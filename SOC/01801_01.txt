Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I meet you under the shadow of the loss
which Canada,

in

common with

all parts of

the Empire, has sustained in the death of our
late beloved Sovereign, King George V. The

sorrow so universally expressed is but one of
the many evidences of the great regard in

duty,

throughout a reign of unparalleled anxieties,
will be held in all our memories as a great
heritage.
I join with you in extending profound sympathy in their bereavement to King Edward
VIII, Her Majesty Queen Mary, and all the
members of the Royal Family. Toward the
new King, there already exists, on the part
of the people of Canada, a feeling of personal
attachment and affection, occasioned by His
Majesty's visits to this country, and the many
friendships and wide acquaintances formed
during the years he was known to us all as the
Prince of Wales. To these sentiments will
now be added in increasing measure those of
loyalty and devotion.
I am profounlly sensible of the great honour
of having been chosen as the King's representative in Canada. I am pleased that my
meeting with the members of both Houses
should be at the beginning of the first session
of the Eighteenth Parliament. It is with the
greatest pleasure that I look forward to the
associations of the next few years.
The seriousness of the international situation has contributed to the world's anxieties.
My ministers are confident that they express

the conviction of the people of Canada in
adhering to the aims and ideals of the League
of Nations, and in seeking, in unison with
members of the League as well as with other
nations. to support by all appropriate and
practical means the maintenance cf peace,
and the establishment of a world order based
on justice and equity.

increase in the number of persons employed,
the number of those on relief shows no
abatement.
As a means of dealing with present emergency conditions, you will be asked, with the
approval of the governments of all the provinces of Canada, to make provision for the
establishment of a representative national commission, which will co-operate with the provinces and municipalities in an endeavour to
provide work for the unemployed, and in the
supervision of unemployment relief. The conmission, which will be assisted by a representative advisory committee, will aim at effecting
nation-wide co-operative effort toward increasing opportunities of gainful employment.
Transfer of the camps established for the
care of single honeless men from the Department of National Defence to the Department
of Labour is in process of being effected.
Every effort will be made to close the camps
altogether at as early a date as expanding
employnient opportunities permit.

A royal commission has been appointed to
inquire into conditions in the textile industry,

My ministers are of the opinion that

are of the opinion that there are the strongest
of reasons for ýState intervention.
With a view to safeguarding the interests of
consumners a fuil inquiry will be instituted into,
representations which continue to be made
respecting monopolistic control of the importation and distribution of anthracite coal.
In order to determine the question of their
vaiidity, reference has been made to the
Supreme Court of 'Canada of a number of
measures enacted at the iast session of Parliament.
I arn happy to be able te inform you that
a trade agreement between Canada and the
United States of America was concluded on
Armistice Day, 1935, and that the trade dispute with Japan, 'which had seriously affected
the trade of both countries, was adjusted before
the end of the oid year.
The Canada-United States Trade Agreement
wili be submitted for your approvai. You will
aiso bc forthwjth advised of the basis on which
normal trade relations between Canada and
Japan have been restored.
My ministers believe that the Canada-United
States agreement will mark a great improvement in Canada's international economic relations; also, that the principles embodied in
this agreement, extended and applied with
vigour and determination, wiil contribute to
the reversai of the trend toward extreme
economic nationalism, which has been undermining standards of living, and embittering
relations between countries ail over the worid.
You wili be pleased to know that the policy
of the Canadian Wheat Board in seiling wheat
at competitive prices is bringing satisfactory
resuits.
A conference between the Dominion Government and the governments of the provinces of
Canada was heid at Ottawa during the month
of December.
Continuing committees have
since carried on consideration of the more
important subjects discussed.
Among matters arising out of the conference;
which wiil be submitted for your consideration,
will be a proposai for amending the British
North America Act, 1867, in order to provide
for certain financial. arrangements between the
Dominion and the provinces.
A cominittee
of Dorninion and provincial representatives,
appointed by the Dominion-Provincial Conference, is engaged in the consideration of a
method and procedure for effecting constitutional amendments.
It is proposed to restore to Parliament its«
control over taxation and expenditure by ending ail measures which have deprived members
of the House of Commons of this control, and
which have served to invest the Executive with
unwarranted arbitrary powers.
Every effort wili be made to substitute
stability for uncertainty in the administration
of customs laws.
The control of credit, and the issue of currency, being public matters of direct concern
to every citizen, it is intended, at the present
session, to ask Parliament to make such
changes iu the ownership and control of the
Bank of Canada, as may be necessary to give to
the Government a predominant interest in the
ownersbip as weli as effective control of the
Bank.

-Steps have already been taken with respect

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND rose to move

That a humble address be presented to His
Majesty the King in the following words:
To The King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects, th Senate of Canada, in Parliament
assemibled, lumnîbly beg leave to express our
deep symupathy with Your Majesty in the
affliction and loss you have sustained by the
death of the late King, Your Majesty's
beloved father.
Your Majesty's sorrow is shared by the
people of this Dominion, whose representatives
we are. King George V, by his fidelity to
duty, his publie service, and bis constant
endeavour to .advance the well-being and
happiness of all classes, had greatly endeared
We
subjects.
himsself to bis Canadian
rememîber with gratitude his unremitting
efforts to secure friendship and peace aemong
the nations of the world. In common with all
parts of the Empire, we shall ever deeply
cherish his memory.
We welcome Your Majesty's accession to the
Throne of your ancestors. We desire, in so
doing, to express to you our loyalty and
devotion. It is our firm conviction that Your
Majesty will ever seek to promote the happiness
and te protect the liberties of all your people.
As members of the Parliament of Canada, we
wish to assure Your Majesty that, in the discharge of these great responsibilities, it is our
desire and deterination te uphold and support
Your Majesty to the utmost of our authority
and wisdom.
That a message of condolence be sent to
Her Majesty Queen Mary in the following
words:
Your Majesty:
We, the Senate of Canada, in Parliament
assembled, respectfully beg leave to tender to
Your Majesty our heartfelt sympathy in your
great sorrow and bereavement. We share Your
Majesty's grief and loss in the passing of our
late Sovereign, King George V, who was greatly
beloved by all his subjects.
We pray that, at 'this tirne, Your Majesty
may be comforted and sustained by the
remembrance of what your loving companionship meant to the late King throughout his
life and reign, by memories of service shared,
and by the sympathy and love that everywhere
surrounds Your Majesty in your great sorrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

He said: Honourable members of the
Senate, since the demise of His Majesty
George V, in British lands and on foreign soil,
from every tribune and pulpit, from all men
who wield the pen, fron the mighty and the
lowly, bas arisen a concert of encomiums such
as lhistory bas seldom recorded. The beauty
of this eulogy was in its unanimity. To whor
was it addressed? To a mighty warrio'r? To
a conquering hero? To a transcendent genius,
who had beneficently directed the fortunes of
a nation? No. This applauding world was
celebrating the virtues of a King who reigned
but did not govern. whose sense of duty and
wiose conscience were bis sole guide, and
whose life was a notable example to the
nation and to the Commonwealth.
It lias been observed that the royal influence
bas increased witlh the diminution of the
executive authority of the King. George V
was a model constitutional monarch. The
question bas often been asked: wbat can be
the influence of the King in his Council?
His chief adviser alone can give the answer,
since the King does not preside over the Council. If lie is endowed with truc qualities of
ieart and mind-detached, as he is, fron
party bias and electoral considerations-he
can discreetly express an opinion that is apt
to carry wcight with his Prime Minister.
Mr. Baldwin, who was so near the Throne,
can best testify on behalf of His Majesty.
His words deserve to be ensbrined in our
parliamentary records. Said Mr. Baldwin, on
the evening of His Majesty's death:
. King George, it is true, inherited his position
on the Throne, but lie won his own way to the
hearts of bis people. Behind the pomp and
pageantry incidental to his great position, he
laboured night and day in tlat high station to
which God had called him. The doing of his
duty to the utmost of his ability was the guiding principle of his life. Great power, which
corrupts weak natures, ennobled our King's
character and made him subdue passion and will
and energy to his duty to his country. He
brought the disposition that is lovely in private

life into the service and the conduct of the
Commonwealth, and not only in virtue of his
office, but in virtue of his person, was he the
first gentleman of the land. As the knowledge
of the King's comîplete dedication to duty grew
and spread as bis reign proceeded, so did the
respect of his people turn into reverence, and
reverence into love.
What a splendid tribute from one who was
in daily contact with our Sovereign!
We all recall how George V, in his Christmas message, emphasized bis great desire for
peace, and rejoiced that our own family of
peoples is at peace within itself and united in
one desire to be at peace with all other
nations.

FEBRUARY 7, ±936
I was privileged to, be received at Buckinghamr Palace in December last. His Majesty vecalled bis visit to Quebec, wh'ere I hied
notioed bis deference for older statesmen
who surrounded bim, hie wh'ole bearing hospeaking modesty and gentlemess. The King
seemed to have aged to a degree. H1e said
that hoe had not fully recovered bis strength
after his long ilîness and a sevene operationý;
that hoe was getting old, older than ahi biis
ministers. Ho spoke of the trying time of
the Great War and expressed the hope that ble
would not live to see aimother war. He spoke
of Canada, of bis admiration for our vigorous
and law-abiding population, and cf the
entbusiasmi of the Prince of Wales for Canada
and Canadian life.
King Ge-orge had, Vo belp and comfort himi
through life, bis royal consort, who shared in
a large degree the oxacting obligations of bis
bigb office. Queen Maxy's radiant personality
was foît far beyond the family circlo. The
people of Great Britain and of the realm, are
grateful to Her Majesty for bier devotion fo the

King and to the public weal. Their heartfelt
sympathy in bier bereavement expressed itself
in terns wbicb. sb-owed their deep affection.
The bour bas struck when we must repeat:
"The King is dead. Long live the King!"
The Prince of Wales, as sucb, is ne more.
That appellation representing youtb, ardent
and effervescent, which was familiar to the
world at large, will now linger in our m.inds
as recalling a happy vision. of an. ideal prince.
Ho will now enter upon a new life, more sedate
and all-absorbing. The lover of travels and
of alI sports will deny bimself the thrilling
and daring adventures which alarmed the King,
and the Quýeen.

In 1927 I had tbe honour of accompanying
is Royal Highness, as ho then was, fromn
Quehec te Montreal, on ithe Saint Lawrence.

In the
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
absence of my leader the right honourable
member from, St. Mary's (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), I have the privilege and the
honour of seconding the resolution which bas
been eloquently and appropriately proposed
by the honourable leader of the Senate.
For more than a quarter of a century the
late King gave an inspiring example of eomplete consecration to the service of his people
througbout the nations and dependencies of
this vast Empire. No preceding soveaeign
had been in so, close and intimate touch wjth
bis people; for bis voice had gone forth at
each Christmastide in an inspiring message
to tbose womn hoe addressed as a family, as
a'brotberhood. So there grew up a respect
and affection, indeed a love, that mourned
for him as perhaps no other suvereign bas
been mourned in aIl our hîstory.
It bas been said that King George reigned
but did flot rule. And perbaps this is true
in a strictly formal sense. But any sucb
consideration is far overborne by the moral
authority and influence which the late King
did exorcise. Authority founded upon po>wer
must, in the last analysis yield to authority
hased upon moral influence, which, in touching the hearts of the people, commands their
sanction and cannot ho denied. In this
bigber sense we must regard the life-work of
our late heloved King. And, althougb hoe
has passed, bis service to the Empire continues i the memory of his ideals, his purpose, and bis devotion to duty.
The mourning has been universal; for the
late King was known as friend of aîl mankind, as true exponent of peace and goodwill.
In the kindred nation whose territories adjoin ours there was an expression of sorrow
so warm and so sincero that it will ever dwell
in our grateful memory.
Therefore witb our mourning is mingled a
solemn pride, whicb will endure and wbicb
bids us rejoice in wbat the late King's life
meant for us and for ah bhumanity.

SENATE

Throughout his great career Queen Mary
shared his purpose and aided his endeavour.
In these days the sympathy of our people
goes forth to her, with their prayers for
strength to sustain her in this supreme
sorrow; and her loneliness will be cheered by
the memory that in all the trials and
anxieties of her husband's career she was,
above all, his comfort and his consolation.
The Crown has passed to one who knows
Canada well, and whom Canada also knows,
for long ago he won all our hearts. His
pledge to the Empire was characteristic: "I
will follow in my father's footsteps." What
more could we ask?
In firm allegiance to our King, let it be
our purpose and our aim to make our country worthy of her great place in the Empire;
to strive for unity of ideal and endeavour
within that Empire, for world peace and
co-operation among all the nations.

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's Speech
at the opening of the session.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN rose to move
that an Address be presented to His Excellency
the Governor General to offer the humble
thanks of this House to His Excellency for
the gracious Speech which he has been pleased
to make to both Houses of Parliament.
He said:
Honourable senators, in rising
to move the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, I wish, first of all, to
associate myself with the sentiments expressed
in this Chamber on Friday last with respect
to our late King George and his successor
Edward VIII. What struck me most in connection with the death of King George, particularly as I come from a part of the country
where a great many of the citizens have taken
up residence after having lived in foreign
lands,.lands that years ago abandoned monarchies because they felt that they were autocracies, were the memorial services held in
settlements peopled by citizens of that
character. Those people expressed the same
sorrow over. the loss of His Majesty as did
native Canadians or British born. I would
not say that this occurred everywhere throughout those settlements, but it did occur in a
great number of them. And it seemed to me
that this expression of devotion and admiration, from people many of whom had been
antagonized by monarchal government in other

FEBRUARY 11, 1936
lands, was probably the highest tribute that
could have been paid to our late King. I
fait it meant that they had found in him a
sovereign of domestic qualities, of demnocratie
traits,* a sovereign who had been to them. a
friend, interested in bringing about social
justice and equality among ail people throughout the British Commonwealth.
I may say also fhat t.he province where I
resida la particularly interested in him who
is to ha known in future as Ediward VIII.
We can say that hie only p4aoe -of rasidence
outsida of Great Britain itself is in the
province of Alberta. That is the oniy place
where Lhe possesses property outside (Â the
British Isies. H1e -came out to Alerta and
puredhased a ranch, neighbouring the ranoh of
my honourabla friend ïrom High River (Hon.
Mr. Rilay), and also naighbouring one of the
ranches of the honourahia senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Burns). Ha be-came a neighhour not marely in name, but in reality. I
think the honourabla sanator from Hîgh River
will flot obWet to my saying that during Vhe
tirna the Prince 'of Wales was out thare he
bacame an intim-ate friand of aIl &i anchers
in the vicinity. So a greakl many di the people
of Aliberta are particuiarly initerasted in the
accession to the Throne of hi'm who was
formseSly known, as Prince of Wales and -is
now Edward VIII. Our n-ew King ba probably spent more time in the province of
Alberta than el-sewhera in Canada, and bas
become better known Vo the people there
than Vo the people of any other province.
The contribution ha hbas mnade Vo the live
stock industry in ýour province bas been. an
important ona. Whan ha acquired bie ranch
thare ha broug.ht to it some of the bast
bloodad stock from Great Britain, and t.his
has enormously improvad 'liva stock in ail
parts of Western Canada.
I think the fact t1hat Edward VIII bas
moved about among the pe>oplas of ail parts
of tha Emupire will prove of greut value to
hlm during hie raign. Ha has an intimate
acquaintance with avary Dominion and with
vary many peopla ail over the Empire.
The Spaech from the Throne was dalivarad

Like most Canadians, I feel that the country
is moving out of the depression, but I would

Wha;t cao wve do to remove the causes of
these wrongs? What changes can we make
in the operation of our present system so
as to get rid of the menace of unemployment,
with its accompanying distress and disturbance? Me.rely to ridicule or dispute the
solutions that are set forth by other sohools
of thougýht is flot an answer. If we are satisfied that noithing but capitallismn la feasible,

Exposures that had been made in the realm
of what is commonly known as "Big Bus~iness"
contrihuted to it, indeed created thje fertile
se-ed-bed iupon which the neýw movement
thrives. It is a favourite charge directcd to
those who do flot, accept these new theories,
that they are the tools of capitialists, that

machinery and other things into proper repair.
If I recollect aright he said it would require

S100.000,000. Think what it would mean if

it were possible to restore the purchasing power
of the farmers of Saskatchewan so that they
could undertake such repairs, which are undoubtedly necessary. Anyone who travels
through agricultural communities knows that
houses, barns, fences, are in disrepair and
need the expenditure of money upon them.
But the owners have not the money to spend;
consequently these properties are becoming less
valuable every day.
I know, however, from what has happened
during the last six months or more, that even
with thle prices obtainable during 1935 there
lias been a restoration, slow but sure, of purchasing power. Merchants in many centres of
Western Canada did better during 1935 than
they had been doing during the previous five
years. To understand the improvement taking
place one need only look at bank clearings and
car loadings. This improvement is due to the
fact that farmers in some districts are in
better condition than they were, and are
out to buy. If their purchasing power continues to increase there will be an increase in
employment, because the industries that have
felt the loss of purchasing power in Western
Canada will begin to benefit from the improvement and will start to put men to work
again.
In speaking of improvement I have restricted
my remarks mainly to the situation of the
grain farmer, but, honourable senators, I do
not want this Chamber to think that farming
in Western Canada is confined to the raising
of grain. I noticed the other day the statement
that in the twelve months of last year the
province of Alberta marketed more than one
million of what are called commercial hogs.
I can remember the time when Alberta could
not supply its own requirements in that regard. Now it is producing enough hogs to
ship for commercial purposes the number I
have mentioned; and that figure does not take
into account those kept on the farm of the
number of which there is probably no record.
We know, too, of the development that bas
taken place in the cattl'e industry. I am far
from being as welil equipped as the honourable
senator from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley)
to speak of that industry, but I know that
there was a very considerable increase in the
marketing of live stock last year and that this
increase contributed towards the improvement
of purchasing power. I think it was in the
Winnipeg Free Press I read that the cattle
exported to the United States market last
year totalled more than 124,000, as compared
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

with only 6,000 the year before. That is a
v'ast improvement, and it is adding to the
purchasing power of the West, because it is
bringing money into the possession of one class
of our agriculturists, the live stock producers,
who were suffening keenly for a number of
years. If that improvement can be maintained
we are assured of the maintenance and increase
of purchasing power.
I can paint a brighter picture of the development of other natural resources besides
those of agriculture in the four Western Provinces. Mining bas been developed in every
province of Western Canada and in the Northwest Territories. Despite the fact that we
say money is bard to get, it seems to be possible to get it to carry on mining development. Such a development bas been taking
place in northern Manitoba, and a new field in
northern Saskatchewan promises to be as
rich as any in the Western Provinces. We
have beard also of discoveries in the Northwest Territories, and we know what lias
happened in British Columbia. When the
depression came upon us we thought the development in the oil fields of the province
of Alberta would cease. That bas not been
so. Individuals and companies have continued
to carry on. They have put down new wells
and found new fields, and I am more confident than ever I was that in the very near
future there is going to be discovered in
Western Canada an extensive oil field which
will supply a large proportion of our national needs.
Let me give an instance of a field discovered some years ago south of Letbbridge,
not far from the Montana border. A number
of companies which had put down wells and
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in that
field had failed to find oil, but during the
past twelve months a company from California, with private capital and no flotation of
stock, put down a well, spending more than
$200,000, and discovered oil in that territory.
Such things have been happening in nany
parts of Western Canada, though the public
at large is not aware of them.
So I believe that as far as the natural
resources of Western Canada are concerned
we have every reason to be confident about
its future.
Many things have occurred to destroy the
faith of the people of Eastern Canada in the
financial condition of our communities, including some of our cities. But even bere
there are bright spots. I have been following
the reports of municipal meetings and school
district meetings in the southern part of the
province of Alberta during the past few weeks,

FEBRUARY 11, 1936
and have been amazed to find nearly ail
those municipalities and sehool districts reporting surpluses, balances in the bank, and,
in certain cases, taxes collected to the amount
of seventy-five or eighty per cent. As an
instance of wbat bas taken place I should like
ta mention the little town of Nanton, flot
far from High River, with a population of
about 1,000. I arn going to read from a newspaper report in respect to tbat town's position, because I think it wiIl help ta efface
the impression that exista in rnany minds
tbat Western Canada is insolvent. It is
from the report of the annual meeting Of
tbe town of Nanton:
The financial statement sbowed the towa to
be in good shape. The town does flot owe a
single dollar of debenture indebtedness, the last
payment being made over a year ago.
The amount of cash on band is about $2,000
more than lest year.
Some conveniences were provided for the
people, for it says:
Total assets are placed at over $29,000, which
includes a $15,000 skating rink and curling rink,
town hall, fire station and equipment, and street
maintaiaing equipment, on all of which there
is flot a single dollar of indebtedness.
Tbat is the record of one community, and
1 tbink I could quite easily bring forth evidence to show tbat, the two large cities in the
province of Alberta excepted, nearly ahl tbe
urban municipalities are in a strong financial
position. I have flot heard of any municipalities in Alberta being forced into the position of many municipalities i the province of
Ontario whicb bave practically fallen into the
banda of a receiver and are baving their affairs
administered by a commission Or some government official. That sort of tbing ba.s n-ot
occurred in Alberta.
While I arn - on my feet and speaking of
tbe position of municipalities I may refer
ta the city of Lethbridge, which has a population of perbapa 15,000. The city manager
af Lethbridge in making bis annual report
predicted that if nlo heavy capital expenditurea were made in the next few years that
city would be out of debt in 1943. The
sinking fund of the city is in a bealthy condition, and ita tax rate bas been reduced;
ahl thia in spite of the fact that its contribution ta relief bas been mucb beavier
than that of other cities of similar population. because of tbe unemployed coal miners
in the district. Good management in past
yeara bas placed tbe city in such a position
that unleas beavy capital expenditures are
undertaken it will be possible for it to be
completely out of debt in seven or eigbt
yeara. 1 started out with a somewhat gloomy
picture. I bave tried ta end up with sornetbing a little brigbter.

L:

Tbere is one other thought that I should
like ta impreas upon bonourable members in
connfection witb. Western Canada, and it
relates ta the Farmn Rebabilitation Act
pasaed by the late Governent. If I have
tbe ear of tbe present Government I arn
going ta say that that Act sbould be maintained, and that, it should be assisted out of
the treasury of the Dominion of Canada, for
tbe reason tbat it will belp considerably
in rebabilitating many sections of Western
Canada wbich were believed ta bave been
destroyed as far as agriculture was concerned.
I tbink I bave told tbis Chamber on other
occasions tbat ten or fifteen years ago southeaatern Alberta bad an experience aimilar ta
that af certain other sections during recent
years. Soutbeaatern Alberta waa regarded as
a dried-out area with no future possibilities.
Many people Ieft it, with the assistance ai
the Government, but a conaiderable number
remaîned. Those remnaining were tald tbey
could not look for any mare assistance, and
that if their cropa failed tbey would have
ta take care af tbemnselves. You rnay be
aurprised ta learn that during the past four
or five years the greater portion of that
area bas been one of the most productive
and best sections in soutbern Alberta. Knowing tbat tbey could get no belp from. outside, the people there set about discovering
the beat methods ai farming. They found
the rigbt way ta farm-the proper impIements ta use and the proper metbads ai
cultivating tbe land. I arn not acquainted
witb tbe dried-out areas in sautbern Saskatchewan, but I bave been told that it
migbt be much better for the gavernmentsta try ta keep experienced people in that
area than ta encourage them ta go ta areas
in the far nortbern part ai the province,
wbere the possibilities may be fia better,
perbaps not as good. Tbe Farm Rebabilitation Act aims at the recavery of tbe areas
tbat have been damaged sa mucb in recent
years, and in view ai wbat bappened in
southeaatern Alberta I arn convinced that
any money spent in sbowing tbe farmers
that by adapting certain metbods tbey might
get a crop in wbat are considered dry years
would be well spent, and that it would be
better ta keep tbemn wbere tbey are than
ta send themn some place else, wbere the
resuit migbt neot be better.
If I were ta devote myseif ta any other
question mentioned in tbe Speech frorn the
Throne it would be ta unemployment. I
feel very strongly that we are goiog ta bave
un'employmnent for a considerable time ta
corne, no mnatter how g'reatly purchasing

years, and a place ýmu.st be found for tbem,
and in order to find a place for ,them scme
portion of the old employees must be displaeed. There are ncw elerments coming into
the picture ail the tirne. While there may be
an iroprovement in einplo-xment conditions,
unemp'loyment seems ýto remain, very msach
as it was. Wbat I amrnmost concernied about
in this country is the youth off the country.
When we see them movin'g about Canada with
no prospect a.head, we can readily understand
why appeals off extremists find them responsive. They were boýrn and raised in this
country among conditions for which we were
responisible, and wben some of them place
the blame for present conditions on the
capitalistie system and those who directed
affaira in the past, it is not surprising to find
them accepting the views and supporting the
movaments of tihose who advnecate radical
change.
There is a feeling off despair in tihe bearts
off those young men and women. I sometimes feel thatbtere may ho in this country
bcîndred.s off young men who wvill not be ýable
to secure an adv anced education, but who, if
they could obtain one, migbit contribute most
to Canada in the years to corne. Among them
there ýinight be some potentially great scientist, some great inventor, but there i.s no
means off helping these young people to get
the edu-cation that would dcvelop their talents
and enable them to realize their ambitions.
If the proposed Unemployment Commission
makes a stýudy of one thing above another,
it shaould be this problemn off youtb, off finding
some means of eneouraginig ambitious young
men and womnen to go ahead and round out
tbcir education. se that iustead off having
their morale destroyed they mnay be given
encouragement to look fforward to the day
wbien they can find some useful and suitable
occupation. Under present conditions many
off them are up against a blank wall, and thcy
can --e no prospect ahcad.
Nowv, honourable senators. 1 have covered
the points upon wvbich I desired to touchi in
moving this Address. I said a ffew minutes
ago that I stili biad confidence in this colintry,-in every part off it, wvhetlier bordering

Honourable members off the ýSenato, tbe
reassembly off Parliament this year takes
place amid memorable circumstances. In the
flrst place, tbe opening off this Parliament
provides the Canadian people witb the opportunity off solemnJy proclaiming its loyal
attachment to the Britishî Crown, and off
expressing its deep regret over the deatb off
Ris Maj esty King George V. This loss is
deeply mourned througbout the world, as
well as in Great Britain and among ail the
peoples off the British Empire. Tbat is not
only because lis Ma.iesty King George V xvas

The new King off England, Ris Majesty
Edward VIII, in bis turn, personifles the noble

FEBRUARY 11, 1936
It is a curiaus coincidence that the session
begins at the saine time as the reign of the
new King, that we welcome among us a
new Viceroy in whom we greet a brilliant
representative ai the intellectual élite of the
British nobility, that a new Government is
in power, and that this Chamber has a new
Speaker, wha, we are quite sure, will display in the dîscharge of the duties of bis
high. office the knawledge and experience
demanded by it, and the tact and dignity
which we know him ta passess.
The Speech fromn the Thrane we heard on
the day oi the apening augurs well for the
future. It would be cantrary ta our duty
and aur constitutional raie ta show an
irreducible and intractable partisan attitude,
but we surely have the right, indeed the

to do so would be hoth wrong and uni ust.
But there are many methods of government:
some reaily bad, some good, and others
better.
The sessianal programme abviously refiects
the Liberal party's programme as expounded
by its leader, which deals with fourteen points:
(1) Unemployment, the most urgent national problem;
(2) Freedom of external trade;

In leas than four months the new Government has undertaken and carried out many
things in accardance with this programme.
In order ta secure the goodwill and coaperation. necessary far the solution of same
af aur main domestic problems, a DominionProvincial Conference was called. This conference set up variaus permanent committees
ta study the most important matters, especially
unemployment and the revision of aur Constitution. Sucb co-operatian between the provinces and the central Gavernment cannot but
revive confidence throughout the land.
In the f oreign field the expansion of aur
trade was the chief concern of the new Administration. Less than a manth after its comning toi power the Gavernment signed a commercial agreement with the United States.
By the new recipracity treaty between Ottawa
and Washington, Canada will share in the
henefit of the decided revival oi business which
has been in evidence in the last f ew manths
in the neighbouring country ta the south.
As a matter of fact, this treaty includes the
interchange between the two countries af
goods at present totalling in value mare than
one hundred millions of dollars annually.
On January 1, commercial relations with
Japan were restored.
Another stimulus ta trade: fram January

tariff concessions made ta the United States
through a reciprocity treaty arrived at between those two cauntries.

There are other commercial treaties under
consideration.
In the Governer General's Speech the Goveroment states that the principles sanctioned
by the Canada-United States agreement, if
extended and applied vigorously and steadily,
wili help toe check the excessive tendencies
toward econoinie nationalism, which is gradually lowering our standard of living and
embittering the relations among peoples
throughout the whole world.
That means that our foreign trade-strongiy
on the decline for seme years past-will grow
larger and larger. Fortunately, we have had
in these last few weeks indications of such
growth. During the month of December the
exports reachcd a total of $68,419,223. and
the imports a total of $38,569,182; the latter
showing a slight decline as compared with
December, 1934, and the former an increase
of $7,000,O00. The favourable trade balance
in December last increased frorm $22,167,975
to $29,850,041.
Commercial reports and financial newspapers
state that agriculture generally is more prospermis than it has ex er been in recent years.
On the whole there bas been a rise in the
prices of farmn prodiiets, in some cases a decided rise. and the prices for cattle have kept

Wc hav e reason to hope for most happy
results, in ail spheres. from a constructive
programme based on goodwill. In the first
place the gnodwill of the Government; the
gnndwill also of ail Canadian citizens, goodxxiii of ail countries with which we want to
live on gond terrms by means of mutuai,
rational and reasonable concessions.
Without gning into the history and development of the Liberal method, or rather principle. thrnugh all its phases in Canadian politics, I may be allowed to say that the programme of the present Government, as summarizcd in the Governor Ceneral's Speech,
and already in course of realization, prepares
for the future, white keeping hright the light
of the past.
Ex olutions., changes, adaptations and concessions are the chiaractisties of polities in this
ceuntr' , as everywhere, resulting oftcn in suchi
minglings and interminglings that somotimes
lines OF dc inarcatien hecoine impeI)rcep)tible.
Certain blendings of economie programmes
and social reforms have given risc to such confusion that people have wondered wxat were
the characterist.ie principles of the policies
dix-iding public opinion.
To ascertain this it is necessary te go back
te the fundameotal ideas by which minds are
classified. There are men of Conservative
Hon.

Mr.

PREX OST.

minds and men of Liberal minds; but one
must guard against judging thema according
te the politicai party in whicha they have been
placed by circumstances, often independently
of their choice. There are men of Conservative mmnd in the Liberal party; and there
are men of Liberal mmid in the Conservative
party. But they constitute the exceptions,
and that is understood in the correct definition
of Liberalism. The Liberai conception is taken
here in its broader sense, meaning action as
opposed to reaction, reasenable emancipation
of the mind froma bondage, progress as opposed
te stagnation, education as opposed te ignorance, the allnwance of all legitimate liherties,
telerance, opposition to ail fanaticism, and an
abiding respect for what is just and right.
In suchi a light Liberalismn predominates ox er
aIl considerations of race, creed, and even
political party. That is why Laurier said:
"In the heart of ail men are te be found
prin-ciples of eternai truth and unalterable justice. and it is upon these principles that we
Liberals must always base our rights and our
duties.'
The wisest poiicy is that whicli is net
doctrinaire te the extent of refusing te adapt
itself te circumstances, and is not willing te
sacrifice the interests of the country for a
theory whichi ton often is but Utopian.
Gox-ernments must take cognizance of the
needs of the people and act accnrding-ly. It
will be said that this is opportunisrn. Undoubtedly. But nppertunismn is of two kinds:
nne, contemptible and vile, the changing of
heart and mind according te pc.rsonal advantage; the ether, which is of the essence
of politics properly understnod. a willingness
to accept inovitable and hnnest compromises
in nrder to reach as nearly as possible the
end aimed at. which it is se hard te attain
at the first*attempt. It is by appiY-ing such
principles and taking uts inspiration from the
Liheral conception, as I haxve just defined it,
tîtat the Gox ernment xviii rally around it-e ,if
aIl mon of goodwill for the realization of a
useful and beneficent policy.
Are we to allov the suffering fromn the

oui1 sole concern? That w'ouid be te deny
tce truth that the world-wide depression is as
mtîch a moral question as an economic one.
On looking oxer Canada it is quite obx ions.
that we ail desire the protection cf our
miaterial interests, the progr-ess cf the country,
tite restoration of our finances, tite expansion
cf trade. etc., btt observing aise the Canadien
mind, I am strengthened in the conviction
tbat the national sentiment which shouid

FEBRUARY 11, 1936
inspire and govern our life means more to
our existence and our future than our wealth
and prosperity. I do not deny the seriousness
of our economic problems, but not one of them
is a question of life or death for Canada.
"Loss of money does not kill," whereas the
loss of a true Canadian sentiment would bring
about the failure of our national existence.
Nowhere can the national spirit of Canada
be discussed more conveniently than in this
Chamber, for the Senate was created out of
regard for the highest interests of the nation
and for the maintenance in its entirety of the
spirit of our Constitution.
Now, more than ever, is the time to
declare. positively that if Canadians fail to
live according to their traditions, Canada
as a nation is doomed. So, above all, we
must be Canadian citizens.
Such a policy, essentially Canadian, must
prevail to-day and to-morrow-a broad and
generous policy, considerate of all citizens,
true to the Empire, yes, but above all true
to Canada, this great, beautiful and rich
country, England's ally.
I do not want to indulge in fruitless sentimentalism. On the contrary, I am conscious
of uttering a fruitful truth and of being on
solid ground.
True to a theme that is dear to us, I will
repeat here what I have often said all through
my career, whether in the province of Quebec
or elsewhere. Canada is our fatherland, our
sole fatherland. Undoubtedly, as French
Canadians, we have a predilection for the
province of Quebec. Do you know of any
patriot, in any land whatever, without a special
preference for a certain region in his own
country? For the French Canadians that
place is Quebec. And that is but natural.
Quebec is our native land, and there we shall
be laid to rest. ihe tender love we bear ber
does not exclude the broad and deep love we
have for Canada as a whole. We love Canada
and we want to serve Canada because we
love Quebec.
In this country, inhabited by people from
so many lands, we feel that a Canadian spirit
must rise above political parties, above various races and creeds, above private interests.
As in the Forum of ancient Rome, where
men of different origins and of all ranks
gathered side by side and became equals,
once they could say, "Civis romanus sum,"
so Canadian citizenship, in this Confederation, must make us equal, united, proud and
strong.
The policy of the men in power must be
inspired with this ideal: to bring forth where
it does not exist, to cultivate and strengthen

15

where it does exist, this national spirit which
should guide our steps, this broad and noble
Canadianism of which this House should set
an example, and which is nothing but active
love of country.
I wondered, and still wonder, why I had
the great honour of being invited by the
leader of the Government in this House to
second the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. It may be that I owe it
to the fact that I belong to a generation not
yet old, and no longer young, but serving
as a sort of connecting link between the
old and the new.
With all my heart I thank the honourable
leader of the Government in this House for
having given me the opportunity of expressing in French, the language spoken by the
first kings of England and by the pioneers
of this country, ideas which, I am convinced,
are shared by all Canadians. I trust I
have not been too unequal to my task.
Honorable members, I thank you for your
kind and indulgent attention.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, we meet to-day under circumstances of quite visible change. Things
seem to be different in more or less important
particulars in matters of geography and of
personnel.
The first thing we rightly observe is the
presence of yourself, Mr. Speaker, presiding
over the destinies of this House. By virtue
of some reason in the minds of the Fathers
of Confederation which I have never been able
very fully to comprebend, it is not the function
of the Upper House to select its own Speaker.
Had such, however, been our function, I am
sure we could not have discharged it more
acceptably to all concerned than it has been
discharged in your selection. With the utmost
confidence we look to you to preside over our
deliberations with fairness and justice to all
members, new and experienced, and of either
party. On behalf of those for whom I know
I can speak, I promise you the courtesy and
deference due your office, and the respect which
your character commands.
It will not be assuming too much of the
character of the patriarch if I venture to
extend a welcome to the many new members
whom we find amongst us now. There are,
I believe, some eighteen who have just
entered this Chamber for the first time. Most
of them have had experience in the other
House, all of them have had considerable
experience in many spheres of active life, and
all of them, including the last appointment,
are, I know, a credit to Parliament. We will

16

SENATE

give thern such co-operation and assistance
as new members have a right to expect, and
we hope that their ambitions for usefulness
in this assembly will all be amply fulfilled.
I should especially mention the new lady
member who takes her place among us (Hon.
Senator Fallis). We all welcome her, and
we all hope she will enjoy ber activity with
us.
It does not seem to me quite in order that
I should follow the beaten path and extend
congratulations to the mover and the seconder
of the Address. Such congratulations are
befitting when, according to the usual course,
the task of moving and seconding the Address
is allotted to new members of our House.
Both the honourable senator fron Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) and the honourable
senator from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Prévost)
are parliamentarians of long standing and
experience and have enjoyed for many years
the respect of their fellows, both in the Commons when they were there, and in this
Chamber.
Ail I need say is, they have
vindicated fully the high regard in which we
held them.
I was interested indeed in the review of
Western conditions by the honourable senator
from Lethbridge. He opened his remarks by
observing that 1e intended to speak of some
subjects of importance which might or might
not be within the four corners of the Speech
froin the Throne. I can assure the honourable
senator that if his mind revolves around any
subject of major importance the inevitable
conclusion must be that it is net in the Speech
from the Throne. Any Speech from the
Throne which finds room for a reference to a
little commission enquiring into the stopping
of a mill, which indeed makes it the subject
of its longest paragraph, will have no space
left for those great problems that trouble the
minds of statesmen and perhaps disturb the
peace of the world. Subjects which the
honourable senator from Lethbridge reviewed
were indeed of interest to everyone. It was
especially gratifying to bear him recall the
fidelity with which municipalities and other
institutions in our Western land have stood
by the faith in matters of finance, and how
formidably they have battled against every
discouragement that could present itselfvisitations of nature, drought, rust, grasshoppers-about all that one would think
could be forced upon a suffering people. But
default is still far from being prevalent in
Western Canada, and all this Dominion knows
that there resides in the people of that country
a determination to maintain its good name;
and I can assure the honourable senator that
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

we in Ontario are throwing no stones at
Western Canada.
I want to come to a short consideration
of some features of the Speech. It is exceedingly brief. I do not know that it is any
the worse for that. We have had heavily
laden speeches from the Throne at some of
our sessions. We have had exceedingly energetic government in Canada for some years
past. If indeed there has been error in respect
of force, vigour and fertility of administration,
the late Government erred on the side of overenergy. So it is not entirely with disappointment that we find a disposition to sail for
a moment with the wind and to enjoy moving along under the momentum of the past.
But this Speech from the Throne is not
only brief; it is vacuous. Not only is it short,
but matters discussed are in the main trivial
in so far as there is any presentation of intention to legislate. i call attention at the
moment to a paragraph that struck me as
somewhat interesting, and especially to a word
which seemed to me to have deep signifieance:
It is proposed to restore to Parliament its
control over taxation and expenditure by
ending all measures which have deprived
members of the House of Commions of this
control, and which have served to invest the
Executive with unwarranted arbitrary powers.
One notes particularly that word "ending."
When a Speech from the Throne advises
Parliament of the intention of the Administration to repeal legislation, it says that measures
"repealing" will be introduced.
However,
what is foreshadowed here is not repeal, but
ending. I wonder if honourable members
have reflected on what must have revolved
in the mind of the dra1ftsman of this Speech
from the Throne when he chose "ending"
instead of "repealing." If "repealing" had been
used there would have to be legislation for
the purpose, and we should look forward curiously to what it would be. But the draftsman, knowing there was no legislation to
repeal, decided that "ending" would be less
perilous, and thus this word was chosen.
What is this legislation which bas deprived
the House of Commons of its control over taxation and expenditure-this legislation which
is going to be ended? It is fortunate for this
House that the leader of the Government here
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will follow me, and
will have an opportunity of detailing to the
Senate of Canada just what legislation we
were foolish enough to pass which stripped
Parliament of this power.

FEBRUARY 11, 1936
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
right hanourable gentleman a question? Does
this flot refer largely ta Orders in Council?
Right Hon. ;Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do nlot
think se I do flot want to be satirical. "Lt
is proposed to restore to Parliament ifs control over taxation and expenditure .by ending
ail measures" and sa on. Orders in Council'are
flot measures. Measures are bis or statutes.
Orders in Council capnnot be passed unless they
are based upon and authorized by statutes.
Unless they are so based and so autharized,
noa one need pay any attention to them; they
are waste paper, fit only to burn. But measures are referred ta here, and we are gaing ta
witness -this session the ending af some mea.sures. I arn waiting anxiously for my. distinguished friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to tell me what measures these are,
and just how they will be ended withaut
being repealed. Is it that no new legisiatian
will be introduced rohbing Parliament of
power? A Speech from the Thrane does not
usually foreshadow what wilI not be done;
it tells us what will be dane. This Speeoh
tells us we are gaing to get rid of certain
legisiation which bas ro>bbed Parliament of
certain pawers. I want ta know as saan as
passible ta what legisiation I shall have ta
give my attention, because, as I apprehienct
the powers of Parliament and the facts af
legisiation, no legisiation can passibly be
pasgsed that will ever rab Parliament of any
power. How can Parliament rab itself?
Naw, we are of course free from electians,
and we ought ta be tolerant ta -the prevalence
af election ballyhoo af aIl kinds, but it does
seem taa had that we shouId be asked .to pass
a vote af .thanks for a Speech from the Throne
which in these respects so manifestly insuits
aur intelligence. Surely this nonsense shauld
have been ended with the electians. If it got
any votes and pleased any people ta think
we h'aà autocracy in office averriding Parliament and the powers of Parliament-welI, let
it go at that. That is the way of some very
often successful men. But why bring the
matter up again when the electiens are over
and revive this ballyhaa ai the past?
The honaurable senater fram. Lethbridge
dwelt for some time upan the subject af unemployment. There is a reference in the
Speech froma the Throne ta unemployment,
and a cammission is pramised ta study this
subject, supervise relief and co-aperate with
ather gavernments, and generally ta preside,
as it were, over the meditatians af the Canadian peaple in respect of unemployment.
There are twa other commissians pramised
in the Speech from the Throne. There is a

17

conference referred ta, and there are samne
references ta courts. But this special commission is ta take inta consideration the
whole subject ai unemployment. I have been
a member ai a Government for many years,
and have been a witness of the conduct ai
administration for a longer period, and I
have ta admit befare this buse that I do nlot
know af any adequate service a commission
can perform in respect of this subject of unemployment and *the administration of unemployment funds. I can understand a commission being created ta perform a new and
specific service which is determined upon as
the expression af a new line ai policy, but
when there is fia new line ai policy 1 da nat
know how a commission which superviges
the dispensation of funds, such as have
been dispensed for the same purposes aver a
number of years past, can be of benefit ta
this country. It appears ta me as a shifting
of the burden ai governmental work from the
shoulders on which if was plaoed ta other
shoulders, for which the taxpayer will have
ta pay.
But, worse than that, the tendency af commissions whose main function is the distribution af governmental funds is ta add ta the
amaunt ai thase funds and thus to the burden an the backs of the taxpayers, who, have
to provide the money. We have had many
commissions in the past under bath Gavernments. Thé ideas af commissions are concentrated on their own peculiar work. They
like ta see it well done, and usually elabarately
done. Their minds do nat get far beyond
the sphere in which they are acting. They
do n-ot have ta raise the money they are
expending; it is hanlded ta them. The an-us
af taxing ta raise the money is not theirs, and
that extreme care which is essential ta prevent
any of those great services getting ouf ai
hand entirely is far more likely ta be exercised by a Minister ai the Crown, under the
eye af the Minister of Finance, than it is by
a commission. If this peculiar commission
is ta reach dimensions foreshadawed in
this Speech from the Throne, if it is te be as
broadly representative as is indicated here.
and is ta act in co-operation wîth nearly everybody and every institution and ail the provincial gavernments af aur country, then what
is ta be the size of the commission? Besides, it is going ta have some advisers.
There is ta be a board ta advise the commission, which, I presumne, will advise the
Minister ai Finance; and aiter the advising
is ail done the people's money will go out.
What is Parliament for? What are these twa

themselves empowered to give exspression fto
the -doctrines which t.hey se, long have loved.
They cannot complain 110w that thoir efforts
will be impeded by provincial governmen.ts or
provincial labour legisiation of any kind.
There is nothing in the long road ahead, I
think, to stop them in the pursuit of their
great and lifelong desiro.
The hanouraale senator fr-om Lothbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) has expressod the view
that one of the first considorations of this
Chamber is to let the goods of other nations
in, so that the people of the West may find
markets for their grain. I listened about a
week agýo to an addross, very able in point
of diction, very beautiful in forin .and cortainly very earncstly dolivered, by a late
distingnishcd member of the Houseocf Commons now dofeatod. Nover since the day of
Michael Clark had I heard the doctrine of free
trade so poworfuliy prosented. The speaker believod that no industry was worth preserving
Nvhich could niot proserve itsolf in coinpetition
with overybody ovor the face of tho globe.
By its ability to proserve itself. and by tbat
to
right
the
alone. had any industry
live. He believd thiere shuuld be no patornallsm, no kindly parental oye watching the
difficultios of industries in order that the
Governmont might help thom Vo survive. All
this hie brushed aside with ponderous thunder
and apparent logic. But he lef t out one consideration, a consideration which we do not
have to refer Vo much in Western Canada,
but which neverthe-less is very practical and
vital to this Dominion, lis whole fine structure of political economy rested upon one
promise, namely, a free market for labour.
Thore can of course ho a free market for
lahoîîr's prodîxets if ive are prepared to admit
a free market for labour itself. I tbought that
in the presence of great labour organizations of this country, and in the presence of
the employers of labour in tons of thousands,
if would have been more frank Vo say that
ail these things are impossible unless we are
pre-pared to admit, and to print in our logislation, the doctrine of a free market for
labour.
I wonder what would happen in Canada if
that wero to ho proclaimod by Government.
If it is noV the wvill of Govornment to
proclaim it. thon I do not think it is
going Vo ho the will of Government Vo move
very far in the direction pointed out by the

FEBRUARY 1l, 1936
honouraible senator from Lethbxidge this
evening. But the road in front of themn is
clear: if they want to do it there is no
impediment. I do flot think they can dlaim
týhey have not a mandate. So I say to
honourable gentlemen: "Go ont Pursue the
course. Implement the doctrine you have
preached ail these years. Let us have Liberalism now«in ail its pristine power and glory.
Let us find what the result will be, and
let us in Canada govern ourselves by the
practical consequences of the doctrines that
honourable gentlemen have been driving in'
upon Parliament ever since we 'becane members of either Huse." I do not see very
mucli reference to themn in this Speech from
the Throne. I do flot see very -muceh of the
doctrines expounded 'by the former member
for Weyburn and the honourable senator
from Lethibridge embodied in this Speech.
I do flot see much promise of positive action
along that line. We have to be satisfied witli
investigation by commission, and the stopping
of a miii in Sherbrooke.
With a view to safeguarding the interests
of consumers a fuil inquiry will be instituted
into representations which continue to be made
respeeting monopolistic controt of the importation and distribution of anthracite coal.
I suppose we must be satisfied with that.
We had one just a few months ago, but perhaps it is not too soon to have another. I do
not think you can satiate the appetite of the
Canadian people for probes and investigations if their appetites are correctly diagnosed
by our Canadian press. Does the honourable
gentleman know a single point ini Canada
where there is not some investigation going on
now? Does any honourable member know
any business that is not being probed, or any
considerable section of society which is not
under suspicion because of governmental
probe? So the happy process goes on. One
would think ail these things could be cured
hy the immediate and wholesome application
of those principles which we have heard and
which honourable gentlemen are now as free
as the air to put into effect.
Steps have already been taken with respect
to the reorganization and consolidation of goveroment services, which it is believed will
further their efficiency and effect much needed
economies.
I do not know just what that can mean
unless it be the union of the Department
of Marine and the Department of Railways under the appellation of the "Ministry
of Transport." We shall hope for economies
there, and shahl be glad to have a return

brought down at the earliest possible date
showing the amount of money saved.
The Speech refers to certain legislation with
respect to railways:
You wil be asked to consider ainendmnents
to existiing legislation respecting the Canadian
National R'ailways, which will serve to afford
a greater meaure of government authority and
responsibility to Parliament.
These words also, no doubt, caused considerable perplexity in the minds of the Adminiis-.
tration when they were drafted. The Government is eager to restore more governmental
authority in respect of the Canadian National
Railways. We in the Senate shaîl have to be
guided by such facts as are revealed before our
own committee. I am not certain that it has
even been alleged that the railways have suffered because of too great a restriction of goverumental control. I did not follow speeches of
the campaign closely. I did not hear any of
them, but I read the press with fair industry
and I arn unaware of any allegation that
our railways have suffered because of a contraction of governmental control. I was surprised,, therefore, when, speaking in Toronto
a few months ago, the new Minister of Railways, for whom we ail wish so well, foreshadowed the restoration to bis department
of control of our National Railways. It may
be evidence can be adduced to convince
us that it is going te be to the advantage
of that great systemn to be brought hack into
the Railway Department, under whose auspices
it wallowed in debt to the extent of scores
of millions in years gone hy. But such evidence, I should think, would need to be very
convincing before there would be a reversal
of policy in this direction. If the honourable gentleman who leads this Hvusc (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) will give an indication of
what sufferings have resuited fromn the railway not being under the direction of the
Department of Railways and Canwls, or what
the hurtful limitations have been which have
prevented its growth and prosperity, it certainiy wiîl be welcomed.
Lt is the duty of this House te review carefully ail legislation, especially legislation which
affects in such vast figures the finances of our
country, and to see that no backward step is
taken, no matter how plausibly the program
may be stated as clothed in the beautiful
language of Liberal diplomacy.
When, checking over the Speech for that
reference I noticed also:
Transfer of the camps established for the
care of single homeless men from the Department of National Defence to the Department
of Labour is in process of being effected. Every
effort will be macle te close the camps alto.

SENATE

gether at as early a date as expanding employment opportunities permit.
Of the last sentence I have no criticism at all
to offer. It does not take a prodigious mind
to conclude quickly that the camps were
erected with the intention that they would
be closed at the earliest possible date, and
that no one hoped for their early closing
more than those who erected them. Therefore
to this policy the House will take no exception. But the first part of the pronouncement is more dubious in its wisdom:
Transfer of the camps established for the
care of single homeless men from the Department of National Defence to the Department
of Labour is in process of being effected.
I have no reflection to make on the Minister
of Labour, and noce at all on the Minister of
Defence. But in this connection one has to
inquire just what was the purpose of the camps
and what is the principle of their operation.
It never was the original purpose to provide
labour.. They are not sustained on a labour
basis. If they were, the cost would be such
that this country could not stand under it.
Labour would have to be paid on a basis of
prevailing labour costs. Were that the case.
or were the purpose te find work, one could
understand a transfer to the Department of
Labour. But the feature in mind was the taking
care of men under discipline, to preserve, by
discipline, all those elements of manhood that
were disintegrating while the poor fehlows
walked our streets; and such seemed to be the
The
work of the Ministry of Defence.
House will await evidence to show that this
purpose may be better effected by the Department of Labour.
I was glad to note in the Speech from the
Throne a reference to legislation te effect
a better co-ordination of provincial and
federal finances. I welcome that pronouncement. As far as I have been able to divine
the intention of the Administration in this
respect, it seems to be defensible and wise.
If I apprehend it correctly it is this. Means
will be provided under the British North
America Act by which the Government of
Canada may establish a Loan Council, which
will in certain eventualities have control of
the issue of securities by provinces, and
possibly by municipalities. Provinces may
or may net, as they choose, come within the
purview of that Loan Council. If they come
within its purview they will obtain such
advantages as the Loan Council can afford,
possibly the advantage of Dominion guarantee of credit, and of lower interest as a
consequence; and if they choose to stand
outside. that is in the exercise of their undoubted right and they will proceed as they
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

are proceeding to-day. To this principle
I can see no objection, and it seems to me
it ought to result finally in a more harmonious operation of the whole system of provincial and federal credit, and in the checking of certain tendencies which even in our
country-I call the West ours still-have
brought about extravagant expenditures and
those immense difficulties which follow in
their wake. There is something to be hoped
for from a movement of this kind, and I certainly promise the Administration all the ceoperation I can give, and I am sure that of
honourable members on this side of the
House, in bringing about this result.
As to the succeeding subject, the modification of our constitutional charter by ourselves instead of by the process we have
always followed, I cannot say that I am
going to take up any bayonet and fight
against it. With equal certainty I cannot
say that I can get enthusiastie over it. I
do not think it makes a great deal of difference. We can get any amendment we want
to our charter at the present time, and we
have been able to get that for tens of years.
But if it is better suited to the situation
in this day to effect any amendment directly
rather than through the old process, let us
do se. There are those who object. For
their opinions I have every regard. But I
do not sec in this any subject of such profound and great consequence as to challenge
the attention of the honourable senator from
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan). It seems
to me pretty much a matter of playing
with constitutional trifles.
We shall receive the legislation of the
Administration in the spirit in which-I say
it with all appreciation-honourable members
opposite received ours in the years tha!t have
gone by. In this House we have made an
effort, which has been comm,on to both sides,
to review carefully and te improve legisiation
with a single eye to the good of Canada. In
that work we had the assistance-the industrious assistance- and the utmost co-operation
of the honourable senator who now leads this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and of those
associated with him. We owe it te them
that we now reciprocate to the full. We owe
it to them that we utterly abandon prejudice
and deal with legislation on its m.erits. We
owe it to them that we make the committees
of this House a medium by which all persons
peculiarly and direetly interested in and
affected by legislation may have their arguments heard and make their wishes known,
to the end that our legislative product may
be the more acceptable. Such service we have
endeavoured to perform and we shall en-

or not, it wiil be the encleavour of us ail,

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumned from yesterday consideration of His Exceliency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Buchanan for an
Address in repiy thereto.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Senate, in the Speech
from the Tbrone His Exceilency the Governor
General has expressed bis appreciation of the
great honour conferred on him by the King
in having chosen him to preside for a tîme
over the destinies of Canada. May I state
that we Canadians, who are ail the architects
of our own fortunes--les fils de nos Seuvresand have njo aristocratie strain in our blond,
are happy inmthe knowledge that our new

21

Vieeroy, by bis training, is very near Vo ourselves. By bis induetry in the pursuit of a
literary career he has plougbed his own furrow
and shed lustre on his narne. It is the selfmade man-the cornmoner-whom we delight
to weieonie.
I desire Vo express rny appreciation of the
reference made by tbe right honourable leader
on the other aide (R.igbt Hon. Mr. Meigben)
Vo tbe choice made by the Government of the
day cd the Speaker Vo -preside over our delîberations. The qualities which my right
honourable friend found in His Honour's
person, and whicb have been manif est during
the several years His Honour bas been among
us, are qualities wbich we ail recognize. We
are confident that be will conduet the proceedings of this Chamber with a full sense
of justice to ail its members. I join my right
bonourable, friend in ýcongratulating His Honour. on bis appointment Vo the Chair.
The mover (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Prévost) of the Address
bave favoured the bouse with the special
knowledge wbich. they have of conditions prevailing in their respective provinces. I knew
that the bonourable senator from Letbbridge
would give us an interesting statement concerning tbe situation in the West. We wbo
live in the Est are alrways bappy Vo have
first-band information witb respect Vo our
compatriots who live beyond the Great Lakes,
and he has given us good reason Vo hope that
tbings wi*ll better themselves, noV only in Vhe
East, but also in the West, o! whose lo-cal
conditions he has intimate knowledge.
My right honourable friend opposite (Rigbt
Hon. Mr. Meighen) bas expressed bis appreciation of the speeches delivered hy the, mover
and the seconder. The honourable senator
from Mille Isies, who cornes from my province, gave us an interesting disquisition, philosophical, and perbaps psycbological, on the
rends of Vbougbt Vo be found in the two
major parties that"divide public opinion in
this country. He bas expressed the view that
the designations Lihberal and Con.servative do
not always explain the actual situation; that
he had found Liýberals who were really Conservative, and Conservatives wbo were really
Liberal. He migbt perbapis have added that
here, as in England, it bas happened that the
ConservaVive party at imes bas heen more
radical Vhan the Liberai party.
My right bonourable friend has welcomed
the new senators wbo were sworn in at the
opening of this session. I join with him ini
that welcome. May I express the hope that
the constant procession of departing senators
will for a time stop, for I realize that I
arn nearly at its head myseif.

?2

SENATE

The appearanco of a lady sitting on the
other side of the House is evidence of a happy
appointment. I rocail that towards the end
of last session, as the thon Prime Minister
(Right Hon. Mr. Bennett) caine with lis
Honour the Deputy Governor for the Royal
Assent to Bis, 1 was sitting on the other
side, having to my right the honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) and to
my lef t my right bonourable f riond from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). As the Prime
Minister passed by my seat I told bim that hie
should take notice that we had society on our
side. He smiled. Perhaps at the time hie had
the name of Mrs. Fallis in his mmnd; which
would fully explain the smile.
I was happy to hoar from my riglit honourahle friend that ho did not intend to play the
role of leader of an opposition. That is similar
ti what I tolcl him whien hoe came into this
Chamher. I romembor bis first word wasand I appreciated it as a bigh complimentthat I sboîîld ho biencoforth the opponient
werthy of bis steel. I told him that 1 disclaimod any such honour, and moreover would
not be an opponent, because 1 did not recognizo the existence of suchi an institution as His
Majesty's Loyal Opposition in this Chamber.
Ho soemod somowbiat surprised, but I think
that during the five sessions we have worked
tegether hoe bas como to realize that there is
no systematic opposition here and that we are
ail hont upon doing our hest to impreve the
legislation that comes to us from the House
of Commons.
I may say that in 1922, on taking tho leadership for the Government in this Chambor. 1
expressed the same opinion, pointing out that
the framers of Confederation intended this
Chamber not to ho a duplicato of the Commons, and that if we feit and acted as though
we wore, our usefulness as a second Chamber
would bo gone. The Sonate is not a duplicate of the buse of Commons. We stand
above the sharp divisions of party that exist
in the other Chamber, and we approach al
questions with a desire to do our best for the
general interest of the country. I believo that
I have been fairly consistent in upholding the
underlying principlo I thon enunciated, both
when acting as Government leader and when
sitting where my right honourable friend is
now sitting. While acting in either capacity
I have shown, I think, very little bias. 0f
course I recognize that, as in the country,
there are two trends of thought in this Chamber, but they do not express themselves here
in as forcible a mannor as in the House of
Commons.
lion. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDLURANIJ.

lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have îmbibed certain principles and doctrines, which
romain wîth us througlîout our caroor, but
when I stop into this Chamber 1 feel that 1
should beave at the door ahl political prejudices
and address myseif simply to the monits of
the questions that cuine hefore us for consideration.
My righit honourablo friend bas asked for
information cencorning many of the statemonts
that appear in the Speech from the Throne,
and although I shaîl not doal with tbem in
the order mientioned hy himn, 1 think 1 shaîl
cover aIl hoe bias brought to our attention.
The right honourahle gentleman bias spokon
of that part of the Address wlîich rofers to
the formation of a national commission to
co-operate witli the provinces and munîcipalitios, the commission to ho assisted hy an
advisory cnmmittee. Ho lias not much faitb
in suchi commissions, and hoe bas expressed
bis Jack of faith in forcible terms. I would
draw my right honourable friend's attention
to the fact that this mattor wvas submitted
to the people of Canada during the last term
of Parliament, both in the House and outside,
and the people seom te bave endorsed such a
proposaI. There is, I bohieve, soe virtue in
it. Heretefore there bas heen ne ce-ordination
of effort on the part ef the Dominion Govorament, the provinces and the municipalities.
There bias been ne concertod action.
We
bave boon furnishing money by the millions
te the varieus provinces without having a
general view of the subj oct.
My right
honourable f niond says, and quite properly,
that Parliament should assume the obligation
and porform the fonction of exorcising a
supervision ovor this expenditure, but Parliament can only do se through its own cernmittees, and this hrings us near te the
organizatien of a soparate commission.
I can well soc that a national commission
could study with benefit the distribution of
the unemployed, whe are gathered in most
of our cities and towns. In Great Britain
there is a constant mevement te have us
oen our doors to imm igrants from that
country; and there is also a constant movemont
towards the celonization of our lands. But
we find throughout this country a resistance
te immigration, even though it ho from the
British Isles, bocause of the fear that it
weuld incroaso the number of unompleyed in
Canada.
I have boon wondering, bowever,
wliether we sheuld net do semething, under
some systom such as would ho adopted if
people wore coming frema abroad, to place on
the land the unemployed wbo are in our cities
and towns. I -have yot te ho told tbat the
hundreds of theusancis of immigrants who

FEBRUARY 12, 1936
came from the other side of the Atlantic,
whether from the British ILsles or the
Continent, were sonls of the soit. Possibly a
large proportion of them. were, but what
proportion of young men and women, artisans
mainly, desired to try to earn a living on the
farm? 1 wonder whether we sbould not make
some effort to solve our unemployment
problem by directing back to the land at
least those who were born and raised on the
f arm. 1 arn quite sure there are thousands
of them. 1 think it is quite evident that
even if there is a return of general prosperity
and the wheels of industry are running full
time it will be very difiicult to find employment for alI the people now on relief. Their
numbers have been increased from year to
year since 1930 by the younger people growing
up and leaving the schools and colleges. This
explains why, though the niîmhpr of employed
persons throughout Canada bas been increasing,
the number of unemployed bas not diminisbed.
So one of the duties of that commission should
be to apply itself to the solution of unemployment by placing on the land persons drawn
from the ranks of the unemployed.
In years gone by we have spent large sums
of money on transporting immigrants from
Europe to the Canadian West. A nation-wide
inquiry into the whole situation might reveal
certain parts of Canada where some of those
at present unemployed would be welcomed.
Of course the provinces, and the municipalities
as well, would have a voice in the matter.
The idea would be to try to make sure that
these people would succeed when they were
placed. One of the things that haunt me
codstantly is the question where our surplus
population, at prescnt unemployed, is to be
placed as the years go by.
My right honourable friend has spoken of
the camps mentioned in the Speech from the
Tbrone. Hie is not quite satisfied with the
general statement that appears in the Speech
under that head. I would draw his attention
to the fact that while those camps have
been under the direction of the Department
of National Defence, it is proper that they
should be under the Department of Labour.
That is the Department which will be most
active in trying to give work to the men
in those camps, and from the knowledge I
have of the activities of the present Minister
of Labour, who has explored the whole field,
and who may at this moment have reached
somne interesting conclusions, I am sure that
when the policy of the Government is
enunciated it will be found that the transfer of those camps has been a good move.
My rigbt honourable friend bas made light
of the reference in the Speech fromn the

23

Throne to the closing of a mill in the city
of Sherbrooke. I would suggest that he read
again that part of the Speech. If hie does
so hie will find that the question involved
goes far beyond the closing of a mili. Hie
told us that he had flot followed to any
extent the discussions which took place on
the hustings and over the air during the
last election. Had hie done so hie would
know that the present Prime Minister had
in hand circulars that were distributed in
some industrial towns informing employees
that if the Liberal party came into power
the industries or milîs in those towns would
be closed. Althougb, like my honourable
friend, I did not follow the discussions
daily, I know that the present Prime Minister made the statement that any mill or
industry that was closed by reason, of the
fact that a Liberal Government came into
power would be given an opportunity to
justify its action, and that hie would go deeply
into the wbole question of competition in
domestie or foreign trade. That is what
actuated the Prime Minister in suggesting
to bis Cabinet that such an inquiry should
take place.
My rigbt honourable friend bas spoken of
the agreement between Canada and the
United States. lie has not examined very
deeply the convention laid on the Table ol
the House, but hie has suggested tbat in sucb
an important matter hasty action is dangerous. I would point out tbat for a considerable time the late Govemnment studied the
situation. It must bave gatbered considerable data in order to open negotiations with
the United States. Just a few weeks before
tbe election the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett
gave out a statement in which hie explained
tbat substantial efforts had been made at
Washington to negotiate a reciprocity
treaty whereby some seven hundred items
of our own tariff stood to be affected.
0f course we have not the details of
that proposal. Not having seen it, I cannot
compare its ternis with those of the present
convention. The statement of the Right
Hon. Mr. Bennett was supported hy correspondence between the Minister for Canada at Washington and Mr. Cordell Hull,
United States Secretary of State. I suppose
that later on we shail bave the terms of
the two proposals placed before us here, and
we shaîl then be able to see in what respects
they differ.
I would simply suggest to this Chamber
that perbaps the matter was approached by
the present Government from a somewbat
different angle, because of the divergent views
of the two parties on economie questions. No

14

SENATE

doubt, wben the details of the two proposais
are before us we shall be bettýer abie to judge
what rôle this divergence played in the cigeing of the lest convention. I believe the
Liberal policy througbout the last fifty-odd
years and more bas been a quite ueiform and
logical one-.
We must nlot forget that ail men, on cither
side of polities, who bad enytbing to do with
public affairs fromu 1854 to 1870, and latLr,
wcre most eager to obtain a continuation or
resumption of the Reciprocity Treaty of 18541866. Soon after Confederetion Sir John A.
Macdonald sent delegetions te Wasbington te
try te resurrect that convention, wvbicli was
based on an. exchange of natural produets, and
in this endeavour he bcd the good wisbes of
the Liberal party in the lieuse of Commons
and throughout the land. Wben he came bcck
te power efter the election cf the l7ýth of
September, 1878, he ietroduced the National
Pclicy. My bonourable frieeds will sec that

was the desire cf the whole Conservative
party, and it remained die desireocf Sir John
A. Macdonald birnself until bais dectb in June,
1891. Even as icte as February cf that year,

people with the suggestion that negotiations

Kcigbt cf the State of Maine. then Secrctary

Rigbt lion. Mr. MEICHIEN: But that is
net the point the bonourable gentleman mcdo.
lie indicetud the late Prime Minister bcd

FEBRUARY 12, 1936
made an offer to the United States of America
for the free entry of the natural products of
each country, or, as he put it, for reciprocity
in natural products, which would include the
free entry into Canada of natural products of
the United States. Now, I want to know if
the honourable gentleman does say that offer
was made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, surely it
was not made in that form.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nor in any
form.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It could not have
been made in that form, because there were
limitations in the mandate given to President
Roosevelt.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Then it is
flot so that an offer of free exchange of
natural products, such as was in the reciprocity arrangement of 1911, výas ever made by
the late Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Welil, I might
say that there is no Government, that of my
right honourable friend or any other,' which
would not jump at the chance of having
reciprocity in natural produets between the
two countrice.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I make the
statement now that no Government of which
I amn a member will do that, so long as I amn
a 'member of it. Will the'honourable gentleman say that we in thie country are prepared
to admit the fruit and vegetables of the
United States into Canada without limitation?
Is his Government prepared for that to-day?
Hon. Mr. DANDTTRAND: If my rigbt
honourablýe friend will refer to, the appendix
to the tariff of 1879, brought in hy Sir Leonard
Tilley, the Minister of Finance in Sir John
A. Macdoniald's Cabinet, he will find it covers
ail the articles that were in the Reciproeity
Treaty of 1854-1866, and there was a standing
offer to the United States for exchange in
natural produets.
Right Hon. M*r. MEIGHEN: That is long
ago. We did not have a fruit industry then.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think if the
question of reciproei.ty in natural products
were submitted to the people of Canada today it would be endorsed by nine-tenths of
the agricultural part of our population, the
part that is most directly interested in it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is in favour of it himself?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 personally
arn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: AIl right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think that
although the producers in somne lines would
stand to suifer, there mýust be some give and
take in such a large field. Some people will
of necessity be injured to a certain extent
by any reciprocity convention. My right
honourable friend was a member of the Bennett Government, which was a party to the
Ottawa agreements. Those agreements were
between memnbers of our own family of nations, yet has he not found that somne parts
of the Commonwealth, including Canada,
stood to suifer in certain respects? My right
honourable friend said yesterday that those
who had to do with the making of a convention sbould consider every item of our own
produets with a view to seeing that it was
not adversely aifected. But it must be recognized that in developing our trade on a large
scale for the general advantage of the country it is almost inevitable that some degree
of~ injury wilI be infficted upon certain lines.
My right honourable friend indulged in an
interesting flîght of eloquence on Liberalisma
as practised by the present Government,
which, he said, had a full mandate to go to
whatever lengths it pleased in furthcrance
of free trade. I would draw his attention
to the fact that there is no free trade party
in Canada that I know of. There is a fair
trade party, and I believe I could count
upon my right honourable friend as being
one of that party when, having imbibed the
atmosphere of the West, he reduced the
tariff on agricultural implements by 10 per
cent.
My right honourable friend has alluded to
the proposed change in procedure for effecting constitutional ameadments. He recognizes, I take it, that the British North
America Act should be amnended in certain
particulars; but apparently he is not especially interested in any transfer of the amending power to this Parliament. He states
that the present procedure is not irksome,
and that wc can get any amendments we
may desire. But I share with many of My
compatriots the sentiment for equality which
flows from the Statute of Westminster, and
I should be proud to know that, subject to
proper safeguards for provinces and minoritics, our Parliament had the same power to
amend the British North America Act as
the Parliament of Australia bas to amend its
Constitution. There is a certain sense of inferiority in the fact that we must go to

Constitution.
before in this Chamber that I dislike even
the appearance of our having to go to a
sister Parliament for confirmation of the acts
of this Parliament. As I said on another
occasion. the equality which I claim te share
with the electors in the British Isles is based
on the fact that I am net willing to be a
subject of the subjects of the King; I want
to be directly a subject of the King, just
the same as are the citizens of London.
Now I come to an interesting part of my
right honourable friend's remarks. He was
struck by this paragraph in the Speech from
the Throne:
It is proposed to restore to Parlianent its
control over taxation and expenditure by
ending all neasures which have deprived
imeinbers of the House of Commons of this
control. and which have served to invest the
Executive with unwarranted arbitrary powers.

over taxation and expenditure? Was it not
by its own will, its own consent?" Assuredly
it was, but at the express request of the chief
of the Executive, who came before the House
and asked for those powers. His followers
assented. We all know that the House of
Commons, as representative of the people, has

and how it will be applied, and te control
and supervise that expenditure.
I do net desire to criticize the effect of the
legislation; I am simply seeking to answer
my right honourable friend, and I tell him that
during the five years between 1930 and 1935,
by orders in council, there were expended:
under Relief Acts, $192,000,000; by way of

honourable friend has not given very much
study to this question, for the power which
bas been withdrawn from the Parliament of
Canada in faveur of the Executive is to
be found in Chapter 13 of 25-26 George V,
assented to on April 4, 1935. It is the Act

that loans of unstated amounts can be
m.ade to the provinces and to the Canadian
Co-operative Meat Producers Limited, and
that under the peace, order and good government clause the Governor in Council may
take "all such measures as in his discretion
may be deemed necessary or advisable to
protect and maintain the credit and financial
position of the Dominion or any province
thereof." The Executive may also "provide
for special relief, works and undertakings
under control and direction of the Department of National Defence and the Department of the Interior."
I draw his attention to clause 11 of the
Relief Measures Act:
This Act shall expire on the thirty-first day
of March, 1936.
So no repeal legislation is needed; the
statute will expire on the date specified. But
I would remind my right honourable friend
that the paragraph which he cited from the
Speech from the Throne expresses a policy
dear to the heart of the Liberal party as
represented by its present leaders.
My right honourable friend bas asked: "But
how was Parliament deprived of its power

These figures represent a total expenditure
of $447,000,000-all without any detailed
appropriations.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes; but my
right honourable friend, having been a
Minister for a number of years and having
presided in Council, knows that the appropriation voted states te whom the money is to
go and how it is te be applied. Here you haVe
a blank cheque to the Administration. I am
net discussing the policy behind the legislatien; I simply state to my right honourable
friend that such power was absor'bed by the
Executive from Parliament-with the will of
the majority if you like.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly, and
that is always the case in all legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But since for five
years the members of the present Government
pleaded against the House of Commons being
deprived of the power to control this enormous expenditure directly by ear-marking
each item, and voted against the principle of
money being spent under the peace, order
and good government clause, are they not
justified now in saying: "Henceforth we will
net do that. We will revert to the old policy
of the House of Commons maintaining its
control over every item voted from A to Z"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The control
is there still; always was and always will be.
The objects on which expenditures are to be
made are set out in that legislation the same
as in other statutes; there is no difference

but you did not have that enabling legisiation when yau signed the convention. You
deprived Parliarnent of its power in a sense
far more direct than it could possibly be in

the exercise of the power, whereas in this case
it is subsequent.

lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourablýe friand has alluded -to the amen<knents
which in the Speech fromr the Throne are
announced ta be made te the existing, legislation respecting the Canadian National Railways, and bas asked in what f orin those
arnendments will be. Well, I confess I cannet satisfy hi.s curiosity ta any extent befare

the leg-islation is brought down. I would
draw my right honourable friend's attention
ta the statute whieh we .passed, Chapter 33,
23-24 George V, assented ta on the 23rd of
May, 19-33, an Act respeeting the Canadian
National Railways and ta provide for caoperation with the Canadian Pacifie Railway
system, and for other purpases. My right
honourahie friand will1 rernember how much
interest was shawn by everybody at that time,
neot only within the precincts of this Chamber,
but throughout the eountry, i'n the effort ta
reduce aur expenditure on the Canadian
National Railways, which amounted to, virtually $1,.000,000 a week, or more than
$50,000,000 a year. We had great hopes that
the arrangement proývided for in this statute,
by which the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
the 'Canadian National Railways were ta be
brought together in order ta co-operate and
ta abolish conipetition in many directions,
would bring about a better financial situation.
I desire ta draw my right honourable friend's
attention ta the fatet that aur legisiatian of
1933 has been a profound disappointment, not
oniy ta myseif, but, I arn sure, ta him and ail
the members af this Chamber who are within
hearing. The arganization which was set up
under this Act hardly worked at ail, and was
nat even cornpleted by its creator, the late
Government. So the measure foreshadowed
in the Speech £rom the Thrane will be an
attempt ta bring about an irnpraverent in
conditions, something which apparently could
not be accomiplished under that Act. That
is ahl I can say for the marnent.
I should have liked tea peak to-day of
international conditions, ta which allusion is
made in the Speech frorn the Throne, but
shall nat do sa, as I arn sure my right honourable friend- will find occasion ta lay bei are
us the viesvs recently expressed by him, an
this aide of the line as well as in the United
States, in regard ta the very serious situation
that we are facing. When that occasion arises
I may be able ta give my own views an the
subject.
We are undoubtedly mo'ving tawarde better
times, but apparently the burden af maintaining the existing situation lias been so heavy
upon aur public finances that we are nat yet
out of the danger zone. The condition of
the people throughout the ]and may be impraving, but there remaîn many serious problems ta be solved by -the Dominion, and by
the -provinces and municipalities. I hope that
we shall find a way ta maintain aur whole
financial fabric unimpaired, se that we may
show the world that Canada, a young nation,
bas been able ta weather the ternpest and
keep its flag flying.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: As I understand it,
according te our Constitution, and by parliarnontary practico as well, we are perrnitted,
and perbaps it is part of our duty, when
considering the Address in reply te the Speech
frorn the Throne, te bring up anything that
wo thinik would affect our country or its
people for woal or for wee. During tIse Great
War, Parliarnent in its wisdem irnposed very
high custorns and excise duties, particularly
on spirituous liquors; and in conscquenceoef
that legi.la tien, which rernained after the War
was ended, there bas grown up in Canada, I
think I arn justified in saying, a systom of
smuggling spiritueus liquors which bas very
baneful effects. First of ahl, the country is
deprived of revenue tlîat it should receive;
and, ivorso than that, I thîink, the people wlbo
engage in the traffic and these who sympathizo
with it have beon practically derneralizcd.
This trafflo is carried on in the Maritime
Provinces and thc loer part of Quc'becand perliaps in Britisli Columbia; I arn net
farniliar with conditions tlîeie-te a greator
extent, I believe, than in otiier parts of the
country. Wbat is actually taking place in the
province from which I corne is this. During

costly oquipment and crews are engaged in
carrying liquors from St. Pierre-Miquelon,

Naturally there arc ne figures as te censurnptien, but the consumption mnust ho very

of the people, particularly the youngor people,
both men and wornen, is demoralized by this,
illegal and improper business.
The magistrates, whose duty it is to enforce,
the law in this respect, tell me that the ceet
of enfercernent is enormously increased bywholesaie perjury and by the fact that the
trafflc has the syrnpathy of a large numberof people.
There is a srnall arrny of men, the Preventive
Service, engaged in trying to stop this traffic..
They are equipped with motor-boats and fast
automobiles; they even have aoroplanes; but
they cannot cope with it, because the facilities
afforded to it by the geographical nature of
our country lenable the offenders to evade the
officers of the law.
I have a suggestion to make to the leaders
of the House-I offor it with great diffidencenarnely, that a cornrittee of this House be
appointed te, obtain as soon as possible aIl
the information on this question that can bo
secured in a reasonabie way. I bring up the
matter nos'. because we are going te adjourn
to-rnorrcsw for probably ten or twclve days.
If it is deerned advisable te appoint a cornrnittee, members from the Maritime ProvT
inces, and perhaps some from the W est, who
have to remain hcrc, rnight begin to organizc.
at least. I think every province should ho
reoprescntcd on the comrnittee. It is not rny
intention that rnuch expense should ho incurred. The idea in my minc is that the
officers of the Prevontive Service wbio are in
or near Ottawa sbould be summoned to give
what evidence they can, to report upon the
difficulties they are eecountering, to state the
cost of this Preventive Service, and*probably
if tbey cao do se, to givo us somne idea of
tise quantity of liquor smuggl-ed and the effeet
of the smuggling on the revenue. If xve wore
te begin now te get that, information, it would
be available te the Government. whiich, if it
se chose, could tako action upon it during the
present session.
At one tirne, when prohibition prev.ailcd

for in se doing they would ho rondering a
co>nsideratble service te the Government and
te the country.
I do net intend te make any motion; I
desire only te make a respoctful request that
the leaders of the Sonate will consider this

FEBRUARY 12, 1936
matter and see whether we can act upon it
before adjournment.
Perhaps, as there is plenty of time, I may
say a few words more closely related to the
subject-matter before the House. I was going
to make some remarks with respect to the
statement of the right honourable leàder on
the other side of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), but, to my mind, the leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) cleaned that
matter up pretty well. I read nearly all
the speeches made in Parliament by the right
honourable gentleman who leads the other
side of the House. I think they are worth
reading. He made one statement yesterday
which I think contains a great deal of matter.
In speaking of some man who made an
admirable free trade speech, he said:
His whole fine structure of political
economy rested upon one premise, namely, a
free market for labour. There can be a free
market for labour's products if we are
prepared to admit a free market for labour
itself.
I thought that statement went to the bottom of the matter. I thought so much of it
that I crossed the floor of the House and
asked the leader what result would follow if
we had a free market for labour, a free market
for labour's products, and reasonable freedom
for everything the world over. He told me
le was not prepared just at the moment to
give a definite answer to that question, but
he gave me the impression that he thought
it was not foolish. That is the kind of free
trade I should like. I have no hesitation in
saying that I do not suppose it is possible,
but in my opinion it would be ideal.
I am going to say only a few words, because
I do not want to be considered an orator. I
should not mind being called a preacher; I
should be fiattered by it. I think I am a
little different from other people, but I should
not like to be considered entirely different from
my fellow countrymen. The idea. that I have
in my mind is this. When this world was
made, and the human race was created and
given the power to manage things in this world
as it wished, that power was abused, and all
our troubles since have arisen from that abuse
of power.
Sir Edward Beatty addressed the students
of the University of Western Ontario, I think
it was, on university work and general education.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In London.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: As I saw it, an address on that subject given by a man who
occupies the position of.president of the largest and perhaps the best managed transporta-

29

tion system in the world, a man who at the
same time is chancellor of the largest university in Canada, is deserving of the greatest consideration. I read it several times. He
made this remark in opening-I think I remember it:
Conditions have arisen in this world during
the last fifty years that have made it a puzzle
to all who dwell in it.
Now I want to comment on that. I do not
think Sir Edward did himself justice in making that statement. The actual fact, as I see
it, is that the world at the present time is in a
terrible state of turmoil, strife and contention.
Practically none of the nations of the world
have any confidence in other nations, and individuals have little confidence in one another.
I am going to preach again for a few
minutes, if you will not laugh at me. Almost
everybody is trying to get ahead of the other
fellow. But that should not puzzle anyone.
Conditions similar to those of to-day have
existed for more than two thousand years, and
they have never been a puzzle to those who
realized that a very large part of the human
race has always gone directly contrary to the
will of God. The reason for the deluge that
destroyed the world over two thousand years
ago-the wickedness of mankind in those days
-was no puzzle to Noah. He knew why it
was sent. Likewise, Moses knew the causes
of the plagues of Egypt and of the destruction
of Pharoah. And Lot understood why the
cities of the plain were destroyed.
The misfortunes that have beset the human
race ever since those days have been caused
by the folly and the evil of men themselves.
We go against the divine law. That explains
the situation to-day. What do we find in
nations all over the world at the present time?
In Russia the divine content has been taken
out of all law. Everything is judged from a
material standpoint. The absolute or totalitarian state is set up in place of God. In
Mexico there is the same thing, or perhaps
something worse, and only God knows what
is in store for that country and Germany.
There is no way of avoiding such conditions
except by getting back to first principles. We
in Canada are blessed. We live in a country
where the laws are pretty well observed; a
Christian country. And this is a Christian
assembly. Yet, are we doing our duty? And
are the people of the country to the south of
us doing their duty?
Recently I read another notable speech, that
of an eminent man in the United States,
President Nicholas Murray Butler, of Columbia University. I am emboldened to follow
this line of thought because of what he said

M0

SENATE

in his annual report to the trustees of that
great institution. I suppose he is one of the
sanest and most outstanding of modern
Americans. His speech appeared in a magazine
called "The Commonweal," which I think is
published in New York, and I have an extract
that I think is worth reading. Dr. Butler
says:
From the viewpoint of sound educational
principles this (the neglect of religion) is a
serious state of affairs, since the religious
inheritance of the race is an essential part of
the history of that civilization toward a
knowledge of which it is the chief business
of education to lead youth from generation to
generation. One need not himself be religious,
or indeed have any great concern for religion,
to grasp the fact that religion has had a very
large, in fact a preponderant, influence in shaping our contemporary civilization and in laying
the foundations of our present-day social,
economic and political institutions. During the
half century just past this condition bas
changed entirely, and religious knowledge,
together with religious interest, is passing all
too rapidly out of the ed'ucational process.
I thought an implication of Sir Edward
Beatty's address to the students of the University of Western Ontario was that religion
and education could be divorced. If my inference is correct, he made a grave error.
Wherever such a .separation has
been
attempted it has entailed serious consequences. It is one of the causes of prevailing conditions in the great country to
the south and all over the world. The
omission of religion and spiritual ideas from
business, from education, from politics and
from nearly all the activities of men and
women is one aspect of Communism.
Because Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler considered it advisable to make the serious comment that I read a few moments ago I thought
it would not be altogether out of place for
me to make a similar statement, in my own
imperfect way. And, the opportunity having
offered, I thought I ought to refer to what I
believe was the weakness, as well as to what
I believe to be -the strength, of Sir Edward
Beatty's remarks on the very important
occasion to which I have referred.
I am
unable to speak as I should like, for any
length of time, unless I read from notes,
and this I have not done to-day.
The Address was adopted.
THE LATE HON. SENATOR MURPHY
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, it is my painful duty
to have to record the recent death of one of
our most seasoned colleagues, Hon. Charles
Murphy. Senator Murphy was born and
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

brought up in Ottawa, and his whole life was
given to law and politices. He thoroughly
imbibed the atmosphere of the Capital. He
was familiar with the machinery of government in all its details. His knowledge covered
every department, so that colleagues among
whom he worked for a number of years used
te say he seemed to know more than they
themselves about the officers and affairs of
their respective departments.
He had a very brilliant mind, with many
facets. His interests went far beyond the
affairs of Canada. To mention but one of his
activities, he was an ardent Home Ruler. His
correspondence with men of note throughout
Ireland, Great Britain, the European continent
and the United States was remarkable. He
attended most of the important functions in
the United States at which men of the Irish
race had anything to say, and I recall that
many a time he expressed to me his delight
at having been present at conventions of the
Republican and Democratic parties and having
occasionally helped his friends to build some
planks into the platforms of those great
organizations.
As I have said, he was a prolific correspondent. His letters, which were sometimes circularized, dealt with a wide range of human
activities. On a number of occasions I received from him copies of letters having to
do with various international activities of
Canada.
He had strong likes and dislikes. Though
he had a kind disposition and a very charitable heart, ho could carry on a relentless
vendetta.
No question came up in the Senate in which
Senator Murphy was not interested. He followed the discussions here and in our conmittees, and always had his own opinion,
which he would express by correspondence to
the leader of his party in this Chamber. He
will be greatly missed by his colleagues, who
knew him and appreciated his talents.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: Honourable members, none who has been so long in
either House of Parliament as I have, and
therefore so long associated with that very
distinguished man, the late Senator Charles
Murphy, can ever forget the sense of shock
and loss and loneliness with which we heard
of his death. How often since then has the
picture of him returned to our minds, with
all that his character meant to us throughout
the years of our political association! When
one thinks of Senator Murphy one thinks of
him first as a typical Irish intellectual
gladiator, as a man who embodied all that
bas made the Irish nation great, who loved

FEBRUARY 12, 1936
everything associated with that race, and was
perbape its greatest pride on this continent.
I have often wondered what would have
been the destiny of Charles Murphy had his
parents flot emigrated ta this hemisphere.
Had they remained on the Emerald Isle and
had hie been raised there. there is no question
that hie would have taken hie place in the
front ranks of the great Nationalist Party
of that country, that hie wouid have ornamented
the halls of Westminster, and might have gone
down ta posterity as hero of the achievement
of Home Rule -for hie countjry. Many of
those who took an eminent place in that
battle I have had the privilege of knowing
from afar; ail their orations I have read. But
I know of none who was capaible of such
passionate and cloquent advocacy of the
cause of Ireland as was Charles Murphy
himself.
We think of him, however, not only in that
relationship, but aiea as an eminent Canadian
public man, a party man of the Canadian
type, a strong fighter in the ranks, a favourite
of hie chief, a lover of hie leader, a man who
could pe'rhaps deliver the most teiling blows
of any who sat opposite ta us in the Hanse of
Commons in the aid days. -He "drank delight
of battie wit-h hie peers," and, weli was hie
equipped both ta battle and tao conquer. But
I have ta add ta that refiection this: however
severe were the assaults hie directed, however
relentîcas was the battie he conducted, I
neyer in the whoie course of my public life
heard on the part of any member of the party
ta which, I beionged, and which was oppoeed
ta hie, ane word in the way of resentment or
personai bitternees against ýCharies Murphy.
The reason for that was that he demeaned
himoself as a man at ahý times. He neyer
behaved as a ruffian; much lese did hie ever
behave as a bandit. Hie struck abave the
belt, and ail knew that behind the masculine
and virile brain and person of Charle
Murphy was a kindly and generous heart.
Hie friends hie knew and their adoption tried,
and hie grappied them ta hie soul with hooks
of steel. Those who were flot hie friends in
the warfare of politice hie possibly knew how ta
crush, but hie did not know how ta hate.
We think of him, though, nlot only as a
public man, but as a lover of literature and
especiall'y as a student of history. The
honourable leader on the other sîde (Hon. Mr.
Danduranct) has told us how he associated
with men of hie own race and cause in the
United States, in England, in Ireland and an
the continent, and how hie conducted a
voluminous correspondence with these men ta
the end of his days. He liked them because
they were giants of achievement. In what-

ever sphere they might have achieved he was
interested. But hie was intereeted moat if
they had at heart the common cause so dear
ta him, the cause of Ireland. He wanted ta
experience in hie own 111e ail the highest and
best thnilis of living, and hie gat this experience f rom these personal associations.
How hie loved ta telli about incidents and
conversations with men of note, especially
those of the land ta the south and those of
the lest generation across the Atlantic I No
man ever cxcei'led him as a raconteur. No
man ever excellcd him. in presenting the
interesting and the gripping side of a con,
versation in which he had taken. part or of an
incident through which hie had passed.
Naturaliy hie had, hie heroce in aur own land.
I do not know that anyone in this Dominion
quite filled hie ideal of politicai perfection
and personal charm, except one, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. How hie ioved Sir Wilfrid! But he
whom hie most revered in the paet records of
aur country was D'Arcy MeGee. Na one has
eontnibuted sa m'uch ta the immortaiity of
that great figure in Canadien history as hes
Charles Murphy. He wee a student of McGee
for the samne reason that hae was a *student of
many other notcd figures. He himseIf shared
the saine love of iearning, the semne poetic
temperament, the samne ardent patriotism. In
the story of this Dominion there will perhape
be none who will be found ta have possessed
in more bount-iful degree than Charles Murphy
that statesecn's iegacy of literary fire, of practicel political wiedomn and of ardent love of

FEBRUARY 12, 1936
Ailow me, honourabie senatars, ta add a
word ta what bas been s0 eloquentiy expressed
by my colleague from Rougemont. Chiarles
Murphy's memory will not fade. >There are
througliaut the iength and breadth of this
land tliousands upan thousands wlio wiil cherish bis memary and keep it green.
Senator Murphy was a fighter-alow me ta
say, a bare-fisted figliter; and the worid loves
a figliter. I will not say tliat lie was always
riglit in bis views, but lie thouglit lie was
riglit. Wliat else mattered?
In bis passing bis famiiy lias lbat a devoted
brother, tliis flouse a useful and briflant
member, and we of Irishi descent a feariess
champion. I have bast a friend. But wlietlier
my days be long or short I shall often think of
him, and always witli respect.
Riglit Han. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourabie senators, 1 was very intimately assacîated witli Cliarles Murphy in aur younger
days, thougli I was some years older than the
senatar; not 50 many, liowever, as ta prevent
our being together in aur youth.
H1e was eariy seiected by the yaung Liberais
of the province as tlieir president, and from
that office lie was cailed ta the presidency of
the Liberal Club of the Dominion of Canada.
Sa lie was weli knawn aIl aver this country. I
met him in those days and was associated
witli hýim very ciosely.
Wlien the time came that, for good or for
evil, I was asked ta join the Laurier Administration, the man ta meet me at the station
-tiough 1 had no idea that lie had any
knowiedge of my selectian-was Chiarles Murphy. Tlirougliaut those days, in evil as weli
as in good report, we were very intimate
friends and dîscussed many questions; not
always agreeing, I wili admit, bath being Irishi,
but we discussed everything ta aur lieart's
content. And that is really wliat an Irishiman loves.
Wlien the time was a littIe more advanced,
and I liad been a member of the Government
a few years, it became necessary ta find a
successar ta the Hon. Mr. Scott, a veteran
statesman of the city af Ottawa, and 1 was
ca.lled inta consultation. I told Sir Wilfrid
that I kinew of no better successar, nor any
ane mare able ta take bis place as the representative of bis race, than Charlie Murphy.
Cliarles Murphy was seiected-I do noît say
an my recommendation, but le was seiected.
Hie iaboured under great physical difficuities
ever since bis boylood, and the pain he suffered was hardiy knawn ta any but lis most
intimate friends. Down aimost ta the day of
bis death lie was the victim of one accident

after another, which added greatly ta bie
suffering, but neyer dimmed his mentality.
R1e was a rugged character; I might say a
rugged debater, a rugged friend and a rugged
opponent. A man of a peculiar disposition,
he neyer lagged in endeavouring ta fill hie
mind with the most compiete information on
every subI ect. Hie was a great lover of art, and
you wili find many exampies of it in bis home.
When lie came into his room in' the Senate
it was transformed almost into an art gailery,
as you ail know. H1e was able in debate, but
to my mind Cliarlie Murphy was. more
entertaining in private conversation.
In
debate a man is som~etimes restricted, as some
of yau honourable gentlemen know, frosa
expressing bis views in the language in which
they can lie expresaed most forcibly; but in
private conversation Senator Murphy during
the many years that I knew hýim was one
of the most wonderful entertainers, and he
diffused information in aimost every sentence.
I saw a good deal of Senator Murphy
from bis boyhood up, for there were flot many
days at a time wlien I did flot have either a
telephone conversation witli him or a personal
talk. I shall miss Cliarlie Murphy as a friend
as weii as a colleague. I was a coileague of
lis for years in the Government as weil as
in the Senate. Our private and public if e
lias lost a forceful character that lent individuality and robustneas to it at every
stage.
Toý bis brothers I extend sincere sympathy.

SENATE
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

THE LATE
Honourable

senators, it will be noticed that there is nothing on our Order Paper for discussion. I

made diligent inquiry, but found there was
no business available for initiation in this
House. There may be later on. This being
the case, it was then my duty to ascertain
what legislation might reach us from the
Commons, and I have come to the conclusion
that there will be none within the next two
weeks at least.
Therefore I beg leave to alter my notice
of motion to read March 3. This will give
the Commons two full weeks within which to
discuss and pass Bills to be transmitted to
this Chamber for our consideration.
I now beg leave to move, seconded by
Right Hon. Mr. Graham:
That when the Senate adjourns to-day it do
stand adijourned until Tuesday, March 3, at
8 o'clock in the evening.
The motion was agreed to.

INQUIRY

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Before the House
adjourns I wish to ask the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) whether he has had
sufficient time to consider the suggestion I
made yesterday in regard to the advisability
of appointing a committee of the Senate to
take up the question of illegal importation
of liquors and other commodities into the
Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have gone
into the matter which my honourable friend
laid before the House yesterday and have
carefully read his speech. I may say that
his suggestion is under advisement.

HON. SENATOR McCORMICK
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable members of the Senate, it is my painful duty to record the demise of one of our
colleagues, who has left us during the recess,
the Honourable John McCormick. He had
been ailing for some months and was not
able to be with us at the opening of this
session.
Senator McCormick was a pure
Highland Scotchman. Born in 1858 at Sydney
Mines, Nova Scotia, be had lived there all
bis lifetime, and for a number of years was
the leading citizen of that place.
Being
public spirited, be interested himself in all
the activities, municipal and provincial, of
his community. He was municipal councillor,
mayor and member of the Legislature. But
his vista extended beyond the borders of his
province. He started on his way towards
the Dominion capital in 1904, and he plodded
a heavy road, for he met with defeat in
that year and in 1908, 1911 and 1917. But,
though defeated, he was never downhearted,
and he reached his goal as a member of the
Dominion Parliament when he entered this
House in 1921.
Senator McCormick often participated in
debate. expressing his views with deliberation
and without bias. He was always informative and interesting, and he held the esteem
and friendship of his colleagues.
To his family our wholehearted sympathy
is extended.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
members, I have had the honour of being
a member of this Chamber during only the
past five sessions, but in that time it was my
happy privilege on more than one occasion
to meet the late Senator McCormick. We
all know that he was a man of a very kindly
and reticent disposition. During my time
here he did not speak often, but when he
did express himself upon any subject he
kept very close to the point and left upon
the House a strong impression of his sincerity. The honourable leader of the Senate
has referred to the fact that Senator
McCormick was of Scotch parentage, which
of course was an advantage. Not only was
he a successful merchant, but he gave unstintingly of his time to civic affairs, and
before his appointment to the Senate he was
a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature.
He belonged to that old, historic Church,
and I am credibly informed that he was a

MARCH 3,1936
very staunch member,' giving of his time and
money in a most generous manner.
On behaif of honourable senators on this
side I desire to associate ourselves with the
expression of sympathy that has been so
fittingly voiced by the honourable leader of
the Government in this House. That sympathy will no doubt be conveyed in the
usual way to the members of his famlly.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
short Bill to amend the Dominion Franchise
Act with respect to annual revision of lists.
As there is nothing on the Order Paper for

of the Day for second reading at the next
sitting.
The motion was agreed to.

question of the Dominion Franchise Act. It
is the consensus of opinion in the other bouse
that some $300,000 or $40,000, if not more,
will be saved by not having the lists revised
until 1937.
Question bas arisen as to what would happen
if by-elýections were to be held meantime. I
think it has been agreed in the House of
Commons that if nothing in the form of
changes in the Franchise Act comes out of
the committee, legisiation will he brought in
before the end of the session to cover
by-elections.
With these explanations I move the second
reading of 'the Bull.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Unless some
other honouraible senator on this side of the
b1ouse wishes to speak, I m-ay say that I can
sec no objection to this amendment. What
is proposed will cost, I think, $16,000, whereas
a general revision would cost 8350,000.
Hon. A. D. *McRAE: I think we might
commend the Government on this Bill. This
is the first evidenoe of goverumental economy
that to my knowledýge bas come before the
bouse in some time. I think we ought to
speed the measure on its wiay.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: I understand
there are somne amendments to he made to
this Bull. Later I shahl move that it be
referred to Committee of the Whole.

DISCUSSION

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Senate, it will be recalled that before we adj ourned, some two
weeks ago, the honouýrable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) asked me if a
committee of the Senate could not be appointed to examine into the question of the
smuggling of spirituous liquors into. Canada.
I intimated to him that I would rephy to his
suggestion as soon as possible.

SENATE

followed in trying to stem the evil to which
he referred.
Perhaps the inference to be
drawn from the remarks of the honourable
gentleman is that if the duty on spirituous
liquors were reduced the temptation to
smuggle would be less. le stated the duty
was some $10 per proof gallon, and indicated
that as a result there was such a large spread
between the purchase price of liquor and the
retail selling price, after duty was paid, that
the temptation to smuggle was very great.
Then he spoke of the Preventive Service and
rather suggested the question whether it
could net be strengthened, though he implied that this could be done only at a very
high cost te the country.
I asked for and have here a statement of
the customs duty and excise taxes at present
applicable to spirituous liquors from Great
Britain, Australia, South Africa and France,
showing the dates on which these rates became effective. The figure of $10, as quoted
by the honourable gentleman, was in force
at one time, perhaps up to a year ago,
though I am net sure; but it is no longer
in force, except with regard to some imports
from France. Effective March 23, 1935, the
customs duties on spirituous liquors were
reduced as follows:
From Great Britain-Item 156, $5 per
proof gallon. Item 156a, $5 per proof gallon.

From Australia-Iten 156, brandy, $3 per
proof gallon; rest of item, $5 per proof
gallon. Item 156a, $5 per proof gallon.
From South Africa-Item 156, brandy, $3
per proof gallon; Van der Hum, $4 per proof
gallon; rest of item, $5 per proof gallon.
Item 156a, $5 per proof gallon.
From France-Item 156, Cognac brandy
and Armagnac brandy, $5 per proof gallon;
liqueurs, $6 per proof gallon. Since May 10,
1921, the duty for the rest of this item has
been $10 per proof gallon, and for item 156a,
$10 per proof gallon.
. As to excise taxes, there is payable at the
time of importation, unless the goods are imported under sales tax licence number and
certificate, a consumption or sales tax of six
per cent levied on the customs duty paid
value.
There is also payable on importations from
France a special excise tax of three per cent
levied on the customs duty paid value.
Goods imported under the British Preferential Tariff or under trade agreements between Canada and other British countries
are exempt froin this tax.
Included in this statement, in small print,
are the complete tariff items 156 and 156a
as amended in 1935 and in effect since lMarch
23. I will place this upon Hansard.

This indicates that the cost of importation

large margin of profit available to persans
who evade the payment of duties by smnuggling.
I wrate ta the Commissioner of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, asking for a statement as ta the activities of the Preventive
Service. His reply is somnewhat lengthy, but
quite informative, and as there is very littie
more on the Order Paper, I ask leave to
read the statement, sa that it may appear in
Hlansard.
Ottawa, March 3, 1936.
Dear Senator Dandurand,
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter
of the 26th ultimo enclosing a copy of The
Debates of the Senate for Thursday, February
13, 1936, and referring ta a proposal made by
Senator Hughes that a special committee of the
Senate take up for consideration the existing
conditions with respect to the smuggiing and
illicit distillation of liquor.

in your letter, the follawing information is submitted in an endeavour ta outline briefly aur
experience during the past f ew years, and the
present situation with respect ta the traifflc,
and the methods emplayed ta combat the tactics
used by those engaged in the nefariaus trade

Taking Over of Preventive Duties
3. On April 1, 1932, the duties of the Preventive Service were assumed by this Farce,
being taken aver from the former Preventive
Branch which operated directiy under the Department of National Revenue. Ail the personnel of the former Service, including those
who were employed an patrol vessels, wha were
up ta the standard of the Rayai Canadian
Mounted Police were taken an the strength of
the Force. Aiýl patrol vessels and patral cars
were, at the samne time, taken aver by the
Police.
4. The change was made easihy, f acilitated to
a great extent by the absorption of the majarity
of the personnel of the former Preventive Service, and due ta the fact that a considerable
number witbin the Farce had enforced the
Excise Act and, ta a lesser extent, the CJustoms
Act, for fame years prier ta 1932.
5. The effectiveness of the new Service was
retarded for the first f ew months wbihe definite
instructions of a uniform character were prepared for the guidance of the Force as a whole,
in enforcing the respective Acts.
Pawers: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Act was amended in 1932, conferring upan ail
memibers of the Farce the pawers of custamsexcise officers. Instruction in Preventive Service work was, therefore, included in the schedule
of training througbout the Force.
7. Wrîts of assistance were provided in arder
that at heast one member of necessary detachments throughout the country might be se
equipped.

SENATE

Conditions existing in 1932
8. During the 1932 season the whole situation
was sized up, and conditions existing generally
were as follows:
On the Pacifie coast,
British Columbia:
waters adjacent to Vancouver Island and the
mainland were the scene of great activity by
rum vessels engaged in smuggling liquor froi
Canada into the United States, and also in shortcircuiting liquor released from bond in Canada
for export, such shipments being relanded on
islands off the northern mainland of British
Columbia for removal to the larger centres as
opportunities arose.
h'lie three Prairie ProvPrairie Provinces:
inces produced a considerable number of infractions of the Excise Act, the majority of
cases covering possession of small pot stills by
farmers, or the possession of illicit alcohol manufactured by that means. There was very little
smuggling of liquor over the boundary except
for a few attempts, wbich were effectively
stamped out. The city of Winnipeg, however,
was the rendezvous of gangs operating large
stills of commercial capacity.
Ontario: In Ontario a considerable amount
of distillation of liquor on a small scale was
carried ont in the rural districts, and evidence
existed of the smuuggling of liquor from the
United States over the bridges, and by motorboat in the Niagara and Windsor districts.
(At that time the Volstead Act was in force.)
Quebec: In the province of Quebec it iwas
evident that a large and well organized gang
vas engaged in snmuggling alcoliol into Canada in
the lower St. Lawrence area, and that it nwas
well equipped with vessels and veiicles for
transportation, and well protected by means of
an espionage system which kept its members
posted of the movements of our men in checking their activities.
13. Large illicit stills were in operation in
and around the city of Montreal, and smaller
stills in the smaller cities and towns and in the
rural districts. At this time there was little
evidence of smuggling of liquor fron the United
States.
Maritime Provinces: In the three Maritime
Provinces there was great activity in waterborne contraband liquor originating in the West
Indies and clearing from St. Pierre-Miquelon
for the "bigh seas," for points off our shores.
The vessels so engaged were for the most part
of the auxiliary schooner type.

Prairie Provinces: The preventive work carried ont by the Force in the Prairie Provinces
has been mainly concerning the suppression of
small illicit stills and their product. As our
detachmients are located at all settled parts, a
good check is kept ou these operations.

employees if they are convicted, or compensating

Quebec: In 1933 members of the Force in
the province of Quebec concentrated on the gang
referred to on page 4, w'ho operated along the
lower St. Lawrence. Raids were made simultaneously at the premises of known bootleggers
and disclosed evidence of a conspiracy to defraud the revenue of an amount estinsated a.t
$1,500.000, through the smuggling of liquor.
22. Some sixty persons were indicted for
"conspiracy to defraud," and upwards of forty
persons were convicted, receiving terms ranging
from four years' to three nionths' imprisonment.
In addition, evidence was adduced which justified the seizure of some twelve vessels, which
were subsequently forfeited for transporting
contraband. The ring had an organization which

subsequently adopted, whereby the vessels in
question and others seized for rum-running
were destroyed rather than offered for sale
by tender. The actions outlined above completely broke up a gang which had operated
for several years in the district in question.
It has been our experience that forfeited rum
vessels offered for sale, invariably, were bought
back by bootleggers through agents, at scrap
prices, and soon were again following their
nefarious trade.
Quebec, continued: Following the break-up
of the gang previously referred to, who operated
in the lower St. Lawrence and the province
of Quebec, further intensive investigations were
carried out, which disclosed that an even larger
organization for trafficking in contraband liquor
existed in the province of Quebec, with headquarters in Montreal.
Some sixty persons
were charged in the Montreal courts "for
having conspired to defraud the revenues of a
very large amount of money."
The persons
were residents of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, but the
Crown sought to prove that the actual
conspiracy took place in Montreal.
Subsequently all charges with the exception of eight
were withdrawn in view of questionable jurisdiction of the courts in Montreal.
25. Our efforts were disappointing in the
cases which were continued in Montreal, as,
despite a mass of evidence and exhibits
produced by the Crown, which indicated that
those charged were handling large quantities
of liquor upon which the duties or taxes had
not been paid, throughout Eastern Canada, the
cases were dismissed at the preliminary
enquête.
26. Attempts to have Crown counsel "bound
over" to prosecute before the competent court
of jurisdiction were unsuccessful. Subsequent
applications for preferred indictments. were
likewise unsuccessful.
27. In another case in Quebec large quantities
of alcohol of American origin, entering Canada
at Windsor, Ontario, were shipped by railway
freight cars to Montreal, fictitiously billed to
mythical drug firms in Montreal. The extent
to which the revenues were defrauded in this
case was estimated to be in excess of $20,000.
28. Conspiracy charges were also laid against
three persons during 1934 with respect to
shipments of alcohol smuggled into Canada in
railway tank cars. The amount of which the
Federal Government was defrauded in this
instance was estimated at $1,500,000.
29. The modus operandi adopted was to have
tank cars specially constructed with partitions
forming three separate compartments. Shipments originated in the State of New Jersey
and in each instance the end compartments
were filled with a cheap grade of oil, the
centre compartment containing alcohol.
30. The three persons involved, who were
apprehended in Canada, were convicted and
received terms ranging from four years to one
year. Appeals are pending in each instance,
before the Supreme Court of Canada, following
unsuccessful appeal proceedings heard by the
full bench of the Appeal Court of Quebec.
31. Still another case involving similar
charges resulted in the conviction of three
persons in the Montreal courts. Alcohol was
smuggled by aeroplane into Canada from the
State of Maine, and landed in out-of-the-way
spots adjacent to the Quebec boundary. The

39

principals would compensate local farmers foi
the privilege of landing on their property and
for maintaining secrecy.
32. There are indications that aircraft may
provide a common medium for the transportation of contraband and the condition is receiving consideration in order that situations may
be dealt with as they arise.
33. Seven persons were also convicted during
1935 for conspiracy charges arising out of the
smuggling of American alcohol in the vicinity
of Pont Rouge, P.Q. In this case the liquor
was imported in railway box cars, concealed
in shipments of paper and billed accordingly.
It was estimated that the revenues were
defrauded of approximately $150,000 by this
means.
Ramifications of liquor traffic: The foregoing
and other cases involving charges of "conspiracy to defraud the revenue," initiated by
this Force, disclosed the wide ramifications of
the liquor interests. It was established that
publie utilities, including railways, telegraph,
telephone and express services, were utilized,
by those concerned, in the illicit traffic.
35. Within our experience officials of some
companies and Government officials have been
bribed to facilitate the movement of liquor
shipments.
Ontario: In Ontario the liquor situation has
been kept in check, generally, by means of
prosecutions and seizures of stills. Recent
investigations indicated that a gang operated
in the Niagara-Hamilton-Guelph area, producing illicit alcohol for local trade and for export
to the United States, dependent upon the
price structure for their produce in the
respective countries. During November, 1935,
three large stills, each with a daily output of
two hundred and fifty gallons, were seized in
the area in question, and some ten persons
were convicted and received sentences ranging
from one year with bard labour plus a fine of
$500, to the minimum penalty provided by
section 164 of the Excise Act, namely, a fine
of $100, or, in default of payment, three months'
imprisonment.
Nova Scotia: A number of those persons
against whom conspiracy charges were withdrawn in the Montreal courts were later
similarly charged in Nova Scotia. Eleven were
convicted and received substantial sentences
involving fines up to $3,000, with alternative
jail terms.
38. Eight other persons have been similarly
charged in the Halifax courts, and within the
past few days six of them pleaded guilty, and
fines of from $1,500 to $600, totalling $8,100,
were imposed, with alternative jail terms.
39. Since assuming preventive duties members of the Force have continuously obtained
convictions under the Customs, Excise, and
Nova Scotia Liquor Acts, for offences concerning the manufacture, importation, possession
and transportation of liquor.
40. In that province a system has been
devised whereby certain types of such offences
are prosecuted under the provincial statutes,
others under the federal acts; and in certain
instances under both. This arrangement bas
worked out satisfactorily, judging by normal
barometers such as improved sales by government liquor stores and the increased price of
contrabrand liquor in the province. We feel
that our activities have decidedly curbed the
traffie, although we are aware that a large
amount of contraband is still landed by vessels

42. Illicit distillation of liquor is not carried on to any great extent, most offences
dealing with possession, or smuggling of liquor
along the coastline and, to a lesser extent, in
the last two years, over the Maine border.
43. Our efforts in preventing landings in

is well in hand at the present time.

landings of contraband, bas greatly hampered
smuggling operations.
45. Comments from local bodies have been
favourable; and while some complaints have
been received regarding alleged conditions in
certain districts, the persons making the complaints and claiming to have definite knowledge of the violators and violations have
refused to divulge information which would
assist menbers of this Force in dealing with
the offenders.
Maritime Provinces generally: In the Maritimes members of our Force are kept fully
occupied on preventive work. Convictions have
been consistently recorded throughout the three
provinces, and we are continuîally conscious
of the necessity for constant pressure.
47. Indications have cone to us verbaly and
in the form of letters that our work in those
provinces is regarded as fruitful.
48. The rum-runners are being converted
from the schooner type of vessel to large, fast
motor-boats equipped with wireless, by means
of which they maintain contact with agents on
shore, arrange landings, and are kept advised
of the movements of our patrol vessels-a
situation which bas necessitated change in
our tactics and equipment accordingly.

Co-operation

with U.S.

services:

Follow-

ing a conference between officials of the
United States Coast-Guard Service and members of this Force in 1934, an arrangement
was made whereby very close co-operation is
maintained between the preventive forces of
the two countries. Information to the mutual
advantage of the services is freely exchanged.
This has produced tangible results in the form
of seizures of contraband and of vessels conveying it.
Hon, Mr DANDURAND.

51. Co-operation has been developed, and
every opportunity is taken by each service to
aid the other.
52. While in Washington recently I conferred with officials of the United States
Coast-Guard Service, Treasury Department,
regarding plans for combating the liquor traffic
on the Atlantic coast.
53. Co-operation is maintained by marine
and land officers all along the boundary with
fruitful results.
Liquor shipments:
At the instigation of
the United States Government, regulations
were put into effect during July, 1935, whereby restrictions were placed on liquor vessels

was put up, to be cancelled only when landing

temporary check on the traffic; but the trade
from those islands was quickly substituted
by the arrival of steamships from European
ports, chiefly Norwegian vessels bringing
alcohol of Belgian, Dutch, German and Austrian origin.
These deep-sea vessels would
anchor at a rendezvous on the high seas adjaocent to the Nova Scotia and New England
coasts, and discharge cargoes consisting of up
to twenty-five thousand cases of alcohol to
fast motor-boats which made the ship-to-shore
trips.
54. It bas occurred to us that more could be
done by our own country along the lines of
the United States treaty with the French
Government, which resulted in the restrictions
placed upon liquor vessels clearing from St.
Pierre-Miquelon, by making similar arrangements with other British colonies or wi.th
other countries outside the Empire.
Custons duties-excise taxes (liquor) : The
reduction of customs duties and excise taxes
provided in the 1935 Budget followed a strong
recomnendation from these headquarters that
it vas deemed advisable to lessen the profit,
and thereby the incentive to stmuggle liquor.
W'hile this has had some effect, otr experience
cluring the past season indicates that the margin
of profit is stili sufficient to provide the incentive to smuggle this commodity and also to
carry on illicit distillation. The traffic fluctuates over the border as the price structure in
the two countries provides the market.
At
times we have a flow of American alcohol,
and at other times the Canadian produce flows
south. This situation emphasizes the advantage
of close co-eperation with the United States
preventive officials.
•
56. It is believed that if the various provincial governments maintaining liquor stores
would give the fullest possible effect to reduction in the taxes in the retail prices they
would be making helpful and worth-while contribution to successful preventive work.
Legislation:
During the past two years
several important sections of the Customs Act
have been the subject of adverse rulings in
the courts, which have nuillified their usefulness. This is particularly the case with respect
to those sections dealing with the seizure of
liquor laden vessels and the prosecutions of
persons found on board.
57. Recommendations based on cur experience have been submitted to the Department
of National Revenue. and we understand that
amendments te the Customs Act will be submitted at the present session of Parliament,
which. if adopted, will materially strengthen
our arm from a preventive angle.

MARCH 4, 1936
Marine section equipment: The liquor traffic
in the Maritime Provinces has at all times
called for great vigilance, and aircraft provided by the Royal Canadian Air Force, carrying police observers, have co-operated with
cruisers and land forces in combating the landing of liquor in the three provinces concerned.
59. A total of thir-ty patrol vessels were
taken over from the former Preventive Service,
varying in size from thirty-five ta one hundred
and eighty feet in length, also the personnel
of the vessels, approximately two hundred and
thirty officers and men. It was found that
a number of the vessels were obsolete, and
costly ta maintain, and a program was undertaken ta substitute new vessels of approved
type and low maintenance.
60. As an example of the high cost of operation of certain vessels taken over, the Margaret
and Conestoga are cited. Records show that the
cost of operating the former for a ten months'
cruising period was well over $100,000, and' the
latter for an eight months' cruising period,
$40,000. Both vessels were disposed of by sale
shortly after we assumed the duties of the
Preventive Service. The following comparative
figures for the combined operating and capital
expenditure for Preventive Service patrol boats
and cruisers are taken from the Auditor
General's reports for the respective years:
1931-32. . ..........
$887,091 06
1932-33.. ..........
517,424 47
1934-35.. ..........
'513,734 78
61. The personnel to-day is a trained force
employed on a yearly 'basis. They receive
marine training and courses in preventive work
during the lay-up period. Promotion is limited
ta advancement from the ranks, and every
inducement is given ta a man to better himself.
In addition, the men are now eligible for
pension.
62. The prevention to-day is more effective
than in 1932. Some of the cruisers have been
equipped with small, high-speed contact boats,
which can be lowered over the side and chase
rum-runners.
63. Recent additions ta the fleet are small
sixty-foot vessels of a very seaworthy type,
capable of navigating in very shallow water
and very effective in searching coves, etc.,
where they can be run up on the shore without
any damage te -the vessel. The cost of maintenance of such units is exceptionally low. Two
new steel cruisers now under construction will
add te the effectiveness of next season's patrol
at a low cost.
64. Our present marine equipment is net all
that could be desired, and a program for
additional construction of patrol vessels during
the present year, which would have further
strengthened our defence, has had ta be postponed in view of the curtailment of our
estimates presented for the purpose. Additional wireless equipment, for our patrol
vessels, and further motor transport are
needed.
Conclusions
Sources and uses of information: Another
factor which has proven important in preventive measures is the necessity of dealing
liberally with informers who assist the Force
in locating caches ,of liquor, or who supply
information of intended landings, etc.
The
system of utilizing informers in police and
preventive work is sometimes criticized, but
it is a matter of record' that many seizures

41

are a direct result of information supplied
and no successful alternative has yet been
found ta replace this type of service. It is
our belief that a greater measure of reward
ta informers than that at present provided by
the regulations would be justified, in the final
analysis, by the suppression of smuggling and
the resultant revenues which would be recouped
through forcing consumers ta utilize legitimate
channels ta obtain their supplies.
Legal assistance: It is considered that it
would be of advantage ta have permanent
counsel appointed in all large centres ta
prosecute on behalf of the Crown in cases
under the Customs and Excise Acts. It has
been our experience that certain counsel
specialize in the defence of individuals charged
with infractions of those Acts, and are invariably retained by persons so indicted,
whereas under the present system instructions
are sometimes received ta employ counsel with
little experience in cases of this type, who are
hopelessly outclassed by defence counsel of the
type referred ta above.
Efficiency of service: In conclusion I would
state that at the present time members of
the Force have the necessary powers to enforce the Customs and Excise Acts and are
being thoroughly trained for the work, and
that the Force is equipped as far as possible
with a personnel ta take care of situations as
they arise. It is realized that we must be
ever on the alert ta offset the new tactics
introduced by the law-breakers as they arise,
the new equipment which they use, and
systematic study which they evidently give
ta their problems.
68. The cost of the Preventive Service as a
whole has been consistently reduced, as indicated by the following figures. The vote
for Preventive Service, 1931-32, was slightly
in excess of $2,100,000; amount of vote transferred ta the R.C.M. Police from the Department of National Revenue when the duties
were assumed, on April 1, 1932, slightly in
excess of $1,500,000; the present annual cost

is approximately $1,000,000.

69. We are under no illusions as ta the
extent of the liquor traffic, and while every
attempt is made ta combat the ever-changing
tactices of the rum-running fraternity, we do
feel that there is much ta be done.
Education of public: It is felt that educatien of the public ta the serious effects of the
illicit liquar trade would have valuable results.
We have found that very reputable people
have been quite frankly unsympathetic towards
enforcement of laws respecting liquor traffic
until it has been pointed out te them that the
weaknesses of people for obtaining their liquor
supply through illicit sources are being exploited to the detriment of the country and its
revenue.
Yours very truly,
J. H. MacBrien,
Commissioner.
The explanation is lengthy, but I think it
was worth while to inform the House of what
the Preventive Service is accomplishing under
very great difficulties. This statement will
go out to the public with the preceding one
explaining the reduction in duties, and if
after publication of these statements there
appears some further criticism which would

42

SENATE

justify the Senate in appointing a committee of investigation, the Government will be
quite ready to respond to the wish expressed.
I thank my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) for bringing this matter to the
attention of the Senate.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable members, naturally I could not follow in all its
implications the statement read by the honourable leader of the House. It will appear
in Hansard and I shall read it with care and
try to understand it fully. It clearly shows,
however, that
there is in Canada
a
tremendous smuggling organization covering
the whole country, but particularly active on
the seaboards, both east and west, and that
although large sums of money are being spent
and a small army of men and extensive
equipment are employed, the Preventive
Service bas not yet been able to stamp out
the evil nor to bring it under reasonable
regulation.
Now I want the House to realize that this
unfortunate condition of affairs is of recent
growth. We did not always have it. During
the War the Parliament of Canada. properly,
no doubt-in its wisdom. at all events-raised the excise and customs duties on
spirituous and malt liquors from small charges
to exceedingly high ones. After the War
these duties were continued and this business
started. Therefore, it seems to me, we are
justified in coming to the conclusion that
it was the excessive duties which created the
business. I knew when I was speaking before
the recess that last session the Government
made a considerable reduction in the duties,
but I did not mention it at the time, because
I felt that was well known to everybody or
could be easily ascertained. But in the statement that has just been read the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
says the duties are still so high and the inducement to smuggle is still so great that the
illegal business continues.
To my mind this is a very serious state of
affairs. A large number of our people are
divided into two camps. On one side there
are those engaged in the smuggling business,
who are trying to defraud the national revenue,
and on the other there are those seeking to
prevent them from doing se. In a small way
there is a civil war going on in the country.
Now, is it desirable that that kind of thing
should exist, if it can be stopped?
As I have already pointed out, this business
is of recent origin. It bas sprung up within
the last twenty years. Before that time we
did not have it at all. Would it not naturally
appear that the remedy lies in a return to the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

duties prevailing before the business began?
If we adopted that remedy, would not this
unlawful business die a natural death?
According to newspaper reports it appears
that part of the organization on trial in
Montreal last year was charged with defrauding the national revenue of $5,000,000-a very
large sum of money. Then, the effect of this
business upon a large proportion of the people
engaged in it is such as to make them poor
citizens of our country. That is a matter to
be considered.
Some years ago, when the Preventive Service
was being reorganized, the late Mr. Breadner
and two or three other officials came before a
committee of this House and gave evidence
with respect to certain proposed amendments
to the preventive laws. He was confident that
if the proposed amendments were enacted his
staff would be able to do more effective work
in curbing smuggling. I stated at the time
that I did not think it would be possible to
stop the illicit traffic while the financial inducements were so great. Two or three years
later he told me that the Preventive Service
could not cope with the highly organized
smuggling rings. I believe he was a very
capable official, and certainly one determined
to do his duty. I repeat, I do not think that
this traffie can be controlled while the monetary inducements continue to be so attractive.
In my opinion the only way to cure this tremendous evil is to reduce the duties so as to
render smuggling no longer a profitable business.
I do net think our revenue would suffer by
such a reduction of duties. It bas been estimated by some persons with a considerable
knowledge of the matter that on at least 70
or 80 per cent of the liquor now consumed in
Canada no duty has been paid. I do net
know whether that is a reliable estimate.
However, to my mind, the loss of revenue is
net so serious as the loss of character-the
debauching of our people engaged in this
illicit business.
Now, I would suggest that honourable senators who are interested-and I suppose almost
every member is interested-read to-day's
Hansard and study the statement from the
Commissioner in charge of the Preventive
Service, so that they may realize how serious
is the state of affairs. In the meantime further
discussion might be deferred until we meet
agan.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not concluded.

The matter is

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No, the matter is not
concluded to-day. I have this morning received from the president of the Canadian

MARCH 4, 1936
Seamen's Association of Vancouver a letter
commending me for having mentioned the
matter in this Chamber, and stating that the
smuggling business in Vancouver is simply
appalling. I do not think that is the word
the writer uses, but it isHon. Mr. DANDURAND: An equivalent.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, it is an equivalent. I have also received letters from the
Premiers and Attorneys-General of two of the
Maritime Provinces commending my action
and saying that in their opinion Parliament
should take some steps at this session to
see if this evil cannot be brought under
reasonable control. We have been complaining of lack of legislation from the other
House. I think perhaps under the circumstances we could not be better employed than
in looking into this very serious situation.
The statement read this afternoon by the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) intimates that respectable
people in the Maritime Provinces are sympathetic towards this illicit traffic. That the
people of Canada should be divided into two
armies fighting each other, one of them breaking the laws of the country in a wholesale
manner, is an appalling state of affairs.
I thank honourable members for their
patient attention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should have
informed the House that I have received a
letter from the Premier of Prince Edward
Island in which he refers to the statement
made by the honourable senator from King's
(Hon. Mr. Hughes) and says that this subject
is of great importance to his province, and
anything that can be done to curtail the
traffic will be greatly appreciated by his Government.
Our honourable friend thinks that the only
way to curb the evil is to reduce the excise
duties. I do not think it would be contrary
to the rules of procedure for him to move
that in the opinion of this Chamber the
present excise duties are too high. By taking
this course he would be able to test the views
of honourable members. He would then find
that there are two sides to the question, for
while, if the duties were reduced, smuggling
might be discouraged, cheaper whisky would
stimulate consumption, to the prejudice of
temperance. Of course, I appreciate his point
that under prevailing conditions the morale
of the people is being badly sapped.
The matter is still open for further discussion. I simply place on Hansard the
statement received from the Commissioner
in charge of the Preventive Service.

43

Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable senators, inasmuch as the honourable gentleman
from King's bas referred to the deplorable
conditions at VancouverHon. Mr. HUGHES: I did not refer to
the honourable member.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: -I think it might be
well for me to observe that the situation on
our Pacifie coast bas, I understand, greatly
improved since the annulment of the
Eighteenth Amendment. In fact smuggling
of liquors into the United States has almost
ceased.
I followed very closely the lengthy statement from the Commissioner of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, which the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has placed on Hansard. It indicates that the Preventive Service has been
very active in curbing liquor smuggling, and
that apparently the present force is adequate
for this service, there being no request for
its expansion.
In the opinion of the honourable senator
from Kings cheaper whisky is the only cure
for the smuggling evil. But, as the honourable leader of the Government has suggested,
the application of this cure might be open to
objection on the part of those who think we
are already drinking too much liquor.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I am in favour of cheaper
whisky.
DOMINION FRANCHISE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the

Act to amend the Dominion Franchise Act.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1-revision of lists:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My attention
is drawn to the fact that section 20 of the
Act amended by this Bill is but a procedural
section, and that the operative sections are
19 and 22. Section 19 need not be modified,
but it is suggested that we should modify
section 22.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Mr. Chairman, the
Bill bas not been properly drawn, and I
should like to move in amendment to strike
out the word "thirty-seven" in line 8, and
substitute "thirty-five, except in the year
1936;" and to add, as clause 2, the following:

SENATE
Section 22 of the said Act is repealed and
the following is substituted therefor:22. The days between the fifteenth day of
May and the first day of Julv in each year.
except in the year 1936, shall be a revisal
period during which all Registrars of Electors
shall, pursuant to this Act and in the manner
indicated in this Part, make and certify
revised lists of electors for all polling
divisions.
The Act is left intact except for the year
1936, and this is what we want to accomplish.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:

No.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I do not follow these
bills very closely, but as I think this amendment practically makes this a new bill, it
may be appropriate to offer an observation
with respect to the bills that come to us from
the House of Commons for approval. I am
sure that every honourable senator knows
how much time was wasted last year on
imperfect bills that came from the other
House, some of which were sent back with
as many as fifty or fifty-four amendments.
The proposed amendment would seem to be
a very simple one, and it is rather discouraging to find that the Bill placed before us for
consideration, as a result of the very first
effort, has to be practically rewritten. Fortunately, this measure is short, and we are
not busy, but I hope that later in the session
we shall not be called upon to rewrite a lot
of important legislation.
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of Bill A, an Act to incorporate the Economical Mutual Fire Insurance
Company.
He said: Honourable members, with the
consent of the House I am moving the second
reading of this Bill to-day. As I understand
the Bill, its real object is to give federal
incorporation to a concern that has been
operating many years in Kitchener, Ontario,
under a provincial charter.
On looking at
the measure you will observe, I think, that
the directors are the same persons who have
been directors of the provincially incorporated
company. At least, they are all very substantial men. The business is perfectly solvent and in good financial condition, and it
is merely with respect to the expansion of
the business that it is desired to have a
Dominion charter. If the Bill is given second
reading, I should like to see it referred to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Why not the Private
Bills Committee?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Insurance bills
have ordinarily been handled before the Banking and Commerce Committee, on account of
the fact that the Superintendent of Insurance
usually attends that committee and expresses
his approval or disapproval of the measures
that are dealt with.

Hon. Mr. Euler, one of the directors, the
board is planning for an expansion of the
company's business, and therefore requires
a federal charter.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl

BUSINESS 0F TUE SENATE
MOTION TO ADJOURN

bon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, we returned here at the beginning of this week to flnd that the bouse
of Gommnons had flot yet been in a position
to send us any legislatîon. Because of rny
fairly long parliamentary experience I was
not very rnuch surprised at tiiis state of
things.
I desire to explain to a number of our
new members and to the public at large what
is the situation of this Gharriber during the
early part of the session. There are matters
special to the House of Gommons, some of
which do corne to us for consideration, -but
whiph do not linger here as long as in the
Gommons. In my thirty-eight years as a member of this Ohamber it has been rny experience
that in an average session of five rnonths the
bouse of Gommons devotes at least two
months to matters that we dispose of within
two days. For instance, the discussion on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne hasts from one to two and sometirnes
three weeks in the Gommons. Similarly, the
other bouse discusses the Budget for two
weeks or mare. Then the voting of Supply in
Gornmittee of the Whole in the Gommons
takes four weeks and sometimes longer.
It must be borne in mind that two hundred
and forty-flve members are returned to the
bouse of Gommons, and that the debate on
the Address usualy occupies several weeks
because of the political aspect of the Speech
from the Throne, which naturally interests
the two parties facing each other thereI should say three or four parties. now. We
in this bouse, in our discussion of the Speech
fr.om the Throne, try to keep as far away as
possible from the political angle in order to
retain nur quasi-judicial spirit. In the other
bouse there is a protracted debate on the
Budget, and ail the tariff amendments therein
proposed are incorporated in separate Bills,

45

which again are fully discussed. In my experience the Supply Bill is generally transmitted to this House within two hours of
prorogation. We couid hold it for twentyfour hours or longer, but we content ourselves with a general discussion of the expenitures, whether widened or narrowed
down by the Government of the day. On
the contrary, most of the Supply items are
discussed in the Commons. Hai a dozen
members or more will criticize particular
items on the ground that the appropriation is
too sinall, or that it discriminates against
oCher sections of the country. As a resuit
the discussions on Suppiy extend over weeks
and weeks.
I estimate that the House of Gommons
devotes to these subjects alone, the Address,
the Budget, and Supply, a good two rnonths,
whereas in this Chamber we deal with them
in a comparatively short time.
I arn confident that our parliamentary
records of the last twenty-flve or flfty years
will bear me out when I say that the Senate
bas neyer been able to give more than three
months out of flve to the careful and patient
study ai proposed legisiation. This, I think,
bas been the experience of ail senators who
have been in this buse for some years.
Now, I draw the attention of the public
to a feature whýich is peculiar to the bouse
of Gommons. Its two- hundred and f ortyfive membýers must during the session express
the opinions of their electors, sometimes in a
carefully prepared speech which later they
circulate throughout their constituencies. In
most cases many, if not aIl, of thé arguments
and facts of that speech have been expressed
ten or twenty times before, during the session.
It rnay be asked, why this repetition. Simply
because, while ostensibly adclressing the
House of Gommons, its members are in
reality speaking to their electors, to whom,
as I have said, they will distrihute copies of
their speech. I do not abject ta that practice. Even when somýe honourable members
do nat feel the inspiration, they do feel the
necessity of raising their vaice throughout
the session in order that their electors may
know what they are doing on -the floor of
the bouse.
During the last few weeks of the session,
legislation would be flowing steadily from the
Gommons to the Senate, and when as a
Minister of the Grown I would enter the
Council Chamber I would often be asked
by my colleagues how far we had advanced
in our work. I would answer, "We have concluded our work." lu surprise they would
exclairn: "Whatl Why, it is only last week
that we sent you many bills." I would

SENATE
reply: "Oh, yes, that is true, but we have
fully considered all those bills and have
amended them where they required amendment, and sometimes extensive amendment,
and we are returning them to your Chamber.
But you must realize this situation"-and I
confess I was speaking somewhat facetiously
you gentlemen of the Commons
-"that
address yourselves to your electors, while we
in the Senate address ourselves to the question; which is a much shorter and far more
expeditious procedure."
One fact to which I would draw the attention of that section of the public which
may be disposed to criticize us because we
adjourn at this time-for we have been
subjected to criticism during the past two
weeks--is that members of the House of
Commons inscribe their names on a list to
signify their intention of speaking on a certain subject, and, having done this, they go
to their rooms and prepare speeches which
may follow the exact trend of thought and
argument contained in ten other speeches,
already delivered. In this Chamber such a
thing never occurs. Here, when discussions
take place, any objections raised are answered
directly, and no one thinks of iaising them a
second time once they have been answered.
Our discussions are direct and to the point.
Within a few hours we have solved all
difficulties, or have. agreed to disagree on
certain points. That is the difference between
the atmosphere of the Commons and that
of the Senate. Therefore, to those who ask
why the Senate is adjourning, I say that it is
because in three months it can well do the
work that it is called upon to do-work which
in the Commons, under another form of
procedure and practice, consumes five months.
For these reasons, there being no legislation
coming from the Commons, I would move
that when this House adjourns to-day it do
stand adjourned until the 21st of March at
8 o'clock in the evening.
Some Hon. SENATORS: The 21st?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had thought
of adjourning to the 17th, but my right
honourable friend felt so much aggrieved at
being called back on St. Patrick's Day that
out of consideration for his feelings I will
move that we adjourn to Monday, the 21st of
March.

Hon. Mr. POPE: Keep on going.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I rise, not to speak to the motion, but to say
that since yesterday, and again since the
statement made to-day, I have been speaking
to one of our members about the advisability
of the Senate having a special committee each
session endeavour to select two or three
subjects which might be dealt with by this
body and would provide some work for it to
do. This member said he had often thought
of moving for a committee to deal with some
particular subject, but had always hesitated
to do so. Having regard to the personnel of
the Senate and the experience of its members
in the public life and business life of this
country, it seems to me that each session we
could very profitably deal with two or three
outstanding problems which have no political
aspect whatsoever, but in which the public
generally are very much interested.
I would cite as an illustration of what I
mean the deliberations of our Committee on
Tourist Traffic. That committee did good
work in dealing with a very important subject,
and I think the results of its labours are
evident throughout Canada to-day.
A subject that I have in mind at the present
How much do our
time is reforestation.
people know of what has been donc, what is
being done and what should be donc in the
way of reforestation in this country? I confess that I know little about it myself, though
I should like to be informed. The only way
I could become familiar with it would be by
a prolonged search, I do not know where, or
by the report of a committee which went into
the subject from top to bottom.
We all
know the importance of this subject: we ail
know what is happening in Canada in the
slashing of our forests, and when we look
forward thirty, forty or fifty years we know
what is likely to be the result unless something
is donc to prevent it. I mention that merely
as an illustration.
I quite agree with the honourable leader of
the Government that under existing conditions
there must necessarily be a period during the
early part of the session when we simply
cannot have work to do in this House; but
it seems to me that this House, after the first
adjournment or so, could very profitably take
up some large public question or questions in
which all the people of Canada are interested,
and which have no political aspect at all.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: My suggestion would
be that we should have a small committee,
net exceeding seven in number, which would
meet at the beginning of each session to
select the topics to be considered by the

MARCH 5, 1936
Senate during the session. The adoption of
such a proposal would give the committee a
good deal of work to do, and afterwards would
lead to profitable discussion in the House.
I have not been here very long-about
fourteen or fifteen years-but according to
my observation and experience the situation
always has been and always will be the same.
Conditions are such that this cannot be
altered. As the leader of the Government has
said, the House of Commons must necessarily
give attention to things which do not concern
us at all. During the early part of every
session there must be periods when nothing
is coming to us from the other House and
when, as a consequence, we have nothing to
do.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
members, there is another important policy
that might be extended. During the five
sessions that I have had the honour of being
a member of this House a great deal of most
important legislation bas been initiated here.
We all know very well that under our Constitution one House has as much right as the
other to initiate legislation. Among the
measures originating in this House during the
past few years have been the Railway Bill,
the Shipping Bill-the biggest Bill I ever saw
-the Admiralty Bill, the Insurance Bil and
the Patent Bill. I do not see what objection
any Government that happens to be in power
could have to turning over at least a part of
its legislation for initiation in this House.
Many of us have sat in both Houses, and
several, including myself, have been Ministers
of the Crown. Without the slighest intention
of criticizing any action of the other House,
I think it can be said that when one becomes
a member of the Senate and attends meetings
of its two most important committees, the
Railway Committee and the Banking and
Commerce Committee, one is immediately
struck with two things. First, there is not a
word of reference to polities. This is my fifth
session as a senator, and I have never heard a
political speech in this House, nor a word of
political discussion when bills were being
considered by either of the committees I have
mentioned. The second thing is that measures are much more quickly and efficiently considered in this House. This is due
first of all to the fact that we are summoned
to the Senate for life and therefore are not
interested in elections; and, secondly, to the
fact that honourable members are-I will not
say old, for that is not true, especially of our
lady members, but, as the honourable senator
from SaItcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) has remarked, rich in experience in business, publie
affairs and many other walks of life. I know
that the honourable leader of the Govern-

47

ment in this Chamber has done his best to
have work for us early in the session, and I
hope he will continue his efforts along that
line.
I am very glad indeed that the honourable
leader has made his statement, and I want to
offer him my congratulations. The people
of Canada are not properly seized of the
duties of this House, nor of the manner in
which those duties are performed. It seems
to me that the average person thinks the
Senate is simply a rubber stamp, that senators
have a very pleasant and easy time, and that
all the work is done by the other House. We
all have listened to a great many joking
references to this effect. So I for one am
greatly indebted to the honourable leader
for saying what he bas said to-day. His
remarks will, I hope, give the public a better
and higher appreciation of the valuable work
that this honourable House does.
HonourabIe
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members of the Senate, I desire to add one
remark. Last year we had a very heavy
legisIative session. And as my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) has
just said, in the course of the last Parliament
there were some highly important measures
coming for review before this Chamber. Now,
such measures as the Insurance Act, the
Shipping Act, the Patent Act and the Railway
Act will not have to be overhauled every year;
so I hope we may expect the legislative work
this session to be lighter than in 1935. There
are people who believe that the tendency is
for us to place too many laws on our
Statute Book. The fact is, of course, that
we pass laws when we feel it is opportune or
necessary to do so, in the public interest. But
there should be, it seems to me, some lean
years in legislation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, March
23, at 8 p.m.

SECOND READING
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH moved
the second rcading of Bill 6, an Act ta repeal
the Economie Cauncil of Canada Act, 1935.
Ho said,: Honourable members, this Bill
passesses at least the menit of brevity, and
needs littie. if any, explanation.
It cornes
ta us from the House af Commons. Its purpose is te repeal an Act passed last session.
The Bill then enaeted w-as presented by tbe
riglit lianourable leader of this Hanse at tbe
time (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) as a Geveruîiieit mîeasure tu establish an ecunurnic
cauncil, and xvas passcd after very littie discussion-merely a few rernarks by the leader
an aur side of the House and a word of
(-riticiin frorm anather banourable member.
The Lite Gox-eern-ent took ne action under

council.
I pi-osumo tbat ne part of tbe
"-0.000 apprapriated last session for the purpo-es of the couneil bas ever been expended.
Nxo sirnilar prax ian appears in the Estimates
for the fiscal year cnding March 31. 1937.
Apparently the prasent Government dees not
intonci ta act under the statute. In fact, an
the ,-econd rpading af thi.s Bill in theoather
Hau.se, w-hon the Prima Minister w-as pressed

MARCH 23, 1936
te, state the position of the Government with,
regard to the Bill, he contented himse]f witb.
simply .sayin.g that this Government tbougbt
it was nlot in 'the public interest that the Act
sbould remain upon the Statute Bo.ok. Accordingly, this Bill was passed by the Bouse
of 'Commons without division and with
virtuaII.y no discussion. It would appear that
the Governmýent of the day has no intention
Of proeeeding under the Act, and therefore it
might as well be repealed.
Right Bon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, the consideration which ordinarily sbould govern the repeal or non-repeal
of an Act of Parliament is whether or not
that Act is capable of being of public service. 1 do nlot think it is worth while,
tbough, to argue now the question of the
value of an economic council. There were,
perhaps, those who thouglit it sometbing in
the nature of supererogation, but the Commons of last year unanimously, 1 believe,
passed the measure sponsored by the Government of that time, and it passed also witbout
opposition in this Bouse. For myseif, I think
a thoroughly well selected body of men who
made their life work a study of economie
questions, men of the stamp of Maynard
Keynes, of England, if we had them in this
country, migbt be, and certainly ougbt to be,
of immense value to us.
Bon. Mr. CALDER- Bear, hear.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGBEN: But if the
Government of the day do not want the
measure, I certainly arn not going to, be a
party to, forcing it upon them. It is, to my
mind, not only conceivable but probable that
an economie council would be of use if
selected by a Government who believed in
the institution tbey were establisbing; but it
is utterly beyond common sense to suggest
it could. be of any value if appointed by a
Government who had no faith in it and did
nlot tbink it could serve this country. Therefore I do not oppose the repeal of tbe Act.
Indeed, the line of reasoning 1 arn adopting
is just that advanced by the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth).
But 1 do cali attention to something that
appears to me as extraordinary.
I do not
like this Bouse being addressed as if it
really had meagre intelligence, and in that
very fashion it is addressed in the explanations vouchsafed to us on the second page
of this measure:
The purpose of this Bill is t<o repeal The
Economie Council of Canada Act, 1935, for the
following reasons-

49

Now, will the Bouse mark the reasons why
the Act is to be repealed?
(a) The Governor in Council lias flot
deemed necessary or ex!pedient to appoint any
members to f ormi an economie council.
Not that the Governor in Council thiaks an
economie council would not be of any use;
but that tbe Governor in Council bas not done
anything. In paragraph (b) we are told:
(b) According to section twelve thereof, the
said Act is inoperative if moneys are flot
appropriated 'by Parliametat for the purposes
of the council; and whereas the provision for
an expenditure of $20,000 appeared as item 412
in the schedule of The Appropriation Act,
1No. 6, 1935, said provision has been left out
of the Estimates for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1937.
So we are asked to repeal the measure, nlot
because it is not a good measure, but because
no mçney has been voted te, sustain and
operate At. Surely we are entitled to, an
explanation whýich suggests a little better estimate of our intelligence th-an what is indicated here. I know the bonourable leader of
the Bouse (Bon. Mr. Dandurandi) is flot
responsible for tbe explanatory notes, but it
is utter nonsense Vo address them Vo a
deliberative assembly.
As stated by the honourable member from
North York, it would be absurd to bave legislation remain on the Statute Book if tbe
Government of the day do noV believe in it,
and evidently they do not. Tberefore I do
noV oppose the present Bill. But I should
have Iiked the Government to Vell us why
they do not believe in the legislation now
sought to be repealed, especially in view of
the faet tbat when it was being enacted members of the present Administration supported it.
Bon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
My rigbt
honourable friend suggests that the Government should have given its reasons for the
repeal of that legisiation.. But the Government took no action in the matter: the Bill
before us cornes froin a private meniber of
the Bouse of Commons. As the bonourable
gentleman from North York (Bon. Sir Allen
Ayleswortb) 'bas said, tbe Prime Minister
was asked what was the opinion of the Government witb respect to tbe measure, and he
answered that as he bad bis own Council Vo
advise him, and bad at bhis elbow alI the
experts in the departments, hie did not deem
it proper Vo appoint an eco'nomic council.
I make this staternent simply to free myseif
and the GovernmenV of responsibility for tbe
statement wbicb appears on Vbe page opposite
the Bill.
Tbe situation confronting us remindg me
of a statement made by Mr. Josephi Chamberlain to the late Sir George Ross, who, was

is that the legislation of the last Parliament
is not respected by this one, and is not
deemed Vo be "national legislation."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: W'ith ail
respect, I would point this out. Though this
Bill was introduced in the other House by
a private member it did not affect private
legisiation at al] but repealed a public Act.
Therefore the Government had Vo take a
position upon it. and what may be described
as reasons for the position taken, however
weighty they may be, or however unimportant, were advanced by the Prime Minister.
But they are not addressed Vo us. We are
addressed in child's talk.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was noV the
Government that drafted the Bill or the
reasons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But the
Government must he responsihie for the
reasons in respect of the repeal of a public
measure; therefore I eaul attention to the
danger the Government get into when they
permit, recognize and sanction the repeal
of a public measure, which was a Government Bill, at the instance of a private member. There is this further to be remembered:
the moral that the honourable member d'raws,
which appears Vo give somne menit Vo the
system of discard.ing legislation objected to
before the defeat of a government at an
election, d.oes not apply in the present case.
This measure met with no. objection from
any party. Further, I venture this piece of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

information: one of its main sponsors,
if not its main sponsor, was a most distinguished, useful and honoured servant of
Canada who happens to have beein appo-inted
by the leader of the present Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
attention to this fact. We used Vo receive
from the House of Gommons bis whieh gave
us no inkling of the reason why they were
introduced. Some of them amended sections
of an Act by .striking out or adding a
few words here and there, and no ordinary
member could find out the meaning of the
changes without calling for the statute to be
amended and ascertaining where the words
were to be eliminated or added. It was the
Senate of Canada wbo decided that the
practice should be altered and that bis
originating in either Chamber should contain
reasons and explanations, and the text of the
clause to be amended, so that every member
could see at once what was to be effected.
My purpose in rising was simply to say that
any private member can introduce a Bill to
amend government legisiation, and I believeI stand to be corrected if I arn wrong-the
member who takes siich action is the one who
hears full responsihility for the drafting of
the Bill and for the explanations accompanying
it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not after the
]3i11 passes the other Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn not so sure
about that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure, honourable members, to adopt the
motion for the second reading of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It appears to me
that it might be a gond idea to allow the
motion to stand over until to-morrow, so that
the sponsor of the Bill may have an opportunity to read this discussion. H1e might have
something Vo say.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He cannot say
it to us.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: The honourable gentleman mean.s the sponsor in this House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, I beg
pardon. I thought he meant the sponsor in
the other House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the
honourabie senator move to postpone the
second reading?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes.

MARCH 23, 1936
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Senator Robinson that the debate be
adjourned until to-morrow. Are you ready for
the question?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think My
honourable friend fromn the East (Hon. Mr.
Robinson) is up to his aid tricks again and is
perpetrating a jake on us. It seems to me
very clear that nobody objects to the passage
of this Bill, but everybody in either House is
agreeable to it. Thon why postpone it for
another day to see if something may flot turn
up? I think my honourable friend would be
well advised to wait for another B&11 on whicb
ta mave the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourablé members, I arn always prepared to take the advice
of the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mir. Graham). 1 suggested
a pastponement only out of deference ta the
honourable gentleman from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Ayleswarth), who, I thought, might
like ta make same comments, and would
appreciate an opportunity te, read the discussion. I think there is a great deal of
legislation that ought ta ho repealod.

The motion for the second reading of the
Bill was agreod ta, and the Bill was read the

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:- Honourable members, I would suggest that there is

think the House will need much explanation
of this measuro, becauso it is exactly along the
linos of previaus bills that were passod in bath
Houses, more ospecially in 1933-34. Tho Bill
incorporates a company ta go into the business of londing monoy ta the public. A most
important part of sucb bills, as a rule, is that

govorning the charges that can be made, or
the rate of interest. As honourablo sonators
know, this is covered by general logislatian,
under the Intorest Act, the Money Lenders
Act and the Loan Companies Act, especially
as ampnded in 1934. If second reading is
given ta the Bill I should like ta have it
referred ta the Standing Committee an Bankimg and Commerce, where it would ho
thoroughly explainod.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members of the Sonate, during the last few
years--the period may extend back oight or
ton years, for the years pasa very rapidlywe have incorporated a certain number of
similar societies or companios, whose objoct
is the lending of money under certain safeguards or restrictions. I understand that one
or perhaps two such companies will seek
amondments ta their charters this session. Sa
far as Canada is concerned, such legislation as
this is experimental; but I believe there has
boon a longer exporience with it in the United
States. I think the Banking and Commerce
Committee will have ta give some study ta
the whole question of how this past legislation bas worked, and that may influence the
committee ini dealing with the present Bill. I
do not abject ta the second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honaurable
members, I do flot întend ta abject ta the
second reading either. I know that in previaus
years measures have been passed somewhat
parallel ta this, but whether or not the feature
ta which I naw caîl attention is the samne in
those previaus measuros I arn not certain. It
appoars that there is need for this class of
campany. At ail events, legislation of the
more advanced cauntries of the world seems
ta provide for it. The ossential feature would
seom ta me ta ho that the company ho compelled ta make plain ta its customers exactly
what they are paying, and that the Bill prevent
any device or subterfuge that covors up the
real cost of the borrowing. I thought 1 found
in some of the terrns of this Bill expressions
which. wouId make it possible for that cost
ta ho somewhat misunderstood by the barrower. While I consent ta the giving of
the second reading, I do not want it understaod that with respect ta this feature I amn
in agreement.
It would seemn ta me that the time bas
camne when we might have a general measure.
Wl»' a soparate bill should ho required for
e-very finance company wanting ta make
these small loans is a inystery. It is true
that up ta naw it fias always been necessary ta, have a bill in each case. I have the

impression, though in this I may be wrong,
that in relation to a measure to come this
session fro'm a company which has been
doing business for ýmany years a proposal has been made that there be a general
eonactment, and its terms have already
been discussed with the Superintendent of
Insurance. If this is so, we should wait for
that general measure, and if it is passed all
such bills as this could come within its
ambit. The second reading of the present
Bill may as well pass; but I fancy that if a
general measure is to come before us the
Committee on Banking and Commerce would
be wise to defer its consideration of this
Bill, and of two others which I understand
are to come, until we know whether or not
there is to be a framework covering all
legislation like this.

corporating companies to do that' kind of
thing. I submit we are on dangerous ground
every time we pass a bill like this which
provides that certain Acts passed for the
general benefit of money borrowers shall not
apply. I do not agree with the principle of
this Bill at all, and I personally object to
the second reading.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Honourable members,
I object to this Bill and to the principle
underlying it. In our city we have many of
these finance companies, and they are giving
us a tremendous amount of trouble. Any
bill which says that the Interest Act, the
Money Lenders Act and the Loan Companies
Act shall not apply, or that parts of them
shall not apply, is a dangerous piece of
legislation. I know nothing about the Senate,
nor how the Sonate works or thinks. I am
not a member of the Banking and Commerce
Committee. and so have not a chance to
express these views there.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 12, an Act respecting the
Toronto Harbour Commissioners.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Any senator
can attend meetings of the committee and
express his views, but if he is not a member of the committee he cannot vote.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am net on the committee and have not the same opportunity
there that I have here. I object to the principle of this Bill, and I intend so long as I
am a member of this House to oppose the
principle underlying bills of this kind. If
the right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) can bring in a
general measure covering not only companies
that seek incorporation, but those already
doing business, it will be a good thing. I
can cite case after case, in my own province,
of people on salaries who borrow money and
are charged a high rate of interest. The
companies cannot charge more than 12 per
cent, but they make the rate as high as they
can.
They deduct part of the principal
money as interest, they have fees for inspection, then they re-inspect and charge fees
again, and they also im,pose fees for legal
work, and so on. until the borrowers are
harassed from pillar to post. We as a legislative body should not pass legislation inRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

NOTICE

OF

ANNUITIES
'IOTION

Honourable senaHon. F. B. BLACK:
tors, I give notice that on Thursday next I
shah move:
That a special committee be appointed to
consider and report upon the operation of the
Government Annuities Act, being chapter
seven of the Revised Statutes of Canada, and
to nake recommendations with respect to the
desirability of extending or eurtailing such
operation; with power to send for persons,
papers and records.
I should like to state some reasons, which
I think might appeal to honourable members,
as to why I am giving this notice of motion.
The Government Annuities Act was passed
originally in 1909, the Bill having been in-

MARCH 24, 193~6
troduced into this House by Sir Richard
Cartwright.
ýIt was amended, 1 think in
1931, by a Bill initiated in 'this House, but
that amendment provided only for reducing
the maximum amount of an annuity that
could be purchased from $5,000 to $1,200.
Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAND:
I would draw
my honourable friend's attention to the fact
that bie is 110W speaking to a notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Perbaps I had better
postpone my remarks, but I thought the
reasons why I am giving this notice might
be pertinent now. I am prepared to speak
now or on Thursday, as the House desires.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND - The difficulty
i-s that no one can understand the honourab'le gentleman's explanation as cleariy as
hie could if we had the motion bef'ore us.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:
Very well. I will
postpone tny remarks until Thursday.

TORONTO HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS'
BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. ]RAOUL DANDURAND moVed the
second reading of Bill 12, an Act respecting
the Toronto Harbour Commisioners.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple Bill. Its purpose is to amcnd
section 20 of the Toronto Harbour Commissioners' Act, 1911. Dourbt bias been expressed
whether this section gives the Harbour Coinmissioners authority to issue new debentures
to meet niaturing obligations. The Government of Canada not having guaranteed the
outstanding debentures, the proposed amendment interests directiy on'ly the Toronto
Harbour Commîssioners and the City of
Toronto. Those two authorities have been
advised that it would be better to pass a
declaratory 'Act affirming the Ha.rbour Coinmissioners' riýght to, issue debentures to pay
off and redeem outstanding debentures before
or at m.aturity. The amending section reads:

53

2. lt is hereby declared that the powers
gýranted to The Toronto Harbour Commissioners by section twenty of The Toronto
Harbour Commissioners' Act, 1911, chapter
twenty-six of the statutes of 1911, bave alwayg
included and do include the power to borrow
money froým time to time for the purpose of
paying off and redeeming in aceordance wiýth
the ternis thereof debentures from time to,
time issued by Ile Toronto Harbour Commissi oners pursuant to, the provisions of the said
Act either st the maturity thereof or at such
earlier date as such dehentures or any of them
may become or be made payable, in accordance
with the provisions thereof; and have al'ways
included and do include power te issue debentures for *money so borrowed.
This clause was drafted by the attorneys
for the Harbour Commissioners and the City
of Toronto. It has been suggested that it
migh-t well be clarified, and when the Bill
is in committee a substitute clause will be
offered. more in coniformity with the proper
legal phraseology.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN:
The
honourable leader of the Governmen-t bas
stated that it is intended to reword the
operative clause of this Bill. Plainly it is
subject to the very samne defect as was in the
original clause, which failed to provide that
on *maturity of the whole or part of a loan.
a new boan might be effected for refunding
purposes. This Bill does not provide that on
maturity of this new loan it may be repaid
by means of ano-ther issue. As we ail know,
borrowing in these days :is done with the
intention. not of repayment, but of renewal,
and provision should 'be made accordingly.
. While I amn on my feet let me make this
suggestion to the House in general and to
the honourable leader of the Governmen-t in
particular. I have read over the operative
clause of the Act, and reaily in point of
draughtsmanship it is a masterpiece of ina-ptitude.
One can hardly conceive of a
clause being drafted in this form:
(2) The principal and interest of the sumo
of money which may be borrowed under this
section shall be a charge on the revenue anising fromt the rentai,
and so on. Then the subsection continues:
-and other lawful charges upon the said
income shall be as foliowvs:
(a) The payment of ail expenses incurred
ithe collection of the sanie....
(b) The defraying the expenses of keeping
'.he harbour clean....
(c) The pay'ment of interest due on ail sumns
of moniey borrowed....
(d) Providing a sinking fund for paying off
the principal of ai sums borrowed. ...
It wihl be ob.scrved that paragraphs (c) and
(d) cover exactly charges already included in
the first part of sub-clause 2, yet describe them
as "other lawful charges." This might, b.

called te the attention of the Parliamentary
Counsel of the Senate and a more extensive
amendment made, for the wording of the
original clause is utterly absurd.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Our attention is
directed simply to clause 2.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am under the
impression that legislation which will come
before us touching the administration of our
ports will tend to modify or suppress all these
clauses concerning harbour commissions; so
the matter is of little consequence.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I understand that
this all relates to Ontario. What about provincial rights?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They do net
include harbours.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Bottoms of rivers
and lakes do net belong te the provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The management of the harbours is federal. Does Toronto
harbour come under the new legislation? I
am net certain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, it does net.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hardly
thought so. Consequently it might be worth
our while to make some sort of sightly specimen of this clause. when we are at the job.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; Toronto
pays its way.

CANADA-UNITED STATES TRADE
AGREEMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and the United States of America.
He said: Honourable members of the
Senate, I must admit that I did not think I
should live long enough to have the privilege
of introducing such a Bill in this Chamber.
I had taken an active part in the elections of
1911 in the endeavour to obtain the country's endorsation of the trade convention of
that year. I confess that to this day I have
retained a feeling of grievance towards my
then opponents, who carried the day and
defeated reciprocity, for having rejected the
very great advantage that would have accrued
to Canada from the expansion of its trade
with the United States under such an agreement.

55

I was very close to public men who had
lived under the 'Reciprocity Treaty of 1854-66,
and I had occasion to notice that those who
had entered public life prior to Confederation,
and had enjoyed the advantages of that
treaty, were most ardent in their desire to
have it resurrected. That desire was general
throughout the country. We had no Western
Provinces at the time, and trade with the
South was concentrated in Ontario, Quebec
and the Maritime Provinces. When I left
college in 1879 I failed to notice any general
dissent on the question of reciprocity. The
Reciprocity Treaty of 1854-66 had brought
very great prosperity to Canada. It may be
urged that that prosperity was due in part
to the fact that the War of Secession had
to a considerable extent increased the need of
the United States for our products.
That treaty was denounced by the United
States in 1866. The reason given was that
we had altered our tariff in 1859 and imposed
duties on manufactured goods, and so changed
the conditions. As a matter of fact, throughout perhaps the whole duration of the treaty,
from 1854 to 1866, we sold to the United
States nineteen-twentieths of our goods and
bought from then one-twentieth of theirs.
This was deemed to have been the ground
for the denunciation of the treaty; and I
think it has been affirmed by historians.
But another reason was advanced for the
denunciation: the attitude of the Anglo-Saxon
world towards the Northern cause. Was this
the result of a lingering rancour in the breasts
of Anglo-Saxons at the violent separation of
1775-2? At all events there was an expressed dissatisfaction in the United States at
our apparent indifference to the success of
the North, although thousands of Canadians
had volunteered for service in the Northern
army. I have in my time met dozens of men
who had been in the Federal forces throughout
the war. Hundreds of Canadians were on
the pension list of the United States. I
recall one who served as Clerk of the
Senate for a number of years, Major Samuel
E. St. Onge Chapleau, who had enlisted in
the Northern army under the name of his
mother, St. Onge, and had received promotion and ultimately become a major in the
Northern forces. I recall an old friend of
mine, a judge of the Superior Court of Montreal, Mr. Justice St. Pierre, who alse went
through the Civil War. So there had been
considerable enlistment of Canadian volunteers in the Federal army. Yet undoubtedly
the United States felt that the Anglo-Saxon
world had not shown any active sympathy
for the Northern cause.

SENATE

56

Be that as it may, we were faced with
denunciation of the treaty. Sir John A. Macdonald during the whole of his career strove
to restore our trade relations with the United
States that had prevailed between 1854 and
1866. He sent many a delegation to the
United States on that errand, but to no avail.
In 1874 the Mackenzie Government sent
Hon. George Brown to Washington. He
succeeded in negotiating a treaty, but it was
rejected by the United States Senate.
In 1879 Sir John A. Macdonald introduced
his National Policy, and, through his Minister
of Finance, ho inserted in the Customs and
Excise Act a standing offer to the United
States. It is clause 6 in Chapter 15 of the
Statutes of 1879, and runs as follows:
Any or all off the following articles,-that is
to say: animals of all kinds, green fruit, hay,
straw, bran, seeds of all kinds, vegetables
(including potatoes and other roots). plants,
trees and shrubs, coal and coke, salt, hops,
wheat, peas and beans, barley, rye, oats, Indian
corn, buckwheat and all other grain, flour of
wheat and flour of rye, Indian meal and oatmeal, and flour or meal of any other grain,
butter, cheese, fish (salted or smoked), lard,
tallow, meats (fresh, salted or smoked), and
lumber, may be imported into Canada free of
duty, or at a less rate of duty than is
provided by this Act, upon Proclamation of
the Governor in Council, which may be issued
whenever it appears to his satisfaction that
similar articles fron Canada mray be imported
into the United States free of duty, or at a
rate of duty not exceeding that payable on
the same under such proclamation when
imported into Canada.
This standing offer remained in force until
around 1888 or 1889. We had to wait until
1891 to bring the matter squarely before the
people of Canada. The United States tariff
had been raised to a considerable degree, and
the farmers of Ontario, Quebec and the East
were suffering greatly as a result. Sir Richard
Cartwright, who felt that the United States
would never grant us reciproeity in natural
products unless there was a large measure of
reciprocity in manufactured products, succeeded
in having the Liberal party committed ta the
policy of unrestricted or unlimited reciprocity.
Sir John A. Macdonald felt that this brought
about a very dangerous situation, for the
humour of the old provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, and of the Maritimes, seemed to indicate that such a policy, radical as it was, would
be adopted. In January of 1891, or thereabouts, Sir John had the House dissolved,
stating he had good reason ta believe that the
Secretary of State of the United States, Mr.
Blaine, would be disposed to discuss reciprocity
in natural products. An election took place,
and Sir John was returned with a majority of
fifteen or twenty on the ground that he inHon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

tended making a proposal to the Washington
authorities, in favour of reciprocity in natural
products.
Mr. Bjaine, however, had not waited for the
election, and in a letter which he wrote to a
member from Massachusetts or New York
State the assertion made by Sir John A. Macdonald was repudiated. Sir John then sent to
Sir Charles Tupper, George
Washington
Eulas Foster, and a third delegate whose name
I forget, and before they would be received by
Mr. Blaine they had to declare that no offer
of reciprocity in natural products had been
made. So there was no commitment nor
negotiation with respect ta reciprocity in 1891.
In 1896 the Laurier Government came into
power. In its convention of 1893 it had
pledged itself to a lowering of the tariff. The
first thing the Government did was to send a
delegation to Washington, headed, I believe,
by the Minister of Finance, Mr. Fielding. But
it was of no avail. When the Laurier Government found that it could make no breach
in the wall that had been raised against our
goods at the American frontier, it turned
towards Great Britain, and although Great
Britain had nothing to offer us reciprocally, a
preference, which gra'dually reached 331 per
cent, was given to British goods entering this
country. The Laurier Government was then
executing its promise of reduced tariffs. As a
consequence the Americans had to reduce the
price of their goods in order to compete with
British goods in this country. Besides this,
there was a reduction of tariff during the
session of 1897.
The next effort was made in 1911. After
a meeting with delegates from the United
States, at which the question had been grappled
with, Sir Wilfrid Laurier declared that there
should be no more pilgrimages ta Washington; and, if I am not mistaken, it was in
1911 that the United States Government decided to send delegates ta Ottawa. Now, on
looking at the agreement of 1911 it will be
seen that it includes all the items which I
have mentioned as being contained in the
standing offer made by Sir John A. Macdonald in 1879. But the 1911 convention
goes much further; it covers a wider range.
Virtually all our natural products are to be
found in it.
I was in the gallery of the House of
Commons when Mr. Fielding brought in his
convention, and I saw an extraordinary
spectacle. Mr. Fielding was a master tactician. He was proceeding slowly through the
whole gamut of ou-r natural products on
w'hich he was obtaining reductions. Members on the opposition side could hardly bide

MARCH 25, 1936
their time, -and one after another kept jumping up to ask whether certain articles in
which -they were interested came under the
treaty. It was acclaimed by both sides of
the House. That is what 1 saw with my own
eyes in 1911.
What happ.ened to alter the opinion of the
memnbers of the Conservative party at that
time? I shall not go deeply into the reasons
which actuated them. 0f course they used
every argument that presertted itself against
the treaty of 1911. One of the main objections was that the direction of trade would
be north and south, whereas our Tailways had
been. built to carry goods from west to east
and from east to west. Another argument
much used at that time-one which was
employed by my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) with sufficient
eifect to secure bis election to the House of
Commons, and which he used for many years
afterwards-was that the arrangement was
unstable, that it could be annulled at a few
months' notice, and thus would be brought
about a dislocation of our trade. It was
alleged also that such a strong movement of
goods between the two countries gave rise to
danger of the developinent, of a pro-Amenican movement in Canada.
The first argument, namnely, that, our railways would suifer by reason of an increase of
trade between the United States and Canada, has, I surmise, long since been exploded,
because the years during which trade between
the Uniited States and Canada was the greatest were the years during which our railway
returns were the largest.
The second reason advanced, namely, that
an abrupt cancellation would disrupt otir
trade, was one that 1 recognized. My right
honourable friend said, "If such a convent~ion
lasted for ten years, with business moving
north and south., jugt imagine what a calamity it would be for Canada should that movement suddenly stop." 1, have always realized
the danger that resuitg from a diislocation of
business, but I would draw my right honourable friend's attention to the fajet that in our
relations with the UJnited States we have had
many a shock from the sudden raising of
the American tariff te, a very high level.
My friends from the West, who have witnessed the loas of their markets through the
raising of the Ame-rican tariff, have feit that
jerk and suiffered froma that loss. So the
eifect of dislocation, which my righit honourable friend predicted as a resuit of a convention. is sometihing with which we are very
familiar.
The third reason, the fear that a movement
towards annexation to the United States
would resuit fromn reciprocal relations with

57

that country, I have always feit to be an
insult to our manhood. I neyer could think
for a moment that our hearts would become
disloyal, or that we would ship .them with
our potatoes across the frontier. I would
point out to my honourable colleagues that
I have neyer heard of any movement for a
change of political statua or political allegiance
when the people were happy.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Except in '48.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend to my lef t says, "'Exce.pt in 1848," but
the people were unhappy at that time, for
reasons which he knows. It is true that the
most prominent names in Montreal-and I
arn not sure that I should not also say in
Toronto-were signed to the annexation
proclamation in 1848-49.
Now, these were the three main rea.sons
-if there were others, my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) will remember them-which were given for the rejection
of the convention of 1911. 1 do not intend
te place on Hansard the extensive list of
advantages that Canada would hafve reaped
under that convention. Such a list would
whet the appetite of ail our rural population.
Lt went far beyond. what Sir John A. Macdonald would have accept-ed under his standing offer, and far beyond the most optimistic
aspirations of the coun'try. Yet, there it was.
1 see on that list: cattie, horses, sheep, swine,
poultry, wheat, rye, oats, barley, huckwheat,
beans, peas, potatoes, corn, sweet potatoes,
yams, turnips, cabbages, onions, all other
vegetables in their natural state, fresh fruits,
dried fruits, butter, cheese, fresh milk, fresh
cream, eggs, fioney, garden, field and other
seeds, grass seed, flax seed, cotton seed and
other oul seeds, hay, stroew, and so forth. All
that was rejected in 1911. This will explain
why I have neyer feit very friendly-I do not
mean in my social or personal rebatons-towards those responsible for 'bninging about that
rejection. I have always felt some rancour
because that extraordinary convention of 1911
had been rejected by my friends of the Conservative party.
The present agreement has a very important preface, which is to be f ound in the offer
of reciprocity made by the late Govern.ment,
through its Minister at Washington, to the
United States Government, under date of
November 14, 1934. It contains a general
staýtement as t0 the economnic situation between the two countries. And then the
Canadian Minister says:
I arn authorized tb put f orward- the following outline as, a sui-table basis for the negotiation of a trade agreement:
(a) A mutual undertaking to maintain
during the life-time of the agreement the

58

SENATE

unrestricted free entry of commodities now on
the free list of either country.
I think that has been done under this present
convention.
(b) The mutual concession of tariff treatment as favourable as that accorded to any
other foreign country; this means that Canada
would extend to the United States its intermediate tariff, involving reductions from the
present rates of duty on some 700 items, including
both
natural
and manufactured
products, together with a number of further
reductions below the intermediate tariff rates
through the extension to the United States of
concessions made by Canada in trade conventions with foreign countries.
(c) The reduction by 50 per cent of the
existing United States rates of duty, as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1934, on a specified
number off natural products, including inter
alia, lumber, fish, potatoes, milk and cream,
and live cattle; a number of other agricultural products, and several minerais both
metallie and non-metallie.

honourable gentleman whether that bas been

of 1934, on a specified number of natural

potatoes, milk and cream, and live cattle; a
number of other agricultural products, and
several minerals both metallie and nonmetallic."

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the difficulties of to-day spring from the sins committed in the past, especially in 1911.
(d) The reduction of the existing rates of
duty by the United States on a number of
partly or wholly manufactured products of
Canada,
including some processed natural
products and certain products in which hydroelectrie power comprises an important element
in the cost of production.
(e) The reduction of the existing rates of
duty by Canada on a number of natural and
partly or wholly manufactured products of
the United States.
Well, when I read that offer by the gentlemen who in 1911 rejected the Reciprocity
Treaty, I felt that circumstances had altered
considerably, for the Conservative party had
at last gone to Canossa; and I wondered what
the eighteen so-called Liberal magnates of
Toronto, manoeuvred by Clifford Sifton, must
have been thinking of the late Government
when, in October, 1935, it was ready to enter
into negotiations with the United States not
only to exchange natural, products but also
to reduce the duties on seven hundred articles.
Those of the eighteen who have gone beyond
must have turned in their graves when they
heard that proposal made by their associates
of 1911.
The present trade agreement is partly in
force, under the authority given by Parliament to the Governor in Council. Under the
Trade Agreement Act of the United States
the President's treaty-making authority is
limited: for instance, the terin of any trade
agreement must not exceed three years, there
can he no tariff reduction beyond 50 per
cent, and no dutiable commoditios can be put
on the free list. It is aiso the fixed policy of
the United States that any trade agreement
must be based upon an exchange of mostfavoured-nation treatment. The late Government of Canada made its offer of Noveniber,
1934, within the framework of that Trade
Agreement Act. The present agreement is
on the same lines. Considerable work had
been dono by the officials of the various departments at the instance of the late Government, and this work was utilized by the new
Administration and was a help to the present
Prime Minister.
Of course, this agreement is nothing like
the agreement of 1911.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

That

oppor-

tunity was missed, and nations, like individuals, often pay for their errors and aiso
for their sins. Our manufacturers opposed the
convention of 1911, although for the most

MARCH 25, 1936
part their interests were not affected. Doubtless to-day they would favour it, but you cannot turn back the wheel of time.
In 1913 I was asked by Sir Wilfrid Laurier
to suggest to President Woodrow Wilson,
whom I was shortly to meet, that the convention of 1911 be allowed to remain on the
Statute Book of the United States, if his
tariff policy was in agreement with that convention, because Sir Wilfrid intended to submit it anew to the people of Canada at the
next election.
Sir Wilfrid was defeated in 1911 on the
reciprocity issue in certain constituencies; in
others, particularly in Quebec, the "Laurier
Navy" played the major role in favour of
his opponents. Now, Sir Wilfrid made an
error when in 1911 he advised dissolution.
One is always wiser after the event, but I
am confident that if he had contented himself
with submitting the convention to a referendum, two-thirds of the electorate would have
voted for it.
In 1923, at the instance of the late Mr.
Fielding, a standing offer to the United States
for a trade agreement was placed on the
Statute Book, and in 1931 it was enlarged by
the Bennett Government.
I realize that both countries may criticize
this agreement from various angles, and it is
being criticized; but in this country the
criticism comes mainly from the official
Opposition in the other Chamber. I have
yet to hear of any pronounced opposition to
the treaty generally throughout the country.
That there should be opposition here and
there would not surprise me at all. You cannot negotiate such a convention without
affecting to some degree certain vested interests
that have enjoyed generous tariff protection.
A reduction in prtection means keener competition, and naturally those vested interests
strenuously object to the slightest reduction
in tariff.
I draw the attention of this Chamber to the
fact that the present Government was to a
certain extent hampered by the Ottawa Agreements. It could not, for instance, offer concessions on anthracite coal, Indian corn, canned
fruits, dried currants, raisins and other commodities.
We might discuss for days and weeks the
advantages or disadvantages of this convention,
but it covers such a number of articles that
I believe some time must elapse before its
effect can be fully understood and appreciated.
Our intermediate tariff can be modified by
Parliament to permit of reasonable adjustments.
Our general tariff and our intermediate have
been raised considerably since 1930; and in
many instances there is only a slight margin

between them. I am speaking generally.
There is, I submit, fair protection under eur
intermediate tariff against all foreign countries,
including countries highly industrialized and
having standards of living much below those
prevailing in the United States. Since 1930
our people have deemed the tariff too high.
It is now brought down somewhat.
This convention, I think, is intended to
give advantages to both countries, and it is
hoped that if within the next three years
this proves to be its effect, it may be
broadened in scope.
The agreement safeguards items now on the
free list. Some of them were seriously threatened. As our general tariff was operating
mainly against the United States, it was an
added incentive for them to retaliate. For
instance, the newsprint industry, which provides a large volume of our export products,
was seriously menaced, for various reasons.
The United States have now a two-column
tariff. Canada enjoyed the lower rate for a
given time. It was to expire on the lst of
January, if I am not mistaken. It has been
continued for two or three months. We stood
to lose that lower rate if we had no agreement.
The most-favoured-nation treatment assures
us the lower rate. To show how imminent was
that danger, I may point out that Germany
withdrew the most-favoured-nation treatment
which it had given the United States, and the
United States promptly retorted by transferring German goods to the general tariff. This
indicates what an incentive there was for the
Canadian Government to accept the convention as it is.
It will be noted that the United States have
allowed their nationals to take $100 worth of
Canadian goods into the United States free of
duty. We have reciprocated by allowing Canadians to bring in $100 worth of American goods.
We have also granted the United States the
right of transhipment of goods coming from
other countries. For a long time the United
States have been threatening to retaliate if we
did not alter the situation in that respect. It
has been established, I believe, that it is to our
advantage to give them that concession. They
would have secured the same advantage from
the granting of the most-favoured-nation
treatment, because from the moment they have
the benefit of that treatment, ipso facto he
stipulation as to direct shipment ceases. The
transhipment privileges in this agreement
would likewise have been granted to the
United States under the off er made by the
late Government.
The privileges given to the United States
does not apply to our tariff arrangements with
Great Britain. In order to secure the benefit
of the British preferential rates it is necessary
to make direct shipment to our ports.

60

SENATE

I wish to place on Hansard an analysis of
concessions granted to Canada, based on
United States imports from Canada for the
calendar year 1929, but before doing so shall
give a summary of the main provisions of
the treaty.
Article 2 provides for most-favoured-nation
treatment in regard to import and export
restrictions; in the event of quantitative restrictions, quotas, et cetera, a qu'antity of
restricted goods equivalent to the proportion
enjoyed in a previous representative period
shall be allocated to the exporting country.
In article 3 Canada fixes maximum rates
of duty on imports from the United States
in relation to items enumerated in schedule
I to the agreement.
In article 4 the United States fixes maximum rates of duty on imports from Canada
in relation to items enumerated in schedule
II to the agreement.
Under 'article 5 each country may impose
on imports from the other a tax equivalent
to any internal tax levied on domestic produots of like nature.
Article 6 provides that internal taxes on
imported articles shall be no higher than those
levied on like articles of national origin or
any other foreign origin.
Article 7 provides that no quantitative
control shall be applied by either country
with respect to the goods of the other, except
as specifically provided for in, schedules I and
II; that regulations for control of markets
applied to domestic products shall apply
equally to goods imported from the other;
that all changes must await thirty days'
notice, after which, though no agreement has
been reached, change may be made; and
that when such action is taken, the other
country may, within fifteen days, give thirty
days' notice of termin.ating the entire agreenent.
In article 8 each country promises fair
and equitable treatment to goods of the other
in the event of a national monopoly over any
product.
Under anticle 9. if either country adopts
control of exchange, the other will be granted
an allotment based on a previous representative period. Sympathetie consideration will
be given any representations of the other in
this respect.
Under article 10, in the event of a wide
variation in exchange rates between the two
countries, either may propose modification of
the agreement, and failing agreement within
thirty days, may terminate the agreement in
its entirety on thirty days' notice.
Under article 11, in the event of either
country enacting any measure deemed as
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

nul'lifying or impairing objectives of the agreement, provision is made for friendly negotiation and consideration by a joint committee of experts.
Article 12 provides that the agreement
shall net preclude regulation of exports
and imports of gold and silver; regulation
of trade in arms; and regulation imposed on
moral or humanitarian grounds, or designed to
protect human, animal or plant life, or 'relating
to prison-made goods, enforcement of police
or revenue laws, or unfair or fraudulent practices.
Article 13 provides that only the mostfavoured-nation clause of the agreement applies to the Philippines, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. None of the concessions apply to the Panama Canal Zone,
and the agreement is net to apply te concessions between (1) United States, Cuba,
Philippines, the Panama Canal Zone and (2)
British Empire countries.
Under article 14, any concession may be
withdrawn or subjected to quantitative restriction if through extension to a third country such country obtains the major benefit,
and undue increase in importation from such
country takes place. Then there is a provision as to how that difficulty may be settled.
The last article of the agreement provides
that the agreement shall be ratified by His
Majesty.
Accompanying the agreement was a note
given to the Secretary of State of the United
States by the Canadian chargé d'affaires at
Washington, declaring the Canadian Government's intention to amend the Customs Act
in certain particulars, as follows.
1. To change the method of determining
values for duty purposes te eliminate arbitrary
executive interference: (a) value for duty will
not include advance for sefling cost or profit
greater than ordinarily prevails in country
of export; (b) discounts shall not operate to
increase value for duty purposes beyond
ordinary price prevailing at time and place of
shipnent in ordinary trade; (c) in case of
fixed values for duty purposes established
under section 43 of the Customs Act there
shall be an appeal to the Tariff Board; (d)
"class or kind made or produced in Canada"
shall mean "in commercial quantities," and
adequate notice shall be given of proposal to
transfer any goods into this category.
2. Pending legislation, fixed valuations under
section 43 of the Customs Act are abolished
on twenty specified articles.
3. Canada is to allow Canadian visitors to
the United States to
back incidental
purchases up to $100 in value under regulations "substantially equivalent" to those now
in effect in the United States with respect to
Canada.

I am afraid I am wearying the House. I
shall ask leave to place on Hansard an analysis

MARCH 25, 1936
of concessions granted to Canada, based on
United States imports from Canada for the
calendar year 1929, and an outline of the

CONCESSIONS GRANTED TO UNITED STATES ON BASIS OF CANADIAN IMPORTS
It will be noticed that the concessions which
have been granted to the United States in most
cases involve a very substantial benefit to
Canadian producers, because they are on
commodities with respect to which there bas
been for some time past a demand for reduction in duty.
The total imports to which these items have
reference amounted in 1930 to $847,000,000,
and in 1935 to $304,000,000. There are eightysix reductions in duties; seventy-nine are
bound to the present rates, and 15 are
bound to the free list. There are concessions
altogether with regard to 180 different commodities.
Concessions granted by Canada are for the
most part with respect to a number of individual items, while the concessions granted by
the United States te Canada are for the most
part on categories rather than on individual
items.

Our total imports in 1930 were $847,000,000,
and in 1935 they had fallen to $304,000,000.
The eighty-six reductions in duty would have
affected imports
in 1930
amounting to
$123.00,0,000, and in 1935 to $23,000,000. The
seventy-nine bound to the present rates would
have affected imports amounting to $66,000,000
in 1930, and $21,000,000 in 1935. The fifteen
bound to the free list would have affected

Mr. DANDURAND.

imports amounting te $62,000,000 in 1930 and
$32,000,000 in 1935. In other words, the 180
commodities on which concessions have been
granted would have affected imports to the
amount of $251,000,000 in 1930, and to the
amount of $76,000,000 in 1935.
The figures regarding the value of Canadian
inports under various heads are in many cases
open to question as a result of the complexity
of the Canadian tariff. The figures below, for
fiscal years, which were supplied by the Bureau
of Statistics, are quoted only to give an
approximate idea of the relative value of these
items in Canadian import trade.

Under the intermadiete tariff the United
States obtains reductionýs on some, seven
hundred items; she also obtains the minimum
sha could expeet froma a trada agreamant with
Canada. The Canadian note of Novembar
14. 1934, bears that out. Canada will benefit
fromn such reductions of duty as the United
States may grant to other countries, through
the most-favourad-nation clause. She enjoys
the benafit of a reduced duty on 86 items
helow the intarmediata rate, and bas receivad
reductions in respect to 63 items of the
United States tariff in addition to the stabilization of 21 items on the free list.
Unfortunately, because of low prices and
deprassed conditions in the United States, we
were unable to obtain concessions on codfish
and table potatoes.
We were not able to obtain concessions on
grain, hecause the United States is stilI an exporter and fears the effect of a reduction on
pricas in its own markets. Evan a fifty per
cent reduction in existing dutias would have
confarrad no henefit upon our grain growers.
We shaîl have to eweit the tima when tha
United States becomes an importer. A gentleman who bas had considerable to do with
matters governing the whola movement of
wheat in Canada axpressed to me, soma three
years ago, the opinion thet the Northwest
should noV limit the production of wheat, but
on the contrary should increase it, because
within five years the United States would he
an importing nation. At the time I was not

as optimistie as ha was, and I arn awaiting
the completion of the five years to see
whether he was right or wrong.
Ini this convention we have stablilized the
moderate rates of duty charged on our lowgrade wheat and by-products of grain, considerable quantities of which have heen sold
in the United States.
The agreement by the United States to
maintain on the free list 21 items of importance
ta Canadian tradc is most valuable.
It
assures Canadien icaporters that their trade
will not *be interfered with.
The itemis on which reductione appear
below the intermediate tariff wcrc carefully
seleoted so as to benefit the Canadian consumer without injuring Canadian industry.
The agreement, I believe, will make for an
expansion of trade. Canadian industries are
on a better competitive basis hy reason of
reduced rates oun machinery and implements
of production. Canada reteins ber freedoma
to adjust the rates of the intermediate tariff
on ail items not included ini, schedulc 1 of the

mitments of Canada to the United States
are chiefly for the purpose of eliminating
arbitrary executive interference with the
normal course of trade. Abnormal situations
can be fully met by our Anti-dumping Act.
As J have stated in the course of my
rema'rks, the convention can' be assailed from
various angles. We have before us the offer
of the late Government to negotiate on
certain lines. If every item mentioned in
its offer is examined in the light of what
has now been secured, it will be found that
we have fairly adhered to the line which the
late Government was taking. It naturally
was asking the maximum it could hope to
attain. and was offering, perhaps, a little less
tahan it expected to have to give. That is
natural in all bargaining. When you are
about to bargain with a foreign country you
do not ask for less than you hope to get.
The first months of the application of this
treaty have not shown that Canada has the
worse of the agreement. What will happen
to-morrow or the day after, it is-difficult to
say. We must test the agreement by applying it. It is my hope that the two countries
will find it mutually advantageous.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: Honourable senators, the treaty which is sought
to be ratified by this Bild may be a good
treaty or a poor one. If it is a poor treaty
ià should be defeated; but, obviously, the
place where it should be defeated is not this
House, the second Chamber of our legislative
organization. Throughout the history of our
country we have always regarded matters of
tariff and of taxation as subjects peculiarly
within the determination of the direct and
elected representatives of the people. Though
we have asserted, and in my judgment have
been undoubtedly within our legal riglit in
asserting, that our power is unlimited with
respect to all such matters, except as to
their initiation, still we do not feel it at all
appropriate that we should be a determining
body as to any measure within these two
spheres. Therefore I myself shall not vote
against this Bill. and I shall not ask any
others here who feel as I do about it to vote
in the negative.
I want. though, to discuss the measure, because for all purposes it is wise that we
understand it and come to some conclusions
as to its likely result. So I shall endeavour
to deal with it briefly this afternoon, at the
saine time admitting that the very short
period within which I have been able to
study the subject has net been sufficient to
make me certain of my facts as to the manifold details of the treaty. In this connection
Hlon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

I ask that if I err at any point I be corrected
by the honourable senator opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), who, I know, has lived
with this particular treaty much longer than
I, and is more thoroughly familiar with its
details.
We all, I believe, can cordially say we like
the direction in which the treaty moves.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think that
the world, driven by intense nationalism, one
of the products of the War, has tended to go
much too far in the way of trade restrictions,
and that we are disposed, all of us, to look
with faveur upon practical efforts to bring
about reductions in tariffs, no matter between what countries arrangements may be
made. Nor will I admit that this is net in
every way consistent with the historic policy
and tradition of the party with which, when
in more active public life, I was associated.
I would add this. We have always felt
that in respect of our trade relations with the
United States it was necessary to exercise a
greater degree of caution, to look farther into
the future, than in respect of our trade relations with any other country. The reasons for
that feeling are these. The United States is
a mighty nation, in population more than
twelve times the size of Canada. It is a
nation which as a commercial organization
is in every respect parallel to ours. It produces what we produce, it sells what we sell,
and to a large extent it buys what we buy.
But the proportion of Canada's trade affected
by any reciprocal arrangement is ef necessity enormously greater than the proportion
of United States trade affected by the same
arrangement. The impact of a treaty or of its
denunciation upon us is relatively heavier, and
the results which follow a disturbance of trade
relations between the two countries are vastly
more serious for Canada. The proportion of
United States trade affected by such a dislocation is negligible, while in our case the
proportion is immense and vital. For these
reasons. and because of the history of our
trade relations, we require to be especially
careful as to the consequences and duration
of any arrangement we make.
In the spirit of these axions I approach
a discussion of this treaty. The honourable
senator who has just sat down proceeds upon
the hypothesis that reciprocity with the United
States is something sweet and beautiful and
palatable to all on his side of the House,
but invariably unpalatable and very ugly to
all on this side. He assumes that reciprocity,
no matter what may be the substance making
up the actual facts to which that naine is

MARCH 25, 1936
given, is always good, and he goes on to
laud the treaty-with faint praise, it is true,
relative to that expressed for others which
have gone before-simply because this, like
its predecessors, is denominated "reciprocity."
Well, if one is in favour of vivisection it does
not follow that one wants the whole human
race vivisected. If one is not opposed to the
use of anaesthetics, it does not mean that one
feels we all ought to be anaesthetized all the
time. Reciprocity may be good, well designed
and well executed, or it may be bad, ill
designed and ilil executed.
The honourable gentleman refers to the
treaty of 1854-66, which was suddenly terminated by our great neighbour, undoubtedly
to our dismay at the time; and he thinks
because that termination made us sorry we
must always be eager for any kind of reciprocity, with any country, for all time to
come.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The men of
that time were under that impression.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Likely the
honourable gentleman would have been in
favour of that treaty, and I might have been.
But reciprocity suitable to that time may
not be wise to-day. Then this country was
simply producing natural products. We had
hardly any industrial organization at all. In
this whole Dominion we had scarcely an area
worthy of the name of a fruit area.

65

that we examined closely and critically the
reciprocity proposal of that time. We found
that while there was much we were obtaining
under that proposal, we were giving away
vastly more. We found that a great section
of the southern part of the province of Ontario
would have been desolated, as would have
been a large section of the province of British
Columbia-yea, and of the province of Nova
Scotia-by the mere provision that fruit was
to be admitted free. Here we were, with our
fruits maturing two, three or four weeks later
than the fruits of the United States, and we
had sent word to that country that we would
bind ourselves under the treaty to let our
markets be flooded with American fruits during those two, three or four weeks, to the
obvious and inevitable destruction of a great
industry which was supporting vast numbers
of our people.
The honourable senator
opposite told us not long ago that he would
vote for that, if it came before him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would vote
for the 1911 convention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That he would
vote for free admission of American fruit.
He would not go to British Columbia and
say so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would vote for
the whole convention of 1911.

Nor were we ex-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He would not
go to sbuthern Ontario and say so, nor to
the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
We were
producers of simple natural products in huge
quantities, and a stoppage of the market
which had been established in those products
shook this country to its centre and threatened the very future of this Dominion. When
that occurred, while we were at all times
ready to try to restore the treaty, we set about
adjusting ourselves to conditions which were
forced upon us, and the result of our efforts
over sixty to eighty years is something of
which every Canadian is proud. We are no
longer simply a country producing natural
products; we are no longer mere sellers of
wheat and of raw results of human labour.
We are producers of almost every manufacture known on the North American continent.
Canada is a tremendous industrial country;
smaller, it is true, than our great neighbour,
yet a big exporter to the markets of the
world. Now we have fruit areas and vegetable
areas of vital importance to this Dominion.
This was more or less our position in 1911,
and it was because of the progress we had
made, because of the growth of this country
to the stature of nationhood in every sense,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hon. Mr. Fielding was in favour of it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That treaty
was defeated and cancelled, not merely by
the Conservative party, but by an enormous
majority of the people of Canada. The honourable gentleman likes to revert to that 1911
arrangement and to lament the disaster which
he feels Canada suffered by its defeat. He
apparently thinks it might have been in full
effect to-day. About two years after the
treaty was defeated our West, which in the
main was in favour of it, was craving for it,
at least in part; and the part which the West
especially favoured was that providing for
free admission of its wheat into the United
States. That country placed upon its Statute
Book a standing offer to admit our wheat and
flour free of d.uty if we would give the same
treatment to such products from the United
States. We took up the offer, but the ink
was not dry on our statute when the American
Government cancelled the whole arrangement.
Does the honourable gentleman remember
that? We have not heard anything about free
wheat for nearly twenty years.

Though I do net like to assume the rôle
of prophet, even in the most humble degree,
I must say that I shall not be very much
surprised if this treaty bas a rather short and
sorrowful existence. In fact I see signs of
s dying struggle commencing already. One
af the fifty per cent reductions we do get
ander this treaty is on distilled liquors. By
reason of policies in ogue in Canada for
decades gone by, we have tremendous quantitics of unused, cured, thoroughly seasoned
liquors. the value of whicb runs into scores
of millions. and it is well worth while trying
to arrange a market for these in the country
to the south, if we can do it. This treaty
does contain an item with respect to distilled
liquors, but I wish the bonourable senator
who bas just sat down had, told us some of
the inside facts about what is taking place
He knows them. He knows that
to-day.
responsible officials of that country have
made regulations which when operative-and
they are all but in effect now-will just wipe
out that whole advantage.
One of those regulations stipulates that
any citizens of this country who are to benefit by tihat phase of the treaty, instead of
-submitting their conduct in Canada to the
jurisdiction of our own courts, must submit
it to the jurisdiction of United States courts.
Why did the honourable senator not tell us
tvborere his Govxernment stands on that? Is
it going to yield? And if it does not yield,
what will be the consequences? It is likely,
at all events there is a danger, that our first
experience in respect of this measure will be
the very same sort of experience we had in
respect of frce wheat and flour.
The honourable senator says, "In making
this treaty we followed the plan suggested
by the late Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. Bennett. He made an offer, and
we have concluded a treaty along the same
linos. Therefore you should not complain
about it. Your mouths are closed, because
yo were ready to do the same thing." I put
une question, to him. He said Mr. Bennett
offered to give the intermediate tariff and
most-favoured-nation treatment to the United
States in return for certain things. All he
read was tihis-I do not know how much
more there was; I have not the letter before
me-that it was to be in return for the
exercise by the President of the power to
reduce by fifty per cent the duties on certain natural products of Canada; inter alia,
tmerely by way of example, on four or five
classes of goods. They we-re: lumber, fish,
potatoes, milk and cream, and live cattle.
I asked him if the consideration had been
obtained even in respect of those few sugR ghit Hon.

Mlr. NIElGHEN.

gested classes namcd in Mr. Bennett's proposal, and he said. "Partly." That is to say,
we got a part of what was to be our
share of the bargain if Mr. Bennett's offer
had gone through. I tell my honourable
friend we did not. get that share in respect
of a single one of those four or five classes.
We came ne'arest to getting it in relation
to lumber. There is no denying that we
derive advantages with respect to lumber,
but we do not get what was stipulated for by
Mr. Bennett. On some classifications of
lumber there is to be a reduction of fifty
per cent in duty, but this is accompanied
by a new provision, something which was
not required before. that our exports must
net exceed a certain amount in one year.
So I repeat that with respect to lumber we
are not obtaining the consideration for which
Mr. Bennett stipulated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: British Columbia
seems very happy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: British Columbia gets benefits in respect of lumber, no
doubt, but I am arguing as to whether we
got what Mr. Bennett stipulated. We did not.
The honourable gentleman's leader went to
WaSbington and soon convinced the occupant
of the 'White Houite that he was ready to
sign anything, and in a very short time he
came back with a treaty. The Government
feels that because it can write the appellation
"reciproeity" across it, the treaty must be
good. I cannot congratulate the honourable
senator, nor can I congratulate his leader on
being a master of trade agreements. I do not
think he has made a single successful trade
agreement in his political career. There are
things at which be is good, but trade agreements are net included among them.
Now, in respect to fish, I should like to
ippeal to honourable senators from either
coast, British Columbia or the Maritimes.
Have we got very much benefit here in respect
to fish ?
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
sonething of value te British Columbia: there
is a reduction in the rates on halibut, which
would be beneficial to that province. But I
venture to say there is not a representative of
any fish-producing province in Canada who
will assert that the treaty contains anything
of real value to the fishing industry of the
Maritime Provinces. Is there a reduction of
fifty per cent in the duty on cod shipped into
the United States? That would be something
worth while, but it is not there. There is
nothing about coal at all.

MARCH 25, 1936
I will tell my honourable friend something
which is in the treaty: there is a reduction
from two cents to one cent in the duty on
halibut shipped from the United States into
Canada. I do not think there were any
considerable imports when the duty was two
cents a pound, but I am not so confident there
will be none under this lower duty.
In respect of fish there is little of value
to Canada. There is something, but it is
not fifty per cent anywhere, and it applies
only to one section of our country.
Now we come to fruit. Do we get the fifty
per cent reduction which the President himself has power to implement in respect of
fruits sent from Canada to the United States?
We do not. I do not think we get it anywhere. I am not sure whether we get it on
cherries, and if not, we do not get it anywhere.
We get from 25 to 15 cents on
apples. Is that any good? In forty-one of
the forty-seven states of the American Union
apples are grown in commercial quantities
-practically
every variety of apple we can
grow. Can we ship across the line apples
matured later than theirs, against a duty of
15 cents?
Now, what do we give tîhem? We make
very serious concessions in respect of fruit.
I do not know that they are so serious if the
Government maintains the policy of the late
Administration as regards valuation, but if
it does not they are very serious. What was
that policy? It was a policy built upon section 43, I think it is, which enables the
Minister of Inland Revenue, with the approval
of the Governor in Council, to fix valuations
on fruit and to vary them one season as
against another. We all remember how that
so-called "vicious" section was reviled by our
friends opposite, throughout this Dominion.
The wounding finger of scorn was pointed
at it on every platform. It was heralded as
the great example of autocracy and denial
of democratic rights which characterized the
late Administration. It was pictured as the
very insignia of autocracy itself, and thundered against on every platform. I tell the
honourable member that unless the section
is maintained in virtuaily its full effect, he has
made disastrous concessions in respect of
fruit. I am not very much afraid that the
Government will not maintain the section.
They are very different men in office from
what they are out of office.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Most persons
are.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The right
honourable member ought to know; he has
been both in and out.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Several times.
12745-5

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have:
here the finest illustration of political consistency I have ever seen in my political life.
This clause, reviled by one and all of our
friends opposite, damned in their press from
end to end of Canada, is specifically preserved
in every schedule of the fruit list; and they
say it may be exercised to the extent of
80 per cent of its average height in any year
back, I think, to 1931. Valuations for duty
purposes may be raised so long as they do not
exceed 80 per cent of the average as fixed
under this heinous clause. So all my honourable friends really meant in that campaign
of revilement and abuse was that our conduct in fixing valuations was all right if we
had only fixed then as high as 80 per cent.
What I would advise honourable members
opposite to do in this regard is just to follow
in the footsteps of the late Government with
the utmost punctiliousness. If they do they
will not get very far wrong. They can follow up only to 80 per cent under this legislation, but that is closer than they are going
to get in any other respect. They will be 80
per cent right anyway. I would warn them
not to delay the imposition of what they
call "artificial valuations," which they have
undertaken to preserve. Let them not defer
until United States fruit is coming in.
Those valuations should be imposed at least
four weeks before our fruit matures. If
they do not follow in the footsteps of the
late Administration to that extent, then by
this treaty they will have dealt a disastrous
blow to our fruit industry.
We have given a great deal. We have not
got from the United States very much in
return.
They were exceedingly frugal in
their concessions. I do not know that it is
an argument against a treaty to say that
we have given more than we have got. The
only argument which would prevail with
me would be an argument showing that the
balance of value is on the right side for us.
Although the balance of value might be
greater for them than for us, this would not
necessarily imply that the treaty is not good.
If the gain to us is greater than our loss,
then of course the treaty is good for Canada.
The honourable member says time will tell
whether the treaty is good or bad. I am
happy that time is to be allowed to tell.
I am happy there are to be three years in
which we may measure the wisdom and expectations of honourable gentlemen opposite.
I am glad this agreement will not be defeated. I am glad they will have no opportunity
to shed salt tears and lament its defeat. I
am glad the agreement is to be measured by
the sure guide of results and fruits.

SENATE

I ask honourable members now to watch
the operation of this treaty. I ask them particularly to descry how many of the vast
army of unemployed in this country it puts
back to work. The burden of unemployment
grows upon our backs. It is the major difficulty which confronts our country. It is a
baffling and terrible one. Does the honourable member seriously think he is stepping
forward the breadth of a hair to solve it
by this treaty? I venture to tell ,him that in
respect of this problem he is stepping backwards and his difficulties will be greater than
they were before. Already there are industries which are suffering, and as to which
concessions have been asked. There are men
on the streets who had work before the treaty
came into effect. Already the army on relief
has increased because of it, and I do not
know that we have witnessed any good results
te speak of. The honourable member says
the effect of the treaty has been all right
so far. Well, I have not the latest figures.
Perhaps the honourable member could furnish
them to me.

States exports diminished over the whole

$223,555,000; in January, after this treaty was

honourable member note this? While the
world exports of the United States were

of $5,230,000.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In December
we sold to the United States $26.937,000
worth. .In January, after .the treaty went

Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN:
I do not
think so. I know the honourable member
believes he is telling me the fact, but I
cannot believe he is correct. However, we
shall have the figures later. But certainly
that did not apply to the month of January;
the very contrary applied.
I have stated these things, honourable members, merely to impress upon the House that
reciprocity is just of the same nature as any
other bargain between man and man.
It
may be skilfully. ably and fairly executed;
it may be poorly completed and poorly
handled. The bargain may be good, it may
be bad. Certainly we all hope the bargain
is good. Undoubtedly it would be far better
for this world if we had a universal levelling
down of tariffs. But to think that Canada
an export country, Canada a young country,
Canada a debtor country, can itself lead the
world and take responsibility of leadership
on itself-such a thought is pure fantasy.
We have to be oareful in bargains, though
they be in the right direction, for they may
in themselves be disastrous. It is all a matter
of the terms.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I desire to tell
my right honourable friend that our exports
to the United States in February, 1936, showed
an increase of $3,258,000, as compared with
$1,991,000 in the same month a year ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
That has
nothing to do with the question. What I
want to know is, how does our increase or
decrease in exports to the United States,
whichever it is, compare with United States'
exports to us since the treaty went into
effect. That is the only way to judge the
treaty.

MARCH 25, 1936
Hon ourable
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
members, this trade agreement bas been considered at great length on the other side of
the Parliament Buildings, and we bave had
two very good speeches on it in this House
to-day. 1 rise only to, raf or brie4ly to some
features of the agreement as they affect that
portion of Ontario fromn whîch I corne.
Most people will rernember that when this
agreement was made the newspapers supporting tbe Government carried large streamers
telling about the great increase tbat would
follow in tbe price of cattle, and the consequent amount of money that live stock producers would receive under tbe new treaty.
In Ontario we neyer before had sueih a crop
of grain and hay as we had last year. As a
resuit of propaganda virtually ail tbe farmers
bougbt stockers at high prices last faîl and
fed tbemn their grain and bay. Wben tbey
place tbose stockers on the market tbis spring,
unless liva stock prices increasa in the meantime, tbey wilI, in my opinion, be unabie to
realize muai more than tbe money tbey'
borrowed from tbe banks to purchase the
stock.
I may say tic duty on lîve cattle was reduced from tiree to two cents a pound, and
our stock producers ware led to believe tbat
tbey would realize that diffarence of one cent
a pound. Tbe bonourable leader of tbe Government in tbis House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
bas spokan vary eloquently of the treaty.
Well, wbat the liva stock dealers are most
concerned about is the increased size of tbe
cbeque tiey will get wben their stock goes
on the market.
I took the trouble to-day to look over the
files of the Toronto Globe of Marcb 26,' 1935,
and I made a few cxtracts frorn tbe live stock
market report for tic week of last year corresponding to the week wa are now passing
tbrougb. Tbese are the extracts:
Choice weighty steers closed $6.75 to $7.50
per 100 peunds; butchers, $4 to $6 per 100
pounds; good cows, $3.75 to $4.75 per 100
pounds.
Reprasentative sales were given as follows:
15 stears 1,290 pounds,' $7.50 per 100 pounds.
2 steers 1,195 pounde, $6.75 per 100 pounds.
27 steers 1,170 pounds, $6.50 per 100 pounde.
I also made cxtracts fromn the live stock
market report of the Globe of ycstcrday, as
follows:
Choice weighty steers elosed $4.50 to $6 per
100 pounds, w-ith choice heavies up to $6.50;
butchers, $4 to $5.25 per 100 pounde; good
cows, $3.25 to $3.50 per 100 pounds.
Representative sales were given as follows:
13 steers, 1,720 pounds, $6.25 per 100 pounds.
27 eteers, 1,250 pounds, $5.50 per 100 pounds.
25 stears, 1,100 pounds, $.5.25 per 100 pounds.

It will ha found by going tbrough these
figures tbat tbe price of cattie to-day is practically $1 par hundred pound-s lasa tban it was a
year ago this week.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Lcss than
it was?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Yes. I arn in both
cases quoting the live stock market report of
the Toronto Globe. That loss is a matter of
mucb concern to the live stock producers. I
arn vary sorry to observe this reduction,
for 1 sbould like to see the price of cattle going
up. Wc all believed we were going to make
money out of cattle. I think certain of our
people are to some extent responsible for the
declina. I noticed about tbe lst of January,
according to tbe Press in certain parts of the
Dominion, one tra-in-load or more of cattlE
was ready to bie sbipped to the Chicagc
market just as soon as the trade agreement
took affect. Now, the business etbics of a
country are just the saine as those of an individual. I bave always noticed that a successfuI business man neyer broadcasts wbat hie is
going to do, but lets somebody aIse tell
wbat hae bas donc. That news reached tbe
Chicago market. I beliave it had a dapressing
affect. and tiat market bins been dropping
ever since. It is really on account of the
drop in prices in the American markets that
live stock prices in Toronto arc so Iow at thc
present time.

Tiare is anotier feature of tic treaty wbich

3. Yes. By the Board as a whole. Its conclusion was as follows: "On the whole it may
reasonably be concluded that in an area such
as Cultus Lake, where a natural run of
sockeye occurs with a reasonable expectancy
of successful spawning, artificial propagation
for purposes of continuing the run to that
area is unnecessary, and, if producing any
additional results over natural spawning, these
would not appear to be in any way commensurate with the cost.'

GOVERNMENT

ANNUITIES

APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
Hon. F. B. BLACK moved:
That a special committee be appointed to
consider and report upon the operation of the
Government Annuities Act, being chapter
seven of the Revised Statutes of Canada, and
to make recommendations with respect to the
desirability of extending or eurtailing such
operation; with power to send for persons,
papers and records.
He said: Honourable senators, I desire to
call attention to some pertinent facts which
I consider important to Canada and of particular ýinterest to the Senate, which has
always taken a great interest in Dominion

for the Government of Canada, and was a
wise provision for those people who desired
and were able to take advantage of it, is, I
think, obvious. While money was costing
Canada from 41 per cent to 6 per cent it
wa.s good business for our own citizens to
deposit their money with the Government,
and for the Government to take care of it
for them and give them an annuity or a
lump sum later on; but as the value of

changed, and to-day they are entirely different. The result of the activities under this
legislation for the first twenty-five years was
that small amounts were taken out, at first
totalling less than a million a year, but later
increasing to $2,000,000 annually. I do not
want to weary the House with figures, but

shall give just a few to show what I have
in mind. In 1931-32 there were taken out
in annuities $4,104,000.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What does the
honourable gentleman mean by "taken out
in annuities?" Is that the amount of the
annuities or the amount of premiums paid
in?
The amount subHon. Mr. BLACK:
scribed to.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Still I am in
doubt. Is that the total of premiums?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No. That is the total
amount of the annuities bought in the year.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The total amount
paid in came to what?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These figures are
not the amounts paid in.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The total amount of
the annuities bought in 1932-33 was $3,547,000,
and the next year, 1933-34. it increased to
$7,071,000. Honourable members will sec that
as available investments bringing in a higher
rate of interest became less numerous, these

the year 1934-35, that is, the last fiscal year,
we find that the total annuities purchased
For the first ten

months of the present fiscal year there were
issued annuities of a total value of $15,879,000.
In the month of February alone, that is, the
eleventh month of the present fiscal year,
more than $2,000,000 worth of annuities were
sold, and at the present time there are enough
applications in to make it clear that by the
31st of March there will have been sold in
this fiscal year alone more than $20,000,000
worth of annuities.
These figures clearly indicate that Government annuities have become a very attractive
investment. People are wise to buy them,
because, so far as I know, there is nothing
that is so safe. But the point has now been
reached where the money paid in is costing
Canada too much. Originally the annuities
were based upon an actuarial table which
showed that the money would cost Canada
four per cent. But actuarial tables of thirtyodd years ago differ from those used by
insurance companies at the present time, and
the fact is that this money paid in by purchasers of annuities costs Canada 4.4 per cent
in interest alone. In addition there is the
overhead expense, which has averaged $200,000
annually. For the first few years the carrying
charges represented a fairly high percentage
in comparison with the amount of annuities
sold, but now that the sale has reached

SENATE
$20000,000 a year the percentage of overhead
is small. The total cost to Canada for this
money to-day is practically four and half
per cent. But, as we all know, we can borrow
money now much more cheaply than that.
Therefore it is greatly in the interest of the
Dominion of Canada to revise and revamp
this whole scheme, for we cannot afford to
pay four and a half per cent for money when
we can borrow on the markets of the world
at one and a half to two and a half per cent.
When this scheme was introduced the object
was to make annuities available to people
in moderate circumstances, who might not
be able otherwise to lay aside enough to
take care of themselves in old age. In other
words, an annuity was looked upon as a form
of old age pension. But if honourable members had an opportunity to examine the list
of persons who have been applying for
annuities in the last eighteen months they
would find the applicants are by no means
people who are likely to need old age pensions.
On the contrary, they are people who can
afford to buy incomes for themselves, and in
some cases for their wives and children. As
I have already said, an annuity is one of
the best investments obtainable; so people
cannot be blamed for purchasing them; but
that is an additional reason why the Dominion
of Canada should not continue the scheme as
it is. The Government should not be paying
people a much higher rate of interest than
they could get on their money elsewhere.
Since we can borrow money on the market
at from one and a half to two and a half
per cent, the money we are receiving from
the sale of annuities is costing us from two
to three per cent more, for, as I have already
stated, the total cost, including overhead,
comes to about four and one-half per cent.
These, honourable senators, are the salient
reasons why I think we should give some
consideration to this whole matter of Government annuities. Two years ago a Special
Committee of the Senate on Public Accounts
inquired into the subject. I was a member of
that committee. which, after having heard
two officials of the Annuities Branch of the
Deparlment of Labour and giving considerable
study to the question, brought in its report
on June 14. 1934. The other day I was
looking over a copy of the proceedings and
noticed two questions that I had asked Mr.
Blackadar, the Superintendent of Annuities.
One wias as to whether annuities were exempt
froni Dominion income tax, and the answer
was "Yes."
That answer is a still further
explanation of why the annuities are such an
excellent investment, and it shows an additional reason why it would be well for a
Hon.

Mr. BLACK.

parliamentary committee, of one House or the
other. to go into the matter. To the other
question, whether annuities were exempt
from municipal income tax, the answer was
that the exemption applied only to Dominion
taxation.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
move the motion standing in my name.
Hon RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, I may say I have had
occasion to give a little attention to this
matter lately. My attention was drawn to
the matter from this angle, that the legislation providing for the sale of annuities was
passed specially with the object of belping
our people in moderate circumstances, and
for that purpose the Government extended
its paternal activities so far as to pay the
whole of the administrative cost; but now
it looks as if people who are by no means in
that class, and can afford to pay for that
cost, are taking advantage of the scieme,
and as time goes on more and more well-to-do
people will do so if the Act is not inquired
into and steps are not taken to protect the
treasury. It has been represented to me that
the whole cost of administering the Act,
which is considerable, is being made to apply
over a large number of purchasers who can
weli afford to pay their share of that cost,
instead of letting the country bear their
burden for them. I welcome my honourable
friend's motion.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There was one suggestion that I intended to make, but overlooked,
and I desire to make it now. It might be
a good thîing if the Government would issue
an order preventing the sale of further
annuities, after the end of this month at all
events, until such time as the operation of the
Act bas been inquired into.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I shall pass
along my honourable friend's suggestion to
the Minister.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I should like to
ask the honourable senator a question or
two. Has be in mind retroactive measures?
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

No.

Hon.
Mr.
MacARTHUR:
applications would be affected?
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Only

new

Yes.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Then the activities of the Annuities Branch would be curtailed, and insurance companies would look
after the business. Has the honourable senator made a comparison of the insurance companies' annuity rates with the rates charged
by our Annuities Branch?

MARCH 26, 1936
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No, I have not. 1
arn basing rny argument upon this one feature, that the scbeme is costing Canada
entirely too mucb. The Government is paying on annuities twice the rate of interest
at which it'borrows money.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Insuraince coinpanies' rates are 20 per cent higher.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I should like
to ask the honourable, senator a question. Has
he any figures to show the volume of annuity
business done by the insuranee companies in
the last three or four years?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 suggest be will find
that the sales of annuities by -insura'nce companies have increased just as fast, proportiunately, as have annuity sales by the Governinent. I would suggest, further, that he
find out just who have beein buying annuities.
I arn not one of those who believe that this
business should be stopped.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Rlear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn in favour of this
busine&e being allowed to go on. In Western
Canada we are faced with a very difficuit
situation on account of a large proportion of
our population coming froin continental
Europe. Tbey do not put their money into
banks or trust companies; they simply bide
it in t.beir homes. The opportunity to purchase annuities bas been an inducement
to, tbem. to invest their rnoney. I arn persuaded that many insurance companies have
sold annuities in large amounts by reason
of the fact that the Government syieem was
in existence; and this is all to the good of
the people.
Originally the maximum Government annuity purchasable was $5,000 per year per
person. That, as I understand. bas been
eut down to $l,2ff0.
The honourable member quoted figures. I.
shahl be interested to learn wbetber those
figures represent fully paid-uýp annuities or
not, for I arn informed by a salesman of
Government annu-ities that a large number
of persons have taken out annuity contracts
on which they .pay a smaîl sum, the balance
to be paid at some future time.
There are two sides to this question of
Goveroment annuýities, an.d I do not like my
honourable friend's suggestion that the business be discontinued. There is a reason wby
our people have been inveeting in aninuities,
apart altogether from the interest return.
The banks have reduced the rate of interest
on deposit accounts from 3 p)er cent to 2

7

per cent, and on certain accounts alIow but
1 per cent, and if the deposit is below
a certain minimum it ceases to earn interest.
The reason underlying investinent in annuities is the financial fear felt aIl over the
world to-day. and everybody is rushing to
put bis money into government securities.
I arn not sure we sbould not allow the business to go on. The people will ultimately
corne to their senfies and start to invest -in
other securities. In our Western country we
could give a large amount of employment
if the peoyle would invest their money in
mortgages on house property or for new
buildings, but we cannot get such loans today, because of certain legislation, some
passed by the provincial legialatures and some
Recently
by the Dominion Parliament.
there was a request to extend the operation
of 'the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act
ini tbat regard. If the requst is granted it
will be mucb more difficult to, secure mortgage funds.
1 arn not persuaded that it is a had tbing
for the people of this country to put some
of their savings into Government securities.
They will soon get tired of the investinent
returnq and that rnoney will go into othber
channels of investment. 1 tbink the saME
thing applies to, the annuity business of the
insurance companies. I amn crtainly prepared
to support the resolution to discuss the question, but. as I bave said. there arc two sides
to it.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, certainly I arn in favour of the
motion. I have bad some experience in dealing with the Governinent Annuities Brancb.
As 1 understand, there is no suggestion to
discontinue the issue of Government annuitiesOh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -but the purpose
is to consider the matter fully and as-certain

we are dcaling equitably with all our people
witb respect to this business. The bonourable senator froin Winnipeg a few moments

opinion not only were Governmcnt annuities
being taken out in larger numbers, but also

annuities issued by the insurance conipanies.
I think hie is right. But what is thie reason
for this increased business? As I understand,
the reason was given te, w, by the honourable
gentleman who bias made this motion (Hon.
Mr. Black), that there is ne income fax payalble on monev invested in annuitiýes. I think
in these trying days of income tax requicements a considerable number of persons--I

East, only in the East it is in a much less
extreme form, and some money is now available. The reason for those difficulties the
honourable member touched on himself. He
said, "People are afraid, especially our newer
population." It is not only the newer population; everybody is afraid of some confiscatory taxing legislation or some upset.
What is needed in this country, as in all
civilization, is stability and security. Then
people will feel free once again to invest
their money in constructive enterprise, and
their investment will provide work. To-day
people are fleeing to the Government with
their money. In the United States investors
are willing to take 4 per cent, and in this
country people will take 11 per cent, in order
to get security which they cannot get in
ordinary avenues of investment.
In these
conditions, surely, we should not be waving
flags calling people in and telling them
we will give them not only the running rate,
but three times the running rate. I think we
should be encouraging investment in private
enterprise, and should be doing something to
encourage the release of money that is going
into Government securities. The way I would
do that would be to reduce Government rates
to the lowest possible level. I should like to
get them down to one per cent, or half of
one per cent. The spectacle which the United
States affords is the clearest evidence of a
condition which affects the whole body politic.
We have the same condition here, but in a
less intensified degree. Therefore, if one thing
is obvious. it is that we should shut the door,
or at least contract the opening, to people
who are seeking the security of Government,
and we should say to them, "If you wish to
come in you will get only minimum returns,
nothing more."
The motion was agreed to.
PARLIAMENTARY
ALLFGED

ABUSE

RESTAURANT
OF PRIVILEGES

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I desire to call the attention of honourable
members. particularly those who are on the
Joint Committee on the Restaurant, to a
situation which apparently has developed this
session. We have in our restaurant, I am
advised. accommodation for 240 diners. Yesterday, in a grand rush, 300 persons were served.
The hallway outside the restaurant reminded
me very much of the entrance to a dining
car in which an attempt is being made to
serve the passengers on a train of twelve or
fourteen Pullmans. I went to the restaurant
with two of my colleagues, and after getting

inside we found at least two tables at which
the chairs were tilted up, and we were asked
net to sit down there, the reason being, apparently, that they were reserved for outside
guests who had not yet arrived. Eventually,
after an hour and fifteen minutes, we got our
meal.
I am not quite sure of the cause of the
greatly increased popularity of the restaurant.
Possibly it is the good fifty-cent meal which
is served, or possibly it is the activity of
the social hostess who has recently been added
to the staff of the House of Commons. Be
that as it may, the restaurant at lunçh-time
yeslerday looked like a first-class ladies' club
in which a number of men had been permitted to get under the wire.
On' making inquiry as to how this condition
comes about, I am informed that more than
two hundred permits have been issued to
residents of Ottawa who otherwise would not
be entitled to enjoy the privileges of our
restaurant. I submit, honourable senators,
that not only does this constitute an interference with the legitimate hotel and restaurant business in this city, but it defeats
the very object which the establishment of
the restaurant was supposed to achieve. Furthermore, it also probably increases the deficit
a deficit which is justified only by reasoiL
of the great service which the restauram
renders to the members of both Houses of
Parliament.
I trust honourable senators will agree with
me that this matter should be brought to
the attention of the Restaurant Committee
and that steps should be taken to restore a
condition which will afford us an opportunity
of enjoying the advantages which the restaurant was intended to provide.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable senators, I am a member of the Committee on
the Restaurant. I think that approximately
228 tickets are given out to the heads of the
different departments, to deputy ministers
and their clerks, and to Government House.
The difficulty is due, I think, to the fact
that tickets extending the privilege of the
restaurant for one day have been issued. For
instance, ladies who want te give parties will
get a member of either House to recommend
that they be accorded the privilege of the
restaurant for the day, and sometimes it
happens that they all desire to avail themselves of the privilege on the same day. I
think members of both Houses are to blame
to a certain extent.
Hon. Mr.
privilege?

CALDER:

Who

grants

the

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The request goes
to the Sergeant-at-Arms, generally through the
Speaker. A lady who wants to have a party
will call ip the Speaker, who will refer her to
the Sergeant-at-Arms. He may tell her, "We
cannot give you lunch to-day," but she will
say, "I am going to have a luncheon to-day
and invitations have already been issued for
it," and she will insist upon her point.
Another practice which has become common
is that of members writing a note saying, "I
want you to serve lunch for six lady friends
of mine." These ladies then come to the
restaurant, although the member does not
accompany them. Only yesterday six employees were sent up with a letter, and while
they were being served members of the
Senate and of the House of Commons remained standing at the door waiting for an
opportunity to get in to have their lunch.
One ex-minister has told me that he would
like to lunch at the restaurant, but that he
could go down town or to his club and get
his lunch more quickly than he could get it
in the Parliamentary Restaurant.
This is a condition which will have to be
remedied. As you know, the Restaurant Committee usually meets only towards the end
of the session, for the purpose of dealing with
accounts, but I shall endeavour to see the
Speaker of the House of Commons and get
him to call a meeting of the committee, so
that the whole question may be considered.
I trust that a satisfactory solution of the
difficulty will be reached.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Honourable senators,
I have been a member of the Restaurant
Committee since 1930. The statements that
have been made about deficits are wrong.
There is no deficit; there is a credit balance.
Yesterday I asked about all the functions
that were going on, what all the ladies were
doing there, and whether the business was
bringing in a revenue to the restaurant. I
was assured that it was. However. I shall
go further into the matter, for I feel a certain
responsibility.
In the past I have made
efforts to bring the restaurant up to a high
standard. I took the young man who was
doing the purchasing down to the packing
plant and showed him the types of meat he
should put in. I want to see the restaurant
kept up to standard, and I do not like to hear
it criticized.

I am sorry that I could not hear what
honourable members were saying.
I wish
tiey would speak up. They have got into
the habit of whispering. When they mumble
their words I cannot hear them. and I feel
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

very lonely. If they continue they will have
me going back to the House of Commons next
election.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Oh, no.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

CANADA-UNITED STATES TRADE
AGREEMENT BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND
READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and the United States of America.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I have but few remarks to make upon this
trade agreement. I may begin by saying that
I would rather cail it a trade agreement, not
reciprociby, becau-se it is net reciprocity in
the proper sense.
In introducing this Bill yesterday the
honourable leader of the House referred to
the prosperity which Canada enjoyed under
ihe Reciprocity Treaty which was in effect
from 1854 to 1866.
That was before my
time, but J have heard of it. During that
period times were good for two reasons, the
primary reason being the one referred to
yesterday by the honourable gentleman,
namely. the war betwen the North and the
South, which gave us a market across the
line which otherwise we could never have had
-a
market which was closed to us as soon
as the war was over.
J believe that a certain measure of trade
between nations is good, and I am quite in
accord with those who say that tariff walls
have been raised entirely too high.
We,
however, are too smiall to exert an economic
influence on the whole world.
The best
illustration of the truth of this statement is
the fact that the greatest exemplar of free
trade in modern times. Great Britain, had to
adopt a protective policy when Germany
built up her foreign trade and took away 40
per cent of what had been Great Britain's,
France did likewise and took away 17 per
cent, and the United States adopted the
highîest tariff of any country in the world.
It is under that protective policy, a policy
of very high protection, that Great Britain

MARCH 26, 1936
flnancial]y and industrially is to-day coming
back more rapidly than any other country in
the world.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: However, I believe the
tarit! walls are too high. I believe neighbours
should. trade with one another. We produce
in this Canada of ours certain commodities
which we desire to seli to foreign countries,
and particularly to our neighbour to the
south. But we are at one disadvantage. We
have a population of only a littie more than
ten millions and we produce fromn the soil,
from the mine, from the sea and froma the
factory, wbereas the Uniýted States has a
population of over 120 millions and produces
sirnilar products on a much larger scale.
TÈherefore in making a reciprocal trade agreement, unless we exercise the utrnust care and
forethought sud provide for revision, the
chances are we shaîl be found holding the
smnaller end of the stick.
I am sorry that the Senate was ad.journed
when this trade agreement was being debated
in another place. Had 1 heen in Ottawa I
should have listened to the debate with a
great deal of iuterest, because the subject
is a vital one. Generally speaking, I do not
thiuk the tarit! reductions on either side are
large enough to bring about any calamitous
result for the United States or ourselves. As
I said hefore, I think the agreement will do
some good. I shall atternpt to deal with it
this afternoon from the point of view of the
affect it may have on the Maritime Provinces, th-at is to say, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and it is
quita proper that I should do so. Certain
features in the agreemnt I do not like because, in my opinion, we have not reeeivad a
sufficient concession. I am willing to admit
that we got ail we could, for I have no
knowledga to the contrary.
I shall take up two or threa items. Fîrst
of all, lumber; and by that I mean ordinary
rough-sawn lumbar. I have here a list of
duties on lumber going into the United States
under various tariffs of that country. Under
the Underwood tariff of 1913 lumber antared
the United Statas free, and it was also free
under the emergency tarit! of 1921. The
Fordney-McCumber tarit! of 1922 imposed
exceediugly high duties on somne things, but
lumbee of the class I arn speaking of ramained free. In 1930, howevar, a duty of $1
a thousand feet was placad on lumbar by the
Hawlay-Smoot tarit!. But that was not all,
for in addition there was a revenue tax of
$3. So tha total United States duty on humber from. the time of the Hawley-Srnoot tariff

until this trade agreement went into effeet
was really $4. Now, a person not conversant
with the facts might conchude, after hooking
over this brade agreement, that our lumber
can go into the United States to-day under
a duty of only fil ty cents, but the fact is that
while the duty proper has been reduced to
flfty cents, there is a customs tax of $1.50.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is $2.
Hou. Mr. BLACK: Yes, that is $2 on lumber going into the United States. If there
are any lumbermen f romn the Maritimes or
Quebac in this Housa to-day they will bear
me out whcu, I say that a ctuty of $2 on rough
lumber keeps our product out of the Amenican market.
But we let American lumber coma into
Canada f ree. We give the United States
most-favoured-natiou treatment, under which
spruce, pine and fir come into New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec without any
duty. Now, that is n-ot reciprocity. I arn
not saying that there is much danger of the
humbar industry in the Maritime Provinces
and Quebec baing injured because American
lumbar can enter this country free; I arn
simphy stating farts.
Our Govarnrnent was not abla to persuade
the UJnited States to give us the same privihega
which we gave them with respect to lumbar.
If as at the lst of March last we could have
had a free entry of our lunrber into tha States
it would have meant an extra price of at least
$1,50 a thousand feet on a very large quantity
which we produced in the Maritimes. I arn
calling attention to this because I understand
the matter will be up for revision, and it is
well that the members of the Government
should kuow the situation, so that when the
question is under discussion they may be able
to say: "We think that the arrangement with
respect to lumber should be adjusted. If we
are going to let that cornmodity corne here
fromn the United Statas free of duty, that
country should admit our produet free."
I have a list of duties on other classes of
lumber, but I amn not going to weary the Housa
with refarances to them.
Some reference bas been made to fisb.
Varions kinds of flsh caught in American waters
are admitted to Canada free, but only sorne
of those classes caught in Canadianb waters
will be allowead into the United States free.
I will not say anything furthar on this question of flsh, as I understand another honourable senator, who is very rnuch more conversant with the subjeet than I arn, intanda
to speak upon it.
Now I wish to rafer briefly to, putatoas,

It has been so ail the way down through

the other kept flacks and herds. You know
wbat the tiller of the soul did ta the one
who had flacks and herds. There has been
trouble rîght down to the present day, and
the live stock industry of tbis country has
been sorely neglected. It bas heen neglected
in this treaty, and that m.akes me feel sad.
I1have been in the cattle business for over
baîf a century. It is an easy matter for the
industrialists in the East to talk of their
troubles, but it is' an easier -matter for me
ta tell you bonourable gentlemen about aur
troubles aut west. The principal trouble bas
been the negleet of the live stock industry.
The farmer bas neglected it by not iooking
after the proper breed of cattle. Our legislative bodies have alsa neglected the industry.
It always seemed ta me when I got up
on the floor of the other House there was a
feeling on the part of many members whicb,
if expressed, would have been something in
this form: 'You are talking cattle. Let us
talk about wbeat, university graduates, or
anything else, but wben it cames ta the cattîs
industry, let us be silent."' Yet that is more
important than anything else ta the man on
the land.

The right honaurable gentleman who went
ta Washington ta make a deal bad the oppartunity of bis life. H1e could have said ta
President Roosevelt: "You bave authority ta
reduce the duty on cattle froma tbree cents ta
one and a baîf cents." Wby did aur representative close the bargaîn with the duty-at

two cents?

Duncan Marshall-Mr. Fraser would have told
hlm just the right moment ta close the deal
and would have got the duty at one and a
hall cents on Canadian cattie entering the
United States. The citrus fruit growers of
California were right on the President's doorstep, eager ta get their large-size oranges into
this country duty free. Ail aur representative had ta do was ta say to the President
of the Unitcd States, "We are giving the freedom of the Canadian market ta your Caliiornia oranges, but you must put the duty
on aur cattie down ta one and a half cents
a pound instead of two cents." As I said,
the President had authority ta reduce duties
50 per cent, and *he could have reduced the
duty of $3 per hundrcdweight an cattie ta
the figure I have mentioned. 1 do flot abject
ta the entry of California oranges. Let us
import ahl the bcalth-giving fruits we can. But
1 feel the live stock industry has been overlooked. There was a chance ta save thousands
of dollars for aur live stock producers by,
as it were, pressing a button and making a
bargain for the admnission of aur cattie into the States at a duty of one and a hall
cents a pound in return for removing the duty
on citrus fruits from California. It was a
splendid oppyortunity, but we lest it.
Oh, yes,, honourable senators, I admit we
have been clamouring for the American market,
but let me say that 1 am not s0 very enthusiastic about that miarket. I have gone aver
there many times with cattle. They will let
you in when th-ey want aur cattle; but by
lowering prices or raising duties they will shut
you out suddenly, overnight, and then you
find you have no market at ail.
I admit the United States is the logical
market for range cattle. 1 admit that wild
cattie from the open range, tihat we eall
"ranchers," do not stand, the vayage across the
Atlantic as well as the domesticated cattie
from Ontario, Manitoba and the eastern part
of Saskatchewan. The British is the lagical
market for tbese domesticated cattle.
You will shortly have on your door-step requests ta fit up the cattle ships which are naw

how many buyers fram the Old Land were on

MARCH 26, 1936
arn speaking about the man who exports
cattie to Europe. I challenge any honourable
senator to point me out any man in that
business who did flot die poor.
The honourable leader of the house (Hon.
Mr. Dandu-rand) will remember my friend
Mr. Bickerdike, who was one of the finest
characters that ever sat in the House of
Commons. Mr. Bickerdike and I were partners
in shipping cattie overseas, and neither of us
made much money, owing to the fluctuations
of the market. But the man who handies hogs
cao use everything except the squeal. Look
at the man who bas been bandling hogs and
fabricating the kind of bacon that is asked
for in the British market-good Wiltshire
sides-and you will find hie is rich.
The poor cattie man, 1 arn sorry to say,
bas had to struggle against adverse conditions.
I ask honourable members to look at this
tin of canned beef which I hold in my hand.
It is brought in from the Argentine and from
Uruguay. What is in these tins? Let me
tell you. The label says the contents are
part of the product of 500,000 cattle. They
were usually decrepit old animals before they
were converted into canned meat. You will
find canned meat on the shelves of nearly
every food store in Canada. Are we to
permit the importation of this tremendous
volume of canned beef to the detriment of
our own cattie? I should have to be very
hungry hefore I would eat this canned meat,
knowing, as I do, what it represents. I have
figured out what the importation of this
product into this country would amount to in
cattle, and 1 may tell you that it is equal to
20,000 head, or 3,000 more than the 17,000
cattle we are shipping.
I do give the Goveroment credit for finding
a market which lielped us out in January,
and for gaining entry for range cattle to a
market which is the logical place for them
to go. 1 was in Washington just a short
time ago. While there 1 looked over the
Senate and the House of Representatives,
and then I went to the Canadian Legation,
where 1 got some figures. For the period
from the 9th of January to the 13th of
February, 14,844 cattle went into the United
States. Well, honourable members can figure
out for themselves what the difference would
be if $7 a head had been gained by a lower
duty. The United States wanted to get their
oranges and citrus fruits into our eountry, and
a deal could surely have been made.
1 know of nothing that will do more to
save Western Canada than a greater production of hogs and live stock. Think of some
of the dilapidated, worn-out farms, with the
soil worked up and pulverized, to be blown

81

away one day and blown back the next.
The ccowless, sowless, chickenless f arma c
Western Canada make for distreas. I saw the
great West when it was rich with cattie. The
railwaye are standing idie because of the lack
of a live stock movement. It makes me feel
sad to ,-ee the stock cars rotting on the sidings. I remember the days when I had to
offer a premium to get my cattle to market.
You could not buy a trainload of cattle between Winnipeg and the moruntains to-day,
as you could in the early days.
1 arn sorry that my old friend the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Burns)
is not present to bear me out in these statements. Hle knows what are the conditions
in the We-st. But in the honourable senator
from High River (lon. Mr. Riley) I have
a friendi here who knows what we did in
the old days-how thousands of cattie were
moved, and the country waa rich. To-day the
country is devastated; it la going baekward
through lack of live stock. Denmark was in
a similar *position, but made a come-back,
largely through the hog industry. Let us try
to do something in the interest of the farms
out west that are covered with sow thistie.
Let us do something to help bring back the
f armer. 1 say, God bleas Duncan Marshall,
even if he did pay $15,000 for a bull. I do
not caTe what hie paid if hie got an animal
that will improve the breed.
I have made the statement before that
the country has been injured by raising too
many Holsteins. I arn sorry that the farmera
did not see farther ahead and keep to the
right kind of cattle. Yes, honýourable senators, they forgot the Old Book. If they had
looked at their Bibles and had read Genesis,
chaptera 30 and 31, they would not have
theise miserable spotted and ringstraked
cattle that we see in every field to-day. Read
that chapter, honourable gentlemen. It is
the firat place where a cattle deal is recorded.
Read ho>w Jacob made a deal with old Laban
to take the ringstraked. and speckled cattle
for bis 8hare, and thereby consumnmated one
of the early cattie deals. Read how hie
pilled the poplar rod. You know the rest of
the story. Modesty prevents me from going
any further. It ia the first deal for profit in
the Old Book.
Before I pasa away I want to see this
country take its proper place. I want to see
happy and contented homes; I want to see
picturesque farine with satisfied farmers on
thema, not men who are just birds of passage;
1 want to see a country that is the richest
and beat in the world. I have lived in this
country since the days of Confederation, and

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
this Bill was rushed through to the second
readîng stage before it should have been.
There should have been two days between
the firs't and second readings, but the hionourable leader of 'the Senate asked permission to move the second reading yesterday,
and the House agreed. I think there are
several who wish to speak on this question,
and I subirit that the proper time for them
to do so is on the second reading. I think
the motion of the honourable senator from
High River is perfectly -in order.
Hon. Mr. DANDURMA]J:
Would the
honourable gentleman have any objection
to speaking on the third reading instead of
on the second?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: 1 pre-fer to speak on
the second reading of the Bill. That is the
piroper time to discuss it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There may
be speakers who are ready to proceed teday. I can quite understand the desire of
the Goverement to make ail the progress
possible.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: There 'q not very much
business before the House, and I do not
see why it should be neccsiry to rush this
through. The Bil! deals with a very important matter, probably the most important that will corne before us this session, and
I think the motion of the honourable senater from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley) should
be adopted and the debate adjourned.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Look at the vacant
seats.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seerns to me that
if any honourable member of the House is
prepare-d to go ahead at the present time
there is no reason, why the motion should net
be euspended. 1 hvnow of at least one hionourable member who anticipated an adjournment of the debate, and who will nlot be

desirous of speaking on the Bill. After the
discussion which bas taken place it is possible
that I shaîl have a few remarks to make, and
I have had no tirne for preparation. So,
unless there is some real reason for it, I do
not sec why we should be in a hurry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 readily rcegnize that except with the leave of the Senate
the motion for second reading of this Bill
could net have been placed on the Order

PRIVATE BILLS
NORTHERN TRUSTS COMPANY BILLSECOND READING
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG moved the second
reading of Bill D, an Act respecting the
Northern Trusts Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
very short in its terms. Sometimes a short
Bill conceals a great deal, but this one does
not. The Northern Trusts Company is not
changing the status of any sharebolder. It is
reducing the value of its shares from $50 to
$20 each, the surplus thereby released going
to reserve account. All the shareholders have
been notified. and of the total 30,000 shares
in existence more than 20,000 were represented
at a meeting which unanimously voted that
the issued and paid-up capital of $1.500,000
be reduced to $600,000, and that the $900,000
so released ftrom capital be added to reserve
account.
The reduction in capital has been used for
the purpose of setting up a special reserve of
$508,725, made up as follows. To this sum
of $900,000 are added an old reserve of
$250000 and some other items, amounting
to $385,185, making a total of $1,285,185.
from which certain deductions are made. Interest overdue longer than one year, amounting to $87,615, is written off, and a reserve of
$688,844 is set up against real estate ield.
These two items total $776,460, and when
deducted from the other total I mentioned
leave a balance available as a special reserve
of $508,725.
As I have said, the change in the capital
structure was unanimously agreed to at a
meeting at which more than 20,000 shares
were represented. None of the shareholders
who were not present have raised any objection. The change does net affect any taxation proposal, nor any creditor or other person; it simply makes the company's reserve

condition.
since 1932.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask a question? What did the shareholders pay for their
shares?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Fifty dollars a share.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And now it is proposed to reduce the value of the shares to $20
each?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. But all the money
stays in the company, just as it is. The shareholders will not be affected, because no new
stock is being issued. If new stock were
being issued it might be said that there was
some attempt to defTraud shareholders, but
that is not se. And the same assets that the
company has now will remain with it. With
all financial companies in the West, and indeed
all over Canada, if mortgages on real estate
are held at a certain value which it is known
they are not worth, there is a difficulty. It
is much better for the shareholders to know
the real truth about the value of their stock.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is that stock all paid
for?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, all paid for.
Hon. Mir. MURDOCK: The shareholders
are not now placing $30 per share in their
pockets?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. The reduction is
being transferred to reserve. A special reserve is being set up against possibility of loss
on mortgages. Not a cent is being taken out
of the company at all.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why is a bill
necessary?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Beoause the company has
a federal charter granted by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The company was
originally incorporated by the LegisIature and
later obtained a Dominion charter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The company was
organized in 1904 under a Manitoba charter
and was re-incorporated in 1923 under a
Dominion charter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By a Dominion Act?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. That is why we have
to apply to Parliament for this change.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

UNITED

ClIEDIT ASSOCIATION
READING

BILL-SECOND

Hon. E. S. LITTLE moved the second,
reading of Bill E, an Act to incorporate United
Credit Asociation.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Wili the honourable
gentleman explain the objeet of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourabie senators,
I understand this Bill is in the saine form
as a number of measures which have corne
before this House in the last three or four
years and been passed. A similar Bill,
I believe, was given second reading and referred to the Banking and Commerce Comnmittee two or three disys ago, at which tirne
the honourable senator from Winnipeg South
Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) registered objection
to it. If the present, measure is given second
reading, I would suggest that it too be referred.
to that committee for further consideration.
Hon. MT. HAIG: Honourabie members, I
arn not familiar with the procedure of this
House. If I remain quiet when second reading is given to this Biii, wili it be taken that
I agree to the principle of it?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If the objections which
I raised to a similar Bill the other day do
flot apply to this one, I must agaîn express
my opposition to, ail measures of this kind.
The incorporators of this company are from
my own oity, and I know some of them, and
they are very fine gentlemen. But this is not
a personal matteT at ail. Without repeating
ail that I saîd the other day, I should like
to suggest again that the honourable leader
of the House take up with the Goverament
the question of introducing a general bill to
cover ail companies that make a business of
lending smali sums of money to people in
saiaried positions-sometimes to people i
very low-salaried positions. We should have
general legislation covering not only comnpanies that have federal charters, but aiso, if
our jurisdiction wili enabie us to go so far,
covering ail companies that do business of
this kind.
Hon. Mr. MLURDOCK: Honourabie seators, I think I arn entireiy in agreement with
the vie5ws of the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South Centre (Hon. MT. Haig).
Shouid this Biii go before the Banking and
Commerce Coimmittee, I hope to do rny best
to persuade that committee to kiil it right
there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the honourable senator frorn London (Hon. Mr. Little)
bas said, a bill similar to the present one bas

already been given second reading and been
referred to the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee. I think there is stiil another to corne
hefore us; so we shail have at leat three of
the sarne kind to consider. It seems to, me
the committee may have to appoint a subcommittee to study the whole operation of
these lending coropanies and see if it would
flot be opportune to introduce a general bill
controlling ai such organizations, or perhaps suppressing thein. 0f course, it may not
be advisable to suppress those that are nlready
in operation. In any event, the whoie matter
should be thoroughly gone into by the Banking and Commerce Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
ST.

LAWRENCE AND ADIRONDACK RAILWVAY
OMPANY BILL-SECOND READING

Hon. L. COTE moved the second reading
of Bill F, an Act respecting the St. Lawrence
and Adirondack Raiiway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is simply to empower the St.
Lawrence and Adirondack Rnilway Company,
owner of the franchise and right of way with
respect to a lune from Montreai te the American boundary, te renew the lease of the railway and undertaking to the New York Centrai
Raiiroad Company, which operates the line.
A lease for twenty-one years that was executed
under statutory authority obtained in 1915
expires this year; hence the necessity for
authority to renew. I may say that ail the
stock and bonds of the St. Lawrence and
Adirôndack Railwny Company are owned by
the New York Central Raiiroad Company.
This Bili is quite the sane as the one which
was passed in 1915, except that instead of
authorizing a lease for twenty-one years the
present measure wouid give authority te make
a lease or leases for a period or periods not
exceeding ninety-nine years. The purpose of
the change is to make it unnecessary for the
company to caine back to Parliament for a
simiiar bill every twenty-one years.
The motion was agreed to, and the Biii was
read the second time.
OTTAWA AND NEW YORK RAILWAY
COMPANY BILL-SECOND READING

Hon. Mn. COTE moved the second reading
of Biii G, an Act respecting the Ottawa and
New York Rnilway Company.
H1e said: Honourable senaters, what I said
about the preceding Biii applies to this one.
The Ottawa and New York Raiiway Company
owns the franchise and the right of way with
respect to a line from Ottawa to Connwall.

SENATE
This company also lias in the past leased its
undertaking and its righit of way to the New
York Central Railroad Company, and that
lease expires this year. Therefore the company seeks authority to renew the ]ease to
the operating company. just as in the previous
measuire, for a period or periods net exceeding
ninety-nine years.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

BILL-SECOND READING

CANADA

Hon. Mr. COTE mo%-ed the second reading
of Bill H, an Act respecting the Trust and
Loan Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the Trust
and Loan Company of Canada, a company
which no doubt is known to every one of us,
wvas incorporated by the old Province of
Canada in 1843. It has carried on business
iii Canada ever sînce, lending money on
mortgage of real estate.
1 arn told that 95 per cent of the debenture
liolders of the company reside in England,
and that the president is Right Hon. L. S.
Amcry, M.P.
The Company owns rnortgages in Canada
The moniey
uînounting to about $12,000.000.
invested on those mortgages is made up of
the subscrihed capital of the company and
of borrowings on dehenture stock and on
short-term debentures.
On account of ýprevailing financial conditions
the company has heen unable to obtain renewals of its short.-termi borrowings, and
naturally it is almost impossible at present
for it to colleet much of its mortgage principal and interest. In order to meet its shortto
termn dehentures the cornpany lias ha
inake calls on its shareholders, and in this wvay
it bias been able to meeýt ail its liabilities.«
However, it realizes that further cahis wvill be
necessary.
The capital is mnade up of 2.500,000 shares
of £2 each. These shares are not fully paid
up. Piiyment on them lîas been called to
the extent of more than £1. The shareholders
and directors desire that as soon as £1 2s. 6d.
lias heen paid on each £2 ?hare the capital
structure be changed by the conversion of
tie.se £2 shares into two shares, one a preference share fully paid up and the other a
common share paid up only to the extent of
2s. 6. When this is done tlie shareholder will
have in his possession, instead of a £2 share, a
fiîlly paid! up preference share and a partly
paid up ord.inary share which will still be subject to call.
For how
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN;
much?
11,n. Mi. COTE£

Hon. Mr. COTE: For the balance of the
£1. The ordinary share will be paid up to
the extent of 2s. Gd., but it will be liable for
the balance of the amounit payable on the
old £2 share, that is, for 17s. 6d. ln other
words. the same amount that the shareholder
would have been required to, pay on his £2
share he will now have to pay on bis £1
ordinary share.
This is being done for the following pur-pose.
As I said a moment ago, it will be neeessary
to make further caîls on these shareholders.
Lt may býe a hardship for them, because the
maturities are rather heavy. In order to
enable the shareholders to finance payment
of their calîs. it is proposed to give them that
.share of pre-ference stock fully paid, but with
nu strings attached, se they can negotiate it
on the market, wher'e it wvill hav~e a value,
lucause there is a good equity baek of it.
By selling this sbaî'e they will be able to,
pay their c'îlls. Under the by-laws of the
Company this caîl money is available for one
purpose only-to pay debentures.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is the first
time that a scheme of this kind hias been
proposed for the purpose of financing such
an institution. It strikes me as being quite

EQUITABLE ELFE INSI'R XNCE COMPANY 0F
CANADA BILE -SECOND READING
Hon. H. W. LAIRD moved the second
readýng of Bill S, an Act to incorporate the
Equitabie Life Insurance Company of Canada.
He .said: Honourahie members, the purpose
of this Bill is to incorporate the Equitabie
Lufe Insurance Company of Canada. which is
to takce over the assets and liabilities of a

SALARY DEDJJCTION (CONTINUANCE)

BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. MT. DANDURAND mnved the second
reading of Bill 15, an Act to provide for the
deduction frnm compensation in the Public
Service.
He said: Honourable senators, as we are
in the midst ni the Lenten season, I assume
wve are ahi disposed to make certain sacrsfices. Tise purpose ni this Bihl is to make
a levy ni five per cent on the salaries and
emolurnents ni members ni the Publie Service
ni Canada. It is a renewal ni a pohicy which
originated in 1933 and lias been continued
from year te, year.
Tliewe is one change from the Bill ni hast
year. That Bihl made provision for an appropriation ni $3,000,000.
That lias been
dropped. 1 have a vague recollection that
1 inquired ni my right honourable friend last
session why hie was asking for $3,000,000 when
apparenthy there was being effected a saving
to the Goverument oi five per cent oi the
salaries mentioned. He exphained at the time
-I now recail it-that ten per cent had been
retained, but that as the deduction was being
redýucýed to five per cent the $3,000,000 was
required to make refonds to those who had
been taxed ten per cent.
With these explanations I move the second
reading ni the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bihl was
read the second time.

SENATE

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
He said: As this Bill reproduces the Act
of last year word for word, with the exception
already mentioned, and as the purport of the
Bill is well known, I suggest that we dispense
with the committee stage and take the third
reading.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should like to ask a
Has the Government any statequestion.
ment to make as to whether this deduction
is going to be permanent or whether this will
be its last year?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I could answer
my honourable friend better after I have read
the budget speech and am familiar with al
that it implies. I see in the papers that one
of my colleagues has declared that the budget
to be announced will be quite unbalanced.
That, perhaps, was an expression of personal
opinion; but till I know how we stand financially I shall not be able to answer the
honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some people think that
this question ought to be very seriously considered; that if salaries are too high and the
five per cent deduction is to be continued
from year to year it should be put on a
permanent basis. On the other hand, if the
deduction is net to be permanent, they ask,
"Why not go back to the regular salaries?"
Personally, I never could see that the Civil
Service was paid too much. Certainly in the
higher reaches of the Service the reverse has
been the case, and business has taken good
men out of the Service. I for one am not
in favour of this salary reduction. I know it
is unorthodox to say this, especially for a
senator, but nevertheless I say it. The cost
of living has been going up since 1933, which
was the low point of the depression; and
rents have been increasing; yet you put
through these deductions. You are coming
to another Bill which involves the same principle.
I am not going to object. I admit that
this idea of a deduction originated with a
Government that I used to support in the
country, but last year it eut the deduction
down from ten per cent to five per cent. I
do not criticize the Government for what it
is doing this year, but I was in hopes that
this would be the last year of the cut, and
I recommend to the honourable leader of the
House that he suggest to his colleagues that
this be the last year as far as salary deductiens are concerned. What we are doing with
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

respect to salary deductions has been done
by a good many business people in certain
walks of life, and I am persuaded that it is
one of the things that have given rise to
ideas like those we hear about in Alberta
and other parts of Canada; also that it is
not conducive to a revival of business, and
that we should consider its discontinuance.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
gentleman will observe that clause 7 of the
Bill says: "This Act shall expire on the 31st
of March, 1937."
Hon. Mr HAIG: Another Bill can be
brought in next year. That is what I want
to prevent.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I certainly
want to express my gratitude to the bonourable

for bis, kind reference to myseif.
Our steps are not as speedy as they once
were. As an elephant wben crossing a river

wbether it is safe, so we have to do now witb
our pedal extremities.
Once on bis return from a trip to the Old
Land Sir Wil'frid Laurier brought an Irish
thorn stick for Ned Crane, of the Intercolonial

Railway. Ned was an cngineer-a good Irishman, like my rigbt bonourable friend (Riglit
Hon. Mr. Meighen) and myseif. Handing it
back to Sir Wilfrid, be said: "Sir Wilfrid,

TRADE
DEBATE

(ONTINUEn
The Senate resumed from March 26 the ad.iourned debate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill 13, an Act respecting a certain
Trade Agreement between Canada and the
United States of America.
Hon. D. E. RILEY: Honourable members,
in speaking on the question before this
Chamber to-nigbt, I shahl take up only a few
moments of your time, and confine my remarks to the effeet the trade treaty with the
Un'ited States bas already bad, and may in the
future bave, on the live stock industry, and
particularly on that part of it relating to beef
cattle.
The feeding and finishing of beef catle bas
in the province of Alberta become a regular
business. Last fail large numbers of beef
steers were put into pens and grain-fed, in
the hope that a treaty would be made witb
the United States. On January 1. the day
the treaty came into effect. a trainload of those
steers. numbering 1,000 head, and weigbing
up to 1,600 pounds, left Calgary for St. Paul.
Thoe cattle were finiAied.
As cattlemen
know, affer a steer lias been finished furtber
foodl is a dead lo;ss to the owner. Wbcre in
Canada coffld those cattle be sold?
The
United States market was open to tbem.
Certainly the ternis were not as good as had
be-en boped for; nevcrthtless it was a ready
market. The President of the United States,
I heliex-e* went as far' as be could under the
circumstances- The cattie netted back most
satisfactory iiiices.
Since duit time flnisbied beef catle bave
been steadily going to the United States
markets from Western Canada. Although the
American markets have fallen off badly since
that first sbipment, it is still profitable to sel
there rather than in our home market. The
demoralization of the American market was
cairsed, not by the few cattle Canada sbipped,
but by conditions witbin the United States
itself.
The latest returns wlbich I bave received
are from. a sale of High River cattle at South

92

SENATE

St. Paul. These I received from the Secretary
of the Western Stockgrowers' Association. In
a letter dated March 19 he says:
I took seven loads of Rod's steers and some
more for other members. It was an opportunity to get first-hand information re the
American markets, and check up on Winnipeg
as J returned; also on steers being purchased
there to go to the Old Country. It is certainly a blessing we got one cent off to the
United States. There is no doubt it raised all
eattle màrketed in Canada one cent.
I doubt if the trade here would have paid
any more than 4.25 for Rod's steers, where
J seeured eight cents flat for the majority
wbich weighed 1,290 South St. Paul, and 7.50
for the balance that weighed 1,135, netting
back to him an average of 4.90 home weights,
after paying all expenses. Quality and finish
over there secures you the premium if any 1s
going.

I have here a statement of a shipment that
went on the 28th of February from High
River. These aLso were heavy cattle. weighing
1,600 pounds and more. They sold for 10
cents a pound in Chicago. It costs less than
3 cents a pound to ship cattle to South St.
Paul, and a little over 3 cents to ship them
to Chicago. That includes the duty and all
expenses.
To-day, in a Calgary paper dated the 28th,
J see that fifty-two cars of cattle left Calgary
for South St. Paul.
So vou see that even with the low price on
the American market it is still a better market
than the Canadian. Another most important
feature is that wben cattle are ready you can
send them. A carload or a trainload is sure
of a market at the market price. whatever it
may be. Up to the present our trade bas
been profitable, but on American prices
depend the future prices received here. Prices
of cattle fluctuate and change from day to
day, from week to week and from month to
month. That market is available to us when
we wish to take advantage of it. But, over
and above the price we receive, there is the
fact that we have a competitive market which
once more opens up the channels of trade, and

this tends to more trade and a spirit of
friendliness.
It seems to be the consensus of opinion
among Alberta cattlemen that the trade treaty
bas raised the price of cattle at least a cent
per pound. As one actively engaged in the
business J quite agree in that. With the Old
Country market again entering the picture,
it is possible that a better time is coming for
the cattle-rancher.
The honourable member for Marquette
(Hon. Mr. Mullins) bas been fighting the
battles of the cattlemen in the other House
for many years. His voice was like a voice
crying in the wilderness. Nevertheless, he

kept it up. I am glad that in his new environment, which I hope he will find congenial,
he is continuing to keep up the good fight
As he
for the cattle industry of Canada.
remarked when speaking on .this Bill on
Thursday last, the cattle industry is one of
the two oldest industries of which we have
any record. The other is the growing of grain.
Ever since the Western prairies came under
the plough and Western Canada became the
granary of the world, days, months and years
have been spent in discussing and devising
legislation to assist and protect the grain
farmer. Further, vast sums of money have
been spent for that purpose. Only a few days
ago the sum of $6,000,000 was voted, to be
distributed to some Western grain growers.
Understand, I am finding no fault with this.
This is all to the good. It is pleasing to
know that our governments realize the important place agriculture plays in our national
existence. After mines have been exhausted
and forests denuded, this good old earth will
still produce sustenance for man and beast.
All this expenditure of time and money has
given to the grower of commercial grain, I
believe. the best legislative protection that
it is humanly possible to devise. But while
all this has been done for the grain growers,
comparatively little bas been attempted for
the other branch of agriculture, namely, live
stock. Not all the farmers of Canada are
engaged in raising wheat for sale, but every
farm worthy of the name sells a certain number of live stock from month to month, or
from year to year, and every year live stock
brings in more money than wheat. If half
the attention had been paid to the live stock
industry that has been paid to grain growing. the farmers of Canada would have come
through the depression and been in better
condition than they are to-day.
It is true, the late Government passed the
Marketing Act in an effort to assist the producers of natural products. This Act, however, did not meet with the approval of the
majority of the live stock producers, and up
to the present they have had no benefit from
it. It is at present before the Supreme Court.
What its fate may be after it comes from
that Court is problematical.
The reduction of one cent per pound on
our cattle, to look at it from a purely academic
point of view, may not seem much of a concession to Canada; but from the viewpoint
of the rancher, who for the last six or seven
years bas seen the accumulations of a lifetime gradually melt away, as a result of unprofitable markets or the lack of a competitive outlet for his cattle, the opening of the
American market was the opening of a

MARCH 31, 1936
door releasing him from the economie slavery
of several years. It seems to me that the
opinion of ranchers should have some weight.
They are delighted to have once more a competitive market.
The beef cattle herds of to-day, unlike
those of the old days, are owned not by
foreign companies, but by individuals, who
in most cases have built them up from small
beginnings during a lifetime of hard work
and sacrifice. They have succeeded in producing a superior type of beef cattle and the
necessary plant and equipment for that purpose. Owing to marketing conditions, many
of those men are bankrupt, and unless there
is some change for the better, the range
cattle business will be a thing of the past.
There is a lot of talk about our export
markets-the Old Country market and the
American market. These, however, take only
a small percentage of our cattle, while our
domestic market takes at least ninety-five
per cent of them. That market is, and has
been for six or seven years, in a most
deplorable condition, and something must be
donc in the way of legislation to correct
the evils that already have existed too long.
It is my considered opinion that the present
system of marketing live stock-cattle, hogs,
and sheep-on our home market has caused
and is causing more unrest in Western Canada than tariffs or any other thing.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I cannot allow this Bill to pass without making a few remarks with respect to the treaty
before us. I do not intend to vote against
the Bill, although there are very valid reasons
which might justify me in doing so.
I listened with a great deal of attention
to the speech made by the honourable leader
of the Government in this House when lie
moved the second reading of the Bill. Usually
lie is very brilliant in dealing with matters
of this kind, but it struck me that on this
occasion he was not quite up to the mark.
I presume the reason to be that lie was not
absolutely in favour of the measure lie was
advocating. He gave us a very interesting
account of various attempts that had been
made in years gone by to secure trade treaties
between Canada and the United States. Indeed, he went back no less than seven decades
to point out the benefit that Canada had
received from a treaty which was in effect
during the American Civil War. I think that
was the only treaty he could point out that
was really of any particular advantage to the
people of Canada. Of course we all understand what the conditions were at that time.
For four years our neighbours to the south

were in the throes of civil war, and had to
secure the commodities they required from
the outside world, many of them from Canada.
But a year or two after the close of the Civil
War we found-and it has always been the
case with our American friends-that as soon
as they were able to produce for themselves
the commodities they required they abrogated the treaty; and I think that from that
day to this nothing has been accomplished
in the way of reciprocity with the United
States which has been of any benefit to the
people of this country.
The honourable gentleman, as has been
customary for the past quarter of a century.
referred to the reciprocity pact of 1911. During the years since 1911, I think, I have never
listened to a speech by a Liberal in which
there has not been some reference to that
pact. It seems therefore somewhat strange
that in the agreement we are considering at
the present time some of the provisions of
the pact of 1911 were not included. I suppose
there was an opportunity to include them.
The honourable gentleman claimed that the
reciprocity pact of 1911 was defeated by the
Conservative party. It is true that the Conservative party had something to do with
the rejection of the treaty. There is no
question about that. He was good enough,
however, to state that there were a score or
so of outstanding Liberals in the city of
Toronto who clubbed together and assisted in
defeating it. He might have gone a little
further and stated that not only in the city
of Toronto, but practically all over Canada,
and particularly in those sections where manufacturing is carried on to a great extent,
thousands of good regular Liberals joined
with the Conservatives to defeat that treaty.
In 1911 the people of Canada were given
details and they had an opportunity at an
election of judging for themselves whether or
not the terms would be beneficial for Canada.
The people decided the terms would not be
beneficial and they defeated that treaty. But
no details at al] were given out about this
pact until the Bill was brought down in
another place. The public had only the bald
promise made by the present Prime Minister
during the election campaign, that, if returned
to power, he would make a deal with the
United States. That promise he repeated on
the platform all over the country. He was
returned to power by a huge majority. Then,
after he had formed his Government, he went
to Washington, where he had to put nis name
on the dotted line. The Americans knew lie
had to make a deal, and in their hands lie
was like clay in the hands of the potter. They
had him roped, for it was known at Washington

peole wbo are inclined to be free traders,
regardlcss of what the results of a free trade
policy migbt be. I do nlot know that they
appreciate fully what effect free trade mighe
have upon their own interests even. But they
have been Iooking towards the United States
for many years, hoping that they would be
helped if the American market were opened.
When this agreement was introduced they bad
great expectations. They are beginning to
see, though, that they will flot benefit to any
considerable extent from it.
In this connection I want to point out,
first, that the agreement does nlot in any
respect assist agriculture. There is no benefit
for wheat, barley, oats or rye, the duty on
these grains rcmaining as it has been for a
number of years. This, undoubtedly, is a
seri nus disappointment to the people of the
Prairie Provinces, where grain growing is the
main industry. Tbey were led to believe
that if any agreement were entered into, witb
the United States, the grain products of the
West would receive first consideration. It
must be a bitter disillusionment to tbem that
the present agreement docs flot provide redress
in any shape or form.
The same applies to our dairy products.
No concessions of any consequence have been
granted under this agreement. On the contrary, we find that under it the Canadian
farmer is subject to new competition witb
respect tri dairy products, vegetables and
fruits.
As to the agitation wbich bas been going
on for many years to secure the American
market, my personal opinion is that even if
this market were thrown wide open to our
agricultural products to-day the people of thîs
country would not benefit to any worth-while
extent. Tbe Ainericans are engaged in producing the sanie commodities as we are, and,
like ourselves, thcy are troubled witb overproduction in some lines. Yet the Federal
Government at Washington has been granting
millions of dollars to assist the farmers of
the United States to produce in even greater
quantities. If we looked into the situation
carefully w e sbould probably find that the
Americans themselves are now seeking wider
markets for their own farm products. So
in what respect could we benefit, even -f they
gave us absolutely free access for our goods?
We ought to consider above everytbing else
the borne market. I understand that we consîime 86 per cent of our produiction. Is it not
of vital interest to us to guard this market?
Honourable senators wbo listened to the
addresses delivered by the Hon. Minister of
Mines (Hon. Mr. Crerar) will recaîl the
statements be nade in regard to the develop-

9

ment of our northern country. He pointed
out, in connection with one or two of the
mines, the large number of people employed
and their enormous consumption of the products of this country. If the Government
would vote a substantial sum of money to
a.ssist in locating gold mines and help generally the development of that northernl country, it would be doing more for the people of
the Dominion than it could accomplisb by
any oCher means.
Perbaps the most astonisbing feature of
this agreement is that altbough the duty on
farma implements bas been reduced by one-haîf
-from 25 per cc-nt to 124 per cent-and we
naturally expected that this would result ini
lower prices, at least to the extent of the
cut ini ýduty, the prices of many implýements
used on -the farm have been increased. For
example, in 1934 a binder sold for $264,
in 1935 f or $262. I arn quoting Winnipeg
prices. But we find tbat this year, altbougb
the duty bas been eut in two, the same kind
of binder is quoted at MO8,some $18 higber
than when the duty was at 25 per cent. So the
reduction in duty in respect to farma impiements has had the very opposite effect to what
we were led to expect.
If we refer to the history of tariff reductions
on farm implements we shaîl find that invariably when the duty was redueed the price
went up.
The bonourable senator from High River
(Hon. Mr. Riley) and the honourable senator
from Marquette (Hon. Mr. Mullins), botb
authorities on cattle, have dealt with that
subjeet. As was poin-ted out bx' the honocîrable gentleman from High River, the United
States has made certain tariff concessions on
our cattle. There bas been no reduction at
all in the duty on stockers, a class of cattle
very important from the standpoint of the
farmers of tbe Prairie Provinces. In recent
years drougbt, bail, grassboppers and otber
adverse conditions bave made feed, comparatively scarce in Western Canada. and ini many
sections of the Prairie Provinces farmers bad
virtually to give away their cattle. The
farmers of tliose provinces are more înterested
in stockers tban in any other class of cattie,
and it is a distinct disadvantage to tbem not
to bave received any tariff concessions in this
respect.
If we compare tbe tariff concessions we make
witb those made to us, we shaîl find tbat our
American neigbbours bave by long odds
secured tbe better of the hargain. This is indicated by a report publisbed in the New
York Times comparing exports and imports
between tbe two countries for December of
last ycar and January of this year, the information being fîîrnished, from Government

records at Washington. The United States
exported ta Canada in December, 1935, $21,760,000 worth of goods; in January, 1936,
826,990.000-an increase of $5.230,000. By contrast, in December, 1935, Canada exported ta
the United States, $26,937,000 worth of goods;
in January-the first month of the treaty$22,930,000. Thus at the very beginning it
is evident that Canada hs not receiving a fair
deal. 1 fear that as time goes on we shall
find this adverse condition will become even
worse.
We have been asked ta give the treaty a
fair trial, ta prove whether or not it wiil be as
beneficial ta this country as is claimed by the
Governent. WTt are citairous that trade conditions shouid improve, and we shall be glad
if the agrcruntn brings about the advantages
that havxe hcen so iavishiy promiscdi. I very
grax e1v doubt whether these promises xviii ever
lie realized.

on a farm in aid Ontario and on the wind-;wcpt prairies cf Saskatchewan, 1 arn deeply
intrrested in this trado agreement from many

angles, most of which have been already dealt
with in the course of this debate. At the
present time 1 arn privileged ta live upon a
farma in Ontario in a district which 1 think we
may consider f airly representative of mixed
farming in this province.
In scanning the trade agreement, among the
so-called major concessions secured frorn the
United States. wo flnd oniy two which ta any
materiai extent affect people engaged in mixed
farming in Ontario. The flrst concession is
with respect ta, cattie. This bas already been
deait with tboroughly by honourable gentlemen who have preceded me. The second concession is in relation ta dairy products. The
dairy farmers of this country had hoped for
major concessions on milk and cream. They
get no concessions whatever on miik. On
creain the duty is reduced fram 56ý cents ta
35 cents a gallon; but that reduction applies
ta a quota of only 1,500,000 gallons. The
smaliness of .this concession will be realized
if w-c think back ta 1929. when we feit we
were badly off tinder the Fordney-McCumbcr
tariff. At that time we shipped across the
barder 5,000,000 tons cf cream. To-day the
Government asks the dairy farmers ta stand
up and cheer because we are being aliowed ta
s il) 1.500,000 galions a ycar.
According ta the Dominion Bureau of
Statisties, in June, 1935, there were 3,850,000
dairy cows in this country. Sa by a little
flguring we flnd that aur quota averages
approximatel1Y three pints cf cream per year
per ccxx.
Therefore the practical value of
this so-caiied major concession is that every
dairy farmer cf Canada m'ay, for each cow he
possesses, ship ta the United States three
pints cf cream per year at a duty cf 35 cents.
But. as a practical farmer. I arn intercsted
as weil in the industrial life of aur countrx'. for I fuiiy realize the truth cf what the
honourabit senatcr from Sa-.katchcwan (lion.
Mr. Gillis) lias said. that more than 80 per

the fact that ,

despite evidence to the contrary, members
of the Government and their supporters were
stili arguing that invariably the lowering of
tariff duties brings lower prices, and that thse
raising of tariff duties brings higher prices to
the consumer. The illustration of agricultural implements bas just been cited, proving
the fallacy of that first statement. May I
be permitted to give you very briefly an instance which shows the fallacy of the second

statement. namely, that the raising of tariff
duties raises prices to the consumer. 1 shall
refer to a plant in my own riding, hecause
1 arn familiar with the working of tht plant.
though what I say applies equally to other
manufacturing plants throughout Canada.
We have in the city of Peterborough a
plant known as the Western Clock Company,
or Weste]ox. which manufa.cture5z many kinds
of dlocks and watcbes, but specializes in dollar

watches and in the cheap alarm. dock known
as Big Ben. Prior to 1930 this plant, which
is a branch of a parent plant in La Salle,
Illinois, was running b-ebind se rapidly that
the parent company was advising its representatives here that it was almost tirne for
them. te fold their tents and silently steal
back tu the United States, wheýre there was
protection for their particular industry. They
were suffering keenly from the competitien

of watches and dlocks brougbt in from
European countries, and particularly did they
suifer from thse importation into this country,
and the assemrbly here, of watcb parts made
in countries with whicb you are familiar, wbere
people work for a few cents a day. Those
parts couild be broýught into Canada and

assembled and the complete article sold for
less than the cost of producing it in the plant

at Peterboroughs, which makes not only every
part that goes into the watch, but ail the
tools required te make the parts. Howevcr,
they were persuaded to remain until after the
1930 election, in the hope that there migh.t be
a change of government and a change of policy.
BotIs things happened. When those changes
came the manager of that plant asked only
one thing-that there migbýt be a sufficient
tariff duty on some of the watch parts wbich
wcre being imported and assembled te bring
thse cost of thse assemblied article up to the
cost of producing sucis an article in Canada.
On that basis they were willing to compete.
The concession ivas granted. And wbat was
the result? BeFore the concession was grant-ed
there were 225 persons employed in the factory

97

in Peterborough,

averaging twenty-five

and

a haîf heurs per week. To-day there are
employed 404 persens, new belp, is being
trained. the plant is working te capacity
every day, and there are many times wben
the employees are working sixty heurs a week,
which means overtime. Tbe pay-roli bas increascd $122,000 annually. Last summer a
fine addition te the plant was completed,
cmploying Peterboroughs workmen and materials, and the wages of those men and the
increased pay-roll were spent in that city.
If this is wbat happens when we protect
our industries, the reverse is true wben we
remeve protection: men lose their positions,
their wages are lest te thse district, relief
cests are increased, and thiere is less money
in circulation in the community.
As a Canadian I arn intcrestcd in thse removal of thse duty on, and the free admission
of, magazines and periodicals from tbe United
States. May I say te you that in respect of
this item 1 arn heartily in accord with the
theory advanced by many of those wbo are
supperting this treaty and this particular
item, that in tise development of bier nationhood Canada needs the stimulating effects
te be derived from competently edited magazines frem other lands, particularly those
from Great Britain and the United States.
We do net desire te follow the example set
by seme Europcan countries in endeavouring

te build up a national spirit solely by the
exclusion of the literature of otber countries.
But tise iegislation before us has gene te the
other extreme. Surely it is unfair te tax
Canadian publishers and publications and at
the samne time expect thema te cemýpete su-ccessfuily with

magazines

and periodicals

of

other ceuntries wbicb enter Canada duty free.
We are epening a wide field for the distribution
of magazine articles, editorials and advertising
written by American writers te foster American
ideals and advertise American products; and

in propertion as we are widening thse field for
that circulation we are reducing tise circulation
of Canadian magazine articles, Canadian
editorials and Canadian advertisements, written by Canadians te foster Canadian ideals
and advertise Canadian products.
One of tbe principal reasens wby the late
Gevernment placed a duty against periodicals

coming in from the United States was, in
iddition te thse revenue it produced, te fester

wnd preserve national unity in this country.
[ think you will ail agree that in tbe devclopment of our national life we bave' reached

the rights of the others. Physical factors
increase our problems, and in spite of all that
has been done since Confederation wide divergencies exist between people of different races
and different creeds. If we are to foster and
develop the spirit of national unity for which
we are all striving, we must first of all give
to our Canadian magazines and Canadian
publishers a chance to compete on even terrns
and on a fair basis with those of other coun'tries. I submit very humbly that no single
factor will do more to foster this national
unity than the wide distribution of our Canadian periodicals. Under the last Government
their circulation bad been increased by sixty
per cent.
In closing may I say, with respect to all
these problems. that from the time of Confederation there has been a desire on the part
of all true Canadians to overcome these
obstacles of race and creed, these differences
of thought between one part of the country
and another; and I am asking those who have
influence with the powers that be, whether
there is not some way of making amends to
our Canadian publishers, and whether, if we
are to allow American publications to come
in duty free, there is not some way in which
the burden of taxes and duties on our Canadian publishers can be lightened so that their
publications may compete on an equal basis
with those coming in frorn other lands.

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Possibly it should be
gallons. I am taking it from Hansard.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: A good authority.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, whilst many matters couild be discussed under the head of the Canada-United
States Treaty, I shall confine my very few
remarks to one particular matter. We have
in, the Maritime Provinces, and notably in the
province of New Brunswick, a silver-black fox
fur ranching industry which has been built up
as the result of the experiments, the intelligence, the persistence, and often the failure of
some of the early promoters of the industry.
That industry is well established to-day,
producing a commodity for which there is a
steady and increasing demand. The fact that
during the years of depression the price and
demand for silver-black fox furs increased
rather than decreased would seem to prove
that the present industry is susceptible of
great financial possibilities. The coSt of food
and labour and the capital expenditure in
ranching are much lcss than in other branches
of live stock raising. Everything would be
well with this industry if the Canada-Unitedi
States treaty had not missed the opportunity
by admitting silver-black fox furs into Canada
free of duty, though there is a fairly high tariff
charged against us by the United States. Our
people are very apprehensive of the results.
It is perhaps more particularly apprehended
that the inferiority of the silver-black fox furs
coming here frorn the United States will not
only mar our market, but will also injure the
good name which our silver-black fox furs
have acquired in the markets of the world. I
say, therefore, that what bas been done is
reprehensible in the judgment of our silverblack fox ranchers and is causing thrm much
uneasiness.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am sure we have
all been charmed to hear our new colleague.
I thought she might have made a slip.

Hon. Mr. POPE: Unles someone else is

fied in replying to his remark that to the
present day he has felt a grievance against
his political opponents in 1911 for defeating
wbat he called reciprocity. Coming from the
northern part of Saskatchewan, where a large
number of people whom we call "new Canadians" reside-people who possibly do not
understand our political methods-I find it
very hard to forgive my political opponents
for preaching something that I consider to be
impossible: I refer to free trade with the
United States, or any arrangément that would
be advantageous to Western Canada. It is
impossible to secure such an agreement. I
would point out, and I believe there are
many who would agree with me, that the
advantages mentioned as coming under the
convention presented to us for ratification do
not exist.
Previous speakers this evening have discussed the cattle industry. I am personally
interested in. the sale of cattle, and I know
a number of people who have lost money in
consequence of the representation made to
them that the President of the United States
had authority to lower the tariff fifty per cent.
If honourable senators will takè the trouble
to look up the records of the export of cattle
to the United States during the years when
we were permitted to ship them there, they
wild find that al we have received on the
average over a period of ten years is ten per
cent instead of 33* per cent. As has been
pointed out, there is absolutely no reduction
given by the present treaty on cattle from
175 to 700 pounds. The honourable senator
from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley) knows
that most of the cattle exported to the United
States in the past have been under 700 pounds.
As to the price of cattle in Western Canada,
it is worse to-day than it wa' a year ago.
Then what about lumber? Farmers in the
Prairie country have been greatly burdened
because of the fact that for any building they
do they have to bring their lumber from
points 300, 400, 500 and even 1,000 miles away.
The cost of lumber to them is $2 a thousand
feet dearer than to consumers in the United
States, as a result of this trade agreement.
That is what Western Canada has received.
The people out there have been asking for
bread and they have been given a stone, so
far as this agreement is concerned.
The Government should do what it can to
encourage trade, certainly, but it should not
start off by making a bad bargain; and I
consider the present trade agreement to be
a very bad bargain for the whole of Canada.
There is nothing in it to benefit Western
Canada especially, and if a vote were necessary I would vote against the Bill.
12745-7j

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable senators, I do not intend to make a speech just
now, because I believe that we are having
nothing but an academic discussion. The
speeches have been very interesting, of course,
but I do not think the Senate would undertake to throw out this measure. It is a kind
of money bill, as I imagine my right honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) will agree.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a process of education.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is only one
thing for us to do: vote for or against. But
we have to swallow it. Everyone has his
own opinion about this thing. I will not
say what mine is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are entitled
to have it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable senator will give us his real opinion, I
can assure him of the goodwill of all this side
of the House.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The honourable
senator is committed now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is in my
mind woukl probably not interest the House.
It would not matter, anyway, because we
have to take the agreement or leave it. So
all these speeches that are being made are
nothing but academic discussions. The
measure is like a money bill. Personally I
will go with the majority. I do not see that
we can improve the agreement, and I do not
know that many speeches will make it work
any better.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It cannot be
made to work any better.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand
that my honourable friend from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé) would like to address the House.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: To-morrow, perhaps.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) also desires to speak to-morrow.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pope, the debate
was adjourned.
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 18, an Act to amend
the Soldier Settlement Act.
He said: Honourable members of the Senate,
this Bill seeks to extend the time for granting
additional credit on payments of arrears or

SENATE

100
instalments
the Soldier
subsection
enacted by
Statutes of

by the occupants of lande under
Settlement Act. The Bill repeals
1 of section 73 of the Act, as
section 1 of Chapter 49 of the
1932-33. That subsection reads:

Any settler or person indebted in respect of
any contract or agreement made prior to the

first day of January, 1933, under the provisions
of this Act, who after the thirty-first day of
March, 1933, and up to and including the
thirty-first day of March, 1936, makes payment
in respect of any arrears or of any instalment
due and payable within the said period or
within one year thereafter shall, subject to
the provisions of this section, receive credit
toward payment of arrears or on the balance
of such instalinent or on any other such
instalment for a further surn equal to the
payment made.
As honourable senators will notice, this
advantage granted to returned soldiers who
settled on those lands expires on the 31st
day of March, 1936. That is to-day. The Bill
seeks to extend the privilege another two
years, to the end of March, 1938. That is all
there is in the measure.
We have had before this Chamber a number of amendments to the Soldier Settlement
Act, and I am quite sure this is not the last
one.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: The
honourable senator who lcads the House explained clearly enough the purpose of the
Bill, but le did not say anything in justification. I am not contending the measure should
not be extended, but J should like to hear the
Government's reason for asking this House
to give another extension.
It is a very important concession. Since
1933 up to the present month, tlhree years in
ail, every soldier settler paying the Government for land which was bought with the
people's money gets credit for twice as nuch
as he pays in, both in principal and interest.
No doubt the reason which was advanced in
1933 for tîat concession was a sound one.
Farm lands bail gone down disastrously in
price and in value because of the precipitate
depression in prices of farm products, and
a period was alead of us when certainly
recovery could not be expected in regard -to
either lands or products. Now three years
have gone by. I cannot think that recovery
has come about yet, for there was a bad blight
last year; but I should think it is probably
wise now ýto proceed ycar by year rather than
by periods of two years. This continual largesse, not only to this class, the most deserving
of all, but to other classes, is having a more
demoralizing effect throughout the country
than I believe the Government appreciates. I
do not sece how the largesse can be indefinitely
H i NIr. DANDURAND.

continued. In fact, I know it cannot. My only
suggestion is-and I am not going to press it
further-that it would have been wiser to
make this extension for one year instead of
two years. I doubt if there is a single man
in the whole class covered by the Bill who
expects ever again to pay more than fifty
cents on the dollar. Ail will be encouraged
in their view by this two-year extension. I
ask the Government if it bas not been a little
hasty in going so far as this measure proposes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have received
no brief on the Bill, and my only information
is what J got from reading the debate in
another place. I found a strong expression
of opinion there in favour of extending the
privilege farther than two years. But against
that view it was argued that by the period
being limited to two years an incentive would,
be given to debtors to take advantage of the
privilege. It seemed to me tiat the arguments presented were on the whole rather
in favour of the Bill as it is.
My right honourable friend now suggests
that the extension should have been limited
to one year. But it was pointed out in another
place that debtors should be belped to arrange
their budgets in such a way as to meet their
liabilities, and that a year would he a very
short time in which to do this. In fact, it
was said that even two years would be too
short, but after reading the discussion I came
to the conclusion that the Government was
quite justified in limiting the period to two
years. There has been a considerable demand
for the extension.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
Those in a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
better position to express the need are members of Parliament coming from the districts
where the soldier settlement lands are situated. And there was not one voice raised
against the extension. On the contrary, much
of the argument was in favour of a longer
extension.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am somewhat surprised that a parliamentarian of such
long experience as my honourable friend
should recite as a reason for this extension
the fact that members of Parliament favour
it. Of course they do. In their constituencies every soldier settler, and indeed everyone else, would want the extension to go
through.
So what else could members do?
But the honourable senator occupies a very
important position in the Government of the
day. He represents those interests who fortunately are not subject to the momentary
sway of popular
clamour and popular

declamation. 1 ask hirn just to take anchorage once in a white and fix his mimd on the
direction in which this country is travelling.
Let hima take cognizance of portento-us facts
which surround us. in respect of our financial
position. iIf we in this Chamber do nlot
consider these things I do nlot know who
will. For years, under both governments,
this country has been steadily granting
millions here. millions there, adding to
millions to-day and multiplying those millions
to-morrow. We are now reaching a time
when things are somewhat better from the
employment angle, and even from the rural
angle. But on the financial end things are
vastly worse; sO much so as to be diffleuit
to believe. We hardly ever stop and face
the figures. It is because of this situation
that I think the Government would have
been wiser to give in the present Bill at least
some indication that there is an end to this
lane along which we have been travelling.
My rigbt
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend has followed from the lieginning the fortunes of this seheme. In this
Chamber on more than one occasion he has
asked us to agree to revaluation of lands,
implements and stock. And before him I
myself had urged that the liability of the
soldier settiers be reduced. Cuts were made
by the million. 0f course, we aiways are
wiser after the event.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
revaluations were made before my time; but
we did bring in the Bill of 1932-33.
Some of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bis were sent to committee, where we heard
representatives of the departmental* branch
administering the Act. Those officiais were
unknown te, me before. I must confess I
admired the work they were doing, and I
have confidence in them. In the various
territories were agents striving to save the
millions that had been invested. It seemed
to me that the officiaIs had been weli chosen.
No doubt, some of themn were nominees of
the Government of my right honourable
friend, because the Act was introduced during the time when he, or his predecessor Sir
Robert Borden, was Prime Minister. The
scheme was undertaken and a huge sum of
money. more than $50,000,000, lias been spent
in the attempt te re-e.stablish soidiers. I am
quite sure that the department is doing its
level best to save as much as possible of
this vast expenditure.
The Bill does not cali for any outiay. The
money has aiready been spent, and now we
must husband what we can as an asset. In
many instances, and with respect to a large

proportion of the deht, the value of the asset
is very doubtfui. That is why I intimated
when explaining the measure that I feel it
will he thQ duty of myseif, or of someone
foiiowing me, to ask occasionaiiy for relief for
some of these diEbtors.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I should like to
say to the bonourable leader of the House
that I do not think the Bill is equilabie.
There are some instances of soldier settlers
who have donc well and are able to pay their
debts.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: And have paid
them.
Oh, yes.
H1on. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But what becomes
of the unfortýunate man who is unaible to pay
his debt? The Government gives relief to
men who can hear the burden and adds to
the ioad of other men, a ioad that is already
too heavy for them. I should like to have
this Bill sent te a committee, befôre whicb
departmental officiais could be cailed and
asked for a report on each case. Where it
is found that a man is struggling along in
such adverse circumstances that it is impossihle to pay, there pro'bably would be no
objection to an extension. But as t0 men
who can well afford te pay, why say to themf,
"You wiil be ailowed credit for twite as nuch
as you psy in during the next two years"'?
I think if is inequitable in that if benefits
the successful and burdens the poor man.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we are net
abandoning anything by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I know, but the
period is to be extended for two years. My
riglit honourabie friend will remember when
a Bill was trans'mitted to this bouse from the
Commons to reduce the value of the land
and to provide for the appointment of four
or five hundred arbitrators, I obi ected and
said there must be a better way to accomplish the purpose. The Bill was referred to a
standing committee, before which. officiais of
the department appeared and said. "We have
inspec.ted thesýe lands no fewer than seven
times, and we are quite sure we cao settie, to
the satisfaction of the Government and of the
applicant. the reduction, if any, that shouid
be made."' That was done with respect fo
about 12,0OO cases. Wby should not the same
course bc foilowed now? I do flot see why the
men who inspected these lands eight or ten
times cannot report on fthc standing of flic
inidividuai farmers and their prospects. I see
no reason why the burdeýn shouid be placed
further on the poor man, and the man of
iveaith be be.nefited. I suggest f0 my hono.ur-

ALBERTA

BOND ISSUE

ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, I was asked yesterday by the right honourable the leader on
the other side if I could impart any information to this Chamber concerning the negotiations or correspondence be'tween the province
of Alberta and the Minister of Finance with
respect to the loan of a certain amount of
money to the province to meet a maturity of
this day. I desire to communicate to this

Chamber the correspondence which bas passed
between the Minister of Finance and the
Prime Minister of Alberta. As it is of some
importance, I think it should be laid before
this Chamber. I shall run through it as
rapidly as I can.
The first letter is dated at Edmonton,
March 12, and reads as follows:
Dear Mr. Dunning:I regret very much that I am obliged to
approach you again on a matter which is, I
am sure, of as much concern to yourself as
it is to me. It should hardly be necessary
for me to remind you that there is a debenture issue of $3,200,000 falling due on April 1.
I dislike very much making this approach, but
the issues are so vital that I thought I had
better communicate with you and let you know
how far I could go in regard to this maturity.
We have in the sinking fund available on
this issue $354,000, and in addition we can
add to this figure $196,000, making a total of
$550.000; the balance to be met, of $2,650.000,
we wish you would advance to us on the sane
terms and conditions as applied to our January
15 maturity.
I sent you the 1936-37 provincial budget,
which I doubt if you have had time to peruse.
You will note, however, that we have provided
for a substantial increase in revenue by additional taxation. Changing the procedure which
lias been followed in past years, we have dealt
with unemployment relief as a current income
expenditure. In view of its ceontinuing character we feel that this procedure is sound
and if our increased estimated revenue is
realized and no unforeseen expenditures of
any magnitude have to be met, we will be
in a position to finance our share of the direct
relief estimated.
Taking the budget as a whole, every effort
bas been put forth by this Government to
meet its difficult financial situation and if our
expectations are realized, we should not be
obliged later on to approach your Government
or to raise funds in any other manner to meet
the expenditures of unemployment relief, as
this Government bas done in past years.
I sincerely trust that you will see your way
elear to assist us in this matter, and would
appreciate it if you will let the writer know,
preferably by wire, whether you would desire
to go into this matter, in more detail, in
which event I will arrange to be in Ottawa a
few days before the end of this month. It
would of course be a convenience if arrangementi could be made by wire, as our Legislature is in session, and, as you know, the
Treasurer is at the beek and call of all and
sundry.
With best regards,
Yours sincerely,
C. Cockroft,
Provincial Treasurer.
On the 17th of March Mr. Dunning answered
as follows:
C. Cockroft.
Provincial Treasurer,
Edmonton, Alberta.
Your letter requesting Dominion loan te
assist you in meeting April first maturity
reached me simultaneously with Premier's
newspaper announcement that province was

104

SENATE

about to introduce legislation reducing interest
rates on outstanding debt apparently without
reference to proposed Loan Council arrangement. Announcement has already had serious
adverse effect on market particularly for
Western Provincial bonds and proposal if
carried out would nullify all efforts already
made and proposed to be made by Dominion
to protect credit of the provinces and the
Dominion as a whole. In view of action contemplated by province I do not see how I
could justify to Parliament and the country
the loan for which you are now asking.
Charles A. Dunning.
On March 19 a telegram from Mr. Dunning:
Hon. Wm. Aberhart,
Premier of Alberta,
Edmonton, Alberta.
As you know, authority to make loans or
give guarantees to provinces will expire
MIarch 31.
It is not the intention to ask
Parliament for authority to give assistance in
future in respect of maturing obligations or
for general provincial purposes. Proposed constitutional amendment implies virtually unanimous approval of provinces. As objections have
been raised by some provinces and as difficultics may arise in connection with early
maturities we wish the provinces particularly
interested to be fully cognizant of Dominion's
attitude and future policy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
date of that, again?
Hon. Mr. DANDJR<AND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Chas. A. Dunning.

The answer from Premier William Aberhart
cones on the 20th of March:
Hon. Charles A. Dunning,

Minister of Finance,
Ottawa. Ont.
Impossible financially to meet our obligation
April first. Alberta legislature will not complete its session until next week.

Urge that

arrangements be made by Federal Government for this maturity and will confer at
your convenience afterwards.
William Aberhart.
Mr. Dunning answers on the same day, the
20th of Match:
Hon. William Aberhart,
Premier of Alberta,
Edmonton, Alta.
Your wire to-day's date.
For past five
monuths Dominion has been making utmost
effort to work out with provinces solution
for financial difficulties of certain provinces.
At Dominion-Provincial Conference and subsequent meetings of Financial Committee it was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

inade abundantly clear that the Dominion
cannot consider making further loans for the
purpose of meeting provincial maturities and
cannot possibly consent to any plan which
removes from Dominion Parliament absolute
control at all times of extent to which
Dominion guarantees or loans shall be given.
In these conferences we evolved a plan whereby
provinces finding it impossible to meet existing
obligations could obtain privilege of Dominion
guarantee for refunding and new borrowing
under a Loan Council arrangement.
With
unanimous consent of representatives of all
provinces Dominion undertook to initiate steps
to secure necessary enabling powers and after
submitting proposed draft to all provinces
requisite legislation bas now been introduced
in Parliainent.
In January we agreed to
assist you in meeting a provincial maturity
because we felt that you had not at that time
Iad sufficient time to consider fully the nature
of the proposed arrangement.
As over two
montlhs have since elapsed, that reason no
longer applies. It is unreasonable to assume
that with a maturity eoming on April first
the Alberta Government bas not been giving
careful consideration to the problem thereby
created.
Yet apart from varions newspaper
statements reported to have been made by you
we have not been made aware of your attitude
to the proposed Loan Council arrangement
under which Dominion guarantee would be
available to the province. It may be that the
views of the Dominion and Alberta cannot be
reconiciled, but my telegram of yesterday was
intended to invite a final effort to avert
serious impairment of the credit of Alberta
and other Western Provinces whieh default
on your impending maturity would inevitably
cause.
Regret impossible for me to suggest
any other course.
Chas. A. Dunning.
In reply the Premier of Alberta telegrapbed
as follows:
Edmonton, Alta.,
March 21, 1936.
Chas. A. Dunning,
linister of Finance,
Ottawa, Ont.
Quite appreciate sincerity of statements in
your wire.
Replying categorically.
Agree
Dominion lias made utmost effort for last five
months.
Dominion Parliament certainly bas
riglt to absolute control of extent of guarantees and loans to provinces.
Agree conferecces
discussed
plan
regarding
refunding
existing obligations with Dominion guarantee.
ln this regard Alberta was the first to agree
to earnark certain revenues against interest
upon refunded debt in accordance with federal
Bill drafted March fourth, section three, subsection one, clauses A, B, C. Appreciate your
assistance
in
meeting
January
maturity.
Reference lapse two months we have given
consideration during this period but obviously
impossible to arrive at definite conclusion for
reason sec section one proposed Bill that
Parliament of Canada bas not defined the
terms and conditions to be prescribed by it.
We are net evading this point, but no matter
what the requirements might be, you could
hardly expect advanced definite commitment
by an
legislature on undetermined details.
Failure to advise regarding Loan Council is
explained in preceding paragraph.
We sin-

APRIL 1, 1936
cerely hope that the views of Alberta and
the Dominion can be reconciled. We appreciate your invitation and would have gladly
accepted but introduction of taxation bills and
other important Acts incident to our budget
made it imperative for Provincial Treasurer
and self to remain here until close of session.
As evidenced by ber budget Alberta is doing
everything possible to meet her obligations
with the one objective of ceasing to be a
financial burden on the Dominion. Trust you
and your colleagues will give immediate and
most serious consideration to the drafting of
the important provisions of the Loan Council
which will insure approval by our Legislature.
William Aberhart.
The Minister of Finance telegraphed the
following reply:
Ottawa, Ontario,
March 23, 1936.
Hon. Wm. Aberhart,
Premier of Alberta,
Edmonton, Alta.
Your Saturday's wire. Am glad that you
appreciate efforts made by Dominion during
past five months to meet financial difficulties
of certain provinces and also Dominion's right
to absolute control of extent of guarantees
and loans to provinces. I do not understand
your statement that Dominion bas not defined
the terms and conditions to be prescribed by
it under Loan Couneil arrangement. In meetings of Committee on Financial Questions in
whirh your Provincial Treasurer took part
these terms and conditions were fully considered and the minutes of the committee sent
to all provinces describe them in all essential
detail. Moreover the draft of the B.N.A. Act
Amendment Bill which you have seen coers
fully in legal form nature of the security to
be given by province for Dominion's security.
The only points that remain to be covered
in legal phraseology are the constitution and
powers of the individual loan councils but the
minutes referred to above should leave no
doubt about these points. In brief a council
consisting of representative named by the province and the Dominion Minister of Finance,
with the Bank of Canada Governor acting as
technical adviser, will have power to approve
any program for refunding of existing provincial debt and any future borrowing by
province before Dominion guarantee will be
given. This is the sum and substance of the
matter and I cannot conceive that there
would be any controversy over details. Am
glad to note that you hope the views of
Alberta and Dominion can be reconciled but
only a week remains for such reconciliation
and as stated in my previous wires my request
for a conference this week was to enable such
reconeliation to be made in sufficient time.
Chas. A. Dunning.
On the same day this further wire was sent:
Ottawa, March 23, 1936.
Honourable William Aberhart,
Premier of Alberta,
Edmonton, Alberta.
The Dominion Government to-day were
strongly of the view that it would not be
advisable to go forward with constitutional
amendment Bill, resolution for which is now
on the order paper, if any of the provinces

105

object to its being proceeded with. Would
you therefore please advise me at earliest
possible moment whether you object to our
proceeding further with the legislation designed
to implement decisions of the Committee on
Financial Questions and to make it possible
for any province desiring to participate in
Loan Couneil arrangement to obtain Dominion
guarantee for refunding purposes?
Charles A. Dunning.
The next day, March 24, Mr. Aberhart telegraphed from Edmonton:
Hon. Charles A. Dunning,
Minister of Finance,
Ottawa, Ont.
Will reply fully to your wires to-morrow.
William Aberhart,
Premier.
This is the reply from Mr. Aberhart under
date of March 25:
Hon. Chas. A. Dunning,
Minister of Finance,
Ottawa, Ont.
Your wire twenty-third. Reference minutes
provincial treasurers' meetings we consider conditions outlined inapplicable to assistance by
Dominion which does not extend to entire
funded indebtedness of province. Only refer
to this in substantiation of position we took
in our Saturday's wire. We have reviewed
our complete situation and taking everything
into consideration we are drafting legislation
along following lines in which we hope you
will concur and co-operate. We have in minmd
fixing an early date for the maturity of outstanding bonds bearing interest at five, five
and half and six per cent and issuing approximately sixty-seven million dollars provincial
perpetual stock, interest three per cent, for
purpose of retiring in cash or by exchange
equal total of mentioned bonds and also including all of the maturities for five or six
years so that we would have no early maturities
to provide for. It is not our intention to
include presently outstanding Alberta Government stock. We would however include all our
savings certificates. To insure due payment
of interest on stock our Dominion subsidies
would be charged with the payment of the
interest. This plan means that tht' Dominion
would incur no liability for the principal and
would be fully protected for interest by the
hypothecation of subsidies. The saving resulting from the above plus sinking fund included
in our budget would on a cash basis about
balance our total budget. May we reiterate
request for your assistance in meeting maturity
due April first to extent two million six hundred and fifty thousand dollars we providing
balance? Proposed Bill provides: first, guarantee by Canada payment principal and or interest
and or sinking fund in respect of present and or
future securities; second, empowering Lieutenant-Governor in Council create an issue perpetual provincial stock paying three per cent
interest; third, hypothecating subsidy; fourth,
accelerating maturity date existing bonds,
liolder accepting stock in exchange in full
satisfaction; fifth, to accept lawful money of
Canada in full satisfaction; sixth, Act to come
into force by proclamation.

There is important legisiation yet te be dealt
with by this Chamber in ordýDr that it may

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I am very glad te de
anything in my power te facilitate the business
of the Senate and te meet the general convenience. I may say that honeurable mcmbers frem the far East and the far West
have very i ew oppertunities of going te their
homes during the session; certainly net s0
many as have their colleagues who live within
one or twe hundred miles of the capital.
cannot be here next week if I go home fer
Easter. Se, if thero is te be a pestponement,
I should like the Bill te be dealt witb soon
after the Easter recess.
Hon. Mr. MPMEANS: 1 do not understand
why the honourable leader oi the Government'
should characterize the Bill of the honeurable
senator from King's as being less impertant
than other legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope we shah]
be able te dispose of the Bill before the end
of the session, and that the Commons wil
assent te whatever course the Senate may take
in the matter.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Perhaps the Bill wil
neyer reach the Commons.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I cannot help hew
my Bill may be characterized, but I do think
it is somewhat important.

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 24, an Act for granting
to His Ma.jesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 3lst March, 1937.
He said: Honourable members, this is the
kind of Bill which generally cornes to us at
this time from the House of Commons. Our
fiscal year ends on the last day of March,
and it is very seldom that we have the
advantage of passing the Supply Bill before
that date. Therefore e.very Government bas
to ask for interim supýply. The Bill envers
a vote of $33,862,485.15, being one-sixth of
charges and expenses of the public service for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1937.
It also covers for the same period a vote
of $2,102,371 "towards defraying the several
charges and expenses of the public service,
from the lst day of April. 1936, to the 31st
day oi March, 1937. not etherwîse provided
for, and being- one-twelfth of the amount of
each of the several items to be voted set
forth in the schedule to this Act."
The
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN:
honourable leader of the House bas told
us the purpose and meaning- of the Bill, but
net the wherefore. 1 quite understand why
a one-sixth sweep over the whole range of
Estimates was asked for before the end of
the fiscal year. it being impossible to get the
Estimates down and voted before that date
arrived. It is the se-cond part I should like
te query further. It is an additional vote
of one-twelfth, making altogether threetwelfths in respect of a certain range of

aware of the latest sentiments of the head
of the Administration, I know what his sentiments were some years ago. It will be noted
that the largest item of all. $5.583.800. is for
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In
respect of that service I should think he
would have the greatest reluctance in voting
for even the ordinary one-sixth, but ho is
asking for a special vote representing threetwelfths of the total, or an appropriation
three months in advance. Some further military items rather appal one also, but I am
quite sure after the honourable leader of
the House bas completed his explanation we
shall all understand it perfectlv. Certainly
if the Liberal Government hs received any
access of enlightenment on these subjects we
shall be very glad to have the news.

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Perhaps the
impression the honourable gentleman bas
gained from press reports is wrong, and
possibly the other House has not embedded
its real judgment in the Bill. If ho will read
section 2 ho will find it provides for the sum
of $33.000.000 odd, and describes it as follows:

I think my
right honourable friend is in error. He states
that the amount is three-twelfths.

CANADA-UNITED STATES TRADE
AGREEMENT BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill 13. an Act respecting a certain Trade Agreement between Canada and
the United States of America.

APRIL 1, 1936
Hon. RUFUS POPE: Honourable members
of the Senate, this measure, introduced by the
leader of the Government, bas been designated
a reciprocity treaty between the United States
on the one side and Canada on the other.

1 may say tbat I bave inspected it very
thoroughly, and while I can see the United
States on the one sie, for the life of me
I canoot see Canada on the ather. It is
not a fair deal.
The honourable gentleman referred ta an
ancient reciprocity treaty wbîch was in farce
from 1854 ta the carly sixties. My honourable friend knows full well that at that time,
as bas been pointed out by tbe leader on this
side of the House, there was a civil war going
on in the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said sa.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Nevertbeless it is a fact;
and we were able ta seli ta them products
whicb tb.ey wanted and could not raise
for tbemselves. As they had ta attend ta tbe
war, they could not do very mueb farming,
and therefore they had ta buy wbat tbey
required. Tbe nearest agricultural country
to tbem was Canada, and for a wbile we did
a very good trade with them. But the time
came when that treaty was donc away with.
Since that time various government leaders
froma Sir John7 A. Macdonald do'wn have tried
ta make treaties with the United States, but
alI have failed up ta the present time. On
this occasion the gentleman who went down
ta Washington, the Prime Minister, was
well known to be a very sympathetic fricnd
of the United States of America.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All of us are.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I am not. I like goad
neighbours, but I do nat like bad anes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am sarry.
Hon. Mr. POPE: You need flot be sorry;
you should be delighted that there is anc
man who will stand up oni the floor of Parliament in your presence and, in tbe interest
of Canada, make the facta known. The
honourable gentleman knaws where I came
fram and knows my ancestral line. 11e knaws
that my forbears were driven from the United
States to Canada. They were driven tbraugb
the forest and settled in the wilderness of
Canada on the very spot wherc 1 arn living
to-day.
The United Sta:tes to-day are the same kind
of neighbaurs they always have been. In
days gone by, and right up ta the present
time, I have been told over and over again
by men in very bigh authority that an effort
of this character ia only a stepping-stone to

-109

annexation. What did Mr. Taf t say a *few
years ago? H1e said, "Canada is at the parting of the ways." But we did flot comply with
Mr. Taft's suggestion. We did nlot part; we
stayed rîght here, and stili are here.
if you will examine this arrangement you
wilI plainly sec that it is ail for the benefit
of the United States of America. Take any
item you like. Take, for instance, potatoes,
or pork, or cod from the fisheries of the lower
provinces. Honourable mnembers, I presume,
know as weIl as I do what the Secretary of
Agriculture of the United States said the
other day in making a speech to bis people.
Here it is:
The United States Secretary of Agriculture,
Hon. Henry Wallace, was quoted in the debate
as holding out to American farmers that not
only would they be able te find a large market
for pork in Caniada, hut that they would also
be able to participate indirectly in the benefits
hitherto reserved to Canada under the Ottawa
In the past couple of years the
agreements.
United States, in order to maintain park
prices et ahl, have had no alternative to
destroying hundreds of thousands of hoge.
Hon. Mr. Wallace now holds out the prospect
of the States being able to ship its surplus
pork to Canada in future. Such a development cornes fortunately for the American
administration since the Supreme Court in
Washington has recently declared the A.A.A.,
under which the slaughterings were carried
out, unconstitutional.
There is the position placed clearly before you
by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United
States.
I remember very well what happened in my.
own case a few years ago, whcn people from
the United States, in order ta get a market
for pigs and pork, used ta smuggle tbem across
the line into tbe province of Quebec. Thcy
even wcnt s0 far as ta make arrangements
with some Canadian farmers ta take those pigs
for a week, and cail themn their own, and then
send them alive or dead ta the city of Montreal. That went on until the customs officers
discovered what was happening.
What took place prier to the putting on
of duties in the last sessiun of Parliament
under Sir John A. Macdonald? As a man
who was engaged in the lumber business at
that time, and who had to bave a carload of
barrelled pork, I shahl tell you. The pork
had ail been coming from Chicago. When the
six-cents duty was, imposed by Sir John Macdonald not another barrel of pork fram the
United States was seen in aur community.
If you go across the international line ta
the New England States, which origînally
were settlcd by people wbo came from. foreign
lands, you will find the old farms descrted
and neglected, and if you go up and down the
country througb the forest, as I bave done,
you will see tbe remains of stone walls built

110

SENATE

by -those settiers hundreds of years ago. What
was it that drove the people away? It was
the meat factories of Chicago. Is that an
example that we should copy?
There have been only three important
events in the history of Canadian financial
affairs. First there wvas Confederation, when
George Brown joined with us, and the people
of ail the provinces were brought together;
next there xvas the National Policy; and
flnally there ivas the trade arrangement within
the British Empire, ail brought about by the
Liberal-Conservative party, and not by the
party of rny honourabie friend and his dodging
prophets, who prophesy first and dodge when
the time cornes to take the responsibility. I
arn sure that when Mackenzie King went
down to Washington he had nothing to do but
sign. He was told, "Sign here," and he
signed; then lie went suuth fur fais health.
It was a wonderful effort that he put forth
on hehaîf of the financiai, industrial and agricultural interests of Canada!
By letting in the pork which has been referred to by the Secretary of Agriculture you
are going to drive us fremn our own home
mnarket. The quality of this pork will net be
equal to ours, unless it js irnproved, because,
as was said by the honourable gentleman frorn
M~,arquet.te (Hon. Mr. Mullins) the othe.r day,
people in the United States do not fatten
pork in the sarne way that we do. The feed
is passed through the sterrs. and the pie-s
follow and pick up what the steers have
not digestcd. It is very tempting to Canada
te he fed on pork that cornes from the
manurial fields of the United States. Yet you
say that 1, who arn raising pigs in Canada,
should allow such produets te corne in here at
a cent and thrce-quarters.
I de net and cannot support the treaty. I
cannet even support the principle of it,
because 1 de net believe in it or in the sincerity
of it. What is the situation in the United
States? There are ferty-eight states, each
running- its ow n show, and yen are trying
te make a trade arrangement with the central
Geveroment. You cannot do it. Such an
arrangement wxill net stand. The influence
of the varions states will ho brought te bear
îahen and where it is desired; therefore yen
rannot make a substantial, permanent agreement with the United States. Take their
crirninal law, for instance. A man rnay be a
free citizen on this side of the lino and a
crirninal on the other side. I discovered this
te my very great astonishrnent many years
ago. Vot you think that you can make an
everlasting- trade treaty with the people of
that country. What is the use of two or three
yo'irs' trado under such an arrangement? I

Thank yen.
Ilonourable
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
senaters. I think the treaty before us should
bhe xarnined and weighed frem a business
peint of 'view, se that \ve miglit ascertaio,
if possible. whether or net Canada receives
the equivalent. or practically the equivalent,
of the advantagos whichi it concedes. That
is the first peint that has appeared te me as
essential te a study cf the measure.
The second peint we should settle is this.
EN-en if we do net get the better of the
bargain. are we better off with the treaty
than w'e should ho without it?
I arn botind te say that I have a great
deal of syrnpathy for any Goverenent. the
one at present in office as well as any of ifs
predecessors, which has tried te enter loto a
trade agreemnent witb the United States.
"Ego nommeor leo."
They are a rich and
rnîghty people, and are very exacting with
respect te the terms of treaties.
May I make a few rernarks parenthctically
te illustrate what T mean?
In 1921 I was
requestcd te negeotiate a ternperary trade
treaty with France. Our Governent stipulated that I should exact ail the advantages
that the treatv then revoked had given us.
and should concede in return nothing but the

APRIL 1, 1936
benefits of the intermediate tariff. Now,
honourable senators, the rates under our intermediate tariff have been very generously
applied by Canada to imports from a great
many nations. So when we offer the advantages of that tariff to any country, what we
mean is that such country may have the
privilege of sharing those advantages with
other nations. At first I was rather nonplussed at the proposition, but this is what I
said to the French Minister: "Can we not
agree to a treaty in principle and have
details worked out by specialists?
Will
France grant to Canada the best advantages
that it grants to any other foreign nation?
If so, Canada will extend to France concessions as great as are extended to any coun,
try other than a part of the British Empire." That was accepted in principle. But
what did I find? I asked France to pull
out of its vaults every treaty that it had
made. and there was one entered into with
the United States which gave our mighty
neighbour not only every privilege that had
been accorded to Canada, but, besides, special
rates on a long Iist of -items, for which extra
concessions the Americans had paid nothing
at all. And we were bleeding ourselves to
the last drop in order to obtain advantages
that we sought.
Now will honourable members allow me
to submit an outline of what I consider to be
the advantages and disadvantages of this
treaty? I have here some statistics presented
in tabular form. Let us see what Canada gets.
On both sides lists of specific reductions have
been made. Let us appIy these reductions to
a standard year. Unless we do that, they
will mean nothing to us. I should be very
much surprised if anyone would pretend to
say exactly what beneficial or injurious results
will follow to either of the contracting parties
to this treaty, unless his calculations were
based on the trade for a certain year. Now
-I thought it would be wise to adopt as a
standard the year which I think was taken
by my honourable friend the leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). That is, for
Canada the year ending March 31, 1929, and
for the United States the year ending June 30,
1929. That twelve-months period is one with
respect to which we can make a fair comparison as to trade between these two countries.
Now let us look at specific reductions and
see what we get. Of course, reductions granted
to us are mostly on natural products. Let us
not forget that. I know that trade in natural
products is absolutely essential to every
country, and especially to our own. At the
same time we should bear in mind that that
kind of trade is not the kind which yields the

largest profit. Running rapidly through this
list, I see that the extent of the trade in
some items with respect to which reductions are given to us is: cattle, $11,400,000;
cream, $5,200,000; maple sugar, $2,300,000;
seeds, $2,000,000; other agricultural products,
$4200,000; fish, $4,800,000; lumber, $38,000,000
-that is a concession of importance; minerals,
$5,800,000; and miscellaneous, that is, small
items of all kinds, $5,000,000. The total of
these is a little more than $78,000,000. But
I have omitted one item, and I did so because
it is, as we say in algebra, an unknown
quantity: that item is whisky. In 1929 we
had no trade in whisky; so we do not know
what the reduction is worth to us. The
maximum possible value of whisky exports
from Canada is $82,000,000, because that is
the value of the total quantity of matured
liquor in this country available for shipment
abroad. By adding this figure to the total
I have already given, we get a grand total
And the total value of
of $160,000,000.
American imports with respect to which we
grant specific reductions is $166,000,000.
Before I go into details of imports from
the United States, let me say this. Not only
is the value of our annual exports of whisky
to the United States under this treaty unknown, but the trade is certain to be shortlived. The Americans are not going to allow
Canadian whisky to come into their country
longer than they can help it. For the time
being their spirituous liquors are not sufficiently matured and they have to buy from
us, but, if my information is correct, United
States laws do not require, as our laws do,
that whisky shall be matured for four years
before being sold. So honourable senators
will see that more than half of the value of
our exports with respect to which we get
reductions is subject to discontinuation at
any time. As I have already said, it is certain
to be shortlived.
Let us glance at the imports from the
United States on which we give specific reductions. The 1929 figures are: oranges, $21,000,000; other fruits and vegetables, $11,000,000; canned fruits and vegetables, 3,000,000;
corn, $8,000,000, and other agricultural products, $4,000,000. Then we come to manufactured products, on which the profits are
larger, and for the making of which large
sums are paid out in wages. The items of manufactured goods are: farm implernents, 40,000,000; machinery, $25,800,000; iron and steel,
$15,700,000; household goods, furniture, and
so on, $11,000,000; electric motors, $6,900,000;
periodicals, $4,000,000, and other merchandise

SENATE
The total of this
of ail kinds, $16,000,000.
Arnerican trade on whjch we grant spécifie
rcéductions is $166,000,000.
It will be seen that these figures of trade
between the two countries practically balance,
so long as we include arnong our own exports
$82.000,000 for whisky; but tbat business,
wbicb is more than bal our total, may be discontinucd at any tirne because of the conditions to wbicb I bave already referred.
Taking tbis into considération, it will be
seen that the concessions we give are practically twice as large as those we receive, in
so far as tbese specific reductions are concerned.
The question is often asked whetber it
xxiii ever be pos~sible for us to get a quid pro
quo for wbat we give to the United States.
And now 1 corne to another feature of the
treaty, under which certain items are unchanged and are fixed for three years. I wanýt
to be frank witb the House, and I arn bound
to say that w'ben these items are totalled they
appear to make a very favourable sbowing
for Canada. The unchanged items corning
from the United States into this country are:
raw cotton, $29,000,000, and other items,
which 1 do not need to enumerate, $9,000000atotal of $38,000,000. That seems a reasonable enoughi surn. But when 1 saw the total
of our unchanged items going into the United
States I w'as astonished, for the 1929 value
of our items on whicb we are assured the
United States will not increase the tariff
for three years xvas nu less than S227,000,000.
However, wben one studies the tbing a
littie more closely one finds the explanation
for this apparently large concession is a
simple one. ODf
that total, newsprint accounts
for no less than $132,000,000. Well, as everyone knows, Americans are getting our paper
below cost. That is diue, I arn bound to say,
to the stupidity of those in our country who
are responsible for the direction of the great
industries manufacturing
that commrodity.
Americans are steadily eating into our forests.
Would any Governinent at Washington dare
to pass législation imposing a tax on ncwsprint? Why, thé whole Press of the United
States would join in protesting such action.
So we see that Unele Sam was not calied
upon to make a very great sacrifice with
respect to that $132,000.000.
Also incbiuded in that total of $227,000.000
are pulp and pulpwood, $34,000,000.
With
respect to this item also the Arnericans would
flot be foolish enough ýto imnpose a tax. for
our pulpwood, wbich they get at an extremely
low price, is essential to thcrn.
iln

NBr BEAUtRIEN.

Then there is a figure of $16,000,000 for
mineraIs also included in that seemingiy big
conces.sion wbich we get from the United
States. This item is made up of ashestos,
nickel. and probably other metals which industries in ýthe United States require from
us.
Subtràcting the figures for newsprint, pulpwood and mineraIs, wbich total $182.000.000,
we find the value of Canadian sbipments
untler this part of the treaty is $45,600000.
The eoncessions wbich we give are on items
totalling $38,000,000. So it will be seen that
the tutals are virtually equal.
Now. bonourable senators, I corne to a
concession wbich I con,,ider extrernely serions.
The Governrnent bas given to the United
States tbe benefits of our intermediate tariff,

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I do nut know,
but I am sure that if Mr. Bennett offered
that he asked a higb price for it.
Hunourable senaturs who were members of
this House frorn 1921 to 1930 will rernember
that tirne and tirne again we called the
attention of the Governoment of that day
to tbeir disguised and insidious rnetbod of
reducing the tariff. The rnetbod was also, a
clever une, tbougbi net équitable.
Tbey
b;rougbt in little bills, sometimes containingperbaps baîf a page of printed malter, stating
simpiy tbat Canada extended tu surb and
sucb a country-Italy, Czecboslovakia, and
practically every uther country in Europethe rnost-favoured-natiun clause in return for
an equal advantage to Canada from tbe other
country concerned.
In every une of those
countries there were a number of industries
requiring favoured treatment. and our Governmcnt slasbed the tariff to suit the needs
of sucb industries.
Su eur tariff wali was
beiug dcrnolisbed brick b ' brick, and a
flood1 cf merebandise frorn ail ux er the world
was puuring intu Canadian markets. with
tbe resuit that manufacturera wbo bad beon
in business in tbis country for years and
gave empicyment to large numbers of our
citizpn7 werc unable to witbistand tbe coinpétition.
The situation was bad enoug-h in 1930.
Wbat is it like nuxx? I dare say that there
ino other country in tbe w rld wbich proN'ides such dangerous competition for uur

APRIL 1, 1936
industries as does the United States. We
could perhaps meet the competition of glassware and boots manufactured in Czechoslovakia, for that country is a great distance
from our market, and, so far as its boots
are concerned, our people will not wear them.
But every honourable member having the
slightest experience of business knows that
the manufacturers of the United States are
competitors against whom it is virtually
impossible for us to compete. This was
evidenced in 1930. Before the Government
of Mr. King fell from power Canada imported from the United States about
$900.000,000 worth of goods, two-thirds of
which, or $600,000,000 worth, represented
manufactured products. At that time our
competitors there had no such advantage as
they are given by this trade agreement. Indeed, they needed no advantage. Honourable senators. particularly those living near
the international boundary, know very well
how the manufacturers of thc United States
used to invade our markets. Honourable
members are aware that even with the present
tariff it is difficult to protect our industry.
I am not going beyond the truth when I
say that that is common knowledge.
Let me give an instance. If we ever had a
natural market for our manufactured goods,
surely we had for agricultural implements.
Half of our population live on farms, need
agricultural implements, and buy them
readily. Yet everyone knows that without
protection for agricultural implements we cannot compete with the United States. That
statement cannot be disputed, and for a very
simple reason. If you manufacture and sell
a certain number of units you can pay your
fixed charges, and beyond that point as you
increase your production and sales you enter
the sphere of profit. Well, where we sell a
hundred units our competitors in the
States sell a thousand. Every business man
who have substantially reduced their cost
I have in mind certain of our manufacturers
who have substantially reduced their cost
of production per unit and increased their
sales, and they have made colossal fortunes.
What was the position in 1930? The manufacturers of the United States, enjoying higher
protection and greater sales volume than do
our manufacturers, flooded our market with
$900,000,000 worth of goods, $600,000,000 worth
of which competed directly with our own
manufactured products.
I do not say this disparagingly, but it has
always struck me as being very strange that,
traditionally, the Liberal party has in a sense
always been opposed to our manufacturers.
My honourable friends opposite know this to
be a fact. Why is this? Is not manufac-

113

turing a legitimate vocation in Canada? Are
Canadian manufacturers of negligible account?
Our primary production represents a value of
$1,400,000,000, and our secondary production,
into which of course manufacturing entersand
is much the larger part, reaches a value of

$1,500,000,000. These are Government statis-

tics and cannot be questioned. I am not far
from the truth when I say that of this
se.condary production our manufactures represent at least $1,200,000,000, or, in round
figures, $1,000,000,000. Why has the Liberal
party always had a grievance against our manufacturers?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Against high
protection.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Ahl that is my
honourable friend's way of putting it. When,
however, the Liberal party pares down protection in respect to the products of agriculture it is much more moderate than when
dealing with the products of manufacture.
Why this should be I have never been able to
understand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The first is
natural, the other is artificial.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very good; I am
very glad my honourable friend gives me that
opening. Does he know that our rubber
goods are among our best selling articles in
foreign trade? We produce neither rubber nor
cotton. We have to manufacture our rubber
goods from imported raw materials.
A few months before Sir Wilfrid Laurier
died I said to him: "Sir Wilfrid, I have the
greatest respect for you. Why is it that in
this country we cannot agree on a fiscal policy?
We have many other things to quarrel about,
but why can we not agree on that? Both
Conservatives and Liberals are interested in a
tariff policy not only economically, but politically. Fifty per cent of our population live
in cities and towns and depend directly or indirectly on Canadian industry." I never could
understand why we cou-Id not agree on a fiscal
policy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend did not give Sir Wilfrid's answer.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am sorry. Sir
Wilfrid said, "Well, I should be prepared to
agree to protection for all industries whose
raw materials are produced in Canada." I
replied, "Sir Wilfrid, you would not go far
with such a tariff poliýcy." Think of the many
commodities that we export. For instance,
our sugar refiners import raw cane sugar from
the West Indies and the Southern States, and
export a large quantity of the refined product. If we run through the items that
make up our exports we shall come to the con-

12745-8

clusion that the origin of the raw materials
has flot a great deal to do with the matter.
But ex en if il bad, tell me, why should we
deprive Canada of revenue as preejous as that
derix cd from any industry employing large
numbers of men? Whether or flot we import
our raw materials. their manufacture gives our
people a full dinner pail every day.
But I corne back to 1930. When the Liberal
party retjred froni office we were imiporting,

of this t.reaty?
Let me conclude with this very sincere
wish. which, it seems to me, should be the
wish of every Canadian. Let us forget the
differences there may be between us, and the
political ambitions back of those differences
-ambitions prevalent in another place, flot in
this House. I hope-and let us consider
our cconomic policy apart from and above
ail political ideas, principles, and particularly
ambitions.
This treaty, 1 very much fear,
will work harmn to Canada. We shahl again

gone through have bad one good resuit: our
people who before the depression turned
their faces southward have corne back home
again. We have had to feed thern. of course,
but we have had therm witb us. If conditions
in the United States improve, and if our
workmcn have no work bere and no pay
envelopes on Saturday by reason of the fact
that our industry has been t-ansferred across
the line, the exodus will begin again and we
shall se the trains and station platforms
packed with our workmen going to, the United
States.
We shall sec flot only workmen,
but farmers, with their poor. mean furniture,
setting eut for the United States by tbousands because people in this country cannot
buy their produets. I do flot want to revert to
the past. My bonourable friend knows how
terribly truc is the picture 1 have drawn. Now
that we bave experience to guide us, let us
ascertain how this treaty is going to work, and
let us stoýp it as soon as we find that it is
de-trimental to the life and w*elfare of our
country.

Hon.

W.

A. BUCHANAN:

Honourable

senators, I bad flot intended participating in
this debate, but after Iistening to the honourable gentleman who bas .iust taken bis seat, I
felt that some attempt sbould ho made to
answcr the question whicb he askcd witb respect to the reciprocity agreement on two or
three occaaîons. narnely, "What doos it inean?"
During the lest week or so I have tried to
establish what it actually does mean, and to
determine whetber or flot it is of any value to
Canada. On going over the trade returos for
the flrst two months under the trade agreement I found that the situation was
somewhat like this. Imports from the United
States in the month of January, 1%35,
arnounted to 823,157,000, and for the month of
February in the same year to $23,489,000.
The figures for the sarne two months in 1936
were as follows: January, 826,285,000; February, $25,975,000; or an increase of direct im12745--SI

115

ports from the United States of more than
$5,000,000.
But wbat about exports; fromn Canada te the
United
States? In January,
1935, they
amounted te $17,529,000, and in Febcuary of
the same year to 815,574,000. In January of
1936 they amounted to $20,130,000, and in
February to $21,555,000; an increase of about
$8.000,000.
I know the response of those, who are
criticizing the agreement will be that there bas
been an improvement of trade despite the
reciprocity agreement. Tbere bas been a
graduai improvernent for six or twelve tnontbs,
but as far as the particular articles affected by
this agreement are concerned, I find upon
comparing tbis yea.r with hast year that
Canada bas been benefiting to a considerable
degrce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Would the
honourabie gentleman permit me? Has he
figures before bim to show how much of the
increase cf our experts is due te the increased
export of newsprint and pulp, wbich are not
affected by the agreement at ail?
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I arn corning to
the point of the items mentioned in the agreement, to show the increase that bas taken place
there. For tbé first two montbs of 1935 we
shipped to the United States catthe te a value
of $367,000; for the sarne months in 1936,
under the agreement, we sbipped to the
United States cattle to a value of 81,124,000,
or almest three tirnes as mucb. Alcobolie
beverages a year ago arnounted to 81,058,000
for the first two rnonths, and for tbe sarne
two months of this year te 83,451,000. The
value of fish exported te the United States
for the first two months of 1M3 amounted te
$1,689,000; for the sarne two months of 1936
te $2,195,000. Phanks and boards amnounted
to $760,000 in the first two months of hast year,
and te $1,370,000 for the first two rnonths of
this year.
Now, I arn geing to be fair and give the
trade returns in se far as imports frorn the
United States are concerned. Machinery imported for the first twe montbs of 1935
arnounted te $2,311,000; for the first two
months of 1936 te $3,594,000. Farmn impIements were imported during the first two
months cf 1935 te a value of 8517,000; during
the first two months of 1936 to a value of
$744,000. The imperts of furniture for tbe
same two months in 1935 amounted te 8271,000,
and in 1936 te 8329,000. Fruits were imported to a value of $1,323,000 in 1935, and in
1936 to, a value of $1,682,000.
I give these figures te show that in the first
fwo months the agreement bas heen of henep6t.

SENATE
I arn prnpared to admit that the agreement
lias flot mie:isured up to my desires, for I
should haxve likcîi to see it extenýded to a much
gî-cate- deîc,
it I arn prepared to say that
if shows the possihility of dex-eloping trade;
and if in the dcx clopment of tradc we are
increasrng the purchasing power of the producers cf Canada wc are going to do something towards reviving industry tbroughout
the country.
When I hear advocates of high protection
for our inanufacturing industries. no mnatter
where situated, I oftcn wondcr whether theywouid adi ocate a prohibitive or almnost prohibitive duty against coal corning into this
country fromn the United States, If such a
poliey iverc adopted, wliat would it mean?
If would îaaean the crnployment of thousands
of coal rniners in British Columbia, Alberta
and the Maritime Provinces. who are now
unemployed.
But we of the West do flot

APRIL 1, 1936
the direction in which the treaty moves,"--a
declaration which was heartily applauded by
the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder).
Yes, the treaty is a step in the right direction, and the population of every province in
this Dominion will soon be able to enjoy its
benefits. British Columbia, which possesses
as much standing timber as all the other
provinces combined, is already enjoying its
benefits: many lumber mills which had been
closed for some years have been put into
operation, and the population is happy.
A great deal has been heard about the
Prairie Provinces. I leave it to members
living in that part of the country to express
their appreciation of what has been accomplished by the treaty.
From the province of Quebec there come
hearty expressions of appreciation of the
productivity which already has resulted from
this agreement. I have here a statement that
the province of Quebec rejoices at the adoption of the treaty, and will profit particularly
by the concessions which have been made
respecting lumber, newsprint, and so on.
Under protection the industry was going down
very rapidly.
The Speech from the Throne delivered at
the opening of the session of the Legislature
in Prince Edward Island the day before
yesterday approves of this treaty with the
United States. It says:
Although this treaty has been in operation
for only a short time, it has already conferred
great benefits upon the producers of our province in many directions.
Ontario, like the other provinces of the
Dominion, will benefit from the treaty. In
every province, I may say, prosperity has
already increased, and the people are preparing for better conditions.
There is one provision which bas been
referred to many times, namely, that the
most-favoured-nation treatment can be modified according to the wish of Canada. This
is a very great advantage.

Time will settle many questions that are
now in doubt. Expansion of trade secures
prosperity. It keeps the wheels of industry
turning and creates employment. The greater
the volume of exports and imports the greater
is the traffic on our railroads. Sales that
we make abroad pay for goods that we bring
in. The railroads require more employees,
more money is put into circulation and the
people as a whole benefit. I believe that
by the time we return to our places here
next year we shall all feel that this treaty
bas proved to be in the best interests of
the country.

I thank you, honourable senators, for your
kind attention.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
May I ask if
my honourable friend is the only one who
intends to discuss this Bill to-morrow?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I have heard. I do not know.

So far as

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If any other
honourable senator desires to speak this
afternoon, there is time yet.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable members
of the Senate, perhaps I might be allowed to
take advantage of this opportunity to make
a few observations with respect to the Bill
before us. It would be most unfortunate if
the idea were broadcast throughout this country that either of our political parties was
opposed to a fair measure for reciprocal
trade with the United States. Both parties
seem to have been willing to support such
a measure ever since the cancellation of the
treaty of 1866, to which the honourable
leader of this House referred when speaking
to his motion. I was greatly interested in
his review of efforts that have been made
by both political parties on different occasions
to bring about a satisfactory agreement.
If I have any criticism to offer to-day it
will be, not of the fact that an arrangement
for reciprocal trade with the United States
of America bas been entered into, but rather
of some of the terms and their effect upon
the constituency which I had the honour of
representing for a great many years in the
other Chamber. That constituency is in
New Brunswick and runs parallel with the
state of Maine for a distance of about one
hundred and fifty miles. For long years
down there we and our American neighbours
have enjoyed the fullest measure of reciprocity in matters spiritual and social. Our
young men have gone across the line, married
American girls and brought them into Canada; and young Americans have come into
our country, married Canadian girls and taken
them back to the States. It is not an
uncommon thing on Sunday to see automobiles from the American sid,. of the border
lined up in front of our churches, nor is it
at all unusual to see Canadian automobiles
parked outside American churches. I can
jump into' a car at my home and within
twenty-five or thirty minutes be at Caribou,
Fort Fairfield, Presqu'île or Houlton, all of

118

SENATE

which are thrix ing fcwns in the state of
Maine.
My purpoý(r in rising is to cail the attention
of this Chamber to the unfair way in whieh
one of the chief industries of that part of
New Brunswick in whiech I live has been
treated under this trade agreement. We have
always lookod forward to the time when we
might have a mutual trade arrangement with
the New England states, whereby we cold
exchange natural products of New Brunswick on the markets of Boston, New York
md other places which we could an easily
reachi by either rail or water. Speakers preceding me have told of the different United
States tariffs that were put into effeet from
timo to time, until duties against our goods
entering the Amerîcan market became almost
prohibitive. Other countries also raised their
tariffs against us, until it was abs(>lutely
imi-possible to dispose of our surplus production abroad. In those ciccumstances thece
wa but one thing for the people of Canada

do honourable senators appreciate the _significunce of this reduction? Seed planting in the

at latest by February. Therefore it will be
seen that this concession is of very little
benefit. This season we have shipped to the
United States from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island 1,336 cars of
s'ed potatoes; last season we shipped 1,366
cars-or 30 cars more than we have sent since
this trade agreement went into effect. That
is the situation.
I had expected my good friend from Antigonish (Hon. Mr. Duff) to speak of the
wonderful improvement in the fish trade by
reason of the privileges gran'ted to his province by this so-called reciprocal trade agreement. I had expected also that my honourable friend from Prince Edward Island (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair) would tell us just how the
farmers of the Island feel with reference to
this same arrangement. I listened recently
in the other House to the honourable member for the city of Saint John state that the
people of New Brunswick were 100 per cent
behind this treaty. At the same time he
must have known that various boards of
trade in New Brunswick had passed resolutions protesting against it so far as it affects
the potato industry. Indeed, those resolutiens were before him at the time. He knew
very well that representations had been made
to the Minister of Agriculture at Ottawa. I
knew it too. Therefore it did seem to me
rather peculiar that he should make a statement so contrary to the facts.
The value of this trade arrangement will,
to my mind, be measured at the expiration of
three years by the money that goes from this
side of the line to the American side, and
the sum that comes from the United States
to Canada. If the result is that the wage
earners of this country are deprived of the
money which enables them to fill their dinner
pails, and it is placed in the hands of American workmen, then, I submit, the people of
Hon. Mr. SMITH.

Canada will become tired of the arrangement
and will voice their resentment in no uncertain sound.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The essence
of the point I was making was that the
amount asked for is one-sixth of the whole
plus one-twelfth of a part. My honourable
friend's idea was that it was only one-twelfth
of that part, but he now secs that it is threetwelf-ths, the one-twelfth being in addition to
the one-sixth. Was this one-twelfth put in as
a consequence of a complaint by the Leader
of the Opposition? If so, he was certainly
misled.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose the
explanation was given in the other House.
The only explanation I can give is that in
the first month of the fiscal year the expenditure on these items is generally larger than
it is throughout the following months. That
is why one-twelfth more is needed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I just want to
ascertain whether the honourable member can

was not misled.

(Translation):

Hon. Mr. SAUVE (Translation): May I be
permitted also to express my satisfaction at
seeing the honourable leader of the Governnient (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) resun'e his
ministerial duties with a vigour that everyone
admires. As to the right honourable leader
on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meigben), the
manner in whicb hie commands the attention
and respect of the wbole House is in itself a
h.igher tribute of admiration. than eould be
expressed in eloquent words.
At this stage of the debate it is rather
difficult for any one to avoid traversing ground
already covered. The agreement has been
examined, in ail its various aspects by
economists and experienced business men. I
shaîl therefore confine my remarks to general
considerations, as well as te certain aspects of
the Agreement and its possible effects.
Both our domestic an.d our international
problems have been aggravated by the protracted duration of a crisis believed te, be due
to a universal excess of nationalismn likely to
result in disaster. The continuous disputes and
enervating conflicts of the oid civilization in
Europe, apparently blinded by too muà. light,
are becoming more and more unhearabie. In
the opinion of patriotie Christians of the New
World, mankind has ne.ed of other things than
manifestations of national selflshness and injustice or the exhausting of public treasuries
to build treniches for spreading hatred and
waging war. That is wby in recent years the
Government.g of Canada and the 1Tnited
States have realized more and, more the
n.eces.sity of strengthening, through a commercial tre-aty, their relations as dictated by
good neighbourliness and common interest.

123

As a meruber of the Goveirnment which
initiated the negotiations in that connection
in 1934, 1 know they were actuated by a
national spirit and -our Can.adian ministers
were above ail desîrous of iniproving our
trade and political relations with our neighbou-rs in the great republic of the United
States, as well as with the British Empire
and any other country willing to negotiate
on reasonable ternis with Canada. At Washington, at the London and Ottawa conferences,
in fact, everywhere, the Bennett Governmenit
s9tood by their policy of "Canada first."
No other Canadian Go.vernment ever signed,
in -a period of ten, years, as many treaties,
agreements or conventions as were concluded
by the Bennett Administration in the five
years they were in office.
Hon. Mr. PARENT

now dealing with trade agreements, and it is
from that stancipoint. I amn sorry my hionourable friend did not; get the meanýing of my
statement.
Following the negotiations referred to, the
new Government elected by the people after
an unusually coniplicated contest' hastened to
conclude, not; a free trade treaty as was advoeated by its followers, but an agreement on
the basis of very moderate protection.
Whether the agreemnent be but preliminary
or short-lived because of its lack of reciprocity
or its inadequacy of protection, the experiment is nevertheless acceptable as a first
attempt.
The Prime Minister bas frankly admitted
that the negotiations were ma-de mucb easier
by the work of the Bennett Goverument. As
a member of the late Goverament I appreciate
that evidence of franknes and sincerity. But
does this admission not prove that the Conservative Government, altbough it aiways
reeognized the necessity of adequate protection
for our country, was by no mieans opposed te
limnited. reciprocity? Everything was te depend upon the ternis. There is the question
to, be delbated. The méasure before us is
simply an agreement with unequal concessions. It is not a treaty of adequate reciprocity, the benefits being not mutual. Recently
an American financier stated tbat the King
Government considered the agreement good
for Canada, and in the opinion of President
Roosevelt it wvas an excellent one for the
United States. Good for one country, but
excellent for the other. Tbat gives approximately an idea as te the value of the agreement.

124

SENATE

The agreement, J repeat, has some good
points; it is proper that we should admit and
appreciate tiat. But is there enough good
in it te offset the disadvantages?
Is the
agreement not such as to cause anxiety for
the future of our economic structure, which
is based on protection for our two great
national industries, agriculture and manufacturing. from which the worker gets the money
that enables hi
to buy what lie needs as a
consumer? That is the question that is being
asked. This agreement does not give u.s what
we got in the Underwood tariff of 1913, under
the Taft and Borden Goverunients, nor even
what was conceded to us by the FordneyMcCumber tariff prior to 1930, under the
Coolidge-King Administrations. We are the
losers. In any event, let us give the agreement a fair trial, such being the wish of the
majority in the Government that is responsible to the Canadian people. At the sane
tinie let us watch closely its immediate
effects. The Minister of Finance admits the
pos-ibility of changes. Let us hope they will
not be prevented by a refusal on the part of
the Americans or the prejudiced consumer.
Canadian agriculture especially, in its own
interest, is certain to denand sonie niodifications betore it beînce.s fatally affected.
I
think

(onces-

sions made by ouir Government to the United
States we shouîld have secured better ternis
with

to

our

hores,

our

food products, our vegetables, etc.
For
instance, whien entering the United States,
Canadian hay is subject te a duty of $3, while
on American hay imported into Canada the
rate of duty is only $1.75. The price of hay
in tiis ceountrv 'anges from $4 to $6 a ton.
Our creani and consequently our butter are
more seriously affected under the ncw agreement, whiclh places us in a worse situation
than tiat prevailing prior to 1930, the duty
on cream being increased by five cents, which
means a dutv of 8 cents on our butter. There
is no market for our hot-house lettuce, whieli
even now is practically given away. The
same applies to cabbages and carrots. With
the arrival of American carrots the price of our
autumin product lias dropped to 25 cents a
bag of 80 pounds. The Government's answer

American farmer feels the need of protection
for liimelf, why should our own farier be
left at his mercy in our own country?
Hon. Mr. PARENT (Translation): What
are the products imported from Canada by
the United States?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE (Translation): The honounable member might be sent as a delegate
to study the situation in the United States.
The county of Laval-Two
Mountains,
wliere I live, lias become one of the richest
gardens of the Canadian metropolis, and a
few days ago its importance and beauty were
extolled by a little bard before the Government and the members of the House of Commens. But the market gardencrs of that county
vill demand more than the clever but sarcastic
answer given by the Minister of Finance. Market gardening is necessary to our local market.
It bas increased with the wonderful expansion
of transport facilities aind the developient
of motor-trucking. while, on the other hand,
the motor vehicle bas dcalt a severe blow
to general farming, which lias been affected
by the weakening of the market for such
produits as hiay, oats, straw, lior-e-, etc.

are two kinds of products: market gardening
products and general farm products.
Hon. Mr. PARENT (Translation): Do the
figures deal particularly with hot-bed farming
rather than with natural products froin the
soil proper?

but is the Canadian farmer to be ruined? Is
he net essential to Canada? In order to
dispose of a hundred pounds of potatoes in
the United States market our farmer is
compelled to pay 75 cents, wliereas the
American farmer does net pay a cent of duty
on his potatoes, which begin to invade our

Hon. Mr. SAUVE (Translation): That is
net what I was endeavouring to emphasize.
I shall be pleased to discuss the point with
the honourable member in a few moments.
The time will come when market gardening
will be a serious problem in Canada, a problom which may call for the establishment
of farming zones with appropriate mcasures
of protection. Even at the present time it is
questionable whether the Canadian market
gardener will ever be in a position to compete
successfully with the American producer, whîo
lias the advantage of a climate highly suitable for vegetable and fruit growing. Should
we net see in that disadvantage as to climate
one of the chief reasons for fostering our
canned goods industry and protecting it accordingl'? It is not adequately protected;
it still has to compete with foreign production,
though it is being extended greater conces-

Quite so,

is concerned. It is through adequate protection for the canned goods industry that our
market gardeners may be expected ta profit
by their operations and use ta the best advantage their light soul. Why flot consider
the fact that aur farmers must seli in winter
time, and in the early days of spring, the
surplus of their fall production? The progress
made in preserving processes enables the
farmer to supply the consumers until springtime witb veg-etables that have retained al
their original flavour. If our farmer is to
submit f0 the grading of bis products, bie
should flot be deprived of bis market.
Hon. Mr. PARENT (Translation): If My
honourable friend thinks that I take'pleasure
in interrupting bim, bie is mistaken. I do not
wish to interrupt him needlessly.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE (Translation): I have
been familiar for a long time with the honourable senator's disposition.
The Bennett Gavernmcnt issued more than
twenty-five orders preventing the American
farmer from competing in the spring and
summer with the Canadian producer of
vegetables and fruits.
0f course certain industries sbould not enjoy
protection but for the fact that tbey now give
emplovrnent to thousands of gond Canadian
workers. They should neyer have been allowed ta establish themselves in this country.
They import raw materials aud turn them into
manufactured articles wbich it would be better
for us f0 import in exehange for exportable
produets of our natural resources.
It is becoming more and more evident that
Canada erred in the conception of a national
plan. with respect both ta settlement and to
education. That bas been the cause of serious
mistakes; in the settlement of certain armas of
our country that are unfit for farming; in the
too freýe admission of immigrants assisted by
unscrupulous epeculative enterprises; in the
unreasonable developmient of certain parts of
aur forests and natural resources of inddfferent
valuie.
In confining bis discussion'of the agreement
to a party viewpoint the honourable leader
cf the Government showed ho.w tenaci'ously
hie was adbering fa bis old historie party, althougli hie is growing more and more familiar
with the changes that have occurred in the
course of the past fifty years.
However, the new trade policy may bave
various conisequences. To that policy may be
related miaux aspects of the main problem
facing Canada. Should flot the education of
the people and the influence exerted by
Ameriican magazines or periodicals. the circu-

125

lation of wbich in Canada is now being made
casier by the new Government, be matters of
great concern in this age, wben ail sorts of
absurd theories are advocated? Canada is
experiencing new difficulties. An additional
crisis has just been created by the "Utopia"
in Alberta.
Why should we lose sigbt of the new mentality and the demand of certain classes of
immigrants wbo bave been spoiled or are
prejudiced against our Canadian institutions?
Let us observe in a proper spirit the changes
that have occurred in the ranks of our youth,
discontented witih their lot, and discouraged
by misfortune. These young people are intelligent and educated sons of parents who themselves are real Canadianis and great admirers
of our national traditions. Let us not treat
witb indiflerence or contempt the threatening
appeals af separatists advocatîng American
institutions rather than aur constitutional
and economic systems. Let us apply aurselves whole-heartedly to showing them the
error of their ways and restoýring their faith
in aur land. We should beave nothing undone ta attain that end. We sthould neyer
hesitate to discountenance those in Canada
who. in apprebension of a victory by the
Asiatie races over an oId civilization undermincd by quarrels of ambition, still cling to
the idea of aIl the nations in America grouping them-elves togetiier and forming a sort
uf suprerne power destined ta rule the world.
Such is the fear now overhanging old Europe.
Ouir probylems can only be brought ta a
solution and further troubles avoidcd through
sane attention being given ta them.
The matters just mentioned should be
examined in an absolutely non-partisan spirit.
At the present time youth clamors for something other than submission or -attachment ta
a party. Oxîr young people want principles,
ideas and lhonestly propounded palicies.
Han. Mr. PARENT (Translation): Does
the honourable member suggest that they had
none befare?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE (Translation) : la the
honourable gentleman .ioking or is hie in
earnest?
They want otlier tbings tihan offensive
criticisms of either party. Why, if the two
histarie parties are really great, should they
be belittled hy absusive language and corruptive practices? This sums up the new line
af thauýght in the ranks af youth. It is impressive.

Hon. Mr. SAUJVE (Translation): As 1 arn
not yet accustomed to speaking in Vhis
Chamber, I would ask the hontourable senator not to' interrupt me toc often, and to
confine himself to relevant and sensible questions. 1 suggest that he should wait and
speak after me.
Since capital is necessary for the development of our natural resources, Why try to
cause a further depreciation. of it by confusing it with an overbearing ca.pitalismn aiming
t.o control both production and sale by
arbitrary and vexatious method6?
During the twenty-two years I sat in the
Quebec Legisiative Assembly I consist.ently
and stro*ngly protested against the trusts that
were being created and countenanced by the
party I was opposing, because I considered
such political-financial combinations the worst
enemies of the province of Quebhec and saçv
how tbhey seized up-on the pro.perty bequeathed
by the ancestors of my rare to their descendants. The Cantadian. people suffered greatly
from errors in history, from disregard of
facts or falsifled accounts -of events. AIl these
things corrbined have distort-ed teaching.
caused leadership to go astray and influeneed
youth adversely.
Those who would teacli
bistory sbould learn it in the first place, and
he who, being conversant with history, does
flot tchu it correc'tly, is dishonest.
Mueh bas been done by the Government
to repress evils in trade and industry. History
will show that Rio Governîment ever went as

far as the 1930-1935 Administration did in
legisiation against such evils, against trusts
and everything that stood in the way of new
political and social conditions.
As soon as
the decisions of the Supreme Court are
banded dlown, tie Government will be in a
position to remedy the evils complained. of,
if it is able and willing to enforce the legislation passed ýby its predecessor.
Our tsk is not limited to the concluding
of trade agreements; other tbingsý have to be
consider-ed.
Care must be taken not to
shape our trade policy so that it would
create an illusion of prosperity, or a mirage
representing it as a panacea.
It is said by a well known economýist of the
day that economic if e is complicated by the
social point of view. So long as individuals
of ail classes are unwilling to amend themselves to the extent required for the elimination of the chief moral causes of the crisis,
the best; reforms and the most beneficial trade
agreements cannot secure the resuits that are
promised and expected. Every individuai is

entitled to say to bis neighbour, "Cura te
ipsum."
The right hontourable the Prime Minister
declared the other day: "Depression is the
laek of trade, and trade alone will put an
end to the depression." I would mucb rather
have heard him. say first: "Canada will flnd
a welcome termination of the crisis in rationalization, in the moralization of individual, social,
industrial and commercial enterprise, and in
the orderly and fair distribution of wealth."
By endcavouring so far as possible to repatriate our former citizens, wbom we should
neyer have allowved to leave, and by avoiding
old dissensions tbrougb a better understanding
of the spirit of our Constitution and a better
appreciation. cf the fair tre.atment equally
due to our two pioneer races, Canada would
be in a position to solve ber problemas more
readily and combat the subversive elements.
In the strengtb of that position lies the real
safeguard of our institutions.
Governments which denied the existence of
the depression, or souglit to conceal the facts
by persistently holding out an artificial
prosperity, and wbc drove the people to
extravagance in expenditures and commitments, have still to bear the onerous responsibility of so great an error.
Tbe past is bound to remain a lesson for
those who, inlluenced by similar considerations,
migbt be inclined to overestimate the present
improvement in business and to demonstrate,
on paper, tbe coming cf a new golden age.
Castles in the air are built with paper. It
is also on paper that butge fortun~es are made,
witb unhappiness and ruin in their wake.
The depression bas been aggravated by
"1paperism." "Paperism" is tbe enemyl
Submerged as this country bas been by tbe
inflation of capital resulting from reekiess
speculation. as well by a speculative, disturbing
and objectionable type of immigration, Canada
must not-whatever treaties and laws it may
make-be drawn back into tbat abyss of
"booms" from. which it bas barely eseaped.
Orderly progress, yes, at alI times; but
prosperity witb economie and social disorder,
no, neyer!
In tbe past we bave made mistakes, and
it is in bard times sucb as we are experiencing
now that we should tbink more seriously in
order to realize our errors. As I was saying
a littie wbile ago, we lacked vision in our
national organization; in openîng to colonization certain areas unfit for agriculture, in
admitting undýesirable immigrants, and in
allowing the reckless exploitation of our forests
wbicb we bave ceded to profiteers instead of
keepin-g tbe benefits ourselves.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE (Translation):
Another time.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN (Translation): No;
now.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I arn sorry indeed to interrupt my
honourable friend from De Lanaudière if lie
lias a thouglit or two to express. 1 liad not
intended to take part in thjs debate, as 'since
I have been a member of the Senate I have
be-en given to understandHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not Frenchi.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -that our discussions should be non-partisan. However.
during the past two days I have wondered
wlietlier a more partisan feeling could lie
displayed than we have seen on the part of
certain lionourable members wlio have participated in this debate. Wlien I heard the
introductory remarks of the right honourable leader on the other side (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Meighen) I believed, perliaps foolishly, that
there would lie no real honest-to-goodness
Grit-and-Tory debate. But during the last
few days tlie situation lias clianged entirely
and we have liad distinguislied senators rise
in their places and complain about wliat lias
liappened since the lst of January of this
year witli relation te a certain cornmodity because it was placed on the free list. As a
matter of fact it lias been on the free list
for the last thîrty years.
Hon. Mr. KING;: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MU*RDOCK: Wliat kind of
attitude is that for honourable senators to
take?
1 arn very sorry that my lionourable friend
from Montarvilie (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is
nlot in bis seat, for I wisli to deal briefly with
certain statements lie made yesterday.
I think before tlie de-bate is concluded we
sliould ascertain by wliom the negotiations
for a trade treaty witli the United States
were initiated, and wliat declarations of policy
were then laid down. I do not wish to be
umfair, but in view of some of tlie statements I have licard in tliis Chamber during
the past few days I arn led to betieve that
this trade agreement would in the opinion of
lionourable gentlemen opposite have been
wholly in the interest of Canada had it
,emanated from anotlier source during 1934
or 1935; and I shall try to show that that
probably is the case.
Let me deal briefly with some of their
contentions.
1 think certain honouralile
senators asked the question, perhaps a reasonabile one frorn their viewpoint: Why was not

129

a trade treaty negotiated with the United
States between 1921 and 1930? There is no
honourahle member in this House, regardless
of wliere lie cornes from, wlio is so simple as
not to know wliy it was out of the question to
negotiate a trade treaty between Canada and
the United States during tliose years. The
attitude and the policy of tlie party then in
power in tlie United States were entirely
opposed to anything of that kind. It was
promulgating
an
exaggerated
economnic
nationalism, as were most other countries.
That surely is what lias been largely the
trouble with the world during the past tliree.
or four years. Before I get tlirough I7 hope
to prove that out of tlie lips or froma tlie pen
of distinguislied representatives of the Government in office up to October last. I
maintain that nothing lias done so mucli to
aggravate tlie alinormal conditions which have
prevailed in tlie world during the past four
years as the rabid economie nationalism of
this, that and tlie other country. Canada gave a
demonstration of tlie kind between 1930 and
1935.
My lionourable friend from Montarville in
lis very enlightening
speech yesterday
referred to the Liberal party and stated: "It
lias always struck me as being very strange
that, traditionally, the Liberal party lias in
a sense always been opposed to our manufacturera." Then lie asked the question: "Is
not manufacturing a legitimate vocation in
Canada?" From the standpoint of any
consistent and logical Canadian there can be
only one answer: of course, manufaeturing
is a legitimate occupation in Canada. But I
ask lionourable gentlemen to say whether
there is any one thing tliat lias done more to
put many of our people in the bread line
than the extravagant efforts of certain
individuals to carry on manufacturing in this
Canada of ours. Improved maehinery, manufacturing at its best, lias done away witli manpower. If you want a concrete and splendid
illustration of tlie trutli of wliat 1 say, look
at the first page of tlie House of Commons
Hansard of yesterday. There you will learn
wliat is happening under this very roof-iow
our citizens are forced to go on relief, and
how bread lines are formed. You will discover
that a certain department of this Government
is paying $810 a montli, or $9,720 a year, for
the rental of seven machines whicli do away

Think of it: wliile this money is being paid,
for tlie rental of tliese machines, presumably
thirty-four citîzens of Ottawa are on relief

tions for the removal of prohibitions and
restrictions and for the reduction of tariff
rates; and declare that their aim in these
treaties is substantial reduction of basic trade
barriers, and not merely the removal of
temporary and abnormal restrictions and increments imposed for bargaining purposes."
The resolution continued:
"In shaping its
policy and in executing its obligations under
any agreements, each Government should
direct its first and greatest efforts towards
eliminating restrictions and reducing duties
which most clearly lack economie justification,
particularly:
(a) Duties or restrictions which completely
or almost completely exclude foreign competition,
such as those which restrict -importation of
particular commodities te less than 5 per cent
of the domestic consumption thereof;
(b) Duties or restrictions on articles the
imports of which have been substantially
curtailed since 1929 as compared with domestic
consumption;
(c) Protective duties or restrictions which
have been in effect a considerable period of
time without bringing about a substantial
domestie production of the protected commoditics (say equal to 15 per cent of the total
domestic consumption thereof)."
On December 16, 1933, on your motion, the
Seventli International Conference of American
States at Montevideo adopted a resolution
which declared that the Governments of the
American Republics would promptly undertake
"to promote trade among their respective
peoples and other nations and to reduce high
trade barriers through the negotiation of comprehensive bilateral reciprocity treaties based
upon mutual concessions."
On February 22, 1934, the Department of
State issued to the press a statement concerning trade negotiations with Canada, which
reads as follows:
"The trade between the United States and
Canada is larger in normal times than that
between any other two countries in the world,
and it is natural that both countries should
desire to restore the reciprocal flow of
commodities to normal proportions. We hope
to be in a position at an early date to take
steps looking to the conclusion of a trade
agreement with Canada which will further the
interests of both countries. We hope thus to
bring into practical application the 'good
neighbour' policy between these two great
countries which have so much in common."
A few days later, on March 2, the President
requested the Congress te enact legislation
conferring on him authority to enter into
trade agreements, in a message which concluded with the following words:
"I hope for early action.
The many
immediate situations in the field of international trade that to-day await our attention
can be met effectively and with the least
possible delay."
The legislation in question became law on
June 12. Since then your Government has set
up the organization necessary for the conduct
of negotiations, carried on its preliminary
investigations, initiated discussions with several
governments, and proclaimed the conclusion of
a trade agreement with Cuba. The objective
of the United States in entering upon these
negotiations was stated by you in a public
address on November 1 to be "to break down
all the artificial and excessive impediments put
12745--9i

131

in the way of world commerce, not only in
our own interests but for the benefit of all
others as well, since only by restoring the
whole world can individual countries hope to
remain economically healthy long."
It is hardly necessary te stress the importance to both the United States and Canada
of their mutual trade. For many years each
country has provided the other with either its
largest or its second largest foreign market,
From 1927 to 1932, and again in the first nine
months of 1934, the total trade between
Canada and the United States was greater
than the total trade between the United States
and any other country. In the last ten years,
according to the figures of the Department of
Commerce of the United States, the aggregate
value of the trade between the two countries
was more than ten billion dollars, and in the
single year of 1929 it reached the great figure
of $1.451 millions. During the decade ending
in 1933 Canada provided a market for the
products of the United States larger by onefourth than the whole of Asia, about twice as
large as Germany or all South America,
nearly three times as large as France or Japan,
nearly seven times as large as China, and
more than ten times as large as the Soviet
Union. In spite of the considerable decline
in trade from the high level of 1929, Canada
still provided a market-in the first nine months
of 1934 only slightly smaller than all Asia,
nearly twice as large as all South America or
Japan, between two and three times as large
as Germany or France, four times as large as
China, and twenty-two times as large as the
Soviet Union. Over 30 per cent of all exports
from Canada are currently sold in the United
States, and notwithstanding the great difference in population of the two countries, about
15 per cent in value of all experts from the
United States are currently sold in Canada.
May I pause here to ask particular attention to the next three sentences, and to request
honourable members te keep in mind the
fact that these sentences were written by
and on behalf of the late Government. The
honourable gentleman who spoke just before
I took the floor (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) was, I
presume., a party to and acquiesced in the
declarations made in the next three sentences.
After we have listened for three days to what,
it seems to me, has been a partisan and
obstructive debate, they are well worthy of
consideration.
I resume the reading of the letter.
The relative importance of the market of
each country te the other, and the persistence
of trading on a substantial scale throughout
the changing phases of the business cycle, as
revealed by the trade returns, demonstratè
the inherent advantage of this interchange of
commodities and the tremendous potentialities
of expansion under favourable conditions. But
no useful purpose can be served by calculating
the relative shares retained by each country in
a total world trade that for four years has
been steadily shrinking, until in 1933 it fell
in value to approximately one-third of the
level of 1929. If peace and prosperity are to
be established on an enduring basis, it is
essential to increase the absolute volume of

SENATE
world trade. No better beginning can be made
than by taking steps to increase without delay
the volume of trade between two countries
which offer the most notable opportunity.
Again I pause to remind honourable senators
that this was written by the predecessor of the
Government which has made the treaty. And
do not forget that, as will be disclosed later
on in this document, the late Government
knew full well what obstacles confronted it
or its successoir-but presum.ably at that
time it did not think about a successor.
The late Government also knew that the
President and Government of the United
States were tied absolutely because of their
own signature, as I shall show in a short time.
I proceed to quote:
Recent trends in the balance of international
payments emphasize the necessity of increasing the volume of trade between Canada and
the United States. There are six major factors
which chiefly determine the nature and extent
of the current balance between the two coun-.
tries. These are: (a) commodity trade; (b)
interest and dividends; (c) freight payments;
(d) tourist expenditures; (e) gold shipments,
and (f) capital movements. On the first three
items there has been for many years a heavy
balance against Canada, which has been met
by a favourable balance on tourist expenditurcs, by the shipment of gold, and by the
movement of capital. An approximate annual
balance between the two countries is normally
achieved on such other items of international
payments as insurance, advertising, royalties,
and immigrant remittances, when these items
are added together.
(a) Commodity Trade
In no year since 1882 have Canadian exports
to the United States exceeded in value Canadian imports from the United States. During
the thirty years ending in 1933, Canada purchased in the United States almost 70 per cent
of all lier imports, and sold in the United
States only 37 per cent of all lier exports. In
the last decade, Canadians have spent over
$1.60 in buying products of the United States
for every dollar spent on Canadian products
by purchasers in the United States. Canada
has therefore been obliged to meet the debit
balance thus arising by other means of payment. In the decade 1921 to 1930, according
to the Department of Commerce of the United
States, the balance payable by Canada to the
United States on exchange of commodities
averaged $287 millions a year. In 1932 and
1933-which were the acute years of the
depression-the balance was more nearly
equated; but in the first nine months of 1934
Canadian imports from the United States have
increased more rapidly than Canadian exports
to the United States, and the ratio between
them currently stands at about 10:7.
(b) Interest and Dividends
The long-term investments in Canada of
United States capital have been estimated at
a total of about four billion dollars, offset by
about one billion dollars of Canadian capital
invested in the United States.
The interest paid annually by Canada to the
United States in excess of the interest paid by

the United States ta Canada now amounts to
Hon.

Mr. MURDOCK.

about $125 millions, without taking into
account instalments of principal payments,
which in recent years have averaged approximately $75 millions annually.
To this should be added an annual sum,
amounting at present to between $25 and $50
millions, being the excess derived by the United
States from dividends on investments in Canada
over dividends from investments by Canada
in the United States.

The United States investments in securities
issued or guaranteed by the Dominion and
Provincial Governments is estimated at $1,218
millions. During the depression there has been
no default in the payment of interest or principal on any of those issues, even in face of
the discount on the Canadian dollar which
continued from the latter part of 1931 until
late in 1933. Interest payments have been,
of course, a continuing charge, the real
burden of which has increased with the
decline in prices. The strain on Canadian
economy has been heavy, and it has only been
borne by the adoption of special measures for
the equalization of exports and imports.
(c) Freight Charges
Since the war, net freight payments have
been favourable to the United States to the
extent of between $25 and $50 millions annually,
and this substantial sum remains a debit item
against Canada.
(d) Tourist Expenditures
The expenditures in Canada by visitors from
the United States have been by far Canada's
largest annual credit item. Canadian authorities estimate that the net balance on this
account has been as high as $188 millions in
one year, but since the depression the net
Canadian surplus from this source has sharply
declined, and amounted only to $60 millions in
1933.
(e) Gold Shipments
In some measure, Canada has been enabled
to meet the adverse balance of payments
through the development of the gold mining
industry and the shipment in recent years of
practically all the newly-mined gold to the
United States. According to the figures of the
Federal Reserve Board, the United States
received a net balance on this account averaging $50 millions a year in the five years 19291933; in the first eight months of 1934, gold
valued at $64 millions at the new valuation
was received from Canada, an amount practically equal to the Canadian gold production
during the period. Production in Canada has
increased substantially during the depression,
and its value in the United States has been
enhanced by the reduction in the gold content
of the United States dollar. It is impossible,
however, to expand production rapidly. Even
if the entire Canadian production were shipped
to the United States, it would still be insufficient by at least $25 millions annually to meet
the net interest payments due in New York.
Further, it may not be found possible to con.
tinue the shipment of the entire Canadian gold
output to the United States.
(f) Capital Movements
It may be stated, in general terms, that in
recent years the net Canadian credits from
tourist expenditures and gold shipments have
offset the net debits to the United States from
interest, dividends, and freight, while the
adverse Canadian balance on commodity trade

APRIL 2,1936
has been met by the net movement of capital
from the United States to Canada. Capital
bas moved both by new long-term. investments
in Canada and by the purchase of existing
Canadian securities. In 1931 the flotation of
new capital issues in New York virtually
ceased, and the meeting of Canadian obligations in the United States became much more
difficuit; in fact, it was necessary in some
instances to Taise capital in Canada and
transfer it to the United States to meet
maturing obligations there. A reduction in
imports therefore became urgently necessary
if Canadian obligations were to be promptly
and fully paid at maturity.
The f all in
commodity prices, the decline in Canadian
exports to the United States, which was
accentuated first by the United States Tariff
Act of 1930 and later by the imposition in.
1932 of a heavy tax on imported lumber, the
discount against the Canadian dollar, and the
heavy fnlling off in tourist expendîtures, comnhined to make the situation still more difficult.
Most of the factors responsible for this difficult
situation still persist.
Since the beginnîng of the depression,
amongst countries heavily indebted to the
United States, Canada stands almost alone in
having promptly discharged in full its obligations payable in the United States. If this
record is to be maintained, it is clear, in view
of the uncertainty as to international capital
movements, that the exports of Canadian goods
to the United States must be increased or the
imports of goods from the United States into
Canada decreased.
It should be realized that certain formidable
obstacles to the lowering of tariff barriers now
prevailing in other parts of the world are not
present between the United States and 'Canada. The opportunities of a new continent
have resulted in a parallel economie and
social development almost without precedent.
Standards of living and working conditions
are similar on both sides of the international
boundary. The measures of protection which
each Government bas imposed against the
products of the other country have not been
determined by a desire to excînde the products
of cbeap labour.
In tbese difficult times,
countries seeking to maintain high domestie
standards of living have a common interest
in expanding trade with each other. For the
past year, also, the Canadian dollar bas been
close to parity with the United States dollar,
and the disturbing effects of exchange instability have in large part disappeared. Even
if the desired general revival of international
trade should stili be delayed for a considerable
period, there is much to be said in favour of
an immediate attempt to increase the volume
of commerce between these two neighbouring
countries, wbose traditions and ideals of social
and economic progress are so alike.
Attention bas been directed to the trade
agreements between Canada and the other
members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations signed at Ottawa in 1932. In some
quarters the statement bas been made that
these agreements render difficult the negotiation of a comprehiensive and effective trade
agreement between Canada and tbe United
States.
An examination of. the facts will
demonstrate conclusively that snch is not the
case. Tbe agreements concluded at Ottawa in
1932 bave been of immense importance in
increasing the trade between the several
nations of the British Commonwealth.
The

131

market of the United Kingdom in particular
bas been a most valuable outlet for Canadian
products.
In return for the market thus
assured Canada bas continued and enlarged
the preferences which had been accorded the
United Kingdom since 1897.
The Ottawa
agreements do not, however, preclude and in
fact have not precluded the signatories froin
offering extensive and valuable tariff concessions to other colintries, and it may be stated
positively that the Governent of Canada is
free to enter into an agreement witb the
United States covering a wide range of
products.
Tbe Government of Canada is prepared to
join the Government of the United States in a
declaration that their common objective is the
attainmient of the freest possible exchange of
natural products between the two countries.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I ask a question right here? What the bonourable senator is reading is from the late Governmen.t,
is it not?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: A littie while before
that was written President Roosevelt gave
expression to a plous hope that trade between the two countries miglit be entered
into more freely. Well, hie had the power
to reduce the duty on wheat, for instance,
but nothing like that bas been done. And
in view of that pinus hope, migbt not the
Americans have given us a chance to send
themn a little copper? There is a duty of 4
cents a pound on copper.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH: If my bonourable
friend will wait until I read a lîttle furtber
he will find that some of the powers that
be in the United States. the lawmakers, had
tied the banda of the President by instructing
bim just how far he could- go in the negotiation of a trade treaty. I shaill corne to that
in a little while.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
to reduce the duties?

Had he not power

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not beyond a certain point.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH:

Fifty per cent.
Yes.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: It would bave been
a very fine tbing to reduce the duties on
copper to that extent, but there bas been
no reduction at ahl.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH:
At the moment
I am interested in considering whence came
this trade treaty, and aIea who were responsible for its adoption.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Will the
bonourable gentleman permit me to give him
an answer now? By so doing we may shorten
the debate.

134

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Can the honourable gentleman give an answer?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Certainly. It
is quite true that negotiations were carried
on over a period of nearly two years. That
kind of thing takes time. But J can say
to my honourable friend and to this House
that even if the late Government had been
returned to power they would not have
accepted a trade treaty containing the termas
that are outlined in this agreement.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am quite satisfied to accept the statement of the honourable gentleman who for the moment is leading the other side. My personal opinion is
that if the party that initiated these trade
negotiations had remained in power there
never would have been a trade treaty up to
Judgment Day, because such a treaty would
have been disadvantageous to too many
friends of the honourable gentleman's party.
Hon. Mr. PAQUET: Politics!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That
sonal opinion. We surely have
express our views. I would not
that statement only that the
gentleman dragged it out of me.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

is my pera right to
have made
honourable

It is all right.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will read that
passage agan:
The Government of Canada is prepared to
join the Government of the United States in a
declaration that thseir common objective is the
attainmsent of the freest possible exchange of
natural products between the two countries.
How splendid that soundsl I wonder if I
am unfair in feeling that possibly there was
no sincerity behind it.
It is recognized that this objective cannot
be attained in the immediate future, as
important interests in both countries would be
disturbed unduly by the sudden removal of
existing tariffs on all natural products. The
Governmsent of Canada would therefore favour,
as the first step, the reductions included in the
proposals set out in the next paragraph, to
he succeeded by progressive mutual reductions
in the duties on natural produets, leading to
the attainment of the declared objective.
i am authorized to put forward the following outline as a suitable basis for the negotiation of a trade agreement:
(a) A mutual undertaking te maintain
during the lifetime of the agreement the
unrestricted free entry of commodities now on
the free list of either country.
An honourable gentleman told us about
the great difficulty there had been in his
locality since the first of January last with
respect to a certain article. I pause to remind
the honourable gentleman that that article
ilon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

has been for the last thirty years, and still
is, on the free list.
(b) The mutual concession of tariff treatment as favourable as that accorded to any other
foreign country; this means that Canada would
extend to the United States its intermediate
tariff, involving reductions from the present
rates of duty on some 700 items, including
both natural and manufactured products,
together with a number of further reductions
below the intermediate tariff rates through the
extension to the United States of concessions
made by Canada in trade conventions with
foreign countries.
(c) The reduction by 50 per cent of the
existing United States rates of duty, as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1934, on a specified
number of natural products, including inter
alia. lumber, fish, potatoes, milk and cream,
and live cattle; a number of other agricultural
products, and several minerals both metallic
and non-metallic.
(d) The reduction of the existing rates of
duty by the United States on a number of
partly or wholly manufactured products of
Canada, including some processed natural
products and certain products in which hydroelectrie power comprises an important element
in the cost of production.
(e) The reduction of the existing rates of
duty by Canada on a number of natural and
partly or wholly manufactured products of the
United States.
In view of the declared policy of the Governments of the United States and Canada to
improve existing trade relations, and of the
progress already made in both countries in the
necessary preparatory studies, there would
apear to be no barrier to the immediate
initiation of negotiations and their speedy
conclusion. I am desired, therefore, to request
that I nay be furnished with a statement of
the views of the Governmient of the United
States on this highly important question.
I have the honour to be, with the highest
consideration, Sir,
Your most obedient, humble servant,
W. D. Herridge.
The Hon. Cordell Hull,
Secretary of State of the United States,
Washington, D.C.
The record is net complete until we find
the answer to that communication; therefore
I read the second note, from the Secretary of
State of the United States b the Canadian
Minister at Washington:
Department of State,
Washington. December 27, 1934.
Sir:
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt
of your note of Noveimber 14, 1934, in which
you review the trade and financial relations
between the United States and Canada, and
advise nie that your Government proposes the
early initiation of negotiations looking to a
trade agreement between our two countries.
I have given careful consideration to your
note. I fully subscribe to the views which you
express iii regard to the importance to each of
our couitries of'its trade with the other, and
I am happy to note the willingness of your
Goverînment to undertake negotiations looking

is not necessary to comment in detail on your
statements respecting the balance of payments
as between our countries. As you are aware,
international balances are settled on many
fronts, and it would be a serious setback ta
world trade if countries undertook ta achieve
balances with individual countries.
I am happy also to take this occasion to
express my appreciation of the unflinchin 1
determination with which the Dominion an
Provincial Governments have met their loan
obligations.
When the Trade Agreements Act, 1934, was
enacted, this Government took immediate
steps to create an organization ta undertake
negotiations for trade agreements. One agreement has been concluded; negotiations for
several others are now in progress; and intensive preparations are well under way for
similar negotiations with a number of other
countries.
I believe that a point has now been reached
when an exchange of views on this subject
with Canada should be undertaken, and I
am, therefore, gratified ta learn that your
Government is of the same mind. Whatever
the desirability of the freest possible exchange
of natural products, and indeed other products,
between the United States and Canada as an
ultimate goal, the United States Government
must in any negotiations undertaken at this
time restrict itself to measures authorized by
the Trade Agreements Act, 1934, of which I
enclose a copy.
The outline which you suggest as a possible
basis for discussions has been noted. You
mention several specifie products upon which
your Government proposes to seek reductions
in existing rates of duty in this country. In
communicating to you the willingnes of the
Government of the United States ta enter upon
negotiations with your Government looking to
a trade agreement calculated to increase trade
in both directions, I must, of course, make it
clear that in advance of negotiations this Government can not make any commitment as ta
whether it will be possible ta agree ta a reduction in the rates of duty on particular products,
each of which must be carefully studied in the
light of existing economic conditions before

procedure which has been adopted and followed
in connection with the trade agreement
negotiations with other Governments. Correspondingly, it is understood that your Government will wish ta give the same study ta
individual products upon which this Government may request reductions in the Canadian
rates of duty.
I suggest that ta the proposed outline of
discussions there be added the question of
methods of determining the value of merchandise for duty purposes in either country,
a matter which I consider of importance in
the proposed negotiations.
On the basis of these general observations,
this Government holds itself in readinesa ta
begin immediate preparations for trade agreement negotiations.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my
highest consideration.
Cordell Hull.

William Duncan Herridge, K.C., D.S.O., M.C.,
Minister of the Dominion of Canada.

The third note is from the Canadian
Minijster at Washington to the Secretary of
State of the United States, and reads:
Canadian Legation,
Washington, January 4, 1935.
Sir,I have the honour ta acknowledge your note
of the 27th December, 1934, in which you
advise me of the willingness of your Government ta enter upon negotiations with the
Government of Canada looking ta a trade
agreement calculated ta increase trade between
our two countries, and ta assure you that my
Government, who have noted the suggestion
that the question of methods of determining
the value of merchandise for duty purposes be
added ta the proposed bases for discussion set
forth in my note of the 14th November, are
ready ta commence negotiations immediately
with a view ta the conclusion of a commercial
agreement with the Government of the United

The Hon. Cordell Hull,
Secretary of State of the United States,
Washington, D.C.
It seems ta me that that document should
be placed on Hansard, particularly with regard
ta the discussion of the past few days. I
am of opinion that several honourable gentlemen have not fully analysed it. I believe that
if between January 4, 1935-the date of the
last letter-and October, 1935, a trade agreement such as we now have before us had been
negotiated between the Government of Canada
and the Government of the United States,
honourable gentleman opposite would now be
waving their hands and hurrahing for the
wonderful bargain.
But perhaps I am entirely mistaken. I
may be right in my earlier guess that no trade
agreement would have been negotiated; for I
realize that tens of thousande of Canadians,
while benefiting under tariff regulations, many
of which are still in effect, have profited by the
sweat and in many cases the blood of their
fellow citizens. Far be it from me ta suggest
for a moment that all tariff regulations should
be wiped out. I realize that we must have
tariff duties on the ordinary commodities of
life, so that through indirect taxation the
people may pay into the treasury the wherewithal ta meet the expenses of government.
But it seems ta meHon. Mr. HORNER: Will the honourable
gentleman state what was done by the Government of Canada between 1921 and 1930
ta negotiate a trade treaty with the United
States?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCHÇ: I arn glad my
honourable friend bas brought up that question. Could anything be more ridiculous than
to suggest that between 1921 and 1930 the
Liberal Government then in office could have
entered into a trade agreement with the then
Government of the United States?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Why flot?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH: For this reason,
that at that time the tariff policy of the Government of the United States was, as he well
knows, to raise its tariff barriers against the
world. In my judgment it was just as farfetched to expectHon. Mr. GILLIS: The same as it always
has been.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH: It was just as absurd
to expect that an agreement could have been
reached at that time between the party in
power in Canada and the party in power in
the United States as it was for the Hon.
Cordell Hull in 1934 to believe there was any
possibility of negotiating an equitable trade
arrangement with the then Government of
Canada. The United States, yes, the world,
had heard of what were descrihed, whether
rightly or wrongly, as the straight-from-theshoulder negotiations in Ottawa in 1932,Hon. Mr. BALLANTYE: Hear, hear.

of the Quebec Legislature (Hon. Mr. Sauvé)

admitted that the Conservatives were the
party of protection and the Liberals the free
trade party. Unfortunately, I amn an old man.

tariff was at 10 per cent, and it was net until
some time later that Sir John A. Macdonald
found out that 10 per cent was not sufficient
te cover the costs of administration-to meet
the expenditures. Let an old man recaîl your
history. I know the facts. 1 appeal te my
excellent friend the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais), who

the whole thirty-,six years I have been a
member of this House, and we are going te
have one new. If there are some who want
te take part in it, but do net understand, well,'
se much the worse for them. Sir John A.
Macdonald raised the tariff to 15 per cent,
and it was raised te l7ý per cent under the
Mackenzie Government. I was in the gallery.
I was then a French translater for the House
of Commons. Sir Charles Tupper was te
speak. I saw him with my own eyes put
back into his desk the notes he had prepared.
He believed that 17J per cent wou!d not
answer the purpose and that it should be
20 per cent. In 1874, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste
Society had in Montreal a big celebration
whicb brought from the States a great many
former Canadians. As we had ne manufacturing in this country, those peop!e had gone
to, the States. They were wearing top bats,
fine clothee, and gold chains, and had plenty
of money in their pockets. When asked how
it was that they had se much rnoney, they
would answer: "In the States there are cottonmilîs and we find employment there."
Fer tbirty years we had with us in this
Chamber Hon. Mr. Béique, wbo devoted his
efforts te tbe improvement of propesed legislation. Fer thirty years he examined tbe Bills

in Canada?" they said. They asked Mr.
Hudon te set up a factory, and he erected on
Notre Dame street the cotton-mill which is
still in operation and gives empîcyment to
theusands of people. That was the bcginning;
before 1878; before Sir John A. Macdonald

At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Honourable
Hon. FUGENE PAQUETsenators, it was flot an organized French
meeting that we had this afternoon. Our
English-speaking friends are glad to hear
some speeches in the French language, and
they listened with close attention to the
address by the honourable senator from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé). The honourable
gentleman, who before coming to this Chamber had a long experience as a politician, a
member of Parliament and a Minister, spoke
flot only well, but exceedingly well.
My speech on the trade agreement I will
make in French.
(Translation): I desire that my first French
utterance ini the Senate shaîl express my feelings of eympathy, fTiendship and admiration
for my distinguished predecessor the late
Senator Béland, who, represented the senatorial
division of Lauzon. On May 21, l935, eminent
colleagues praised the qualities of the Hon.
M.r. Béland. Allow me to-day to add my own
tribute to the memory of that eminent Oanadian.
I must beartily thank the honourable senaber from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) for the
splendid speech he delivered this afternoon.
Attention sbould 'be paid, not only in the
province of Quebec, but in the whole of
Canada, to the words of such a distinguished
gentleman. His long political services have
been very useful te his country, and f ew
public mec in Canada possess as much experience as my honieura;ble friend. He bas maintained bis Teputa tien! As a Canadian I
congratulate him and 1 tbank him.
Histery tells us of the extreme confusion
wbich reeulted from the repeal of the reciprocity treaty in 1866, in aIl lines of economic
endeavour. Certain lices of business and
industry bad been establisbed ckiring the
existence of the treaty. Its repeal macle the
people of British North America feel anxious
as te the consequences. It was tbougbt then
that our commercial interests were so, bound
up witb the American market that the cancellation of the treaty gave reason for alarm.
But, honourable senators, we had not y-et
realized our strength. Our fathers, under the
leadership of Sir Jobn Macdonald, Sir George

SENATE
E. Cartier. George Brown, J. Chapais, whose
distinguished son is a member of this House,
bound the provinces together as a Canadian
federation, faced the situation firmly, and
worked out an economic structure whieh made
Canada a great, strong and prosperous country.
There is a good deal of truth in the advice
of the Liberal leaders that we should always
take into consideration the fiscal policy of a
great nation with a population of 120 millions,
whose territory extends for 4,000 miles alongside of ours. Canada and the United States
cover the whole of the North American
continent; so the Dominion is forced by its
geographical situation to have economie relations with its neighbour. But we have also
to consider our relations with the nations of
the Commonwealth, their population numbering some three hundred millions, living as
we do under the same British flag. It seems
to me that in analysing the history of commercial reciprocity with the States the leaders
of the Liberal party could point out a moral
and an instructive lesson for the Canadian
people.
I would not do anything to weaken the
economic bonds between Canada and the
Mother Country. To my' mind, trade among
the componcnt parts of the Commonwealth
should be the corner-stone of a Canadian
policy. Every Canadian knowing the conditions previous to 1932, and the volume of
trade at that time, and considering the
statistics we have now before us, must come
to the conclusion that the Ottawa agreements
with the Mother Country and the sister
nations have been immensely beneficial to
the Canadian people.
When my term as a federal member expired, in 1917. I moved to the district of
Gaspé to resume the practice of my profession.
There I tried to acquaint myself with the nceds
of that fine district, almost surrounded by a
sea that is full of fish; irrigated by rivers of
transparent water abounding with choicest
fish; rich in good, arable land and large forests,
and inhabited by people of whom the district
and Canada may well be proud.
I do not want to describe too darkly the
economic conditions prevailing in the district
of Gaspé. Lack of markets is not the only
cause of the present depression in agriculture
there. Even before 1930 lumber camps in
the Gaspé district were closed; also the sawmills, save two. The hmber industry has
been at an absolute standstill. And neither
fishermen nor farmers have derived any satisfaction from the trade in fish or potatoes.
And so the number of unemployed has been
growing steadily.
Unemployment and its
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET.

attendant evils are leading us directly to
disaster, both financially and morally.
It is not easy to estimate accurately the
advantages and disadvantages of the re.ciprocity agreement in relation to the district of Gaspé. Only the test of experience
can show the effect.
In my humble opinion, it is a step in
the right direction. I hope that Canada, the
United States and other countries will free
themselves from that excessive economic
nationalism which has prevailed to this day.
We must facilitate trade with all nations
willing to (o business with us on reasonable
and fair conditions. Expansion of trade will
serve the interests both of the producers and
the consumers.
In Canada are to be found the richest
fisheries in all the continent of North America.
Since 1922 the fisheries in Gaspé are under
the administration of Quebec. The fishermen of Gaspé are in a deplorable condition.
A fair solution of their problems would require the active, intelligent and permanent
co-operation of the provincial and the federal
authorities.
The concessions obtained for
the fisheries of Gaspé are very disappointing.
Fishermen on the Pacifie got something, but
Gaspé fishermen who desired to have access
to the American market for their product
did not get satisfaction.
Potatoes are another important product of
Gaspé. I believe we have made an error as
to potatoes. We may expect some benefit
on seed potatoes, but we did not get anything capable of increasing the sale in the
United States of the large crop of Canadian
potatoes. The agreement does not include
anything of a nature to promote the sale
of a product which means so much to the
farmers of Gaspé.
It is my duty to make important reservations as to the advantages of the treaty for
the Gaspé district.
Finally, a word on the lumber industry,
which is in a woeful situation in Gaspé. The
reduction in the duty on lumber will no
doubt benefit Canadian lumber merchants. I
am told that in many districts last winter,
as a result of the reciprocity agreement, there
was more work available in the lumber industry and unemployment decreased.
Why it
was not so in the district of Gaspé I cannot
say at the moment. An outlet for the products
of that industry is a precious thing. In our
district lumbering should mean an important
trade. I have the greatest confidence in tie
ahility and energy of the men in charge of
the development of the lumber industry in

heard to-day. It is true there was at times
vigorous enough criticism of certain items
of the treaty, but generally speaking there
was a very obvious desire for co-operation
on the part of honourable members opposite.
Not many moons ago we underwent a general
election, perhaps the most memorable since
Confederation. It led to a manifestation of
opinion, the resounding significance of which
we have not yet forgotten. Victorious participants in that fight recognize more than ever
that they have duties to fulfil. In common
with them the members of this Chamber, who
do not have to pass through the ordeal of an
election campaign, are members of a Parliament based on principles of real British
democracy.
Notwithstanding what was said this afternoon by my honourable friend from de
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) when he
undertook to prove that protection had
really been conceived by Liberal minds before
its advocacy by Sir John A. Macdonald in
1878, every one knows there exists throughout
the country a feeling that the Liberal party
is more or less identified with a policy of

and highly desirable it is to maintain good
relations with our neighbours, and no one will
co-operate more willingly and more earnestly
to that end. Although the United States
have always taken care to look after their
own interests, their people and their diplomats
are too broadminded and good-natured to
deny Canada the right to have the fiscal
policy best suited to its people. The agreement is a mutual one and for a term of three
years. Canada's fiscal autonomy is entirely
preserved. Let us give this agreement a fair
trial in the hope that it may benefit alike
the Dominion of Canada and the United
States.

policy of our country must be based on intraimperial trade. He even called those agreements "the corner-stone of our economic
prosperity." But I hold to the opinion that
it is absolutely ridiculous to disregard
geographical exigencies, to ignore a market of
more than 120 million people and prefer to
sell in far distant countries overseas. While
remaining loyal subjects of the Empire, we
must recognize the eloquent and peremptory
truth of the old maxim. "Charity begins at
home." Indeed, we cannot ignore the facilities
of transportation, of contact and of exchange
which exist between our country and our
neighbour to the south, these two great
countries which cover the whole of the North
American continent and have a common
boundary of more than 3,000 miles.
Before going further may I be allowed to
point out obvious contradictions contained in
two speeches delivered by our friends on
the left. On one hand the honourable member from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
accu-ed the Liberal party of showing perpetual
antipathy towards the industrial and manufacturing class in Canada, and on the other
hand the honourable member from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Sauvé) deplored the sad fate
meted out to the farming community by the
same party. Truly, honourable colleagues,
there is a lack of generosity towards our
party, and a failure to recognize the benevolent efforts which have ahvays been made by
the Liberals on behalf of our population,
which is made up of precisely those two great
classes of human
activity-industry and
agriculture.
I am not going back to the deluge, though
the catastrophe I now allude to might be
termed a deluge of blood, misery and death.
During those four terrible and tragic years,
1914 to 1918, nearly all the countries of the
world were engaged in warfare with shot and
shell. The Armistice was supposed to bring
peace, but an almost universal war has been
raging all the time on economic battlefields.
The governments of the late belligerents
erected against one another tariff barriers
which for impregnability might be compared
to real Chinese walls. A moment ago I
heard the honourable member from Lauzon
(Hon. Mr. Paquet) using the expression
"economic nationalism."
That is precisely
what we have had since 1918. The war-cry
of the Conservative party. "Canada First,"
which resounded from one end of the country
to the other in the 1930 election campaign,
reminded us of the existence of that conceited
sentiment of isolation
and selfsufficiencv. In other words, we ourselves adHou

Mr. LACASSE.

vocated that exaggerated nationalism which
we condemn in others.
All nations have
greatly curtailed their trade with one another,
and in nearly every country, including Canada,
agriculture .is crippled and industry paralysed.
International trade is completely disorganized
and in a lamentable state of stagnation. That
is another reason why I greet with delight
the first Administration in the world to make
a determined move to break the vicious circle
of tariffs. I am all the more happy because
that fine and generous example bas been set
by the Government of my own country.
I admit that as regards political matters
I am rather nationalistic. So those persons
who cried "Canada first" on the hustings in
1930 should be the last to find fault with my
attitude.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE (Translation): Unless I
am much mistaken, "Canada first" was Sir
Wilfrid's slogan in answer to Hon. Mr. Tarte
in 1904.
Hion. Mr. LACASSE
(Translation): It
moved me profoundly to hear from the lips
of the Conservative chief, Mr. Bennett, twenty-six years later this proof of the old Liberal
chieftain's continuing influence. But I was
saying that I take a rather nationalistic point
of view with respect to political matters. On
the other hand, in the domain of commerce,
as in that of science, of art and of literature,
I believe in internationalism. It is necessary
to the highest welfare of mankind that no
national frontiers separate these domains, for
all peoples have "blood of the same colour."
IL may be said that my plea in favour of
greater commercial freedom between countries
is based more or less on sentiment. That
may be. But can any honourable member of
this Chamber eliminate all sentiment from
polities and business? Of course, by sentiment
I do not mean sentimentalism or sentimentality. Consider the significance of such a commonplace transaction as the payment of a
debt by cheque. The business man who accepts the cheque has confidence-he truststhat the debtor bas money in the bank. Is
not this sentiment of confidence, of trust,
necessary in every business transaction? To
pursue the point from a different angle, may
I ask if it is not truc that the most beautiful
pages of history were written by the heart
no less than by the mind?
I fully appreciate the desire for sincere cooperation expressed at the beginning of the
present session by the right honourable leader
of the other side on behalf of himself and
his followers. He doubtless recalled the loyal

APRIL 2, 1936
assistance we of this side gave hima last year,
when he was piloting through this House
the social legisiation of the then Government.
I rejoice deeply over the obvious feeling of
intelligent and cordial friendship between
representatives of the two great political
parties in the Canadian Senate. It will be a
salutary example for the people, as showing
that persons of intelligence and goodwill are
able to understand one another and to work
together for the best interests of our common country.

Under this item timber enters the United

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I read the item
exactly as my honourable friend does.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Now I would ask
my honourable friend to turn to page 26,
item 601 (c) (6):
Lumber, rough, or pIaned or dressed on one
or more sides, except flooring made of maple
(except Japanese maple), birch, and beech.
Under this item lumber is admitted into the
United States at a rate of $1.50 per thousand
feet. board measure. This is the same com-

141

modity as is covered by item 401, but there
are two rates of duty, on the first item 50
cents per thousand feet, and on the second
$1.50. Which is correct?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is not the same
kiid of lumber.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It is described as
"Lumber, rough, or pIaned or dressed on one
or more sides, except fiooring made of maple
(except Japanese maple), birch, and heech$1.50 per thousand feet, board measure.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is the import tax;
the other is the rate o~fduýty.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If there is to ha an
excise tax in addition to this duty we shaîl
not know where we stand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will revert to page 20 he will find
the first column is headed, "United States
Tariff Act of 1930." The third column is
headed, "Rate of Duty." The item on page
26 bears the rate of import tax under the
Revenue Act of 1932.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It is very plain.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It may be to my
honourable friend, but I think our lumber
entering the United States would be subi ect
to a duty of $1.50 per thousand feet.
Hon. Mr. KING: It would be $2 in ahl.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: This discussion is
irregular.
Hon. Mr. MURDOGK: TheL language of
the two items is materially different. The
item on page 20 does not refer to maple;
that on page 26 does.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The item on page
26 excludes maple.
Hon. Mr. MUR.DOCK: Let me read item
401:
Timber hewn, sided, or squared, otherwise
than by sawing, and round timber used for
spars or in building wharves; sawed lumber

and timber not specially provided for, ail the
foregoing, if of fir, spruce, pine, hemlock, or
larch, 50 cents per thousand feet, board
measure.
Item 601 is in these words:
Lumber rough, or planed or dressed on one
or more sides, except flooring made of mapie
(except Japanese maple), birch, and beech,
$1.50 per thousand feet, board measure.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Will my honourable friend read item 1803 (1) on page 25?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Here it is:

In item 601 the

in item 1803 it is speciflcaliy stated to be
"nlot further manufactured than planed, and

My conclusion
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
agrees with that of my bonourable friend.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: I would direct attention to the second proviso on page 26:
Provided fortlier, that no article described

which is being elassifled under section 601

melaretl objective.
I aim aîîthorized te put forward tbe following outline as a suitable basis for tbe negotia.
tien cf a trade agreement:

(a) A mutuai undertaking te nsaintain
duriîîg tIse lifetime cf the agreement the
unrestrieted free entry cf commodities now on
tIse free list of either country.
Se tihe continuatiou cf raw fox furs on
tise free list is simply a continuation of the

APRIL 2, 1936
policy of the late Government and of the
policy that has been in force under our tariff
for the past thirty years, or perhaps longer.
Now may 1 refer to quotas? Wbile the
quotas on some articles going to the United
States--such as cream, potatoes, lumber and
cattie-are not as large as we should have
]iked to see them, the United States has dealt
fairly generously with us in respect to the
method by which they will be intýerpreted.
Quotas, of course, apply to ail articles of the
class or kind referred to. Under the agreement, if concessions are given by the United
States to any third country they shaîl apply
also to Canada; and if a third country, such
as Mexico, sbhould increase ber exports to the
United States, t-he quota, as far as Canada is
concerned, would be interpreted on the basis
of our trade over a representative period of
years prior to the coming into force of the
agreement. So we have nothing to fear with
respect to any change that may take place in
the exports of any other country into the
United States.
It is unfortunate, I think, that the honourable member from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black), wbo spoke a few days ago, sbould
have referred to the duty as applying to table
potatoes. The treaty does not reduce the
duty on table potatoes going into the United
Sýates, but it does appreciably reduce the duty
on seed potatoes. While seed potatoes going
into the United States are subjeet to 75 cents
per hundred puunds, the treaty reduces this
duty to 60 cents per hundred pounds between
the lat of December and the end of February,
and to 45 cents per hundred pounds between
March 1 and November 30. That is an
appreciable reduction, and is of benefit to the
growers of tbe Maritime Provinces, particularly those of Prince Edward Island, wbere
we bave specialized to a considerable degree in
the growing of seed potatoes for sale to the
Soutbern States. In years gone by, tbough
not so much in the immediate past, that business was a profitable one. The treaty guarantees it for the life of the agreement.
Furthermore, there is a change in the import
regulations whicb is of henefit to us. The
United States were genel'ous enougb to accept
as prima facie evidence of the fact that our
potatoes are seed potatoes, the certificate
of the Government inspector in Canada
stating that tbey are such and are intended
for the purpose for which they are permitted
to enter under the low rate of duty. Prior
to 1932 we enjoyed the privilege of sbipping
potatoes to the United States in the early
part of the season, and putting them in bond.
In the early winter the Maritime Provinces
are able to sbip by water to the American
ports, and, by reason of the eheaper rates,

143

to save almost enough to pay the duty.
Otherwise we should be very much handicompeting with Maine. In order
capped ýji
to get the low rate we bave to sbip before
December. Under the old arrangement, if we
had donc that, we should have bad to pay
the higber rate of duty applicable between
December 1 and March 1; but the regulatioýns have been so arranged as to give us
the privilege of putting in our potatoes under
general order warehouse regulations and paying the duty when they are taken out of
bond. We could do that prior to 1932, but
as some of the American importers were
violating the provision under which it could
Seed
be donc. that right was cancelled.
potatoes can n0W be entered at any Atlantic
port and put into storage hy the customs
officers, and kept thýere until the lst of
March, after which they may be taken out
under the lower rate. This, 1 think, shows
the spirit of the agreement in relation to
trade barriers, and it is apparent that our
efforts towards the efficient functioning of the
treaty are heing met with a good measure of
fairness by the United States.
It is important for the people of the
Maritime Provinces to have as wide a market
as possible for their'potatoes. Our farmers
depend very largely upon potatoea for their
cash crop. Formerly we enjoyed a market in
Cuba for table potatoes, but some years
ago, owing to a change in the Cuban
tariff regulations, a preference of fifty
per cent in duty was given to the United
States, and this made it impossible for us to seil
in that market except for a few seed potatoes
and some potatoes of second size which were
nsed for seed. Formerly we shipped from
three to four million bushqels annually-a trade
which was of real help to the growers of the
Maritime Provinces.
Since losing that outlet we bave suffered
from a restricted market for table potatoes.
Not beîng able to scîl over the duty of 75
cents, we have had only the Canadian market.
If there is a good crop throughout Canada
each province can readily raise potatoes
sufficient for its own needs. We therefore
welcome the easing of duty in the American
market by this agreement.
There is another item which is of interest to
the people of the East, and, I think, to the
people of other parts as well. I refer Vo, the
reduction on cattle, particularly dairy cattie.
Some years ago we, in common with breeders
in O-ntario and Quebec, enjoyed a ve'ry good
market for our mi¶ch cows in the New England
States. Pure-bred cows now go into the States
free of duty. On 6ther cat tie the tariff is tbree
cents a .pound, exoept dairy cattle of grade

144

SENATE

varieties, on which the rate under the treaty
ia one cent and a haîf. Now, the bulk of the
cattle that we preduce are dairy cows. We
can raise them cbeaply and well, and they are
hig-hly thought of and readily purchased by
dairymen of the New England States. I tbink
it is generally felt that the ha.lving of the duty
on dairy cows will be of real benefit te cattle
shippers of the Maritime Provinces.
I shouJd like to -refer te a statement quoted
a, few evenings ago by the honourable senator
from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) from
the unrervised Hansard report of a speech
made by the Prime Minister in another place.
I appreciate the confidence the honýourable
,genator showed iu the Prime Minister by taking as correct, wit.hout checking it, a figure
fiound in that report. It was stated th.at in
1929 thie exports of cream te the United States
were over 5,000,000 tons. It is obvieus that
thit -could, net possibly be se, for it would
mean we had exported the stupendeus quantity
of tee billion pounds. The statement should
have read that the exports amounited te
$5,000,000 in. value, and this correction was
made by the Debates Office of another place
as soon as the errer was noticed.
There le another item in the tr'eaty which,
will be of real benefit te the Maritime Provinces, sud particularly te Prince Edward Island,
and that is table turnips. In, the last decade
we have but up a fine business ine grewing
table turnips and sbipping them te New
England markets. Ontario and Prince Edward Island are the enîy provincecs that really
specializa ie these shipments te the United
States. and Ontario bas been in the business
for the longer time. We have made good
pregress on the Island. I have, net the exauct
figures at hand, but I know that last year our
experts ran arounýd two million bushelAs. In
value they varied from $396,000 te $630,000
annually over the period from 1931 to 1935.
The former duty of twenty-five cents a huedred pounds, which was net really high, bas
been cut in bagf, te twelve, and one-haîf cents.
Our people will, be encouraged te grow table
turnips te a greater extent than before.
Now may I make a few remarks with regard
te the question of lumber, which waq refered
te by the honourable senater who spoke
immedîately before me (Hlon. Mr. Gordon).
The reduction in duties on lumber under this
agreement is a real henefit te eastern, central
and western Canada. I have in my hand a
report prepared by the Department of Trade
and Commerce from which seme figure,: were
quoted a fewv days ago by an honourable
senater on the other aide. It gives in detail
the duties prevailing under airieus tariffs
in the United States fromn 1921 up te the
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

present time. Under the Hawley-Smoot tariff,
sawed boards, planks, deals. and sawed
timber, of fir, spruce, pine, hemlock or Iarch,
entered the United States free on a reciprocal
basis, up to June 21, 1932. Since that date
there lias been a duty of $1, plus $3 revenue
tax, or 34
thousand feet. By this agreement
the duty is reduced to fifty cents and the
revenue tax te $1.50, or 82 in ail. But in the
case of Douglas fir and Western hemlock these
ratesý of duty and tax do not apply to more
than 250 million board feet in any calendar
year.
Hon. Mr.
GORDON:
How can you
reconcile that statement with item 1803 (1)
of the United States tariff?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think that item
applies to timber.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It also applies to
lumber net further manufactured than planed,
and tongued and grooved.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The item reads:
Timber hewn, sided, or squared, otherwise
than by sawing, and round timaber used for
spars or in building wharves; sawed lumber
and tiraber, not furtlier manufactured than
plaIie(, and tongued and grooved; aIl the foregoieg, if not of balsa or teak, and net specially
provided for, f ree.
The last four words, "net specially providid
for," mean that the item des net apply to
anything that is specially provided for.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But does my honourable frjend flot see that that item provides
for free entry of more than is cox ered by the
statement he was reading?
This refera to
tongued and grooved lumberHon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The words "net
specially provided for" mean that the item
dees net apply te goods of the clas referred
te in the statement I was quoting.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I venture te say that
if the statement read by my honourable friend
dees actually apply, net ene thousand feet of
lumber will go into the States under this
agreement.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That may be. The
honourable gentleman may be correct in that.
The next item referred te in the statement is
"Other
softwood,
except
cabinet wood."
Under the Hawley-Smoot tariff that was free,
but after June 21, 1932, it was subject te a
revenue tax of $3 a theusand feet. In this
agreement that tax is cut in haîf, te $1,50.
Then ýhardwood of ail kinds, except flooring of
maple, birch and beech, was free up te June
21, 1932, when it aise was made subject te a
revenue tax of $3. And under the agreement
this tax Iikewise has been reduced to $1.50.

APRIL 2, 1936
On flooring of maple, birch and beech the
duty under the Hawley-Smoot tariff was 8 per
cent, but -the-re was no revenue tax. The
agreement cuts that duty in haif, to 4 per cent.
Flooring of other kinds of wood, except those
I have just referred to, was free up to June
21, 1932, at which time a revenue tax of $3 a
thousand feet was imposed. Under the agreement it is stili free and the tax bas been
reduced, by one-half.
Item 1803 (1), to which my honourable
friend bas called attention, applies only to
such lumber, other than balsa or teak, as is flot
specially provided for.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then will my honourable friend tell me what kind of lumber does
go in free, under that item? There is nothing.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Timber.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But the item also
mentions lumber.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If the honourable
senator wishes to know what lumber is
admitted free to the United States under item
1803 (1) hie will have to get the details from
the Customs or the Department of Trade and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I think you will find
that none goes In free.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: While that item
is placed on the free list, it is subject to $1.50
revenue tax, which tax had- been $3 prior to
this
agreement. The President
had
no
authority to reduce either excise taxes or duties
more than fifty per cent.
May I add this, with regard to lumber?
Item 401 of the United States Tariff Act of
1930 imposed a duty of $1 a thousand feet
board measure on sawed lumber of. fir, spruce,

pine, hemlock or larcli. There was, however,
in this pa.ragraph a proviso exempting from
such duty certain classes of lumber "when
imported fromn a country contiguous to the
Continental United States, whicb country
adrnits f ree of duty similar lumber impo>rted
from'the United States." Now we know that
at that time no duty was applied on Canadian
lumber of the classes in question. But id~
1931 our Government imposeci on lumb.er a
special war revenue tax of one per cent, which
was interpreted by the United States Customs
as a duty, and as justifying them in applying
a duty o! $1 per thousand to importe fromn
this country. Negotiations were carried on

bet.ween the Governments of the two countries, I think, although I have not seen the
correspondence, and late in the autumn of
the saine year our Govern.ment, by Order

in Council. suspended the application of the
excise tax; and then the United States can-

145

celled their duty of $1. Later on that year,
in November, our Government passed a further

Order in

Council, making this

exemption

retroactive to the time that the Budget was
brought down, in order to keep lumber on
the free list. There was no change from that
time until April 6, 19M2, when the Budget
resolutions increased the special excise tax
from one to three per cent. In the following
June the American Government imposed a
tax of $3 a thousand feet upon imports of
lumber. It does seem to me that by negotiation the two Governments might have
avoided the imposition of these taxes. The
reduction under this agreement will be of
substantial benefit to Canada.
May I cite a Canadian Press dispatch from
Victoria, o! March 28, which a.ppeared in an
Ottawa paper last month. It refers to record
activities in the timiber market on Vancouver
Island and readg:
Greater activity in the standing timber
market and in logging and milling prtion
than at any time in the history ofVancouver
Island was revealed in a survey made public
to-day.
Wjthin the last f ew weeka billions of feet
of standing timber, mostly Douglas fir, have
been acquired by operating companies in a
series of deals running into millions of dollars.
New operations are being opened on both the
east and west coasts of the island.

Log prices in the last year have risen 20
per cent. Prices of standing timber are stiffenIlg but not yet up to the pre-depression levels.
Prducers see possibilities o! the Canadian
market on the prairies opening up with renewal
of construction activities. This mairket lian
taken littie for 10 years.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:- I am afraid that is
too optimistic.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The Canadian Press
bas a reputation for reliability.
I think those who make a careful study of
the agreement, particularly in relation to the
items to which I have referred, will admit
that this is a move in the- right direction, for
by the inerease o! our foreign trade there will
be greater opportunities for employment, and
these in turn will be reflected in better conditions throughout the country. AlI honourable members have practically admitted th io.

REVISEU EDITIoN

146

SEINAT E

True, there are differences between us, but
they are largely matters of detail. Therefore
I submit that the treaty is decidedly a step
in the right direction and should be approved.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators. I cannot let the remarks of the
honourable senator who has just taken bis
seat (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) pass without dissent.
He said hie was sure that ail honourable nierabers on this side agree with honourable members on the other side in favouring this treaty.
Surely the honourable gentleman bas listened
te the numerous and very plainly spoken
speeches fromn this side for the last few days.
Certainly we do not agree with our honourable
friends opposite that this is a good trade
agreement.
As my right honourable leader
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) said a few days
age, we are not voting against it. But let
there be no misunderstanding: we on this
side of the House do not favour the treaty.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I may explain te
my honourable friend that I based my statement on what is contained in the letter
delivered hy our Minister at Washington to
the Secretary of State of the United States,
which I thought reflected the views of the
Conservative party.
Hon. JOHN A. MACDONALD (Cardigan):
Honourable members, rising for the first time
in this Chamber, I should like to say of the
honoîurable gentleman whose scat I 110W
occupy, the late Hon. John MeLean, who
died a few weeks ago in the ninetiethi year
of bis age, that ne finer gentleman ever lived.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD: This treaty bas
been discussed se fully that I had net intended
te takc part in the debate, and I would nlot
do se but for certain remarks made by the
honourable gentleman frein Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair). To me it is amazing te hear any
bonourable gentleman fromn Prince Edward
Island, of ail places in Canada, defend the
treaty. Prince Edward Island is already suifering. and will continue te suifer, from its
operatien.
0f ail places in Canada from
wbich one might expect approbation of this
treaty, certainly Prince Edward Island sheuld
be the last.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: What about New
Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD: New Brunswick
may get some little concession on lumber.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Migbt I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
What
about a resolution passed hy the Legislature
of Prince Edward Island the othler day?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

Hon. Mr. POPE: Order in this court!1
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD: I do 'net know
te what resolution the henourable gentleman
refers. The Legislature of Prince Edwnrd
Island has, been in session for only twe or
three days.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Speech from
the Throne stated that the trade agreement
was a geod one.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD: Naturally the
Liheral Premier of Prince Edward Island
would sav so. The honourable gentleman
wbo precetled me (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) spoke
of the concession on lumber. What use is
that te Prince Edward Island?
We are
importers of lumber. While I am glad te sec
the lumberman get some henefit from this
treaty, any resultant rise in the price ef
lumber wvill be te the detriment of tIse Island.
I could net follow the bonourable gentleman's argument je faveur of the treaty, unless
lie was attempting te show that in a gencral
way it might perhaps benefit soinu other
sect ions of Canada.
He referred te fox furs. We aIl kcowv that

any knowledge of the potato business knows
that as far as this agreement is concerned
it does not give us a thing that is worth

category as our table stock potatoes.
The concession on potatoes is not the
whole story. The fact that the United States
can send potatoes here makes the situation
very much worse. Previously American potatoes coming here had to pay 75 cents, the
same amount as was paid on Canadian potatoes going to the United States. There was
equality, but now there is no such thing. They
pay nothing; we pay 75 cents. The result is
that to-day the farmers in Prince Edward
Island, New Brunswick and Ontario are not
getting anything like the prioe they would
have been getting if it were not for this
treaty. The difficulty lies not so much in the
fact that potatoes are coming in here in large

potatoes are coming in.
I have this feeling about the agreement,
and I hope I am right-no person, not even
the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance,
can make a statement at this stagethat the men responsible for it, men of long
experience in publie life and possessed of at
least common business sense, do not intend
to let the existing condition continue. As
there is a very easy way to correct it, I feel
satisfied that it will be corrected. We know
that United States potatoes are not specifically
mentioned in the treaty. They are covered
by a blanket clause which permits United

United States potatoes come in free. So, if
there is one thing I want to do more than
another it is to appeal to the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Finance to see to it in
the framing of the Budget this year that the
tariff on potatoes from outside countries is
raised to a reasonable point, for the United
States will automatically come under the
same tariff. I hope I am right in believing

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD.

that these men will consider curing in this
manner the condition I have referred to.
I shall not delay you much longer, honourable senators. I should just like to mention
the fact that as far as Prince Edward Island
is concerned the tariff generally is a handicap.
We do not get much benefit from protection
except in so far as it helps to maintain the
industries of the rest of Canada and thus
provide us with a market which is always open
and free. As a matter of fact, in Prince
Edward Island we do not strongly advocate
tariffs; we accept them, and are prepared to
accept them, simply because they furnish a
market which no foreign country can take
away from us. Were it not for the tariffs
that maintain the industries of this country
and support its industrial population, we
should have no market at all if outside countries chose to erect a prohibitive tariff wall
against us, and we cannot ourselves consume
all of our own products.
I want to say that I am in favour of the
principle of this agreementHon. Mr. SINCLAIR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD: -but I cannot
sit quietly by, while it is going through, when
I think it works an injury to the province
which I have the honour to represent.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
If no other
members desire to speak. it is my privilege
to close the debate.
I have listened attentively to all that has
been said in this House since I moved the
second reading of this Bill. My right honourHon. Mr.
(Right
able friend opposite
Meighen), who answered me, expressed the
fear that this trade agreement would be on
the whole unfavourable to Canada. He cited
some figures showing that already the movement of trade between Canada and the United
States indicated that we could hardly hope
to receive any great benefit from the treaty.
I realize, as he also would realize, that the
first two months are not a real test of the
value of the treaty. Many months must pass
before we can form an opinion of what the
results will be, but I have figures which
indicate that they will not be unsatisfactory.
Here are the returns for January and
February of 1935 and 1936. I do not know if
they are exactly the same as those quoted by
my honourable friend from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan).

Well, those figures certainly are not discouraging, contrary to what the remarks of
some honourable members would lead one to
expect.
My right honourable friend expressed fear
of the consequences of a sudden change of
tariff policy by the United States. He cited
the experience of 1912-13, when a free exchange
of wheat was abruptly terminated by that
country. But perhaps his memory is faulty.
The Underwood Tariff of the United States,
which came into force on October 3, 1913,
provided for a duty of 10 cents a bushel of
60 pounds on wheat, but there was a proviso
to the effect that wheat could be imported
free of duty from countries which did not
impose any duty on United States wheat. I
cannot find that there was any action taken
by Canada to secure free entry for wheat in
1913, but on April 16, 1917, an Order in
Council was passed providing for the admittance of United States wheat free of duty.
Consequently, from April, 1917, to May, 1921,
when the Emergency Tariff came ioto force,
Canadian wheat was admitted into the United
States free of duty under the reciprocal provisions of the Underwood Tariff.
The position is similar with respect to
potatocs. The Underwood Tariff provided for
a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem, but there
was a proviso admitting potatoes free of
duty from countries which did not impose
any duty on United States potatoes. By
Order in Council the Canadian Government
provided for the entry free of duty of United
States potatoes in 1918, and from November
of that year until May, 1921, when the
Emergency Tariff came into force, Canadian
potatoes were admitted into the United States
free of duty under the reciprocal provisions
of the Underwood Tariff.
Ion. Mr. DANDURAND.

Regret has been expressed at the fact that
the duty on furniture has been reduced from
45 to 27j per cent, and that potatoes and
magazines are on the free list. Our new lady
member (Hon. Mrs. Fallis), to whom we
listened with great delight, made particular
reference to magazines. Now, as honourable
senators know, if the Bennett Government
had succeeded in reaching an agreement with
the United States those items would be the
same as they are now. Mr. Bennett offered
most-favoured-nation treatment, which implied
the intermediate tariff, and as a matter of fact
the intermediate tariff is mentioned in Hon.
Mr. Herridge's communication.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Cardigan): But
the Bennett Government asked something in
return.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Whatever might
have been obtained in return, the fact is that
furniture, potatoes and magazines would have
been as they are under this agreement, because
the offer of the Bennett Government was to
that effect.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They did not make the
agreement, though.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They would not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall come to
the matter of quid pro quo. But I say now
that no stone can be thrown at the present
Government as regards furniture, potatoes and
magazines, because these items are the same
as they would have been if the late Government had actually made an agreement based
on the termas of its offer.

APRIL 2, 1936

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The honourable gentleman is speaking of something that could flot
have happened, because they would flot agree
to the general ternis offered by the United
States. Consequently there is no analogy.

now the fewer hie wilI bave to take back
next year.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, we
get under this convention mucli more than
was refused by the late Government.
I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that beL ore Mr. Bennett lef t
on bis first trip to London hie had Parliament make a considerable increase in duties
under the general tariff and the intermediate
tariff. We ail know of his very cool reception by the British Govcrnment, which feIt
that hie had raiscd the tariff walls so higli that
even if they werc lowered ten per cent, as
hie offered to Iower them, it would be impossible to get British goods over them. Now,
although Mr. Bennett was negotiating with
the United States during 1934 and 1935, lie
did not raise the intermediate tariff on tliose
three items: furniture, potatocs and magazines. I arn surprised that hie did not do so.
Questions wcre asked of the Governmcnt last
session as to wbat negotiations were being
carried on and what advances were being
made, and in response to those questions the
Prime Minister would say: "Please do not press
the matter. We are negotiating." After we
came into power we entercd into negotiations
and made the samne offer that the Bennett
Government liad made, namely, moetfavoured-nation treatment-the intermediate
tariff. Wc could not have progressed at ail
if we had offered anything less, because the
Uni ted States were opposed to granting us
any concessions uniess we extended to them
most-favoured-nation treatmcnt.
I amrn ot recriminating at ail. 1 have the
highest esteem and respect for the qualities
of Right Hon. Mr. Bennett, and I take it for
granted that lie did bis level best in trying
to convince the authorities at Washington
that they should give him better terms.

Hon. Mr. DANDUiRAND: I -do flot &aim Vo
be a propliet in this matter or in any other.
My good fri.end from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) conilained- thiat our manufacturers are undully threatened, if flot actually
injured, by this convention, and lie dilated.
on bis 'belief that tliey would he placed in a
very difficuit position. How would tliey be
injured by the intermed-iate tariff? It is, wbat
tbe late Government offered. I arn of opinion
that our manufactuirers are not prejudicially
affected. I do not say that smc ms.y n.ot bave

of comnpetition, but I w.oul'd d-raw the attention of this 0bamber to the fact t.lat the
int.erxnedfiate tariff bas been raised) considterably and is as high as, and in some instances
higlier than, the general tariff of 1929. 1 bave
not niet many manufacturers, but tbey bave
their mout.bpieces in the Press. I bave n-ot
heard from tbcse sources that thbe manufacturers feel tlier are very mucb injured by this
trade agreement.
When I t.old my honouaatle friend from
Montarvflle that the late Government bad
offered the intermediate tariff, lie replied,
"Yes, but they asked. for better conditions";
just as I heard a moment ago from anotli&
honourable gentleman opposite, "The late
Government wanted better conditions." My
reffly is simply this: whatever better conditions the late Government mnight bave ohtained, it was bound to introduce that element
of competition for our manufacturers whicb
is found in the intermediate tariff.
I say t-here is something illogical in the
affirmation that we who incline toweds freer
trade may have injured the inanufacturers of
Canada by showing less interest in their welLare than would be possible under the traditional Conservative tariff policy. I subseit
that whatever concessions miglit lie obtained
from the United States, our manufacturers
w.oufld, under the intermnediate tariff offered by
the Bennett Government be ini no better position than' tbey are under- the present convention.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If my honourable friend will allow me-the gisV of hie remark sj that the Conservative Government

could not see any possibility whatever of
coming to a satisfactory agreement with the
Un'ited States. Now, I ask my honourable
friend, why assume the Conservatives would
have negotiated this treaty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will put this
question to my honourable friend. On the
hypothesis that the Bennett Government
would have obtained better conditions for entry
of our goods into the United States market,
would not the manufacturers of Canada have
been subjected to keen competition under the
intermediate tariff? I say to our manufacturing industry, whatever might have been the
advantages obtained in the American market
under suich an arrangement, the American
competition in our market would have been
the same as under the present convention.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD: May I interject
that so far as potatoes are concerned I should
be perfectly satisfied to give United States
potatoes free entry into Canada if the
American Government would give us a reciprocal concession.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Right Hon. Mr.
Bennett could. last session, have put potatoes
in the intermediate tariff, but he did net do
so. Now my honourable friend says, "I hope
the Government under its discretionary power
to apply the intermediate tariff will protect
us." That is to say, he hopes that the present
Government will <lo what perhaps the late
Government should have donc last session. I
do not know what will be done, and I shall

The question is, have we secured a fair quid

should have obtained better terms, but I submit that the King Government obtained from

have had to do with affairs of state know that
one cannot bring into the public arena the
conferences and negotiations that precede a
treaty. But. strange to say, the Mail and
Empire on the 5th of November last contained
the following. and se clo:e is it to what was
being mooted between the two Governments
that it was alleged it must have been inspired:
Under the late Government the reciprocity
negotiations with the United States blew up
Roosevelt definitely and
when President
categorically declared his inability to extend
any concessions on, any terms to:
The codfishing and halibut fishing industry
of the Maritime Provinces.
The potato growing industry of the Maritime Provinces.
The dairying industry of Ontario and Quebee.
The wheat growers of the Prairie Provinces.
And anything effective for the cattle raisers
of the West.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Mr. Roosevelt was prepared ta extend concessions ta:
Canadian lumber.
Canadian alcoholie liquors.
The haddock fishing industry of the Maritimes to the extent of a limited quota arrangement which would extend but limited benefit
to the fishermen.
The live stock breeders of the West upon a
combined quota and price arrangement which
would mean but little to the industry.
It is in comparison with these limited
benefits proffered to Mr. Bennett that any
arrangement negotiated with Mr. King will be
judged.
I helieve that that was pretty much the point
where negotiations stood when the King
Gov ernment came into power.
I would ask honourable members, comparing what is reported here with what appears
in this trade agreement, whether there are
not the following apparent additional concessions. I may say that the United States
imports from Canada by calendar years are
based on figures of the United States Bureau
of Statistics.

these concessions obtained by the King Government were flot offered to the Bennett Govemnment.
Within the last two hours one of my honourable friends opposite has said that the Prime
Minister went to Washington and signed
where he was told to sign. I would direct
bis attention to the fact that Right Hon. Mr.
King obtained these concessions-concessions
which Right Hon. Mr. Bennett could flot
obtain. Whetber the Bennett Government
would have accepted those advantages had
they been offered it *at the time, 1 do flot
know. Be that as it may, it will, as I said in
my opening remarks, be severai months before
we shall know where we stand, but I feel
this treaty gives us consîderable advantages.
0f course, I realize it is not what the
Reciprocity Treaty of 1911 gave us.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Why did you not get
it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because the Conservative party sinned against the most
sacred interests of Canada.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The honourable gentleman's party is in power now and could have
obtained a similar treaty according to bis
idea. of the negotiations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That oppartunity
was lost in 1911. Wheat and potatoes were
free under the 1911 treaty. In this connection I recail an incident which is illuminating. Mr. Carveli, who formerly repreaented a New Brunswick constîtuency, Ieft
Sir Wilfrid Laurier to join the Union Government. Later he was appointed to the chairmanship of the Dominion Railway Board. A
few years afterwards I was in company witb
some members of Parliament and senators on
board a train moving towards Montreal. Mr.
Carvell was sitting apart, somewhat estranged,
for we were f ast friends of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, from whom he had separated. Someone said, "It was nothing short of a crime for
Canada to reject the Reciprocity Treaty of
1911." Mr. Carvell could not restrain himself. He jumped up and said, "It was a
crime." He was speaking for New Brunswick, for Prince Edward Island. Under that
treaty potatoee and ail the other products of
the farm were free. To this day, as I said
when moving second reading of this Bill, 1
have retained a feeling of grievance towards
the electorate of Canada. My honourable
friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) .said

this afternoon, in French, that the people had
spoken against recipracity. That is the only
reason given for its rejection in 1911. But
the people of Canada did not speak
against reciprocity. The province of Quebec
was carried by our opponents on the cry
raised against any contribution to British wars
except for the defence of Canada. That was
the slogan of Mr. Bo.urassa's Nationalism, supported by Mr. Monk, Sir Robert Borden's
lieutenant in Quebec, and subsîdized by rnoney
of the Conservative party. Sa I say that the
1911 election did not show the opinion of the
people. I repeat that if Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
inetead of going to, the people and trying to
arouse sentiment througbout the land in f avour of bis proposai, had favoured a referendum,
two-thirds and more of the people of Canada
would have voted for the treaty of 1911.
That treaty bas gone, but if you will compare
it with this convention you will find that it
was a mine of prosperity. Time bas passed,
and we have done our hest. We hope the
United States and Canada will benefit.
I close with this statement ta the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien). He said: "See what will happen
if the balance of trade with the United States
is against us." I could have put the question
to him: "Do you dlaim. that in every agreement witb every country of the world we
sbould try to have the advantagc in favour
of Canada?" That is nat fair trade. Fair
trade is an exchange, and wbile the balance
of trade witb the United States may be
against us, we may have a large balance in
our favour with Great Britain. It is a triangle.
Settiement is made in New York. If during some years prosperity bas been great,
it bas been great because of the excbange
hetween Canada and the United States and
between Canada and Great Britain.

SASKATCHEWAN SEED GRAIN LOANS
GUARANTEE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 23, an Act to assist the
Province of Saskatchewan in financing the cost
of seed and seeding operations for the crop
year 1936.
He said: During the past few years the
Dominion Government, under authority of
Orders in Council passed pursuant to relief
legislation, granted to the Prairie Provinces
financial assistance for the purpose of enabling
farmers to purchase seed grain and to carry
on seeding operations generally. This assistance was given by way of loans to the province, secured by provincial treasury bills.
When the Govetrnment of Saskatchewan applied to us for financial assistance to cover
the cost of seed and seeding ,operations for
the 1936 crop season, we advised it that
any such assistance, if granted, would be by
way of a Dominion guarantee. In the case
of loans obtained from the banks by municipalities the provincial government guarantees repayment. The Dominion undertakes
by this proposed legislation to supp'lement the
provincial guarantee. In the case of loans
made by banks for seed grain assistance required in the local improvement districts where
there is no municipal organization, and where
the Department of Municipal Affairs operates
in its stead, the money is borrowed by the
Minister of Municipal Affairs, the province
and the Dominion guaranteeing repayment of
such loans to the banks. Mone detailed information can be furnished on that point.
The Bill before us authorizes the Dominion
to gua.rantee bank loans made under the Seed
Grain Ait of 1936. It says:
The Governor in Council, subject to the
provisions hereof, may authorize the guarantee
of the principal and interest of any loans made
by any chartered bank and guaranteed by the
Province of Saskatchewan under the authority
of The Municipalities Seed Grain and Supply
Act, 1935, of Saskatchewan and amendments
thereto, for purchasing seed grain and providing other assistance to farmers in connection
with seeding operations during the spring of
1936.
The Governor in Council, subject to the provisions hereof, may authorize the guarantee of
the principal and interest of any loans made
by any chartered bank and guaranteed by the
Province of Saskatchewan under the authority
of The Local Improvement Districts Act, 1936,
of Saskatchewan or of The Local Improvement
lion. Mr. DANDURAND.

Districts Relief Act of Saskatchewan and amendments thereto for purchasing seed grain and
providing other assistance to farmers in connection with seeding operations during the
spring of 1936.
The guarantee or guarantees given under the
authority of this Act may be in such form and
on such teris and conditions as the Governor
in Council may approve and may be signed on
behalf of His Majesty by the Minister of
Finance or the Acting Minister of Finance or
by such other person as the Governor in Council
may from time to time designate.
The aggregate principal amount of loans
guaranteed by the Government of Canada under
the authority of this Act shall not exceed four
million dollars ($4,000,000).
No guarantee shall be given under the authority of this Act, unless provision is made that
the liability of the province of Saskatchewan
and the Government of Canada in respect of
any such loan guaranteed by them shall be
separate and successive and not joint and that
the Government of Canada shall only be liable
to implement its guarantee in respect of any
loan to the amount that the province of Saskatchewan is unable to implement its guarantee
in respect of the same loan.
No guarantee shall be made under the authority of this Act unless provision is made that if,
at the end of the period of not exceeding three
years for which any such guarantee is given,
the Government of Canada is required to pay
any ainount in respect of any such guarantee,
the province of Saskatchewan will deliver to
the Minister of Finance treasury bills or other
obligations of the province of Saskatchewan in
such form and subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister of Finance may approve,
equal in principal amount to the amount which
the Government of Canada is so required to
pay.
The Governor in Conncil shall have full power
te make all such orders and regulations as may
be deemed necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes and intention of this Act.
I think I have given the purport of the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Act may
be cited as the Saskatchewan Seed Grain
Loans Guarantee Act of 1936. If there is
no opposition to the principle of the Bill, I
would ask that it be given second reading
now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable leader of the House a question? Does
this Bill give the Government a blank cheque
such as was given to the Bennett Government
under the old Relief Act, or is the amount
specified?

APRIL 2, 1938
Hon. Mr. HAIG- Up to that it is flot
limited?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Mas the honourable
leader any information as to how the figure

of $4,000,000 was reached?

Is it just guess-

work, or what is it? The ainount specified
may be insufficient or it ma'y be more than
enough. If the amount specified is not
required, what is to become of the balance?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: It may already have
been expended.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I do not thjnk the
honourable gentleman is quite correct in that
rcgard. I suppose the honourable leader
has no information as to how the estimate was
made of the requirements for seed and to
assist farming operations. I should be glad
to know if he has such information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
answer to my honourable friend's question.
Two general methods will be followed in the
financing of seed grain requirements for 1936.
The first is through advances by mortgage
companies, with a provincial government
guarantee for repayment, as provided for by
the Seed Grain Advances Act of SaskatMortgage companies which have
chewan.
clear-titie land are expected to finance their
tenants without goverfiment guarantee and
security. Reeves and treasurers of municipalities have been advised by the Provincial
Government that advances for seed grain to
applicants whose land is under mortgage are
flot to be made until reliable information
bas been furnished to show that the mortgagee
is unable or unwilling to finance the applicant.
The second inethod is (a) by municipal
boans from banks, these to be guaranteed by
the province and supplem&ented by Dominion
guarantee; (b) by boans obtained from banks
by the Minister of Municipal Aiffairs and
guaranteed by the province and the Dominion for seed grain asistance in the local
improvement districts; and (c) by boans
obtained from banks by the Minýister of
Municipal Affaira. and guaranteed by the
province and the Dominion for seed grain
assistance to certain farmers in rural munîcipalities.
Under the first metbod the farmer is permitted to apply directly to his mortgage
company or to the munitipality. If the
application is made direct to the mortgage
company, it will be accepted or rejected and
the municipality in wbich the applicant lîves
will be notified accordingly. If the applica.
tion is made to the municipality, it is to be
approved of in accordance with the general
regulations and forwarded tci the mortgage

company for attention. In this connection as
well, the mortgage 'company will notify the
municipality as to whether the application
bas been accepted or reje*ted. After the
mortgage company has approved the application it will issue authority directly to the
borrower to secure his grain and submit the
accounts direct to the company for payment.
This procedure prevents duplicate advances
being made by the mortgage company and
the municipality. It is estimated that the
mnortgage compan-ies will advance approximately $1,OOO,OOO. No guarantee is requested
from the Dominion in respect of such boans.
With reupect to boans to be guaranteed
by the province and the Domindon, the representative of the provincial Department of
Agriculture will sit with the committee of
the municipal council and pass upon every
application. The municipality will make a
report to the provincial Department of
Agriculture, and, finally, a total credit will
be estahlished for that particular municipality.
The farmer will enter into an obligation,
agreeing to psy the amount borrowed plus
interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per
annum. As security for the advances, the
municipality will be given a statutory first
charge upon the borrower's crop for the
current and the next succeeding year, and
in addition a charge upon the land of the
borrower. A rebate of one per cent interest
to the farmer is to be permitted if tbe boan is
paid not later than a date, to be fixed, in the
autumn of this year. The rate of interest
charged to the farmer will be the saine as tbat
charged by the mortgage companies, namely,
6 per cent.
The Dominion proposes to give its guarantee only in cases where assistance cannot be
secured otherwise, or where the banks are flot
in a posaition to finance the farmer or the
rnunicipality without requiring our guarantee.
Furtbermore, the Dominion guarantee will
be given only where the bank bas agreed to
an interest rate not exceeding 4 per cent.
The difference between the rate charged the
farmer and the rate paid to the bank is to be
set aside by the province as a reserve against
loss. Any moneys which, the Dominion will
have to provide in implementing its guarantee
at tbe end of three years shaîl be secured by
Saskatchewan treasury bills or otber form of
security, and the ultimate loss is to be borne
by the province to the extent of 75 per cent
and by the municipality to the extent of 25
per centIn local improvement districts which are
administered, not by a local council, but
by the Departrnent of Municipal Affaire, the

156

SENATE

Minister of Municipal Affairs will borrow from
the banks and re-loan directly ta farmers.
The province and the Dominion will guarantee these boans. The rates charged will he
the saine as those I have already quoted.
Checking of applications for loans will be done
by provincial officiais.
Because of the drought in the south, some
farmers have left their farms there and
settled in rural munticipalities in the north.
These rural municipalities have refused ta
assist such farmers, and it is necessary for the
Provincial Government ta provide the necessary assistance. An ameodmont is being made
ta the Local Improvement Districts Relief
Act ta, enable the Minister of Municipal
Affairs ta borrow money ta assist sucb farmors
andl ta authorize the province ta guarantee the
repayment of moncys s0 borrowed.
A re tbese explanations satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Yes, quite satisfaetory.
But I suppose the $4.000.000 is merely an
estimate of what may ho roquired, for it
w ould be almost impossible ta state a dofinito
figure. This mioncy xvill bo uscd for supplying
seed and assisting farmers generally, and if
the xvhole of the sum. is flot required for that
purposo the balance w'ill flot bo uscd for any
other purpose, I pi-estime.
Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND: It appears ta
have been anly reasonable ta fix a limit of
$4,000,000. Fvery farmer will endeavonhr ta
finance himself throughi the boan companies.
It is only svhen hie fails ta do so, and when
the municipality is unable ta corne ta bis
roscue, that advances will be made by the
Provincial Government in conjoniction witb
the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should like ta ask the
honourable leader a question. I see no provision bore for Alberta or Manitoba. Do they
roquire no assistance?
Han. Mr. GILLIS: Mr. Aberhart will look
aff or Alberta.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the case of
Manitoba nogotiations have heen going on
witb respect ta similar assistance, and if sucb
assistance is required a Bill along the ines of
this one will be introduced at a later date.
The amnourot involvod in the case of Manitoba
will ho very rnuch less than that required for
Saskatchewan.
As ta Alberta, tbe previaus Administration
authorized boans up ta $2.250,000 ta the Government of that province for variaus purposes.
That was donc by Order in Council of the
26th of Septeinher, 1935, P.C. 3045. One item
in that Order in Counicil reads as fallows:
Hori. Mr. ]DANDERAND.

Eatimated cost of seed grain that sbould now
ho purchased in Alberta ta secure proper seed,
$300,000.
Since wo took office loans totalling $3,932,000
have beon authorized for paymont ta Alberta
for relief purposes and ta reimburse the provincial treasury on acuunt of relief, including
agricultural relief expenses previously incurred.
and paid from provincial funds. Consequently
it is ot expected that Alberta will require
furthor assistance.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Honourable senators,
Alberta is ot as large a wheat-producing
province as is Saskat-chewan, but normally
thero will not ho much difforenco botwoon the
prov inces as ta the assistance required. AIberta's crop, tan, bas been affected by drougbt
and rust.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:

When

shaîl

With beave, 1
Hon. '.\r. DANDURAND:
would move the third roading now. It bas
been suggcsted by aur legal expert, the Law
Clerk of the Sonate, that two smaîl amendmonts should ho made. I ar not altogether
recanicileýd with respect ta ane of those proposed amondments. The Law Clerk dislikes
the word "imptement," which occurs twice
in subsection 1 of section 4:
No guaranteo shahl be given under the authority of this Acte unless provision is made that
the liability of the province of Saskatchewan
and the Government of Canada in respect of
any such boan guaranteed by themt shahl ho
separate and successive and flot joint and that
the Governinent of Canada shail only be hiable
ta iniplement its guarantee in respect of any
boan ta the amount that the province of Saskatchewan is îînable ta implement its guarantee
in respect of the same boan.
The Law Clork says tlsat some years ago
the use of this word caused, on an appeal ta
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Counicil,
considorablo oxpense ta the Dominion. Ho
adds thaj the word is marked "rare" in the
Oxford Dictionary, and suggests that in this
instance some ather word ho suhstituted, sncb
as, for instance, " fulfil."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
was another word ho suggested.

"Perform"

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Do honaurable
senaturs think we should strike out "implement" and substitute one of the suggested

157

words? There was a third word suggested,
but I cannot recall it at the moment and I
have nlot the Law Clerk's memorandum
before me.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do nlot
think any one of them is better than "implement."
Perhaps we
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
might leave the Bill as it is in this respect,
for the time being. We may be able to
agree upon a different word in later bils.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Why not let the
matter stand until to-morrow, when the right
honourable leader of the other aide (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) may be present?
Yes. I also
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
give honourable senators notice that another
suggested amendment will be dealt with tomorrow. Section 5 says, "The Governor in
Council shall have full power to make al
such orders," and so on. It is simpler to say,
"The Governor in Council may makre al
such orders."
It was ordered that the motion for third

GUARANTEE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 23, an Act to assist
the Province of Saskatchewan in financing
the cost of seed and seeding operations for
the crop year 1936.
Honourable members of the
He said:
Senate, hast evening, when moving the second
reading of this Bill, I drew the attention
of my colheagues to a suggestion whîch had
been made to me that the word "implement,"
which appears in lines 9 and il of the second
page of this Bill, should be replaced by the
vvord "fufil," "perform," or "complete," the
reason being that some years ago, on an
appeal to the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, the use of the word "impieunconment" had caused considerable
templated expense on the part of the Dominion. I have no objection to the word
"implement" heing replaced by the word
"fulfil."
Also, in clause 5 of the Bill there is an
expression that might well be replaced by
one word. Clause 5 says:
The Governor in Council shaîl have full
power to make aIl such order&-etc. It is suggested that we strike out the
words "shall have full power to," and substitute the word "may."
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourabie senators, I move that this Bill be not now
read a third time, but that it be amended
by replacing the word "implement," on page
2, lines 9 and 11, by the word "fufil"; also
that the words "shaîl have full power to"
in line 24, page 2. be replaced by the word
ýmay.y
The proposed amendments were agreed to.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: HonourabIe members, before the Bill receives its third reading I shouhd like to ask just one question.
Is this the first piece of hegislation whereby
the Dominion Government guarantees boans
made by a province for a matter of this
nature? I am not familiar with the situatin. It is quite possible that legishation of
this kind has been passed before.

SENATE
Briefly, the position as I sec it is this. At
ieast until a faw yaars ago, or, se far as I
know, up to the present tirne, when a province dasirad money for anything of a purely
local provincial character the Federal Government was not called upon to guarantea
any boan the province had made. It seems
to me that if this is the beginining of this sort
cf thing it may ba a littie dangerous. I arn
net opposad te the lagisiation at ail, becausa
I understand the necassity for it. The question in my mind is whether or net the
province cf Saskatchewan, along with the
other provinces, bas reached a stage whare it
cannot secure from the banks the moneys
that ara necessary for provincial purposes. Is
that the position to-day?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It is.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: If that is se, I suppose this is the cnly way eut cf it. Then
aIl I wi,,h to ask is information as te wbether
or not this is the first legislation of such a
character. If it follows the practice of the
past there cannet ha any objection to it
at al. and if the financial situation cf the
Western Provinces is sucb that they cannet carry on, I suppose we shall simply have
te agree te it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: I have net at
hand any information as te the assistance that
bas been givan by the Faderai Governent
during the last fiftaen ycars. but, if my
memcry doas net fail me, thaere have been
measures authorizing us te advance money
for secding purposes. I think ail the information my bonourable friand requires wil
ha found in our Hansard report of the statament I made ycsterday on the motion for
second reading, when I explained the whoe
modus operandi as te the giving cf halp
under this Bill.
There are provisions for
safeguarding the interests of the Dominion.
It will guarantea only after the Province bas
guaranteed, and will pay, upon the giving
cf sednrity by the Province, only aftar the
Province bas failed te pay. Before a municipality or the Province will corne te the
rescua cf a bcrrowar bie will hava te show that
the banks have refused te make hirn an
advancc. I tbink my bonourable friand will
find that the sceene is well devised te give
the utmost protection te the faderai treasury.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I hava ne doubt cf that
at ail; I do net question the provisions that
arc made for proecting the treasury in every
way possible. My question is a simple one.
Is this the first piece cf legislation undar
which boans made by a provincial government, for purely provincial purposes, are
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

guaranteed by the Dominion?
That is a
distinct point. I arn quite aware that millions
of dollars have been loaned out of the federal
treasury te Western provinces; but this
measure is flot on that basis at all. The
Province of Saskatchewan wishes te get
money te, expend on purchasing seed grains
for farmers. Heretofore in a case of this
kind a province has always arranged the
necessary boans, so far as I know.
The
Federal Governrnent has supplied seed grains
to farmers on homasteads, but the local govcrnment has had to provide the money for
seed grains needed by those who. had acquired
title to lands. Now, is this the first rneasure
under which the Federal Government wili
guarantee loans mada by a province for
purely provincial purposes?
If it is, wc
cau, see what rnay happan in future. Other
provinces may corne and ask the sarne kind
of treatment with respect to ail sorts of
undertakings.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As rny honeurable friend knows, direct help has been given
by the federal treasury in the past. In reply
to bis question may I say that 1 surrnise fromn
the brief given to me that this measure is
a ncw departure.
I will read part of the
information I gave yesterday on the motion
for second reading.
During the past few years the Dominion
Governnment, under authority of Orders in
Couiii patsscd pursuaiit to relief legisiation,
grante(l te the Prairie Provinces financial

assistance for the purpese of enabling f armers
te puiehase sced grain and to carry on seeding
eperations gaoerally.

This assistance was given

by way of loans to the prov ince, secured by
provinîcial treasury bis.

Wlien the Governînent of Saskatchewan
applied te us for financial assistance to cover
the est of see(l and seeding oerations for
the 1936 (rop seasen, we adviscd it that
any sncb assistance, if granted, would be by
way of a Dominion guarantee.
In the case
of boans obtained from the banks by municipalities the provincial government guarantees
repaymcnt. The Dominion undertakes by this
prepoed legisiation to supplement the provin~cial guarantea.

Io the case of

loans made

by banks for seed grain assistance required
iii the local iinprovement districts wliere there
is no municipal erganization, and where the
1)epartment of Municipal Affairs operates in
its stead, the money is borrowed by the Minister of Municipal Affairs, the province and
the Dominion guaranteeirig repas ment of such
boans to the banks.
But the guarantce of the Dominion Government will be secondary to that of the province.
My honourable friand says that other provinces may apply for sirnilar legislation. This
is what I said yesterday, in reply te a question as to Alberta and Manitoba:

APRIL 3, 1936
In the case of Manitoba negotiations have
been going on with respect to similar assistance, and if such assistance is required a Bill
along the lines of this one will be introduced
at a later date. The amount involved in the
case of Manitoba will be very much less than
that required for Saskatchewan.
As to Alberta, the previous Administration
authorized loans up to $2,250,000 to the Government of that province for various purposes.
That was done by Order in Council of the
26th of September, 1935, P.C. 3045. One item
in that Order in Council reads as follows:
"Estimated cost of seed grain that should now
be purchased in Alberta to secure proper seed,
$300,000."
Since we took office loans totalling $3,932,000
have been authorized for payment to Alberta
for relief purposes and to reimburse the provincial treasury on account of relief, including
agricultural relief expenses previously incurred
and paid from provincial funds. Consequently
it is not expected that Alberta will require
further assistance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am sorry to trouble
the House in this way, but I was not here
last night. Briefly, this is the position as I
see it. The present Bill is the first measure of

this character ever to come before Parliament.
By it the Dominion is guaranteeing loans
made by a province for purely provincial
purposes; in this case to assist in financing
the cost of seed and seeding operations. I
quite agree that we must recognize the situation as it exists. In the case of the Western
Provinces, and perhaps of other provinces as
well, their financial condition is such that they
are unable to carry on without assistance.
But this measure will establish a precedent.
Up to the present time the Federal Government has made loans direct to provinces.
Hon. Mr. RHODES: Taking their tréasury
bills as security.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Heretofore the Dominion has not guaranteed provincial loans; so
this measure is a distinct departure. Now, I
am not saying that the step being talgen
should not be taken. The situation may be,
and likely is, such that the step is absolutely
necessary. What I am pointing out is that
the Bill will be a precedent, and therefore

the Government ought to be very careful
lest that precedent be relied upon in the
future by provincial governments demanding
guarantee of loans to enable them to make ail
kinds of expenditures. I hope such a situation
will not develop, but if it does the Government in future will have to be very careful
before deciding to follow this precedent.
The motion for the third reading of the Bill,
as amended, was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill U, an Act to amend
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
He said: In order that honourable senators
may have a general view of this measure, I
may explain that of the sixteen sections six
are concerned, in whole or in part, with the
correction of purely clerical errors in revisions
of the Act in 1932 and 1934. These are
sections 3, 8, 10, in part, 11, 12 and 13. In
1934 many of the sections were renumbered,

and in some cases the cross references were
left unchanged. The result, of course, is confusion and impossibility of proper interpretation of the sections affected. The amendments
are to correct this state of affairs.
Another group of sections-1, 4, 5, 15 and
16-deals with the removal of anomalies produced by revision of the Act in 1932 or 1934.
Section 6 restores a provision deleted in
1934, that the forms of half-yearly statements
shall be supplied to the companies by the
department.
Section 9 makes applicable to Canadian
fraternal benefit societies the same provisions
respecting the constitution of boards of
directors as are now applicable to Canadian
life insurance companies.
This leaves only three sections which may
be said to change the principle of the Act.
Section 2 provides that the general meetings

of Canadian insurance companies and fraternal
benefit societies shall be held in Canada.
Section 7 provides that the participating
policyholders in insurance companies who
under the Act receive 90 per cent of the
participating profits fund-the remaining 10
per cent being set aside for the shareholdersshall have their proportion increased to 95 per
cent. I do not know how many insurance

SENATE

160

companies have been applying the principle
of the Act and allowing the participating
policyholders 90 per cent, but I believe most
of the large companies of Canada have for
a number of years freely given 95 per cent of
profits te the participating policyholders and
retained only 5 per cent for the shareholders.
Section 14 extends the penalty clause of
the Act te companies which have been incorporated by letters patent of the Dominion
for purposes other than the transaction of
insurance, but which do actually transsot that
business.
I do flot ask the Senate now te bind itself
te the principle whîch is involved in this or
any other amendment contained in the Bill,
as some of the changes may ho deemed te, be
vital. I suggest that after the Bill bias been
given second reading it be referred te the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, su
that after it has heen thoroughly examined
there, the Sonate may ho free te accept or
reject any part of the Bill.

CANADIAN ENLJSTMENTS IN PRINCESS
PATRICIA'S RIEGIMENT
FURTHER INFORMATION

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the Orclers
of the Day are called, may I be permitted to
rectify, if possible, the answers given to me
with respect to the numbe-r of native-baru
Canadians who enlisted in the Princess
Patricia's regiment, which was raised, by Col.
Hamilton Gault and was the first recruited
in Canada for the Great War.
I have here an extract taken from two
beautifully bound volumes of the history of
the regiment which may be found in the Parliamentary Library, and so are available ta
every honourable member of this House. I
flnd that the answers given to me were not
exactly correct. I have here a list of ail the
men from the province of Quehec, giving their
names, their numbers, their original units,' the
place where they joined, and the date . I also
have the names of those who were killed or
wounded. In the list of the wounded is the
name of Col. Hamilton Gault himself, a gentleman who, has been for many years living in
England and is a member of the British Parliament. H1e was wounded three or four
times, being finally wounded s0 badly in the
leg that the whole of it had ta be amputated;
and afterwards, when hie had an. artificýial limb,
he went back ta the trenches.
I will not delay the House by turning up this
record, but I think it is a direct answer ta the
article which recently appeared in the Toronto
edition of Liberty. Ahl I ask is that I be
permitted ta deposit this information on the
Table of the Senate s0 that any honourable
member niay see it.
May I ad', I find that 108 French Canadians--of course they were native-bornenlist-ed- in the regiment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As far as I
arn conoerned, not only arn I willing that the
honourable member should have leave, but I
should like ta have him give a numerical summary of the findings hie has9 taken front this
record. Otherwise it will nat appear in the
Senate Debates.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am dealing only
with the Princess Pat's-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I know.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: -and I think it is
but fair ta Hamilton Gault that the truth
should be known. Not only did he give of
his own time, but hie spent a lot af money
in recruiting the regiment. As I have said,
there were in that regiment 108 boys fromn the
province of Quebec. Many of them were
wounded. or killed.

Haw many
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Canadians were there?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: One hundred and
eight.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Ail Canadians?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 picked out those
from the province of Quebec. I should be
very glad ta go back to the book and
secure the information asked. Almost as
many enlisted in the Princess Pat's as in
the famous 22nd Regiment of Quebec.
1930 WHEAT CROP EQUALIZATION
PAYMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 22, an Act to provide
for the payment of certain suina of money
to primary producers of wheat with respect
to wheat of the 1930 crop delivered ta provincial pooî organizations.
H1e said: Honourable members of the
Senate, this is a Bill to provide for the payment of certain sums of maney ta primary
producers with respect ta wheat of the crop
of 1030 delivered ta provincial pao1l organizations. The present Gavernment is faced
with a fait accompli-an accamplished fact.
It inherited the settlement of this question

when it was sworn in on the 23rd of October
last.
Ail honourable members of this Chamber
who sat here last year will remember the
Bill under which the Canadian Wheat Board

was organized ta superintend the marketing
of wheat in interprovincial and export trade.
Among the powers granted ta the Board were
the following-clause 7, paragraph (b) :

-ta buy and seil wheat: Provided that no
wheat shahl be purchased by the Board except

froma the producers thereof;
and paragraph (f):
-notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, te acquire fromn Canadian Co-operative
Wheat Prnducers Limited, upon ternis ta be
approved by the Governor in Council, ail
wheat or cantracts ta purchase or take delivery

of wheat in respect of which the Gavernment
of Canada bas given a guarantee.

An understanding was arrived at between the
Canadian Wheat Board and the Canadian
Co-operative Producers Limited for the transfer or sale of ail the wheat, or contracts
for it, ta the Canadian Wheat Board. That
was on the 8th of October. On the lOth
of October an Order in Council was passed
authorizing this sale, subject ta an audit
or verification by auditors. That was the
situation when the present Government came
into power in the latter part of October.

wheat upon the market to clear up their
position with the banks. The provincial governments eventually undertook to give this
guarantee. The initial price was, therefore,
maintained at $1 a bushel until the latter part
of .June, when it was reduced to 85 cents,
but practically ail the wheat had been delivered before this reduction in price was
made. There was a loas of approximateIy
$25,000,000, which eventually had to ha
assumed by the provincial governments under
their guarantee, and the wheat pools carried
over 43.000,000 bushels of wheat out of the
crop year of 1929 into the crop year of
1930. Wheat was stili going down in price
and on the l6th day of July, 1930, the pools
set an initial price of 70 cents a bushel for
any wheat delivered after that date, whether
it was from the old crop or from. the new
crop that was then coming in.
This was the situation when the late Government was formed on the 7th day of August,
1930. Conferences were held in Ottawa hatween the 9th and l2th of August, the provincial governments, the Iending banks, the
pools and the Federal Government being represented. Later conferences were held with the
lending banka at Toronto and Winnipeg.
It was finally agreed by the 26th of August
that the initial price should ha 60 cents a
bushel for the new crop of 1930. It wau understood that it would be impossible for the
provinces to guarantee the accounts of the
banks for the 1930 crop, in view of the crop
bosses which they had to assume in connection
with the 1929 crop. It would appear that all
understandings ini connection with the crop
from this time on were understandings relached
with the Federal Government. The price of
wheat was 95 cents a bushel when the initial
price was set at 70 cents. When it went down
to 88 cents the price was set at 60 cents. M'len
it went to 72 cents, that is, on the 15th day
of October, the initial price was reduced to
55 cents, and when it went doýwn to 65 cents
the initial price was reduced ta 50 cents.
About. this time, as a resuit of an understanding reached, between those responsible for
the line of credit and the pools, Mr. J. I.
MeFarland was made General Manager of the
Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers, which
was the central seiling agency of the wheat
pools. Mr. McFarland apparently worked in
close co-operation with the lending banks and
the Federal Government for the remainder of
the 1930-1931 crop year, but the grain was taken
in under the contract pool method, and was
marketed through the Canadian Co-operative
Wheat Producers. Mr. McFarland, however,
closed all the selling agencies which had been
established in countries outside Canada, and
12745-l1J

did business through the Winnipeg Grain Exchange entirely.

He carried on from the 27th

day o! November until the 3lst day o! July,
1931, in the samne manner.as though the pools
themselves bad been operating, without any
control other than the change made in the
agencies tbrough which sales were made in
other countries.
A meeting of the provincial governments, the
Federal Government, the wheat pools and the
lending banks was held on tbe 24th day of
June, 1931. Previaus to and at this meeting

the Western representatives asked the Faderai
Govarnmaent to set Up a Wheat Board to
handie ahl the wheat of Western Canada. The
Faderai Government proposed an alternative
sceme, which was to set up a corporation,
with Mr. McFarland at the head, which would
lease the elevator systems of the pools and
carry on the grain business as an ordinary
grain corporation.

Mr. McFarland refused to

head the corporation, and the idea did not
materializa.

Out of the discussion of Juna 24 there arose
a plan whareby the Faderai Govarnment,
through Mr. McFarland, acting as Ganeral
Manager o! the central selîng agency o! the
pools, attampted to stabilize pricas through
entering upon the market from time to time.

Thair plan in this connection can be best
stated in the words of the then Prime Minister,

Right Hon. Mr. Bennett, in a statement put

out to the public at the time, and quoted in
the Seventh Annual Report of the Canadian
Co-oparative Wheat Producers:
The wheat pools of the three Western Provinces, which own nearly 1,600 country elevators. as well as terminaIs at Vancouver and
Fort William, wilI operate this year in the
saine way as privately owned enterprises.
They will have ample working capital and the
provinces will not be called upon to guarantee
their oparations.
As a substantial number of praducers desire
ta market their grain on the pool principle,
the elevators operated by the pools in the
severai provinces will afford ta such producers
an opportunity ta have their grain daalt with
by the operation of a voluntary pool. The
elevators will make ta such producers an
initial paynient of 35 cents a bushel on the

saine basîs as ta quality and point of ship-

ment as in previaus years.
The Dominion Gavernment will take whatever action may be necessary ta insure the

arderly marketing of the crop of the year.
Panie conditions wili not be permitted to
contrai the prices obtaining for this year's
Western grain crap.
It wîll be seen that the Federal Government undertook ta assist in financing the
handling of the carry-over from the 1930 crop
and in financing the crap of 1931, on
condition that the contract pools were to
cease to function. Mr. McFarland was to have

164

SENATE

control of stabilization activities and the Government itself a greater control over the
handling of the wheat.
In addition to the Wheat Pool there have
been four coarse grain pools in the provinces
of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, but none in
the province of Alberta. There was a pool
for rye, one for flax, one for oats and one for
barley.
When the contract pools ceased to operate
and the new system was brought into being
on the first day of August, 1931, there was a
carry-over from the 1930 pooled wheat of
76,648,000 bushels. There was a carry-over
of oats of 1,286,000 bushels; a carry-over of
barley of 1,752,000; a carry-over of flax of
405,000 bushels, and of rye 758,000 bushels.
The reports of the auditors and the statements of Mr. McFarland indicated that coarse
grains were not used in stabilization, that is,
they were not used for the purpose of affecting the price of grains produced in later years
by the farmers of Western Canada; but it is
agreed by all that the wheat was used for
stabilization purposes. It was used in this
way: the 76,648,000 bushels either of wheat
or contracts to take control of wheat were
set apart in separate accounts and kept off
the market from July 31, 1931, down to
November of 1935. Thus arises the claim that
is now before us. The wheat pools have
claimed that because the wheat of their contract signers was taken off the market and
held off the market to improve prices to
others as well as themselves for succeeding
crop years, they should have some payment
in addition to the initial payment, particularly where that was made on a basis of
50 or 55 cents a bushel, in 1930. It was finally
agreed through letters exchanged between the
Canadian Wheat Board, which was set up by
the legislation of 1935, and the wheat pools,
that payment should be made. The amount
of the payment asked for was an equalizatien of the 55 and 50 cents initial payments
up to the initial payment of 60 cents a bushel
on the basis of 60 cents a bushel Northern,
Fort William, taking into consideration the
spreads as between the different grades. The
Wheat Pool also maintained at that time that
additional payments amounting to $890,000
should be made on coarse grains in order te
bring them up to the highest initial payments
that had been made on those grains.
After examining into all the records the
Government has come to the conclusion that
the pools are justified in asking for an
equalization of 60 cents a bushel on wheat,
in view of the fact that wheat was used in
stabilization, but that they are net justified
in asking for payment on the basis of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

highest initial price on coarse grains, in view
of the fact that coarse grains were not used
in stabilization. It lias been decided, however, that since these coarse grains were all
sold during the period, and since there was a
profit on rye, barley and flax over and above
the initial price which was paid, the amount
of that profit should be returned to the
producers, but since there was a loss on
oats, the fact that the Government has had
to implement its guarantee in connection with
the account in order to cover that loss
should he a final settlement with regard to
oats. It bas, therefore, been necessary to set
up legislation providing for the payment of
$6,509,000 on wheat and $350,000 on coarse
grains; also providing sufficient money to pay
the costs of distribution of the funds. The
agency defined in the Bill, namely, the Wheat
Board, and any agencies determined upon by
it, and agreed to by the Government, will
make these payments to primary producers
on account of grain which they delivered to
the pools and which was later taken over and
handled under the direction of the Goverement
through Mr. MeFarland.
The Wheat Board legislation of 1935 provided that the Commission was te have power
7(f) notwitistanding anything hereinbefore
contained, to acquire from Canadian Cooperative Wheat Producers Limited, upon
terms to be approved by the Governor in
Council. all wheat or contracts to purchase or
take delivery of wheat in respect of which the
Governmnet of Canada has given a guarantee.
Under this section the Canadian Wheat
Board, which was set up under the Act, could
take over from Canadian Co-operativ'e Wheat
Producers, Limited all wheat and contracts to
deliver wheat which had formed a part of the
stabilization activities of Mr. McFarland
previous to the set-up of the Wheat Board.
Any agreement reached between the Wheat
Board and the Canadian Co-operative Wheat
Producers Limited, with regard to a settlement
for wheat and contracts to purchase or take
delivery of wheat, had to be approved by
Order in Council.
An Order in Council was passed on October
10, 1935, approving a certain agreement which
had been entered into by letter between the
Wheat Board and the Canadian Co-operative
Wheat Producers Limited, subject to the
amount contained in the letters of agreement
being verified by auditors' certificate. The
amount contained in the letters of agreement
was 88,262,415.37.
After the change of government instructions
were given to the auditors, on November 5,
1935, to make an audit for the purpose of
verifying and authorizing the amount contained in the Order in Council dated October

APRIL 6, 1936
10, 1935. The auditors', report revealed that
the amoirnt of K8262,415.37 was made up as
follows:
36
Wheat.............$6,509,269
44
Coarse grains..........890,658
Expenses of provincial pool
862,487 57
organizations for 1930-31..
$8,262,415 37
Before the auditors' report was available it
was thought necessary for the proper operation
of the Wheat Board tbat the wheat and wheat
contracts should be delivered to the Board.
This was done on December 2, 1935, as a resuit
of a meeting heid in Regina on that date, and
through a document whieh is on the files in
the foilowing f orm:

An examination of the legisiation will show
that wheat was the only grain wbich could be
handled under this Order in Council, but the
auditors' report indicated that the money which.
was to change hands, namely, $8.262.415.37,
had to do witb coarse grains as weil as with
wheat. In view of the fact that these transactions took place on the 2nd December, 1935,
under an Order in Council based on the legislation of 1935, which Order could not deal
with coarse grains, and in view of the further
fact that thbe auditors' report showed the total
amount of 38,2415.37 contained $862,487.57
for expenses of provincial pool organizations
for 1930-31, whicb the Government thought
that it did not owe, it was considered advisable
to have legislation making possible payments
not covered hy the provisions of the Order in
Council. as well as payments wbich might he
covered by those provisions.

In other words, the present Government,
confronted with the contract between the
Whieat Board and the Co-operative Wheat
Producers, endorsed hy Order in Council, decided simply to f ollow the procedure as practically completed except for the audit,
obtained that audit-wbicb the late Government itself would have ohtained-and came
to the conclusion embodied in the Bill.
Now, if I have not sufficiently explained and
justified the measure, I would ask my honourable friends opposite, who are jointly responsible for the cbild now hefore us, to supplement my statement.
HonRight Hon. ARTHIJR MEIGIIEN:
ourable members. I do not rise to object to
the principle, nor, at this timne. to criticize
details of the Bill, for I assume th-aît after
being given second reading it will be referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
There we shahl have the advantage of reading
again the memorandum wbich the bonourable
leader of the House bas favoured us with,

Riýgbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I believe the
Minister of Agriculture introduced the Bill in
the bouse of Commons.
The honourable leader states tbat the Government of tbe day is confronted witb a fait
accompli. If so, there is notbing more to be
done. It is just because the Government
must argue that it is not a fait accompli that
we have this Bill before us.
The fait acHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
compli is if the contract between the parties

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not at ail.
Though, in the opinion of the Government,
there is a fait accompli in the contra*ct hetween
the parties, the Canadian Co-operative Wheat
Producers Limited and tbe Canadian Wheat
Board, it does not mean a fait accompli to
us, because under tbe Wbeat BoaTd Act sucb
contract must be approved hy the Governor

As a matter of fact, I think my bonourable
friend was hiappier in bis estimate of the
situation as a fait accompli tban hie was if

ing to them under the contract, as endorsed
and agreed to by the Order in Council. The
Order in Councit, which recognizes the rights
of the parties, is stili alive, and it will remain
ative t.ii] the Bill is passed. My right honourable friend may say: "But do the vendors
agree to this?" 1 arn under the impression
that they are agreeabte to this form of
settiement of their dlaim under the signed
contract. But if we rejeet this legistation,
as we have a right to do, the vendors wilt
fait back upon the Order in Council, whjch
then wilt be very much alive.
I drraw the attention of my right honourabte
friend to the fact that only wheat could be
covered by the Order in Council. But the
report of the auditors discloses the fact that
coarse grains are included, as well as expenses. I have flot the report before me, but
it is from that report that the decision of the
Government springs. They say the item of
$900,000 odd of expenses included in the
$8,000.000 wa.s incurred before the stabilization by the pools, and, that therefore it is a
matter that rests with the pools. So this
$900,000 disappears, according to the report of
the auditors. I do not know that the Order
in Council would have been affected very
much, for it said, "subject to the report of the
auditors," and coarse grains do flot fait undier
either the contract or the Order in Council.
Something had to be done if we wanted to
give compensation, because the settiement
between the otd Board and the Producers was
to be comptete. Now we are at the point
where we must close the book and make that
settIement. We make it hy coming to Parfiament, explaining the situation, and asking
that, in order to execute the contract of sale
between the two parties, as understood hy the
Government, a certain sum shoutd be paid.
There i.s a clause which provides for the
assent of the parties. I have reason to believe
that they have agreed upon the figures, and 1
doubt very much whether my right honourabte
friend, after examining the Bitl and considering the situation as it is, and the figures that
confronted the Government, witl deny that in
the face of an Order in Councit which was
insufficient as to coarse grains *we were right
in corning to Parliament, whieh has the
supreme power in deciding as to the payment
of such large sums.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The only
difference between us is this. It is just a
question of whether or not, under the Wheat
Board Act, the Wheat Board bas power to altot
profits on coarse grains, aggregating 3350,000.
It takes over that part of the moneys, to be
paid to the owners of it-those producers who
delivered the coarse grains. Now, assuming

ii

that the honourable member is right, and that
under. the Wheat Board Act moneys standing
to the credit of the coarse grain producers
canniot be paid, att that was necessary was a
Bit] to enabte payment. I think that if my
honouralte friend will look ai. the PriceWaterhouse report he wilt flot find that the
3350,000 was not paya'ble under the Wheat
Board Act as it is. 1 think he wilt find that
what Price-Waterhouse reported was that the
additionet amount, making the aggrcgate
$890,000, coutd not be paid under the Act.
Price. Waterhouse and Company found that
ait that coutd be paid was, first, 36,600,000 in
respect of equatization on wheat, and second
-as I maintain, subject to correction--3350,000
in respect of moneys hetd te the credit of producers of coarse grains. That is ahl that could
ha paid under the old Act; that is att that can
be paid under this. Undar the old Act and
tha Order in Council the Goverument could
psy axactty what it is paying here-6,600,000
in respect of wheat and 3350,000 in respect of
profits on coarse grains--not a cent more, and
not a cent less.
But assuming the honourabte gentleman is
right in respect of profits, ail we should have
here is a Bit] to enabte themn to be paid, not
a repetition of the Act of 1935. If ha were
altering the amount which the otd Government agreed to pay, which is the amount
claimed, if audited and found correct, ha
ought to, comae here. But he is not altering
the amount at ail; it is exactly the same.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: I do not see that
we are not altering the figure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- It is not being
&itered. at att, for the Order in Council permittad of the payment of only such amounts
as were certified by the auditors to be payable; and the amount certified hy the auditors
to be payable in respect of wheat was $6,600,000
and no more. Now, I say the auditors certified that $350,000 was payableHon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN: Perhaps 1 am
wrong. If I arn wrong, then the honourable
gentleman shoutd be here asking for power
to pay that sum, and that atone. Ha bas no
excuse for being here with aIl this statutory
surptusage. I emphasize this att the more hacause we have a world record in the preamble
of this Bill; it is the Marathon preamble of
att times--one, two, three pages, and part of
a fourth, whereas usuatty all that is necessary
is about four lines.
The honourabte gentleman has given a
pretty concise and fairly clear account of a
complicatad matter. It definitety establishes
that the legislation, if it is necessary at att-

and it can be necessary for only one thingbas its beginnings in the Wheat Board legisiation of last year and the profits in respect of
coarse grains. Why, then, ail this historical
rocital running back over the ages? The honourable gentleman's idea, 1 prosume. is to show
that the Conservative party and Conservative
governments have not been very businesslike in
the matter of whoat. WelI, I know somothing
about that.

APRIL 6, 1936
That situation, if lef t to itself, would have
produced ini this country a level of prices wbich
would have meant, flot merely disaster, but
the end of Canada as a wbeat exporting
nation. It would have brought about esnigration from Western Canada, and utter desolation in that part of our country.
These were the cîrcumstances through whicb
this great business bad to lie guided. I was
flot a member of the Administration, and personally I had notbing at ail to do with the
handling of the problem. I always feit fairly
cornfortable, because I realiÈed that the Prime
Minister of the day knew a great deal about
the grain business and about the West; furthermore, I was aware that lie possessed business capacity of a bigli order. I stand here
to say that in rny opinion, under bis direction
and witb the co-operation of Mr. McFarland,
the wliale difficulty was ably managed tbrougliont, regard beîng had ta ail the cireumstances, which tied it up witb almost every
problemn facing tbe world, and to the perils
which bad to be avoided day by day, week
by week and month by month. It is easy now
to stand up and say: "You should have sold
wlieat. You Iost markets by nat selling. You
got people into the habit of eating bread
made from other wheat." But the facts do
not justify that criticism. As far as I can
see, the selling of our wbeat ta the usual
extent-leaving only our ordinary carry-overat tbe distress prices of thase times, would
bave meant simply the differenoe between
starîng it in Europe and storing it in Canada;
and if we cannot make profits in any other
way, I would rather make themn on storing
wheat than on nothing.
Now, we are losing some money. I fancy it
is tbe best-spent money we bave ever lost in
this Dominion. There is at least a chance
in the future for those three Western provinces. The population has remained there;
the people have stayed on the land. Hope
is now justified, and hope aiready exista.
That is due in fia maTi rneasure to the way
in whicb tbis baffiing and perpiexing wheat
probiem bas been handled.
We did not produce the "baby." It came
to us. I arn not contending that it came from
the party represented by lionourabie gentlemen opposite, for it had another source. It
lias been weii nurtured and welI disciplined,
and as a consequence it bas now met the
best fate that could have been boped for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I sliould like
to make a few remarks foilowing those of my
riglit honourable friend. I would not dare to
enter, even if I couid, upon the fielel that lie
lias travelled in dealing with the efforts of
the Iast five years to prateet the farmers of

the West. Not a word that I bave uttered
could be considered as a condemnation of those
efforts. Personaily I was simply looking on
from afar, -and I arn unable to express any
opinion as to the benefits or defects of the
policy that was follawed. I arn quite sure
that the Government which preceded the present one did its very best with respect to the
situation in the West, in trying ta save as
mucli as possible of the wheat produet, which
is of sncb immense importance ta Canada.
My right honourable friend lias alluded to
the preamble of this Bill. I draw bis attention to the fact that we have been taking
care of the private interests of thousands of
people in the West. By aur endorsation and
guidance we bave become more or les
partners in disposing of the crops during the
last four years. The Government made a
paternal effort ta solve the problems of large
numbers of indîviduais in that great constitnency comprising the three provinces. My
right bonourable friend wonld, I tbink, find
it

difficuit

ta

point

ta

any

governmental

nndertakiag similar ta the handling of this
wbeat during the last three or four years. I
believe there is nothing comparable ta wliat
bas been dane. In fact, in this I amn only
repeating expressions of my right honourable
friend. The Dominion brancbed out along
an entirely new line of aperations, and now
we are liquidiating an important part of those
operations.
When the present Administration came into
power it found that by virtue af tlie Act passed
last year authority bad been given ta the
Government ta sanction by Order in Council
such procedure as that contained in the contract of sale between the Board and the
Wheat Producers. But there are two opinions
as ta the respoasibility of the Government
towards Parliament. This Bill bas ta do witb
a large matter, of considerabie importance; it
represents something like $7,000,000. The
Governnment now in office bas deemed it
proper ta ask Parliament ta ratify the liquida-

tion ta this extent of the preceding Administratian's operations in wheat.

bas passed on that.

in such circumistances my right honourable
friend would flot consider it improper for the
Government to ask the opinion of Parliament again.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It was asked
once.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We were faced
wjt-h an Order in Council whicha could not
cover coarse grains. Perhaps we could have
passed another :Order in Council to cover
payment of the amount in question, but I
doubt it.
In the preamble, to which my right honourable friend refers, there is this statement:
Whereas no justification exists for the
inclusion of the said sumn of $890,658.44, inasrnuch as The Canadian Wheat Board is not
authorizcd to purchase coarse grains or contracts to purchase or take delivery of coarse
grains, as no mention was made of coarse
grains in the agreement between The Canadian
Wheat Board andi the Canadlian Co-operative
Whieat Producers, Limited, summarized ahove
or in Order in Counecil P.C. 3199, dated the
tenth day of October, 1935. approving such
agreemient îinder certain conditions, and as an
audit of the operations of Canadian Cooperative Wlieat Producers, Limited, discloses
11o information
tlîat said operations in connection with coarse grains were effected for
stabilization purposes in the national interest;
but
Whercas an audit discloses thiat the operations in respect of coarse grains which were
condueted as separate pools resulted in credit
balances in the case of certain coarse grains
ani consequently the primary producers who
delivered said grains are justified in expecting
to receive said credit balances.
Tin -e are the reasons wby that part of
flic contr:ict entered into by the ',endors
could not be impleînented. Now w-e come to
Parliament asking authorization for the paynment of a certain sum and sanction of the
whoic operation. We believe we are on the
safer ground whcn submitting such a matter
to Parliament.
Hon. J. P. MOLLOY: Honourable senators. I had niot imtended to say anything on
this mattcr. but there are a few rcmarks I
should like to makc now that the discussion
bas gone so fac. We frequently hear references to "the forgotten man." But that termi
cannot refer to the "baby" that has been
spoken of bore, for there can be no question that it lias been pretty weli looked after,
no miatter to wbom it belongs. My honourable friend tbe leader on this side says to
the rigbt bonourabie leader on the other side.
'It ils your baby."
The right honourable
gentleman retorts. "No; it is yours." Well,
betwccn themn be it.
The bonotirable leader of the House hias
stated( that a pooi was formned in Manitoba
lIon. -Mr. 1)ANDURAND.

in 1923-24, and that fifty per cent of the
farmers of that province became members. I
always refuscd to join the pool. In 1929,
as we ail kn.ow, the prices of wheat dropped.
The man who was outside the pool and who
sold his w'heat or did flot seil it, as the
case may be, stood eith-er to win or to lose.
Another statement which lias been made and
cannot be contradicted is that the pools by
their operations have soaked the people of
Western Canada to the extent of $25,000000.
That is not disputed, in fact. And now
they are coming- to the Dominion treasury
and. as the honourable leader tells us. asking
for another $7,000,000. The question I should
like answered is this. What about the fifty
per cent of wheat raisers who do not get a
cent under this Bill? They are the "forgotten men" here. If the measure were fair,
those fifty per cent who were flot in the pool
would receive as much as, or perhaps more
than, the members, according to the relative
quantities raised or sold.
In other words,
cvery farmer in Western Canada who raised
wheat woul-d benefit fromn the Bill.
But it is the old, old story. You cao get
.something if you Join an organization whicha
in time becomes strong enough to, exes-t
power as part of a political machine, as the
pools in Western Canada did after they laid
the corner-stone of their ruination by trying
to dictate the world price of wheat. When
they lost money and failed they went back to
the provincial governments for $25,000,000;
and now. as I have alrcady said, they are
asking the Dominion for an additional
$7.000.000. If it were lef t to me thcy would
flot get a cent unless everybody in the wheat
business in Western Canada received the
samne treatmcnt. 1 submit that that is fairness and justice. Because men organize they
cao dictate to the Tory party one day and
the Cnit party the next day. They semr to
think they are at liberty to apply, if they
deem it necessary, to the provincial government as their first choice. and later to the
Dominion Goveroment.
I am sick of the
whole thingi

Hon. F. B. BLACK, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented,
and moved concurrence in, the report of the
committee on Bill 22, an Act to provide for
the paym-ent of certain sums of money to
primary producers of wheat with respect to
wheat of the 1930 crop delivered to provincial pooi organizations.
He said: Honourable senators, for the
benefit of those who were flot in attendance
at the meeting of the Banking and Commerce
Committee I may say that if they wilI look
at the original Bill they will find, beginning
with page 1, that ail but the lust paragraph
on that page is deleted. The last paragraph
has been incorporated in the amendment. On
page 2, the first, second and third paragraphs
are deleted, and the fourth paragraph is incorporated in the amendiment. -On page 3,
the first, second, third, f ourth and fifth paragraphs are deleted, and the last paragraph,

Trhe report reads as follows:
1. Pages 1, 2, 3 and page 4, lines 1 to 17,
inclusive, for the preamble substitute the
following:
Wher.eas the result of certain price stabilizatien and other opérations of Canadian Cooperative Wheat Producers, Limited, carried
on with the knowledge and consent of the
Government of Canada by means of advances
by certain lending banks guaranteed by the
Government of Canada in pursuance of Relief
Acts in effect f rom time to time, has been a
loss; and
Whereas a transfer of wheat and contracte
to purchase or take delivery of wheat in
respect of which the Government of Canada
had given a guarantee was made by Canadian
Co-operative Wheat Producers, Limited, to
The Canadian Wheat Board as of December 2,
1935, subject to final settlement of the terms
of such transfer; and
Whereas
Canadian
Co-operative
Wheat
Producers, Limited, had, by February 29,
1932, made transactions related to thse 1930
wheat crop approximately equal to the
deliveries of wheat by primary producers
during the 1930-31 crop year, and an analysis
of the prices at which such transactions took
place indicates that the transactions were
made at approximately sixty cents a bushel,
basis No. 1 Northern, Fort William, in the
case of wheat other than Durum wheat, and
approximately sixty-six cents per bushel, basis
No. 1, Amber Durum, Fort William, in the
case of Durum wheat, but that the spreads
between the prices for various grades of wheat
varied from the arbitrary spreads fixed at the
time the initial payments were determined;
and
Whereas. notwithstanding such loss, the
primary producers of wheat other than Durum
wheat who accepted initial payments on a
basis of sixty or fifty-five or fifty cents a
bushel, basis No. 1 Northern, Fort William,
are justified in expecting those payments to
be equalized on the basis of sixty cents a
bushel, basis No. 1 Northern, Fort William,
and primary producers of Durum wheat who
accepted initial payments on a basis of sixtyfour or fifty-four or forty-nine cents a bushel,
basis No. 1 Amber Durum, Fort William,
are justified in expecting those payments to
be equalized on the basis of approximately
sixty-six cents a bushel, basis No. 1 Amber
Durum, Fort William, with the spreads
hetween the various grades of wheat determinpd on the h,,sis of the prices at which the
transactions referred to in the preceding
paragraph were effeeted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members of the Senate, it will he noted that
two matters are delctcd from. the preamble
as it appears in the Bill. The first concerns
the elimination, from the contract. price of
38,000,000 odd, of the figure of 8800,000 or
$900,000 for expenses, and the second the
reduction of the amount to be paid for coarse
grains froin $890,000 to some $350,000. Those
two items, being omitted from the preamble,
do not appear in the Bill; but the Bill itself
indicates that the producers of coarse grains
will be entitled to a sum commensurate with

SENATE

the profits that were made on the sale of
coarse grains. The Government would have
preferred to have in the preamble an explanation of the disappearance of one item and
the reduction of the other, but the committee
has decided otherwise, and I abide by its
decision.
The motion was agreed to.

INQUIRY

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators. last year, on representations being made
to the Federal Government by myself and
others regarding an intimation that the Government of Haiti would impose the maximum
tariff on fish, fleur and other goods entering
that country from Canada by direct sailings,
negotiations were entered into by the Govornment of Canada with Haiti, whereby a
modus vivendi was agreed upon and made
effective from the 15th of July, 1935, to the
16th of April. 1936.
As this arrangement
expires in

a few days, and as the producers

and exporters of sh, fleur, and other goods
shipped by steamer from Nova Scotia direct
to Haiti are seriously affected. I should like to
ask a question of the honourable leader of
the Government in the Senate.
Are any
negotiations now in progress with regard te
arranging an extension of the modus vivendi
until such time as the Trade Commission
from Haiti interviews and negotiates with
the Canadian authorities? In view of the
dire distress of Maritime fishermen. I would
urge that a temporary agreement be made
and that the present regular service be maintained. pending a favourable trade agreement
between the two governments.

morning. 1 intimated to my honourable friend
the leader of the Senate that there wouid be
no at.tompt to delay passage of the measure,
and that this Houso couid get it through in
time for Royal Assent to-day. The situation
seems somewhat different now, though, with
the prospect of such a.n important measuro
coming beforo us botween threo and four
o'clock, or maybo later. We are asked to
finish our consideration of it by five o'ciock.
The Bill deals withi a subject whichi is of just

House of Commons, and 1 personahly feel
an intimation should bo given that we cannot
be expected to deal xvilli the Bill as we want
to, in the fe'w minutes that flouse in its
pleasuro chooses to give us.
I realize that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the time for consideration of this measuýre
will bo ail too short if we are to pass it in
tiine for the Royal Assent, hefore six o'clock
this afternoon. 0f course, there is ne rule

flouse of Commonis adjourns at six o'clock
on Wednosdays, under a standing ordor, and
1 arn net sure whether that House couid, if it
so e ùosrt d. continue its sitting untii late this
evoening whiie waiting for us. te finish our
werk, sliould xve clecu it proper te rcsurne
after cihto'eieck. If we osewish, wo can
postpone pas-lage of the Bill until to-ntorrow;
but in tirat ex ont, if the flouse of Commons
is beîînd te adjourn at si.-i to-day, it will
ho inmposs.ible te have tise nteaýure saneT
lioed befere the Easter recess. W e aire froc
te dispose of the Bill this aftornooýn or tenterrew. et' te postpone conideration of it
until zifter Easter.
I think my righit honourable friend wili agree
xvith mie that the Sonate wouid net deemn it
opportune te rejeet a Bill based on the
recent approvai cf the electorate, and that
therofore our concorn shouid be te study the
details cf the measuro in ordor te see if we
could net improvo it. From the close attention I have given te the proceedings in the
Commons, I may say that each clause cf the
Bill was carefuily considered and many amendmonts were adopted during committee stage.
Now, can the Sonate for once accept the
Commons drafting and pass the Bill in the
formi in which it will reach us, subject te cur
rovision if necd or occasion arises next
session? It will be for the Sonate te decide.
I thought we might give that measure cf confidence te the House cf Commons by passing
the Bill as it stands to-day, if its princile

believo that it wili net ho challenged by rny
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

right honourabie friend. I purpose te give as
full an explanation as possible cf the Bill,
thon my right honourable friend might give
his views as te its gonerai application and
value, and we might pass it. 0f course, this
wouid imply that we dispense with committee
stage.
There is this advantage in accopting that
procedure. Unempîcyment is a most crucial
question, and 1 should dislike te seo the
Senato tako the responsibility-altheugh it
would be quito justified in doing se-cf pestponing considoratien cf this Bill for three
weeks; for it is my intention te propose that
the Senato adlourn until the 28th instant.
The lieuse of Commons is adjourning until
the 2Oth, and I arn fuliy docided to take the
responsibility cf moving that we adjourn fer
seven or oight days longor. Since the
beginning uf the session xve have had experionce of how long it tak-es the House cf
Commons te dispose cf an impertant measure
with which we can deai exhaustivoiy in frem
twonty-four te forty-eight heurs.
I beas ,e with honourablo members this
probioma as te what it wouid be best for the
Sonate te do. \Ve can absolutely refuse te
accopt the Bill as it reaches us from the other
lieuse-I am speaking cf the fermi and net
cf the principie without testing every clause

westhe axdeption cf the measure.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: The unempicyment measure is undcubtedly important in
the sense that it affects a very pressing,
nation-wvide and vital problem. As I have
intimated te the Huse, I de net feel it is a
measure which we sheuld defeat, in view cf the
fact that it undoubtediy was part cf the
specifie programme cf the party sustained in
the lest election, end there is conscqcîentiy
ne deubt as te mandate. But I de net want
te be understocd as saying that in the presence
cf a definite mandate the Sonate should net
express its own view and record that view
by vote. It may be this. fouse weuld feel it
its duty te de se in the case cf a measure
which touches seme vital principle cf gevernmont, a measure as respects which there is at
stake a definite article cf policy for Canada.
Such a measure I de net take this Bih! te be.
I do not believe there is any grave principle
in issue within its foids at all. Consequently,
for myseif, I feel like accepting the will cf the
electerate and having the Bill pessed in this
lieuse without impedîment.

APRIL 8, 1936
This of course does not mean, and I know
the honourable leader of the Government
wouid flot take it to mean, that it is a measure
we should just allow to go through and shouid
see no more of. Though we may not deem it
our duty to oppose and, if we have the votes,
to defeat it, nevertheless our duty is to express
our views upon it, as well as to review carefully ail its features and improve their expression and their detail in any way we can.
Such, undýoubtedly, is one of the funetions of
this House, and we should exercise it in relation to this measure as in relation to al
other important measures.
That said, I corne to the course we should
pursue. We are faced with a resolution of
the Commons intimating that their House
ad.Iourns this evening at 6 o'clock for the
Easter holiday. The Royal Assent te such
Bills as havp passed both flouses is then to
be given. I again state the view I expressed
a moment ago: there will flot be time
between new and then for us to deal, in the
fashion in which. we thiok we ought to deal,
with a measure se important as this, even
though it- be a measure we do oot wish to
defeat. The right honourable leader of the
flouse of Commons might be so advised. Nor
can I sec any value in our sitting to-night
and to-morrow if the Commons adjourn at
6 o'clock this eveniog, because Royal Assent
to the measure will then inevitably be
delayed until after the Easter holiday.
Maybe the adjournment will be a week
longer in the case of the Senate; but a week.
although important, dees not involve a very
serieus delay, and, in my opinion, if this Bill
does wait another week the ranks of the
unemployed will flot become any more
congested in that time. I do not think anyone expects froma this measure anything in
the way of immediate relief, for it merely
provides for the appointment of a commission
to study, recommend and report. Therefore,
if this resolution does stand, I sbould feel
j ustifled in sharing responsibiiity for postponing the measure until after Easter. If,
on the other hand, this resolution does flot
stand, then I thinkHon. Mr. DANDURAND: This resolution?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The resolutien that the flouse of Commons adjourn at
6 o'clock. Then I thinc we owe it to the
country to proceed with our work, though it
may take to-night and to-morrow, and finish
our review of this measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn glad to
have the opinion of my right honourable
friend on this question. I move now that
the Seno.te adjourn during pleasure. When
we resumne I shaîl know exactly what is the
situation confronting us.

17,'

Hon. C. E. TANNER: flonourable mcmnbers, while it may not be strictly relevant to
the discussion, I think it is relevant enough
to make to the honourable leader of the
flouse a suggestion which I have had in my
mind.
As I understand the matter, we are now
waiting upon the other House for an important
picce of Government legisiation. I arn not
holding my honourable friend the leader of
t'his flouse responsible for the delay; he is
entirely blameless; nor arn I suggesting that
the Goveroment it.self as a matter of fact is
te blame for the situation which confronts
us. But if this Bill should corne to us to-day
or to-morrow, I sheuld like te draw my
honourable fricnd's attention te the fact that
it will be the first piece of major legislation
which the Goveroment bas been able te send
down te this House since February 6. That
is precisely twe months ago. If one takes
the trouble te look at the flouse of Commons
Debates one will discover that 2,062 pages
have been published in two months. Out of
aIl this discussion there has corne te this
Chamber just one bit of important legislation.
It is improper, of course, for us te criticize
the other Chamber, and I have ne intention
of se doing, although we are frcquently
interested in and sometimes arnused by
criticisms of this Chamber and propositions
concerning what is called "reforma of the
Senate." I have said more than once, and
I repeat it to-day, that if any part of this
Parliament is in need of reforma it is the
flouse of Commons. In saying this I amn
referring net te the people sitting there, nor
te the Government, but te the flouse of
Commons as an institution badly in need of
reform.
What is the situation that has prevailed
since we came here? After a vigorous contest in the country a Government was returned with a very large majority. That
Government undertook te do a great many
things which it, and the country, considered
to be important and urgently in need of
attention. But here we are after two months
with nothing donc. That, of course, is the
fault of the system. The Governmcnt is tied
up by the systcm, and we are tied up by the
system, and I arn going te make a suggestion
te my honourable fricnd, who, I presumne, 's
an influential member of the Government of
the day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We ahl have a great
deal of confidence in and respect for the
honourable gentleman. I suggest, therefore,
that he take up with lis oolleagues the idea
that the time of Parliament during the first
month or six w'seks of the session, ingtead

SENATE

176

of being frittered away in discussion which is
uscless, as anyone who peruses the House
of Commons Hansard will discover, should
be devoted to the business of the Government and, the country. Government business
should have the right of way over speeches
of people who come here from various parts
of the country, East and West, filled with
ideas, and who for six weeks or two months
practically govern the country with speeches
that lead us nowhere.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I presume it will be
objected that this is an interference with the
right of free speech. I am proposing, not
that the right of free speech be taken away
from anybody in either House, but that the
business whieh the Government has been
elected to submit to Parliament, and which
the country expects it to dispose of without
delay, be given precedence, and the right of
free speech be deferred. The proclamation
calling Parliament says that it is summoned
"for the dispatch of business," not for the
making of speeches. If the Government had
liad the past six weeks or two months in
which to submit its programme, put it through
the other House, and send it up to us, we
should liave had an opportunity of dealing
with it in a leisurely manner, as we are entitled to do. After that private members
would have an opportunity to make their
speeches and enlighten the whole world if they
so desired. The adoption of such a proposal would help us.
The Gov ernment is powerful, having an unprecedented majority and full control of Parliament. Let it review the rules and regulatiens of the House of Commons and ta-ke
ente itself power to deal with Government
business during the first six weeks or two
months, and let the other gentlemen stand
by. Then it will get its business through.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: They are frittering away two months' time at a cost of
more than $14,000 a day.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
members, let us keep the record reasonably
straight if we can. This Employment Commission Bill was given first reading in the
House of Commons on the 19th day of March.
We understand it has not yet received the
third reading. If honourable gentlemen read
Hansard, as I have tried to do, they will
find, I think, that there was a great deal of
discussion on the resolution introducing this
Bill, more discussion on the motion for second
reading, and still more discussion at the committee stage. Discussion by those who sit
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

behind the Government is not what has
delayed the Bill. I do not say that unkindly.
But let us be fair. I do not ask anybody
to take my word for it. Look at the Debates.
Those who have delayed the progress of this
Bill from the 19th of March to the present
day are not seated behind the Government.
The sarme remark applies, I think, to the
trade treaty, a Government measure which
was passed by us the other day. I think
it will be found that of the 2,000 pages
already printed very many have been taken
up with speeches emanating from gentlemen
not strongly supporting the present Government. Of course the Opposition bas a right
to speak. I think it can safely be said that
more than one-half of Hansard of the House
of Commons bas been taken up by those
opposing the trade treaty and the measure
which we are now awaiting. I may be wrong,
but that is my judgment.
I am not blaming

this Government or any ether.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
ourable gentleman is not.

I know the hon-

My honourable
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
friend is always ready to take a partisan

As to the sugHon. Mr. MURDOCK:
gestion that the Government should have
six weeks during which to go ahead full
speed with its measures. I am saying that it
could not have proceeded any faster than it
did with the trade treaty or the Employment
Commission Bill.
Now, one more word. If we want to convince the people of Canada of the correctness of the opinion held by many, namely,
that the Senate is a fifth wheel to the
wagon, we should simply accept this important measure and rush it through. But since
I have been in the Senate some one bas
suggested-I stand to be corrected forthwith
if I am wrong-that so far as the legislation
of this Dominion is concerned the Senate
may reasonably be regarded as the balance
wheel. Not much balance would be shown
in undertaking to pass through the first,
second and third readings a Bill which is
perhaps the most important to come before
us this session, in order that it may receive
the Royal Assent by 5.30.

A message was received froma the Huse

the establishment of a National Employment

SECOND

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Wlhen shahl this
Bill bc read a second time?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of thie Senate, it i.s not customary
to ask for the second reading of a bill on
the very day of its introductioo into this
Chamber.
Ordinarily two days' notice of
motion for second reading is given, in accordance with our rules. But with leave-and if
no voice is raised i0 protest, I shahl presumo
]eave to, ho givon-I would move the second
reading of this Bill now. Honourable members have just huard His Hlonour the Speaker
read a communication that the Deputy Governor General i, to corne hce this afternoon
at 5.30 tu gix e the Royal Assent to some
Bills. In the meantime wo cao continue
with our xvork.
This Bill is addres'e(-d to tlie solution of
the foremost problem of the day, that of
gix ing work to fellow citizens anci relieving
the (listrCss of a million and a quarter of our
people. It is recognized that the first duty
of a Government is to try to miake the
Leoplo of a country happy. Thougb happiness is an ideal flot very often attained, we
-trive in normal times to make it possible
for oui' people lu achieve at leasd a certain
=-easure of cootentment. The present situation irnpo,,eý upo)0 us a more pressing duty,
îîamelv. to seo to it that thiey receive
the flOceities of life.
Since 1930 ail countries-I know of no happy
exception-have been afflicted xvith the same
kind of ecunumie conditions. 0f course, the
-oisfortunes of our neighhours are nu consolation for pur owo. For fixe long years,
in which Canadians have displayed admirable fortitude and great patience, our federal,
prov incial and municipal governments have
poured ont înuney without stint tu help relieve
distress. But so far the efforts of the various
organizations bave been carried on in a more
or less disconnected way, xithout co-ordinalion. Nuw it is tbought by ils sponsors that

of dispensing relief, and for co-ordinating the
efforts of the bodies which have been dealing
with these mattors.
This me-sure is flot a cure-aIl for our
economie ilîs. It is simphy a means to an
end. and by itself it will flot provide employment. It will be the duty of the Commission
lu point ont the proper direction to public
authorities. The Government and Parliament
wilh nul be relieved of thoir responsibilities
nor of their authority as regards this great
problem of unemployment. The Commission
will ho an aid to the Administration, flot a
substitute for it. Il is impossible for any
Cabinet tu concentralo aIl its thoughts on
the solution of une such probl.em, to the
exclusion of.mulifarious other duties. Honourable members who have sat in Council and
been responsible for the administration of
(lepartments will bear me out in tbat.
We must substitute for more expediency
some degree of planning. -It is necessarv
Ihat there ho a preciso ýurvey or census with
respect to the whole unemployment situation.
And Ihere must be a link to correhate the
policies and practicos of organizations coniributing to relief. s.o that industry, commerce,
financial institutions, labour bodios and sociil
service agencies may co-operale under a
centralized leadership.
With the permission uf the Houso I shahl
supplement my remarks witb a few appendices
for incorporation
in
Hansard. This
is
Appendix No. 1, with respect to classification
of direct relief recipients and arrangements
for collection of data:
Dom-inion-Provincial Conference held
)t
in A thie in Deceinber. 1931, the Sub-Conference
Ottaw~a
on Uneunployinent and Relief considered the
data available iin respect tu relief recipients,
particularly as to its adequacy as a basis for a
cuoprehensive study ut the relief situation.
Fiuding that it would be desirable lu have
statistics înnch mure coniplote, the Sub-Confer-

eure recoininîded that a re-registration of
direct relief recipients ho underlaken by the
proviuces sud uîuiîicipalities; for the purpose ot
procuring uniforni data.
In giving consideration te the establishment
ut a National Employnment Commission the
Sub-Coiîfcrenee suggested as une ut the functions ut the proposeel Comimissioo, the followi ng:
"lu co-uperalion with the provinces and
muuicîpalities to carry out as early as possible
a Dominiun-wide registration and classification
uft huse on relief who are capable ut selfsupportifig work."

Upon turther con.sideration fahlowing the
Couterence, il xvas the opinion of the Department ut Labour thiat the collection ut statistics,

linie. so mnuch su that if the statisties were to

APRIL 8, 1936
would be desirable that steps should be taken
forthwith to put into effect a new statistical
system. With this object in view forme were
drafted by the Department of Labour, and
these forme were distributed to the provinces
at the middle of January, ta be returned in
their completed form each month by the provinces and municipalities to the Department at
Ottawa.
The matter of whether and to what extent
an actual re-registration of those on relief
should be undertaken was left to the provinces and the municipalities to determine, the
criterion in this regard being the adequacy
of the information immediately available on
relief cases through existing municipal records.
In all instances, it should be remarked, the
provinces and their municipalities have undertaken to co-operate with the Department by
securing the detailed data requested. It might
also be observed that relief is distributed
throughout the nine provinces by several
hundreds of municipalities, al.1 of which are
required to co-operate in these inquiries.
Federal authorities, distributing direct relief,
have also been asked to supply information,
these latter including the relief camps heretofore under the Department of National Defence,
as well as those under the National Parks
Branch of the Department of the Interior;
the Departnment of Indian Affairs, in respect
to the Indian population; the Department of
Pensions and National Health, in respect to
certain war pensioners; and the Department
of the Interior in respect ta the Yukon and
Northwest Territories.
Returns received by the Department of
Labour to date have been ample to permit of
some preliminary tabulations being made, and
from the progress so far accomplished it is
anticipated that in the course of a few weeks
it will be possible to commence making regularly
each month a monthly tabulation on all phases
of the relief situation.
The schedule attached indicates the nature of
the classification of direct relief recipients
undertaken by the Department of Labour.

This is Appendix No. 2, givingComparative Figures of Direct Relief
Recipients:
Preliminary figures for February, 1936, show
1,237,775 persons in receiipt of direct relief fren
municipalities and/or provinces during the
month of February, 1966. This grand total
shows progressive reductions since 1933, the
comparison in each previous year being wi.th
the sane montah. Figures for the month of
February back ýto 1933 are as follows: February, 1933, 1,462,274; February, 1934, 1,347,220;
February, 1935, 1,315,052.
The figure for February, 1936, indicates subtotals as follows: heads of families, 274,188;
dependents of heads of families. 910,7-68; individual cases, 52,819; total. 1,237,775. The detailed separation of relief cases, as provided
under the classification of direct relief recipients, is not yet available for the month of
February.
In addition to those in receipt of direct relief
through the municipalities and/or provinces,
72,648 persons were receiving assistance under
the Relief Act, 1935, made up as follows:
Homeless persons cared for in

The above total ailso showed progressive reductions since 1933, the figures for February of
earlier years being as follows: February, 1933,
71.568; February, 1934, 143,839; February,
1935, 116,041.
Though not assisted under the Relief Act,
there are tavo classes of direct relief pa.id by
the Government of Canada from other appropriations. One is relief paid to certain
ex-service men who are pensioners, by the Department of Pensions and National Health,
which covered a total of 34,603 individuals in

The cumulative reduction froi February,

If the problent of direct relief be analysed,
t will be observed that during January last
37-38 per cent of tose on direct relief were
rmpIoyable persons and their dependents,
his proportion being directly due te unemployment; 6-06 per cent were unemployable
persons and their dependents, representing a
clronic social problent; 26-48 per cent were
farmers and thteir dependents, this proportion being due ta the farmîing difficulties of
the last few years; and -08 per cent were
transient personis. perhaps mostly employable.
These figures are amplified in Appendix No. 3.
whici gives a classification of recipients of
direct relief.
Preliminary figures received from the provinces for January, 1936, on direct relief
recipiaents, make possible sonte interesting
analyses of the relief situation. These figures
show a grand total of 1,233.390 in rece'pt of
direct relief from the municipalities and/or
provinces, in respect of which the Dominion
grants in aid are applied, these figures excluding persons engaged on relief work, persons
placed under the farm placement plan. and
persons settled under the relief settlement
scheme.

Of the grand total of 1,233,390 persons
are

as specified, total 6.06 per cent of the relief
problem.
The third main class is made up of those
members of the farming community who are
on direct relief. Farmers total 68,491-65,235
of whiom are male and 3,256 are female.
Dependents upon farmers, of all classes. number 258,14.6. Thus the share of the total number on municipal-provincial relief contributed
by the farming community is 26-48 per cent
of the problem.
The fourth and last class is that of the
transients, persons resident in a municipality

for less than 30 days continuously, who number

1,000. or 08 per cent of the grand total.
'The municipal-provincial direct relief problem, therefore, on the basis of these preliminary

Employment,

APRIL 8, 1936
compiled each month from reports submitted
by employers, it will be seen that employment
in our industries on March 1, 1936, was
substantially less in volume than on March
1, 1930, although as compared with March 1,
1933, practically the low point of the depression, a marked improvement had occurred.
If we needed such evidence, these figures
would indicate the continuance of a serious
unemployment condition.
In
the relief
figures we find 332,180 employable personsfurther evidence of heavy unemploymentand in addition there are the unemployed
who are not on relief. The employment
situation is dealt with fully in Appendix
No. 5:
There are two statistical indices which
indicate the trend of employment in industry
throughout Canada. One is the series of index
numbers of employment in industries other
than farming, fishing and domestie service,
compiled by the Dominion Bureau of Statisties
from reports furnished by employers; the other
is the series giving the percentages of their
members wlso are unemployed, as reported by
trade unions to the Departnent of Labour.
The Index Numbers of Employment:
The Bureau of Statistics index numbers are
all related to a base of 100 points, which
represents the average for the months of the
year 1926. The index for March 1, 1936, stood
at 98-9 points. The pre-depression peak for
the same month, MarcI, was reached in 1929,
when the figure was 114-4: March, 1930, showed
only a sliglst decline ta 110-2. The index,
therefore, shows a net drop on Marcih 1 this
year, compared with the same date in 1930,
of 10-2 per cent (approximately). But this
does not mean that the drop in employment in
the six years to March this year bas been only
10-2 per cent, for other factors enter in.
These factors arise chiefly from two considerations:
(1) These index numbers do not take into
account the normal increase in population.
Assuming that the percentage of the population
seeking gainful employment remains constant,
then the number seeking gainful employment
increases eaci year in proportion to the gain
in general population. The estimate of population increase over 1930 is approximately 8
per cent, so that this factor would indicate the
need of adding a minimum of 8 per cent to
the visible difference between March of 1930
and March, 1936, ta measure more nearly the
net decrease in employment in this period.
The reason for referring ta this addition as
a minimum is due ta the fact that not all
persons were employed at March 1, 1930. If
such an addition were made it would indicate
a net relative decrease in the employment
reported upon of at least 18-2 per cent in the
six years ta March 1, 1936.
(2) The index numbers include as employed
persons some thousands who are on relief works
or in relief camps. The figure for March 1,
1936, is thus supported by this factor, while
that for March 1, 1930, was not influenced in
like manner.
It is to be noted that the index numbers
relate to industrial employment only; they
exclude, among other industries, farming.
Owing to crop conditions in recent years, the

181

farming industry is able now to absorb very
substantially fewer men, even under bonusing
conditions. This factor is not covered in the
index numbers. and figures are lacking on this
phase of employment, but observations would
lead ta the belief that the decrease in farming
employment afforded would be at least as great
as in industrial employment.
To indicate thus a probable decline in general enployment from March 1, 1930, to March
1, 1936, of 18-2 per cent, is not to overlook the
fact that the sane index numbers show that
material progress bas been made in the recovery of employment since the low of the depression. The low was reached on April 1,
1933, when the index stood at 76-0 points, but
a fairer comparison may be made with March
1, 1933 (to use the same month as before), when
the index stood at 76-9 points. From March
1, 1933, to March 1, 1936, the index moved up
by 22 points, or approximately 28-6 per cent.
This 28-6 per cent improvement in the low
point of March 1, 1933, may be taken to indicate the extent of employrnent recovery in the
last three years, subject to a deduction of at
least 4 per cent for the assumed inerease in
the nunbers of persons seeking gainful employment.
To sum up, at Marcih 1 of this year, according ta the Dominion Bureau of Statisties index
numbers of employment in industries other than
farming, fishing and domestic service, industrial
employment showed an apparent net recovery
of not more than 24-6 per cent relative to
March 1. 1933, but a net decrease of not less
than 18-2 per cent relative ta March 1, 1930,
after making allowance to compensate for the
normal growth in the numbers of persons seeking gainful employment: in these calculations
allowance is not made, however, for the influence of relief work on the trend of employment as carried by these figures. It should
also be pointed out that these percentages
are not directly comparable one to the other,
as they are on different bases, that of the
recovery being based on the abnormally low
level of 1933.
Trade Union Unemployment:
The general trend of employment (and conversely, of unemýployment) as shown by the
index numbers is corroborated in a general
way by the Department of Labour figures of
unemployment among their members as reported by trade unions. The recession in employment had set in somewhat earlier among
trade union members than was indicated by
the index numbers of general employment, and
on February 28, 1930, the percentage of unemployment was 11-5 per cent. For the same
date, i.e., the last day of February, in succeeding years the heaviest unemployment was recorded on February 28, 1933, when it was 24-3
per cent. To February 29 this year there was
a reduction in unemployment among trade
unions until the figure stood at 13-8 per cent.
One factor which may have a tendency to
minimize the percentage of unemployment among
trade union members after a protracted period
of unemployment is that members, as individuals, may temporarily cease their membership
for financial reasons after being without work
for some time, while new employees are not
entering trades and occupations, and are not
providing unions with their normal growth.
Part-Time Employment:
In neither of these two indices is any allowance made for persons in part-time employment,

182

SENATE

that is, persons working less than a normal
working week, of whom there are a considerable number at all times during a depression.
Note of Explanation:
For March 1, 1936, the employers' index numbers of employment cover 931,959 workers. The
Trade Union percentage tabulation includes
169,000 union members.
The fact that trade and employment have
revived since the low point of the depression
gives hope for a market revival as against
the views of the pessimists, who are not
quite sure that conditions are improving. It
may be a long process, but all the Government's efforts are directed towards expansion
of our external trade, which it hopes will
make for more employment. Publie works
will be undertaken, but our financial condition imposes limitations. It will not restore
normalcy; it will only alleviate part of our
troubles.
The Dominion-Provincial Conference of
December last unanimously agreed to the
establishment of a commisison as proposed
by this Bill. In support of this affirmation I
submit Appendix 6:
Dominion-Provincial Conference, December,
1935
Text of Resolution re National Employment
Commission.
Reference, page 43, Record of Proceedinge,
Dominion-Provincial Conference, 1935.
3. That there be established a Dominion
Commission on Employment and Relief with
broad functions and powers which would include the following:
(a) In co-operation with the provinces and
municipalities to carry out as early as possible
a Dominion-wide registration and classification of those on relief who are capable of
self-supporting work.
(b) To determine the general standards,
regulations and conditions to be met by any
province in order to qualify for participation
in Dominion funds.
(c) To co-ordinate public works programmes
and employment policies on a long-range
basis, and establish a general consistency of
action.
(d) To supervise the distribution of funds
voted by the Dominion Parliament (and made
available by the Governor in Council) for employment and relief purposes.
(e) To promote the objects set forth in
sections 4 and 5 hereof.
4. That the co-operation of commerce and
industry be requisitioned to assist in devising
plans under which business enterprises shahl
make year-round provision for their essential
quotas of employees and for the increase of
employment. Many industries now recognize
that it is unjust and anti-social for business
management to produce casualties for public
treasuries to take care of, regardless of the
wrecking of individual and family life involved.
5. That under government leadership a
system shall be devised for the training of
youth in habits and techniques of work and
industry, and for a thorough and well-integrated apprenticeship system.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The Canadian Welfare Council, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, and the trades
and labour associations, respectively, have
given their warm approval of a National
Employment
Commission.
The
Mayors'
Conference held recently in Ottawa also
unanimously endorsed the proposal.
The Government offers this Bill to the
Senate, not as a panacea for our economic
and social ills, but rather as one means
towards the end in which we are all so
deeply interested.
With these remarks I move, seconded by
Right Hon. Mr. Graham, the second reading
of this Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the House already knows
that I do not intend to oppose second reading or to urge any of my fellow members to
oppose it. The House is also aware of the
reasons for this stand.
Those reasons have to do, not with the
merits or demerits of the proposal, but with
the fact that it is a measure which undoubtedly
the Covernment bas a mandate to enact, and
is not of such a character in relation to the
vitals of our social, industrial or political life
as would call for the exercise of a check by
way of reversal at the hands of this House.
It is our part, though, to contribute as best
we can to an elucidation of the Bill and an
examination of its merits and probable results, and as well to improvement of it in any
respect in which we feel we can improve it.
This unemployment difficulty bas confronted
our country for a series of years, it bas harassed
the days and nights of members of administrations, both Dominion and provincial, and
indeed municipal, and it bas, I fear, baffied
and defeated the efforts of the best. We
therefore approach any attempt made in good
faith to find some solution or amelioration
of this condition with sympathy and with an
ardent desire to help.
We know an extraordinary, certainly an
abnormal, proportion of people are still in
the ranks of the unemployed, still suffering
the humiliations and privations which such
a condition imposes. We are especially conscious of the fact that young men, arriving
at that age in life at which, in years past,
people have been accustomed to find a position
in the economic field and to utilize their
powers for their own advancement and the
good of the society they live in, are finding
it difficult and, in a distressing number of
cases, impossible to secure any place at all.
There is no more painful feature of the
unemployment problem than this very phase
Nothing this
in relation to young men.

APRIL 8,1936
House could do, whether by discussion and
treatment of this measure or by sorne separate investigation or action of its own, migbit
be more useful than a thorough review and
examination of the whole question of unemployment.
Society advances by slow and arduous steps,
even though it seems to have the adventitious
aid of scientific invention and discovery, and
every step forward, which in years goïne by
we have been accustorned to caîl an advance,
is accompanied by anguishing pains and suifering on the part of many who are victirns of
the process of adjustment. That which we
are now encountering is the reaction following
a long series of scientific inventions, the application of discovery to machinery, with resultant dispiacement of huge proportions of
working men. The whole structure of society
is bujît upon the principle that each man
reaching the working age of life finds something to which he can put bis hand or bis
brain, with resuits of such value that society
is ready to pay for them. An appalling proportion of those who in days gone by could
seli the products of their foul t0 a waiting
world, able to use them for its own advantage
and good, are now with an asset much less
valuable, much less in dernand, and therefore harder f0 seli. Other things have taken
the place of the contribution they have been
able to make, and to-day they suffer becauze
of the readjustment which we are going
through.
It is flot necessary to despair, for we know
that in other periods of history similar experiences have been encountered; and in those
periods, as in this, very disastrous consequences
were predicted and seemed in sight, but always
in time the process of absorption set in again,
readjustment was cornpleted, and society found
itself one stage higher, the comforts of if e
greater and more widely spread, and the
penalties of progress paid.
Canada to-day, with the rest of the world,
is in the throes of fthc worsf of depressions,
and these throes are aggravatcd by the consequences of the Great War, which used up
much of the energy of mankind and destroycd
much of hurnan values.
The honourable leader of the buse bas
given us the very comforting information
that since 1933 the numbers of the unemployed
have been reduced. There could be no ncws
more gratifying to us ail, even fhough the
percenfage reduction hae not been large. But
1 arn af-raid the news must be accompanied
by this statement of fact, that whilc mere
numbers have dimini.shed, distreas bas been

183

intensified because of the contrast of the ncw
wifh the old.
We also meet this phenomenon, thaf
althýough the numnber of those out of work
bas decreased, the cost of sustaining the
uncmployment situation is greater than it
ever was. In this connection I make mention
of one cify which I know best at the present
fime. There is no doubf that 1932 wau the
nadir of the depression. In. that year, the
darkest of aIl fhrough which we have passed,
both business and employmcnt were at their
worst. In 1932 unempl'oyment in the cify of
Toronto cogt more than $2,000,000. In 1933,
when business was somewhat better and naturally unemployment conditions also improved, the cost was over $5,000,000. In 1934
if was over $8,000,000; and in 1935 over
$9,000,000, although unquestiona)bly opportunifies were then greater for gefting work, and
beyond ahl doubt business was measurably improved from the Iow, furbid condition of
1932.
I think there is somcthing we have to
lcarn from this phenomenon, even fhough we
are very sorry to learn what is a black and
revolting truth. Assuming that the lack of
employment is in the main due fo no fault
of the unemployed themselves--and undoubfedly this is true-I amn afraid it must be said
that it is absolutely necessary f0 maintain
the uncmployed on a vcry modest standard
in order that the urge to work may not be
desfroycd. Nobody who wanfs to pay any
respect to fruth at aIl will deny thaf that urge
to work, upon which the whole progress of
civilization is dependent, is weaker to-day than
it was before this depression started.
In support of my statement I could give
instances for longer than the flouse would
care to listen. We find ourselves, therefore,
wvith the ranks of the unemployed diminishing, with opportunities for work growing
greater, but with the burden of the charge
growing heavier.
Undoubtedly the main
reason for this unsatisfactory condition is
that there is flot the saine determînaf ion to
get out of those ranks as there was years
ago. Would that it were possible to take
care of the less fortunafe on a level and
standard of living of which we couid be proud.
Would that human nature werc so constitutcd
that thaf could be done. I arn afraid we have
f0 admit it is not so ýconstitutcd-that is nof
the way we are made. The consequence is, if
we adopt that course and pursue if, this
machine which, we caîl civilization just wil]
flot work. This appalling truth we have to,
recognize.

APRIL 8, 1936
I have no doubt that is the first thing this
new commission will do. But is a commission
necessary for that? Is any new body required? The honourable leader of the House
in the course of his address gave us a brief
analysis of the classes of unemployed. I do
not know that he gave the ages and other
details which the Government undoubtedly
has in its possession. He gave a statement
of persons unemployable and those who were
not, and as much information as could be of
value. I suggest, however, that he did not
give us all the information available in the
archives of Governament or all that was presented by the Minister of Labour in the other
House when he introduced this Bill. I know
of nothing left out by him that could be of
any practical use. The Bureau of Statistics
exists for the purpose of gathering and
assembling information; it does not neglect its
duties; and I stand here to state that there
is no classification anyone could want or
imagine which cannot be obtained to-day. If
any further detail is required the same agencies
that have produced what we have can produce
that little more. So I do not think anyone
would be serious in saying that he was in
favour of erecting an institution of three,
four, or five storeys for the purpose of obtaining what we already have.
The next duty of the commission is to-recommend
to the MinisterThis word "recommend" has been employed
with rather grating repetition in section after
section.
-recommend to the Minister conditions to be
complied with by any province obtaining grants
for relief purposes from the Government of
Canada.
Right at that point the Administration was
touching on a difficulty which it knew it could
not meet by anything of this kind: the conditions upon which a province gets money.
Suppose a province says, "No." Do we turn
our backs upon the province and do nothing?
Can we dictate to any province how it shall
spend the money we advance? On the other
hand, if a province agrees to comply, but
does not comply with the conditions, what
sanctions can we impose? None at all. The
provinces are just as supreme within their
ambit as we are within ours. It is the
language of folly to suggest that we can supervise the administration of funds, howevet received or from whatever source, once they are
in provincial hands. It cannot be done. The
commission is to "recommend to the Minister
conditions to be complied with." That is not
very difficult. That will not do any harm.
But I should like to have the leader of the

185

Government before us when he finds provinces telling us that they are just as autonomous as we are and intend to spend the money
as they wish, not as we wish.
Next, the commission shall
-recommend
to the Minister-"recommend"
again-effective means of mobilizingThat is a new word in statute drafting.
-mobilizing the agencies for relief both state
and voluntary.
Does that include provincial agencies? After
the Minister gets the recommendation how
is he going to mobilize provincial relief
agencies? Everyone realizes it cannot be
done. The recommendation can be made, but
that will be the end of the function of the
commission.
Next, the commission shall
-investigate
and report upon proposals for
the carrying out of programs of public works
and other projects to aid in providing employment.
In so far as those public works are federal,
surely, having regard to unemployment needs,
the Department is able to evolve a programme
with more wisdom than a new commission
with none of the experience of government
and not very much sensitiveness about the
needs of public business. The Minister of
Finance and his colleagues, who wrestle with
that problem hour by hour and night by
night, would be vastly more competent to
evolve a programme which would be workable and within our means than auy commission we can set up and pay. Besides, we
have a Department of Public Works.
The next subsection is just the same, as
far as I understand its effect. They shall
-recommend
to the Minister measures with
respect to programs of public works and
projects of the Dominion, the provinces, the
municipalities, and other agencies.
Do honourable gentlemen not realize at once
how futile that is? They are to recommend
to the Minister of Labour for Canada what
the provinces or the municipalities should do
in the way of public works, or what should be
done by other agencies, which in this respect
are wholly under provincial jurisdiction.
Futility is written across every line of this
series of powers.
Next, they are to
-investigate
and report to the Minister on
measures of co-operation with commercial and
industrial groups in devising means under
which provision may be made for the maintenance and increase of employment.
The best that can be said of that is that it
is harmless. I cannot see that any very great
injury can be done by it. The commission

186

SENATE

may have a discussion with the Manufacturers' Association, or with individual manufacturers, as to what would be in the interest
of employment in a certain district, but after
the discussion has taken place and, the recommendation has been made it is the manufacturer who is going to decide-and he must
decide on business principles-whether he will
make the recommended expenditures. Otherwise he will be sunk under the water. The
same thing cau and must be said of any other
ag-ency. no matter what it may be. with which
this commission is to confer and with respect
to which it is to make recommendations to
the Minister.
The commission is to
-investigate and report to the Minister upon
plans for the establishment of an apprenticeship system in industry.
Now. I will assume that the commission will
present to the Minister the finest plan that the
resourceful wit of man ever devised for restoring the appronticeship systemn in industry.
Then I follow with the question, How is the
Minister going- to put that plan into operation?
Everyone heme has some elemnentary knowledge
Of OUT constitutional situation; everyone knows
that if any force or persuasion is to be used
to revive and restore the old apprenticeship
plan, thc legisiative assistance given to it
must bc provincial. The effect it would have,
so far as it is lcgislativc, would resfult fromn a
statute of the province conicerned. Is it not
plain, therefore, that when the recommendation gets to the Minister he wil1l be confronted with a stone wall, and will sit with
the recommendation until ho is out of power?
The next subsection reads this way: The
commission shaîl
-investigate and report upon ways and means
of providing employment for disabled persons,
and cn operate with the Veterans' Assistance
Commission in its efforts to secure suitable
cmployment for ex-soldiers.
Whcre is the Department of Soldiers' Civil
Re-estahlishment? Has it ceased to function?
If it is nccessary to do this-and it is, for
the came of the ex-soldier is our duty-the
clause is a proclamation that the womk of
the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment is through and over-its inch-long tapeT
is bumot and donc. There can be no other
conclusion if we are to say this clause is in
any sense a oecessity.
It is proposed that the commission shal-recommend to the Minister comprehensive
measures"Comprehensive measures," mmnd youl
-constitutiog long-range plansThat is another innovation in the science of
draftsmanship.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN.

-of national development which may be proceeded with or discontinued from tinie to timne

I wonder, honourable senators, if there ever
was put into plainer language than this a
statement of the cardinal function of a Federal
Government. This is what the Government
was elected to do. Surely this Government
is flot goiog to stand by and pmoclaima that in
determining long-range policies for the good
of Canada it is to have not nnly the assistance
but the co-operation of a new commission,
and in a sense have that organization substituted for itself. Let me repeat. What I
have read is the fundamental, inescapable,
primary fonction of Goveroment. That is
what honoumable gentlemen are elected for.
Sorely they do not say they are incompetent
to discharge this function. I do not think they
are. Even though I have no confidence in

rather that a Government with some expericoce in affairs, and composed nf men who have

that will help in the study of the problem.
llaving exhausted t.he clauses in section 6,
I now come to the oext section. The administrative duties of the commission are considemed nf sofficient importance to ho isolated.
Section 7 says:
The commission shaîl, under the direction
of flie Minister supervise the expenditure of
fonds voted by Parliament for purposes of
relief and providing empînyment, and perforni
such administrative duties with respect to
relief and empînyment as may be assigned to
it f rom time to time by the Governor in
Council.
Now, the moneys voted hy Parliament during
past years to assist relief have gone-where?
To the coffers of provincial governments. I
do not dlaima that none of our grants have
gone elsewhere, for in addition we had to
provide camps to take care nf single unetm-

APRIL 8, 1936
ployed men. They were an auxiliary undertaking wbich, it was feit could be carried on
most economically and efficiently by the
Federal Govennment, thou-gh the responsibility
was provincial. They were placed in charge
of the Department of National Defence, and
operated under the discipline whioh only that
departmnent could provide. This Government
intends to do away with these camps, tbough
information as to wbat is to be substituted
for them bas not yet been voucbsafed to us,
and at the moment we do not know where
unemployed young men will be placed. But
the point that conc.erns us is that the Government says direct federal intervention was
wrong and will flot be continued. I do not
know what consequenees will f ollow, except
that from now on provincial treasurers will
expend these monieys. Are we goi-ng to step
in, under the autliority of section 7, and supervise expenditures? We know we cannot do
that, and we know we shall fot try to do it,
for once we trîed we should be in the throes
of a problem from wbieh escape would be
very difficuit.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Has not the
Auditor-General been doing this right along?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No. We
may make an investigation as to wbat has
been done, in order to ascertain amounts of
expenditures, but we cannot supervise and
direct expenditures.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Every dollar that
is alleged to be expended for u.nemployment
is audited, to make sure the Dominion is
charged only with its proper proportion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We may
audit, witb the consent of the provincial
government.
My own impression is that
places have been selected in which to make
an examination as to wbat bas been donc.
But though we may audit, we cann'ot control
or supervise disposition of money. And ail
we can get from an audit is information.
1 am aware that the unemployment problem
is exceedingly difficuit, and is becoming
increasingly difficuit. But wbat I really .fear
is t-hat by this measure we are only going to
delay the definite facing of that problem.
It seems to me-and in this I am speaking
for myseif alone-we sbould keep the responsibility .iust where it now is and always bas
been; that is, on the provinces. Indeed, it
cannot possibly be removed from them. We
should assist the provinces on a definite plan,
in proportion flot to the money tbey &pend,
but to their direct responsibilities, virtually
in proportion to population. The money
would then be theirs, the same as taxes
colleeted. Provincial goverfiments are respon-

187

sible to the people wbo pay, to the people wbo
eleet t hem, for the administration and dishursement of funds. And expenses should be kept
as low as possible, because the lower tbey
.are, the greater will be the contribution to
the ultimate solution of the problem. That
ultimate solution is only delayed when there
is maintained any standard of comfort-of
subsistence, even-wbich gives encouragement
to malingering and idleness. Tbe provinces
sbould be beld responsible. But we bave
to supplement their revenues, and generously,
because tbese are too limited to take care of
all necessary expenditures. We must bear
in mind, thougb, the absolute necessity of
maintaining local supervision and responsibility, and of providing no more funds tban
will take care of the unemployed in a
moderate way. Unfortunately, if we do more
we shahl be multiplying the difficulties by
adding to tbe numbers of those wbo have to
be looked after. Thus tbe solution will be
postponed, and, indeed, the whole wave of
distress which follows unemployment will be
expanded.
Tbese observations are not offered in any
spirit of superior knowledge or position. Fortunately for myself, I bave flot had to battlc
with the unemployment question as some
honourable senators have had to do. But
no citizen wbo takes an interest in this country
can bave failed to be barassed, to have bad
his sleep interfered with and bis peace of
mind disturbed almost constantly, by appeals
made to bim and by tbe distress of uneinployed men unable to find work.
Yes, tbe problem is tremendously difficult;
and sometimes I fear we are a little late in
dealing with it. I would there were members of tbis House wbo felt tha-t as part of
our public duties we should bave a special
committee of the Senate to examine into the
wbole question of unemployment witb a view
to assisting the Government in its efforts to
cope with it. Should that suggestion meet
with any welcome on the part of the Government itself and of bonourable members here.
I certainly would give freely of my time in
trying to be of some help. We are in at
least as good a position as the best possible
commission could be to study the subject and
to make recommendations, if any are needed.
Tbe responsibility is directly upon us. We
know the constitutional interrelations. If I
were a member of tbe Administration I would
rather bave the tboughtful conclusions of a
Senate committee than of any commission
lacking experience witb those constitutional
difficulties and confliets of authority and
power wbicb have tbrottled the Government
in the preparation of this Bill and resulted

APRIL 8,1936
organized groups or individuals of their
duties. Indeed, my conviction is that private
contributions will have to be increased rather
than diminished. It has been said that they
will be increased through taxation. That is
true. But it is essential to any worth-while
and permanent improvement in the unemploymen't situation that all organizations and
private individuals continue their good work,
for governments alone cannot do all that
should be done. There is to be a commission, but let me tell honourable members
that organizations supported by contributions
of individuals are closer to the hearts of the
people and in a better position to know
what is needed than any Government commission can be.
In conclusion may I bespeak a fair trial
for this measure?
In these trying times
people who have money must realize that it
was given to them not to be looked at,
but to be used, particularly when it can be
used to help relieve distress among our fellow
citizens.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I verily believe,
after going through this Bill and listening
to my right honourable friend's comments,
that it is quite simple and can be grasped
thoroughly within a small compass of time.
It seems to me that if my honourable
colleagues would deny themselves the privilege
of further discussion on the motion for second
reading and would consent to allow the
Bill to be examined clause by clause, either
in Committee of the Whole a-t once or in
the Banking and Commerce Committee, we
could dispose of it in such a way as to free
ourselves from the responsibility of carrying
the measure over the Easter recess. True, I
may be told that Royal Assent is fixed for
half past five only an hour distant; but we
could come back this evening and pass the
Bill, and in that event I should be ready to
ask His Honour to return to this Chamber
even at midnight to give Royal Assent.
My right honourable friend has expressed
his views on the matter. I do not suppose
that after running through the empowering
clauses he would be disposed to strike them
out or substitute other clauses.
I feel we
should have very little opportunity to amend
the ten or twelve clauses either in Committee
of the Whole or in the Banking and Commerce Committee, but we might dispose of the
Bill. Then, even though it should be too
late for Royal Assent, the Government could
during the recess proceed to organize the
commission and we could not be charged with
paralysing efforts towards a solution of the
problem. That is my suggestion.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think our
plain task is to go ahead with the Bill. I
would not even suggest, much less urge,
honourable members not to speak on this
measure or devote to it all the attention they
feel they can give it. We shall never have
before us any legislation more important than
this Bill, and I am ready to stay here throughout the night in order that we may get
through, if we can without restricting the
privileges or attempting in any way to
abbreviate the duties of honourable members.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then if it is
the view of the House that we give the Bill
second reading, I would ask that we go into
Committee of the Whole now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understood
certain honourable gentlemen desired to
speak to the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I saw no one else rising.

I rose because

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, during the course of the debate reference has been made to the unemployment
situation. There is no doubt at all that it is
appalling, and I doubt very much whether
anything we may do will materially alter
the course of events. There is something
back of it broader and deeper and bigger than
this measure can take care of. The situation
has grown out of something which still exists,
and apparently it. is as bad as or worse than
it was before. While we have to do everything we cau to alleviate the present condition, I doubt very much whether the Bill will
be of great assistance in this direction. It
has struck me during all these years that ,there
is one main cause of all our difficulties, and
we do not have to seek very far to find it.
To my mind it is to be found in Europe.
It grew out of the Great War. Our right
honourable leader has referred to the destruction wrought by the War-the loss of manhood, of money, of property. But something
else has happened since. Little by little until
it has grown to a tremendous volume the
spirit of extreme nationalism has sprung up.
This is largely, if not entirely, owing to the
fact that the people of Europe are still afraid
of the war threat which hangs over it all the
time and is inescapable.
What has been the result? Every nation in
Europe has been striving with might and
main to prepare itself for war. Those nations
are determined not to be caught napping
as they were in 1914; they are not going to
be caught without food stuffs, without clothing, without all the other necessaries of life.
As a result each nation has been endeavour-

190

SENATE

ing in every way possible to make itself
self-sustaining, and to this end has raised its
tariff walls higher and higher and higher
until international trade is brought almost
to a standstill.
That is only one aspect of this nationalistic
feeling. Where is all the mon-ey going that
formerly would have been devoted to the
purchase of our wheat and other products?
We all know it is going into armaments.
Italy probably is spending from $3,000,000
te $5,000,000 a day to prepare for war. What
is France doing? Voting huge appropriations
What is Great Britain's
for armaments.
present expenditure? She is not buying hams,
cotton, linen, boots and shoes; she is pouring
hundred of millions of pounds-sterling into
preparation for war. The world is not in a
normal condition; that it what is wrong. Until
the European tangle is straightened out and
people resume the normal processes of life,
this condition will continue. I know mankind generally are striving for peace, but
until we remove the threat of war little
improvement can be expected. Whether we
like it or not. the buying power is not there
in the countries of Europe, it is not here
in Canada, and it is net elsewhere in the
world. The people have net the wherewithal to buy, because that wherewithal is
to a very large extent going into preparations
for war.
Look at the situation to the south of
us. The people there have spent billions
of dollars in trying to grapple with unemployment, and it is about as bad to-day as
when they started; perhaps worse. A short
time ago we had before us the trade treaty
with the United States.
Do honourable
members think the Government of the United
States entered into that treaty voluntarily?
No; they were forced to because of necessity.
Extrerme nationalism has closed the markets
of the world to their products, and their
warehouses are fairly glutted. They came
here to try to get a little trade with us,
as they are trying elsewhere throughout the
world.
J mention these things merely te indicate
that there is a world condition at the basis
of unemployment. Until sensible people can
get together and put an end te this world
condition, we shall have to continue to struggle
with the problem, and there will not be very
much hope until it is solved.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend-?

Does my right

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think this
is a proper Bill for Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

All right.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Diandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Subsectionýs 1 and 2 of section 3 were agreed
to.
On section 3, subsection 3-fees:
Hon. Mr. COTE: I observe the salary of
the commissioners is not fixed as is usual in
statutes creating commissions of this kind.
Right
cheque!

Hon.

Mr.

MEIGHEN:

A blank

Hon. Mr. COTE: It is a blank cheque.
I was somewhat impressed by this paragraph
in the Speech from the Throne:
It is proposed to restore to Parliament its
control over taxation and expenditure by
ending all measures which have deprived
members of the House of Commons of this
controland so on. At that time I did not know
exactly what was the purpose of the Government in making that profession of faith. I
expected some statutes which we had been
foolish enough to pass and which in some
vay derogated from the high functions of
Parliament in controlling expenditures might
be repealed. But in this subsection we find
the very sort of thing which the declaration
in the Speech fronm the Th-rone seemed to be
directed against.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
monster.

It is a new

Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes, a blank cheque.
The fees or compensation of the seven commissioners are left to be fixed at the discretion
of the Governor in Council. Surely that is
not right. Some reasonable limitation should
be placed on the amount. I move the following amendment:
That after the words "services" the words
"as the Governor in Council may from time
to time determine" be stricken out and the
following words substituted: "not exceeding in
all $25,000."
Hon. Mr. HARDY: That would be less
than $4,000 apiece.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The directors of the
Canadian National Railways were in receipt
of only $2,000 a year.

APRIL 8,1936
Hon. Mr. HARDY: They neyer did any
work.
Hon. Mr. COTE: If the honourai)le leader
of the Government will indicate what ýhe
thinks should be a reasonable amount, I arn
quite williiig to amend my motion aecordingly.
I thought offhand that $25,000 would well pay
the chairman and his satellites, who obviously
would be satisfied with a smaller amount. I
do not think we should pass this subsection
without imposing a limitation on the compensation to be paid the com.missioners.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn not ready
to accept the suggestion of my honourable
friend. Either the fee may be smaîl if we
can succeed in getting dollar-a-year men, or
it may be commensuraýte with the value of the
high-class men who would be called upon to
sit on the board. I would direct attention to
section 12:
Ail Orders in Council and regulations made
under the provisions of this Act shall be laid
before the House of Commons forthwith alter
the making thereof if Parliament is then
sitting, and if flot, within fifteen days after
the opening of the next ensuing session.
This is the control whi-ch Parliament reserves
to itself. I surmise that no one with knowledge of thc duties whieb the commission would
be called upon to perform would be able to
fix the remuneration in advance.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Disclosure of exp enditure is hardly control.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is really
amusing. The honourable leader of the House
says that the "blank cheque"' here is ahl right,
because we do nnt know what we shall have
to pay. We may get inen for a dollar a year,
or we may have to pay them a large sum.
He says it is all right for the additional
reason that the Bill provides that after the
salaries are fixed Parliament must he advised
within fifteen days. Let honourable members
recail the awful legialation against which a
campaign was fought, and which, if it had not
been thwarted in time. according to the honourable gentleman opposite and bis frienda,
would have over-topped the whole Constitution of Canada, smothered the rights of the
people, paralysed the House of Commons.
Everything ha bas said about this legislation
could be said about that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The rigbt
bonourable gentleman does not see the difference between tbrowing tbe treasury wide open
to tbe Government and fixing salaries.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is different
only in the matter of size.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ah!1

191

Right Hon. MT,. MEIGHEN: In the case
of the oCher legislation there was vastly more
reason for throwing open the treasury than
there is now, but the only matter with respect
to whicb, no limit was imposed was relief.
Nobody cou]d tell wbat drought there would
be in Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba, or
wbat scourge migbt follow in the Maritimes.
Nobody could say whether there would be an
extension or a reduction, yet it was argued
then that if a limit were not fixed the wbole
Constitution would be wrecked. Now anybod-y can fix the maximum witb the utmost
ease; it is no trouble at ail. The bonourable
gentleman said then there was nothing but a
wild guess. Now ha says, "But Parliament is
to be told'ý--the very provision wbich was
contained in the other Bill. Oh, what humbug we have in politica!
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think we will ail
agree that this commission, if it, is to perform
the functions allotted to it by this Bill, will
have to carry on some research. We bave had
a distinct reference to the consistent and
proper salary to be paid to the Chairman of
the National Research Council. The distinguished gentleman who constituted the late
Governrnent set it at $12,000 a yeur. I think
it is too much, but the figure bas been set.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I tbink he waa
moderate.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Perbaps. But if
this new commission is going to do anytbing
it will have to make research into every
question confronting the people of Canada
to-day witb respect to unempînyment relief.
Ia there any honourable senator in thi? bouse
who will say that if the very beat and most
experienced and capable man in any position
in Canada can be secured to act on this
commission he would flot be worth whatever it
would reasonabiy cost to get hirn? The
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Coté) proposes
that thc maximum salary shaI] be $3.50 a
year.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The average.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 understand that
would include fees and allowances. You would
not be able to get gond labourera for that.
bon. Mr. COTE: Fees or compensation.
Hlon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us say fees. I
arn quite sure that my honourable friend
(bon. Mr. Coté), as a very capable lawyer,
would not think of workîng for any sucb fee;
nor would any other gentleman in bis clasa.
Right bon. Mr. GRAHAM: Nor would a
senator, for part time.

concern, which is engaged in a competitive
business. What I want to ascertain is the
policy the Government intends to follow in
appointing the personnel of this commission.
If thoy are to be paid for fuli-time ser~vice
as executives of a great organization, three
members are ample. On the other hand, if
men of high capacity are to ho enlisted or
conscripted for this work, and to make their
services ax-ailable on a patriotic basis, being
paid nu more than their travelling expenses,
then one can understand the Government's
d-esire to have a commission of as many as
seven members. Can the honourable leader
tell us what the Government has in mind?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can only say
to my honourable friend that we have flot
yet reached a point where we know just who
will bo chosen. There are a number of highly
qualified men who would, not be able to spare
the time necessary to ho devoted to the duties
of a commissioner. Because we are facing
such a problem we should be able to appeal
to the patriotismn of men of ability and experionce, bunt we do not know just who will
ho able to respond to that appeal.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Unquestionably the
sevon members will be paid a fair wage,
regard being had to the work tha-t will have to
be performed.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should he glad
to accept the statement of my honourable
friend, but hie is not the leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In this situation
there is not the justification for employing
dollar-a-year men that there was in connection with patriotie undertakings during
the War.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I cannot yet understand this thing. because ail the money has
to ho voted by Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is right. And the money had
to ho voted by Parliament under the Relief
Act.
Honi. Mr. GRIESBACH: If we support the
amendment we shahl ho dictating the policy
that the Govornment must follow in appointing the personnel of the commission. I think
before we vote on it at all we should have
some definite information as to what the
Government intends to do. If, msthe honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) suggests, the commissionors are to
ho paid the value of their services, the sum
to ho allowed should ho at loast $100,000. If

we limit it to the amount stated in the
amendment wo shall ho restricting the Govornment's field of action, and I am not
preparod to do that hofore we know more
about the matter.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We shaîl know when
we got the Supply Bill, hecause it wiIl contain
the amount necessary to pay the salaries of
the commissioners.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But if we pass
this amendment it will override the amount
stated in the Supply Bill.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: In dealing with a Bill
that contemplates the sponding of millions
and millions of dollars, is this Chamber going
to take up its own time, to say nothing of
the time of another Chamber, in discussing
the comparativoly paltry sum of $25,000?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not care
whether the amondment goos in or not.
As to the point mentioned a moment ago
by the honourahle senator from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson), with which I quite
agroe, may I say that there nover was su much
utter nonsense expressed about anything as
about the so-called "blank choque."
The honourahie gentleman from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) is wrong in saying that
the Bill contemplates the spending of millions
of dollars.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I nican on all the
works in connection with it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No. There
will ho nu works oporated by the commission.
Its sole duty will ho to think. But, mind
you, thinking is a very important activity,
and should ho paid for.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
the honourable gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.
to

Hon. Mr. COTE: I should have heen glad

amount the honourable leader of the Governmont thinks is reasonable. Ho duos not ee
fit to state any amount, though, and asks me
tu withdraw the amendment. I am disposed
to accede to his roquost. But I do not feel
that I have heon responsible for any loss of
timo hy this House, as the honourable senator
from Leeds suggested a moment ago. It is
obvious that I took too soriously the statemont in the Speech from the Throne that
there would ho no more measures depriving
Parliament of its control ovor the voting of
money. I was mistakon, and in the circumstances I withdraw my amendment.
The amendment was withdrawn.

Bill 14, an Act respecting the establishment
of a National Employment Commission.Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
Sections 4 to 8, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 9-women's employment committee; youth employment committee; honorary
local advisory committees:

But what difference does it make? This is
all one problem, and to imagine that there are
certain inidividuals who will be capable of
thinking out how to report about the employment of women, and other individuals
who will be able to think out how to report
about the employment of youth is a little too
much. If you wanted to expose this Bill as
just show-window legislation designed for
effect, or in other words, statutory hot air,
you could not do it better than it is done in
clause 9.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would call
my right honourable friend's attention to the
fact that notwithstanding the pricking of my
conscience I have many times helped him

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Chairman, I call the attention of honourable members to section 9:

The rescuers at Moose River were naturally
accustomed to working underground. I was
not surprised at the zeal, the courage and
the vigour with which they entered into the
task of saving the victims. All credit must
be given to those rescuers. They have been
universally applauded, and I think it is appropriate to say of them all, those from Ontario
as well as those from the Mariitimes, what
Sir Wilfrid Laurier often used to say of the
people of Nova Scotia, that really they are
the salt of the earth.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, even in the darkest days of
the War we never witnessed an incident which
concentra-ted the attention and warmed the
emotions of the whole Dominion, and spread
its influence and generated anxiety throughout
the whole world, to such a degree as did the
recent incident in Nova Scotia. It is an
example to us, first of all, of the tremendous
and in this case vital value of a well-preserved
physique and a high intelligence in time of
danger.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Control.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was really
mastery of self and ability to summon the
best in the hour of great peril whih enabled
those entombed men to survive.
The other lesson whieh t]he incident teaches
us is that courage and great power of sacrifice
1m most distaseftil and perilous surroundings
find never a higher illustration than in the
man mu overalls. Nor should we forget that
though in this case special demands were
made upon him and a vast amount of attention was focused upon his work, the miner
is never far from peril. Danger is his constant companion in life.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I make

honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) might give us his speech in favour
of the second reading this evening and move

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTAUTHORITY TO AMEND
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON rose
10 accordance
with the following notice:
That he wii draw the attention of the
Senate ta, and inquire of the Government,
whether it is the intention of the Government
to take steps to have legislation passed by the
Imperial Parliament to the end that the
Parliament of Canada shail have the authority
to fron time to time anend the British North
America Act as it may deem proper.
He said: Honourable members of the Senate.
the purpose of my inquiry is to provoke, if
possible, a discussion of this momentous question whiceh, if it is not in the minds of the
people, is occupying the attention of the
statesmen and politicians of this country. One
of the witnesses who appeared before the
special committee appointed by the House of
Commons last session to inquire into and
report upon the possibility of amending the
British North America Act expressed the

APRIL 29, 1936
opinion that nine-tenths of the people of
Canada knew nothing about the Act, and
had no notion at all of what our ConI can quite believe that,
stitution was.
because in Canada there is no public opinion
on anything political which does not directly
affect the pockets of the electorate.
We have had no political education in this
country. Politics, like religion, in Ontario
at least, are taboo in our public schools and
our clubs. I recall that there was a terrible
hullabaloo when young Winston Churchill
addressed the students of one of our public
schools. It was said to be a shocking thing
that any man should endeavour to instill
into the minds of the rising generation anything about politics. As the youth of Canada
are not taught either the civil or the political
history of England or Canada, they grow up
without curiosity regarding any subject beyond
the earning of their daily bread.
I saw in the Globe only on Monday a letter
from a lady in Richmond Hill, Ontario, which
stated:
In connection with the meetings of the
Ontario Educational Association, I wish to
call attention to the fact that English (or,
as it is generally called now, British) history
is no longer a subject included in the high
school entrance examination nor in the
matriculation examinations (junior and senior).
In the public schools the children take it up
in the junior fourth class, but not in the
There can be no
senior fourth (entrance).
good reason for this.
My personal experience of the public schools
is that we were never taught anything of the
history of Canada except that Jacques Cartier
came up the St. Lawrence river.
I am making this address because I think
it would be well for the Senate to try to
provoke some discussion of this question: Is
it wise or necessary to seek to amend or
repeal the British North America Act? The
Act was passed to confederate four provinces,
which prior to their union bad enjoyed

legislative power and authority now divided
between them and the Federal Parliament.
They agreed to create a new state, the
Dominion of Canada, and to surrender to
the central Government all the legislative
powers having to do with the peace, order
and good government of that new state. But
for themselves they retained all powers with
regard to local affairs, generally speaking.
And so through the British North America
Act they gave to the Dominion Parliament
all powers affecting Canada as a whole, and

Dominion and provinces was not changed.
They stood exactly where they had stood

199

before, and there has been no legislation in
the meantime to take us one step farther
towards what are now called sovereign rights.
Canada belonged to Great Britain by
conquest and cession. After the conquest the
French Covernment ceded to Great Britain
the territory then known as Canada, and by
international law Great Britain thus obtained
complete sovereignty over this country. She
has never by any Act diminished that
sovereign control. I am not speaking now of
legislative power, which she has delegated to
us. I recognize that we have full legislative
sovereignty, in fact complete home rule.
Some years ago the late John S. Ewart
started in his Kingdom Papers propaganda
aimed at achieving independence of the
Imperial Government and obtaining what one
gentleman described as absolute sovereign
power. Mr. Ewart was affected with the
Imperial inferiority complex. He could not
bear to think of Canada as a nation owing
allegiance to any power on earth; he conceived of it as answerable in the matter of
government to God alone. A number of our
statesmen, our Disraelis, our Gladstones, our
Pitts and our Chathams, caught that same
dread disease from Mr. Ewart. They would
tolerate a king so long as they were viceroys
over him. And they are forever notifying the
world that we are not a British Dominion,
but a oommonwealth, a nation free and independent; that they have the power to make
or mar the future of this country according
to their own goodwill or stupidity.
One of the members of the committee to
which I am going to refer in a moment or two,
speaking of the Statute of Westminster a few
years ago, said:
This Act completes the efforts of our parliamentarians to assure to Canada the status of
a sovereign state. Henceforward Canada will
be free from any political and legislative
control. England cannot bind Canada by any
legislation or any treaty. Canada may, when
she wishes, amend her Constitution and abolish
the appeal to the Privy Council.
I do not think that gentleman had read the
charter of our liberty, the British North
America Act. The Statute of Westminster confers no new powers on us, gives us no new
status, leaves us where we were-and, please
God, there we shall remain. This is the clause
of the Statute of Westminster which they cite:
No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom
passed after the commencement of this Act
shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a
Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion,
unless it is expressly declared in the Act that
that Dominion has requested, and consented to
the enactment thereof.
Does this mean any more than that the
Imperial Parliament will not in future pass

200

SENATE

laws regarding the Dominions unless requested
by the Dominions to do so?
The Imperial Parliament bas also promised
that it shall not veto or disallow any statute
passed by the Dominions. I believe that
since Confederation one or two of our
statutes have been held up, but not since I
have known anything about politics. To
gratifv the vanity of these statesmen. England
says: "Well, we will promise net to do what
we are net going to do; we will net pass any
laws affecting the Dorninions." That is all the
statute amounts to.
The House of Commons a year ago passed
this resolution:
That, in the opinion of this House, a special
conmittee shouild be set up to study and report
on the best method by which the British North
America Act may be amended so that while
safeguarding the existing riglts of racial and
religions minorities and legitimate provincial
claims to autonomy, the Dominion Government
may be given adequate power to deal effectii ely with urgent economic problems which
are essentially national in scope.
The resolution is overwhelmed with nouns and
adjectives but the language does not convey
to us any idea that it was intendcd to obtain
from the Imperial Parliament the independ-ent
right to amend the British North America Act
as our Parliament saw fit. The whole object
of the inquiry, on the face of it. was to find
ont what was the most convenient method to
follow in amending the British North America
Act for specifie purposes. It is quite clear
that that was a useless inquiry, since no man
can devise any amendments to the British
North America Act which will give to the
Dominion Parliament any greater power than
it now has respecting national questions.
Fortunately, when preparing my argument I
read a copy of this report, and I find that
Mr. Edwarde, the Deputy Minister of Justice,
bas eluoidated this matter much better than I
can; so I shall read what he said before the
committee. It will be found at page 2 of the
report. This is his statement:
In the first place. J observe tiat the resolution itself is in somewhsat narrow termas. The
duty of the cornnittec is to study and report
on the best method by which the British North
Anserica Act msay be cmendedd so that while
safecuarding tihe existing rihts of racial and
religions minorities, nnd legitimate provincial
claims to autonomv. the Dominion Government
may be given adequate power to deal effectively with urgent economic problems which
are essentially national in scope.
I pause here to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that the committee
was formed net to inquire how the British
North America Act might be amended so as
to take from the provinces any power or to
add to the Dominion any authority. Its inHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

quiry was to be directed only to urgent
economie probleins essentially national in
scope.

It will be observed that the purpose is to
enable this Parliament to deal effectively with
urgent economic problems which are essentially
national in their scope. Well, in my view,
problens of that kind are now within the
conpetence of Parliament under the British
North Anscrica Act as it stands. A good deal
las been said about the failure of the Fathers
of Confederation te anticipate the necessity
which msiglt arise for the amsendnent of the
Constitution. Personally I do not think that
they failed to anticipate sucli necessity; but
J think they deliberately framed the Constitution, so as to make it subject to expansion
by its own terns as the needs and as the
problenss of the country developed. In some
of the self-governing Dominions and in other
countries where a federal system prevails. there
are Iixed provisions for the amendment of their
Constitutions; but in nost, if not all, of those
countries, their Constitutions are not similar
to ours in this respect, that the residuary
powe rs rest vith the state and not with the
central authority as it does in Canada. Therefore J think that the Fathers of Confederation
deliberately provided a scheme whereby all
matters that are essentially national in their
sceope would be within tie exclusive cospetence
of Parliamient. They did that by vesting in
the i)oninion Parliamsent the residuary power,
and in giving to the pro-inces their legislative
powers they were very careful to make it clear
that the legislative juîrisdiction of the province was not, in any case, to extend beyond
imatters and riglhts situate in the province
itself, imatters of purely provincial or local
Concern.
Now, if that is a correct exposition of the
law-and to my knowledge no one bas ever
questioned it--it bas always been taken for
granted that the Dominion Parliament had
absolute sovereign legislative power within the
Dominion regarding Dominion affairs, and

there is nothing to amend. Those who want
to make this an independent country, to hide
their intent, have been for ever harping on
the statement that modern conditions have
so changed the world that we need to amend
the British North America Act. So long as
we live up to the spirit of Confederation, so
long as we Io not endeavour to violate the
contract that was made among the provinces,
the creature should never have power to
amend itself; it must be amended by -the
consent of the creators. That is now recognized. It is recognized, I sec, by my right
honourable friend from St. Mary's (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), and it was recognized
by Lord Sankey in the Aerial Navigation
case, that Confederation is a contract, that
the provinces gaie over to the Dominion
the necessary powers, and only the necessary
powers, to rule them, and that we are one of

APRIL 29, 1936
the Dominions and not an independent commonwealth.
Before the committee one of the members
argued that His Majesty is now King of
Canada. What did he mean by that statement, and what do those who accept it mean?
That His Majesty was like his forefather
George I, who while King of Great Britain
and her Dominions was also Elector of Hanover. There is a clear-cut case. There were
two separate sovereignties, both having the
same king, like two independent companies
both having the same president. No man
ever pretended that Hanover was a part of
the British Empire. It was just by chance
that the same man was Elector of Hanover
and King of England. Now, the purpose of
that assertion is to produce in the minds
of the people the impression that "the King
is King of Canada," not because he is King
of Great Britain, but quite independently of
that fact.
Let us sec how much truth there is in that
assertion. He can never be made King of
Canada by the British Parliament until that
Parliament repeals the Acts of Settlement and
other statutes passed in the time of William
and Mary. Those statutes declare that the
kings were the sovereigns of the United
Kingdom, of France, Ireland, and the Dominions of the British Empire. So the title
which His Majesty has to kingship over this
country is bis not as King of the Dominion
of Canada or King of the Province of Ontario, but as King of the British Dominions.
Quite a different thingi When the Lords and
Privy Councillors went on their knees before King Edward they attorned to him as
King; they did not make him King. He
became King of England and the dominions
of England from the moment the breath was
out of bis father's body. "The King is dead.
Long live the King!" There is no authority
giving His Majesty any 'right to rule over
this country except as it is contained in the
laws passed in the time of William and Mary,
when it was declared and proclaimed that he
was King of Great Britain, Ireland, France
and the British Dominions. So he is not
Ring over this country as an independent
nation, but King over Canada as a British
Dominion.
I have now, so far as I am able, argued in
support of the contention that this is not
an independent nation; that it is part and
parcel of the British Empire; and that the
use of the words "Commonwealth of Nations" is utterly without authority.
If my argument is true-and I am going
to assume that it is-then what was this

committee set up for? The whole of the proceedings show that it was to devise some way
by which we should get free from all British
allegiance. One of the members of the committee said, there'by exhibiting bis inferiority
complex, that it was subservience to appeal
to the Privy Council. Notwithstanding that
there is said to be nothing new under the
sun, that proposition was absolutely new as
far as I know. There is in Europe, at The
Hague, a court to which the nations of the
world appeal, and in appealing to it they do
not think they are performing an act of
subservience.
I had never heard such an
argument until some diseased minds in this
country advanced the idea that to appeal to
foreigners, members of a foreign state, for
the settlement of a dispute between me and
somebody else was an act of subservience.
I think the dictionary definition of subservience needs amending.
Another member of the committee said
that we should have a constituent assembly to
frame a constitution for us. Still another
said that we would never allow a British
member of Parliament to interfere in the
settlement of our constitution. There was
only one man, Mr. Edwards, who confined
himself or referred to the subject of the resolution. All the rest were devising ways and
means of marching out of the Empire.
By arrangement between the Government
of Canada and the Government of England,
Downing Street faded from the picture.
Formerly the Governor General did not get
bis instructions from His Majesty; they were
prepared by the Cabinet. But now those
instructions, unless they are prepared by the
King himself, are to be prepared by Ottawa.
In the attempt to shake off British authority,
to try to get rid of the British curb, the
British Government was told, "You must no
longer tell the Governor General what to do."
And it agreed.
Not to detain you too long, I come now
to the three objections which I have to any
legislation by the British Parliament which
would make Canada an independent sovereign
state.
My first objection, and it is the shortest,
is that the British Parliament bas no authority-it has the power, but no authority
-to deprive me of my birthright as a British
subject. In the constitution of the United
States it is provided that the Federal, Government shall not be entitled or shall not have
authority to part with any of the territories
of any of the states. I consider it to be
a fundamental principle that the Government of England, even though it bas the

SENATE

202

power, bas not the authority to deprive any
citizen of his citizenship. "Civis Romanus
sum." I intend to retain my British citizenship so far as I can.
My second point is that Canadian independence would be bad business; it would be
contrary to the material interests of this
country. Leaving aside all sentimental attachments to the mightiest empire that ever
ruled, and coming down to our own selfish
material interests, I say it is folly to seek to
establish an independent nation north of the
St. Lawrence river.
Many years ago, when I was travelling in
the Soudan, we could not go within ten
miles of Ethiopia. That was contrary to
orders, it being feared that we might be
seized as slaves. One day as I was travelling along I came upon a long, low-thatched
building over which there flew the Union
Jack. The only people around tbere were
two young lieutenants of the British Army.
I went up to them and said: "Boys, what are
you doing here?" "Keeping the ptace, sir,"
they replied. But it was not those two boys
who were keeping the peace; it was that
flag. For the first time in the history of
that land men were free; for the first time
in its history no hordes of slavers came
across the border to carry off the people and
send them to Arabia. Peace, order and good
government prevailed in the Soudan. Why?
Stetit magni nominis umbra-it stood in the
shadow of a mighty name. It was free, not
because it was strong, but because it stood
in the shadow of the British Empire.
We must always remember that man bas
never changed; that nations are as predatory,
as cruel. as conscienceless as ever they were.
The United States tore away half of Mexico;
Always
Germany sought to annex Europe.
the strong have endeavoured to take away
the vineyards of the weak. If we convince
the world that we are an independent people,
if we become an independent people, if we
cast our lot into the sea of Time, away
from the shadow of the British Empire, how
can we be free of the invader? The United
States once endeavoured to annex this country. Have we any reason to think it will not
do so again? Every nation on earth is arming to protect itself against the aggression
of every other nation. The history of man
shows that the weak have always been
trampled underfoot by the strong. If we
become an independent nation how shall we
be protected from Asia? How shall we be
protected from Germany? All nations have
colonies and possessions thousands of miles
from home.
Hon.

Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

As you know, man bas never heeded warning. The people would not believe Noah
until they were up to their mouths in water.
Until his gates are down and his houses are on
fire, everybody refuses to believe the enemy
is coming. So all warnings would pass by
like the idle wind which you respect not.
Therefore I appeal through another argument,
which I consider of great weight.
If we succeeded in convincing the world that
we are an independent nation, what would
become of the Ottawa Agreements? Suppose
some foreigner wbo knew of our history were
to go to England and say: "Canada is an
independent nation. We are entitled to the
same tariff treatment that Canada receives
What
under the favoured-nation clause."
would be the result for us? England would
be obliged to admit that point, so long as its
treaties continued in force.
As you know, all men are selfish. If we
convinced England that we are not part of
the Empire, England would say: "Wby sbould
we give you a preference? The Argentine
offers us a better deal tban you do. W e can
make better terms with Sweden and Denmark
than with you." And, by the way, England
bas just given a preference to Denmark, in
return for concessions on the entry of manufactured goods into that country. We can
see the danger that would arise if we should
succeed in convincing England, as we have
been trying for a long time to do, that we
are an entirely independent country.
Parliaments make laws not just for to-day
and to-morrow. We are legislating ere not
merely for the life of this Parliament or of
the present generation. The minds of men
will change in forty or fifty years. I remember one ambassador to England said that all
nations in the world were governed by a

one day reason like this: "Canada is not balf
as good a eustomer of ours as is the Argentine.
Both are independent nations. So why should
we give special consideration to Canada?"
What could we say? Of what bad faith would
England be guilty, what would it violate, by
such an attitude? As we all know, "Richard

only natural for people to act in what they
believe is their best interest. There was a
time when England would not give Canada
any preference. It took us thirty years to
get what we now have. Why did she not give
it to us long ago? Because it was not in ber
own interest to do so. But since she bas

APRIL 29, 1936
merchant's point of view. Are we going to
rsk the loss of what we have gained? This
British connection is worth something in
dollars and cents to Canada.
I am now going to quote from an editorial
that appeared in the Toronto Globe of Monday last:
Great Britain's trade in 1935 amounted to
14 per cent of the total for the world. The
United States, with Il per cent, was second,
Germany being third and France fourth.
Canada was tied with Japan for fifth place,
each obtaining 3-6 per cent.
The encouraging nature of this report, made
public by the League of Nations, becomes of
great significance when read in association
with the information from the Ottawa correspondent of The Globe that "expanding trade
within the British Empire is one of the most
striking features of international commerce."
Empire trade centres around the world's leading trading nation, which established a peak
last year in intra-Empire commerce.
The
United Kingdom's imports from Empire countries amounted to 37-63 per cent of ail importa,
and domestie exports to Empire countries were
47-97 per cent of the total. This represented
an increase in imports over 1931 of 15-41
per cent, and in exports of 19-71.
While
Britain was marching ahead along the trade
routes she was carrying ber colleagues of the
Empire with ber.
The advantage to Canada is shown by the
fact that 52 per cent of the Dominion's exports
went to Empire countries. Five-sixths of the
foreigu trade of this country was done with
the United Kingdom and the United States.
Imports from the United Kingdom were
$30,000,000 more in 1935 than in 1931, the
year before the trade agreements were negotiated.
Exports to the United Kingdom increased in the same period from $180,000,000
to $304.000,000.
Imports from the United
States advanced $80,000.000 from 1931 to 1935,
and exports to the States increased from
$143,000,000 to $277,000,000.
I wish to draw particular attention to the
concluding paragraph:
Canada's high standing in world trade can
be attributed to ber fortunate position with
regard to these two nations, together controlling one-quarter of ail foreign commerce.
But Canada's mainstay is the United Kingdom,
which can be counted upon in fair weather
and bad, regardless of political changes.
Participation in intra-Empire trade revolving
around the world's greatest trading nation is
an advantage to be held at ahl costs.
That, I think, is something well worth considering. It is an advantage which can be
maintained and improved only so long as we
remain a part of the British Empire.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I have
another objection. I am full of objections,
and I hope honourable members think they
are aIl good. If we get a new constitution
we shall be creating it ourselves. Now I
object to the giving of absolute power to

our Government and Parliament to amend
or destroy the British North America Act
or to substitute something else for it.
I
object to any Parliament having any more
power or control over me than is necessary
for the peace, order and good government
of Canada. I shall be told that the British
Parliament has absolute power over the
people of Great Britain. I admit that. I
know that the British Parliament can do
anything, so far as Great Britain is concerned,
except turn a man into a woman. But it did
not get its power from the people. I know
of no constitution under which absolute
power was given by the governed to the
governors. Absolute power was taken from
humanity by its governors.
After the Conquest William I was a despot.
English kings had absolute power from then
until the time of the Stuarts, though there
was a shadow Parliament.
The Stuarts,
being pig-headed and having bad judgment,
did not see that the time was coming when
statesmen would get control over the people
and deprive the King of his traditional rights.
Cromwell was the last dictator of England
to sit on the Throne-for he virtually did sit
on the Throne. When Parliament disagreed
with him he sent the members about their
business. No one gave. him that power, just
as no one gave kings the power that they
had. In course of time, century by century,
year by year, dexterous politicians managed
to denude the sovereign of most of his personal power, and now there is an autocracy in
England. The English Cabinet did not get
its powers from the people. On the contrary,
it took them from the King.
Now, although there is an autocracy ruling
England and an autocracy ruling Canada, the
difference hetween the two countries is that
here the power is split between the Dominion
and the provinces. Our Parliament cannot
get absolute control over us unless it conspires with the provinces, and I object to
its ever obtaining such control.
The night before last I chanced to come
across this statement by a distinguished
Englishman, in an issue of Nineteenth Century of last autumn:
To place unlimited power in the hands of
the State is to degrade men, te narrow the
intelligence, to encourage intolerance, contempt,
bitter strife and the evil arts of flattery. It
involves self-abasement in order to conciliate
votes and possess power, toleration of the
dangerous power of a very able Press, which
too often thinks for most of us, and the
repression of all those healthy individual
differences that make the life of a nation. It
means also the piling up of intolerable burdens
of debt, the mean endeavour to place the
heaviest of these burdens on others, the in-

solence of those who spend money compulsorily
taken. the deep poisonous corruption ... already
sporadically existing among ns; and at the end
of it all the setting up of some absolute foraim
of governmnent, to which men fly in despair.
Now, these are the results of absolutism. In
my opinion no Government should have any
power over the people which is not necessary for the peace, order and good government of the nation.

in the contest and in bringing about the reforms which followed.
After the American Revolution Upper
Canada, now the province of Ontario, rapidly
became populated by immigrants from the
American Colonies-United Empire Loyalists
who refused to live under any other than the
British flag.
Thousands of - these people
settled here, chiefly in the southern sections
of the country, and it was to bring about
conditions more suited to their needs than
those obtaining under French law and French
traditions that the Constitutional Act was
passed. Most of these immigrants had lived
in the older American colonies for many years,
some of them for generations, and they had
become imbued with the spirit of those
colonies. They had become used to the comparatively wide franchise which had been
granted by the British Crown with respect to
American parliamentary institutions, and to
a comparatively wide control over purely local
affairs. The Constitutional Act, which formed
the two new provinces of Upper and Lower
Canada, provided for much the same system.
Although not a few of these immigrants had
sympathized
with the majority of the
American colonists in the earlier stages of the
Revolution, and for years had actually sided
witlh them in opposing the taxes and other
restrictions of the Home Government, when
it came to an actual declaration of independence they broke away and came to Canada.
Through many years of struggling against
conditions in a new country, of fighting against
the wilderness and the Indians, and of making
homes and a living for themsclvcs, they had
acquired a spirit of democracy and selfreliance that did not lightly brook undue
interference from a Government thousands of
miles away, or from the governors who wewe
appointed by that Government.
In addition large numbers of Americans
who were attracted by our farm lands came
in between the Revolution and 1837. They
became loyal Canadians, many of them fightng on the side of the British in 1812. They
brought with them a certain knowledge of
and attachment to the institutions,
social,
political and religious, of the new American
Republie.
We know of many of their
descendants at this very day.
Another large body of settlers came from
Great Britain. After the Napoleonie wars
thousands of disbanded soldiers came here
and settled in what are now the Maritime
Provinces, Ontario, and elsewhere.' After the
Napoleonie wars, as after the Great War,
there was a great depression and England
was seething with discontent. That discontent
they brought here with them.
Hon. Mr. HARDY.

Not long afterwards, in the late twenties,
they were followed by a large number of
people who had seen the great wave of reform
which for years swept over England, and
when these people came to this country
they
still carried in their minds the ideas of
representative government, parliamentary government and responsible government. They
were not mere puppets. They were men who
had been striving for the vote, for wider
parliamentary privileges, and who in 1832
saw the culmination of victory for the great
bulk of the British people in the passing
of
the Reform Act. In Canada they expected
an equally wide franchise and an equally
responsible government, but instead, although
there was a very fair and very sound government constitutionally, it was only a colonial
government, and there was an utter lack of
responsibility on the part of the officers of
the Crown to the elected body.
As I have said, various elements of the
population, whether supporters of the Governnient or reformers, found a common cause in
the War of 1812. They forgot their differences
and all, whether in Upper Canada or Lower
Canada, showed that they were not wanting
in loyalty to British connections. But soon
after the war was over the trouble arose
again, and from the early twenties the opposition to the prevailing system gathered
strength and became more pronounced.
Of course, in any conflict between different
parties in any country there are bound to be
certain general causes of discontent. But
out of these general causes arise many smaller
ones; and I believe it is almost a commonplace to say that frequently it is these smaller
things which give rise to irritation and
trouble.
The chief general causes of the troubles
that came upon the two Canadas in the
twenties were, first, the nature of and the
method of constituting the Executive Council and the Legislative Council; second, the
lack of control over revenues by the provincial legislatures; and, third-and Lord
Durham points out that this was one of the
most disturbing factors-the method of dealing with public lands. I am not going to
discuss the last cause at all, and shall only
touch on the second as it affected executive
responsibility.
The Executive Council was appointed by
the Governor, who could choose almost any
person he wished. I do not think we should
find too great fault with him for appoint.ng the great officials of state. Tha-t was the
English system of administering colonies in
those days. At the present time, however,
t seems inconceivable that judges who were

APRIL 29, 1936
supposed to administer justice should sit on
the more or less political Council. Nevertheless that was the fact. Perhaps it was because the Home Government could flot
conceive of the Councils being anything but
administrative, or of polities being known in
a colony. At one time the Chief Justice of
Upper Canada was president of the Executive Couneil, and later he was flot only Chief
Justice and president of the Executive
Gouncil, but also Speaker of th-e Legisiative
Council.
It goes without saying that there was 11o
responsibility to, the elected House. If there
had been there would have been 11o struggle.
There was not even a collective responsibility
am-ongst the various ministers, or members
of the executive as they were ealled, and
the Governor could advise with on1e or more
of thema without consulting the others. Each
mem'ber was responsible only to the Governor,
and only for his own department. Nothing
the Assembly could do would have any effect
on their actions.
The Executive Council claimed the right
-and in many ways it had the right-to deal
with considerable revenues. It thus made
it.self practically independent of Parliament
for long periods of time. To show how far
this could be carried I may say that when
a House had been electe-d in which there was
a majority opposed to the Government it.
was usually short-lived--it was very soon
dissolved. On the other hand, a friendly
* House was kept in office for its full term.
History shows that this statement is not
open to dispute. Indeed, in anticipation of
the death of William IV, an Act was passed
providing that upon his death the Huse was
flot to 'be dissolved. In those days a legisiature was automatically dissolived on the death
of the sovereign. But the Government oif the
day, having a friendly House, feit that it
would be mucli safer to hold on, and that
action did as muoh as anything else to bring
about the final crisis of 1837.
The Legisiative Council was somcewhat like
the Senate, the mnembers being appoin'ted
by the Governor for life. It was made up
largely of goverument officials, including,
strange as it may seem to us, judiges, members
of the clergy, and, of course, members and
friends cf the Executive Council and of the
Governor.
The troubles that arose. in both provinces
were countless, those in Lower Canada being
more acute, probably, than those in Upper
Canada. The Assembly in Lower Canada
took an almost irreconcil-able stand against
the Legisiative Council. As fax as I can read
from history, it was more strongly opposed

207

to the Legisiative Council than it was to
the Executive. In Upper Canada the reverse
was the' case. In Lower Canada supplies
were refused year after y.ear, and this, of
course, brought the Home Government into
conflict with the Assembly.
Anyone who r-eads the history of those
days will know that neither ahl the wrong
I
nor aIl the right was on one side.
arn not here for the purpose cd raising a
controversy. I believe there were right and
wrong on both sides.
In Upper Canada, as 1 have said, the chief
conflict was waged between the Executive
Council-and that included the GovernoT,
unfortunately-and the Legisîstive Assembly.
One of the chief grounds of contention
was the control of the revenue, and judging
from the composition of the Executive Council we can well imagine that when the
Assembly had no0 control at ahl over the
revenue there would be grievances.
Just; here, in order to show the d-ifference
between the Upper bouse of those days and
the Upper bouse of to-day, I may say that
in one session the Upper House in Upper
Canada threw out no fewer than forty bills.
I need not touch on the trouble that was
caused by the land tenure of the lower province, or on the clergy reserves and other
grants in what is now the province of Ontario.
If a.nyone is intere.sted in this particular phase
I would refer him to Lord Durham's report,
which, I believe, gives an absolutely unbiased
account. If I wiere to bring this up to-day
I think I should be contravening to some
extent my own statemen-t that I would not
touch on controversial matters. But Lord
Durham did flot besitate to touch on anything that he thouglit required attention, and
he covers the whole situation with respect
to land very fully and in an exceedi.ngly
able way.
I propose to deal with just one cause of
the trouble, namely, the lack of responsibility
on the part cf the Government. I believe
that a great many of the other troubles were
brought about by that lack of re.sponsibiiity,
but I shail deal with them only as they affect
responsibility.
Now, I have touched on the general
grounds cif discontent. Ae to. rights or
wrongs, everyone must form bis own opinion
from history. The faet is--and that is what
I want to deal with-that -there was diiscontent, and it was great enough to cause open
rebellion. In these days it would seem easy
enough to, remedy the causes: the Exeeutive
would be in sympathy wi.th the majority of
the bouse and would confoirm to its wishes.
It was for this prineiple that Papineau and

208

SENATE

Mackenzie fought before they finally rose in
rebellion.
Here I would say that although I have
been referring largely to the position and
work of William Lyon Mackenzie in Upper
Canada, Papineau occupied a very similar
position and did very similar work in Lower
Canada. He was the leader of the French
Canadians there, and probably exercised more
power over them than any other man of
his race. He was perhaps the greatest orator
Canada had seen up to that time, and
possessed great personal magnetism.
For
years ho was the idol of the French Canadians. They trusted him and followed him,
and I believe that ho sincerely and honestly
gave of his best for them. He possessed
something of the same temperament as
Mackenzie, and, ike him, was a strong and
bitter fighter. Whether honourable members
agree with me on anything else, it will be
generally admitted that-both those men were
strong and bitter fighters. While Papineau
belongcd to the French aristocratie class,
Mackenzie was always one of the people
and never possessed riches. Yet the two
worked together for the same cause, though
from different angles. No one can discuss
the period and events to which I am now
referring without giving the same consideration. whet.her it be praise or blame, to
Papineau as to Mackenzie.
It has been said that Mackenzie was not
really the man instrumental in bringing
about responsible government. We can only
judge by events and records. We know he
demanded that the Assembly should have
control over provincial revenues and also
over the Executive, which ho claimed should
be formed only of men chosen by or at least
acceptable to the Assembly. As early as
1830 ha stated, in paragraph 4 of his published
programme of reforms, "That an Administration or Executive responsible to the Province for its conduct" was essential. And in
the election of 1831 he was instrumental in
obtaining from all over the province signatures to petitions praying that the King
"cause the same constitutional |principle which
has called Your Majesty's present ministers
to office to be fully recognized," particularly
"so that we may see only those who possess
the confidence of the people composing the
Executive Council of Your Majesty's representative." The words I have quoted are
not the opinions of historians, but are taken
from contemporary records, and I do not
know that anything could more clearly show
what Mackenzie's aim was. Those petitions,
which were signed at great meetings held by
Mackenzie in all parts of the province during
Hon.

NIr. HARDY.

the campaign of 1832. were among the papers
he took to England with him that year when
he went over to lay his case before the authorities there.
In 1833, wben standing for the Assembly, he
declared as .part of bis views that "the great
defect in the colonial constitution was the
lack of responsible government."
These are some of the claims that Mackenzie made from the outset and continued
to make all through his career. Some historians say that he had only a shadowy idea of
responsible government. I think the printed
records available show us exactly what ha
wanted. Of course it could not be expected
that ideas prevailing one hundred years ago
with regard to responsible government should
be the came as those of to-day. In all
countries constitutional re-forms are matters
of slow growth, and responsible government
is no exception.
Of course Mackenzie was not the only
man who agitated for responsible government. The one who is usually given credit
for bringing about that reform in Upper Canada is Robert Baldwin.
These two men
made the same claim over a period of many
years, but Baldwin set it out in batter form
than Mackenzie ever did.
Baldwin was a
greater man than Mackenzie; we must admit
that. Yet when Mackenzie went to England
in 1832 to ask the Imperial authorities
to consider granting responsible government
to the province, ha was received on more
than one occasion by the then Colonial
Secretary-; whereas Mr. Baldiwin, who went
over a feiw years afterwards- was unable to
obtain any such audience.
The rebellion, which finally broke out late
in 1837, first in Lower Canada and shortly
afterwards in Upper Canada, came as a shock
to the Home Government and to England
generally. I shall not deal with the incidents
of those times, but, having shown that Mackenzie was the real leader bound to have
responsible government, I shall now show that
it was these very risings that brought Lord
Durham iato the situation. In all those years
the Imperial authorities had stood firmly
against the reform of the Executive asked for,
but when, in November, 1837, the open risings
occurred, England immediately took steps to
bring about a batter condition of affairs.
In July, 1837, shortly after the return of
Lord Durham from his mission to Russia,
Lord Melbourne asked him to go to Canada
as Commissioner and Governor General and
to inquire into the state of the provinces.
The letter containing this request is an interesting one, but I shall not take time to read
it all. Lord Melbourne said:

APRIL 29, 1936
It has long been evident that flot only the
Government, but the country, is subject to
daily increasing
embarrassment from the
present state of affairs in Lower Canada, and
consequently in ail the British North American
possessions.
The final separation of those
colonies might possibly not bie of material
detriment to the interests of the Mother
Country, but it is clear that it would be a
serious blow to the honour of Great Britain,
and certainly would be fatal to the character
and existence of the Administration under
which it took place.
lie goca on to state that hie believes Lord
Durham to be the fittest man to undertake
the duty of inquiring into Canadian affairs.
That gentleman, however, had just completed
a difficuit mission of two years in Russia and
declined this new task. But in December, 1837,
when news of the rebellion reaehed England,
Lord Melbourne renewed his appeal. This
time the commission was accepted, and early
in 1838 Lord Durham came out to Canada.
It seems to me that the acceptance of the
commission in these circumstances is one of
the first important links in the -chain of resuits
leading from the actual uprisings in 1837.
1 should lîke to deal at some length with
the Durham Report, but it is flot necessary
to do so, because the general principles underlying it are well known. It contained nlot a
few tbings that were unacceptable then and
would be unacceptable to-day. But on the
point with whicb I am dealing, the need for
a truly respon.sible system of government,
Lord Durham lef t no room for doubt. And
hie did flot mince matters regarding what hie
considered the misgovernment of the province.
If I were to go into this I should be dealing
with controversial details, on which I do not
intend to spend any time. The two facts,
that he was unfair to French Canadians and
desired to make Lower Canada a thoroughly
British country, and týhat hie spent very little
time in lp'perCanadu, have no be-aring upon
the general principles he set out as regards
responsible government, which is the only
thing I am concerned with at the moment.
One would have to read a large portion
of Durham's Report to get ahl his recommendations as to the granting of responsible
governiment. But in order to show another
link in the chain of events leading to our
obtaining responsible government may I read
a few lines?
One of his most important
statements was:
The wisdom of facilitating the management
of public affairs, by entrusting it to the persons
who have the confidence of the representative
body, bas neyer been recognized in the government of the North American colonies.
H1e speaks ofthat wîse principle of our Government, which
bas vested the direction of the national po]icy,

and the distribution of patronage, in the
leaders of the parliamentary majority ...
And hie goes on to, say:
It is not difficuit to apply the case to our
own country. Let it bie imagined that at a
general election the Opposition were to return
500 out of 658 members of the House of
Commons, and that the whole policy of the
ministry should bie condemned, and every Bill
introduced by it rejected by this immense
majority. Let it bie supposed that the Crown
should consider it a point of honour and duty
to retain a ministry s0 condemned and s0
thwarted; ... and, I think, it will not be
difficult to imagine the fate of such a system
of government. Yet such was the system, such
literally wss the course of events in Lower
Canada, and sueh in character, though not
quite in degree, was the spectacle exhibited in
Upper Canada, and, at one time or another,
in every one of the North American colonies.
And a littie further on:
1 know not 1mow if, is possible to seure that
harmony in any other way than by administering the government on those principles
which have been found perfectly efficacious in
Great Britain ...
In England ... when a
ministry ceases to command a majority in
Parliament on great questions of .policy its
doom is immediately sealed ...
I inight read many pages of that kind of
thing, but it is unnecessary to do so, as it is
ail a matter of record. That report was the first
recommendation by an offcial of such high
rank that responsible government be granted
to a colony. Af ter its publication many other
colonies, especially those in British America
and Australia, took a keen interest in it.
To-day aIl British Dominions without exception enjoy responsible government, which
had its source, outside England, in Canada.
That is something of which we can, and I
believe do, feel proud.
Two things may be said against the point
I have just been making: one, that responsibie government wu. nlot fully established
in Canada until the time of Lord Elgin, in
1849; another, that it was introduced earlier
in other British American colonies; in Nova
Scotia, for example.
As to, the first objection, it is true that
responsible government was flot fully established in Canada until 1849. 1 .had intended
to deal with some incidents relating to, the
growth of the system, but I thinýk they are
f amiliar to ail who are interested in the
subject. That growth was of course very
graduai and slow,
In that respect there is
an analogy between responsible government
and the autonomy of the great British Dominions. Yet, see ho-w we have advanced.
I wonder w.hat our people would have thought
only forty years ago, let us say, had anyone
proposed such an Act as the present Statute
of Westminster. Or what would have been

said then had it been suggested that the Dominions be given power to sign treaties on
their own responsibiliity and without the intervention of British ambassadors or ministers?
Responsible government was the beginning,
and these things have followed slowly.
Lord Durham was succeeded by Lord
Sydenham, who apparently was theoretically
opposed in every way to responsible government. Yet in practice he acted to a considerable extent in accordance with the principles of that system. This is clear from an
incident in the new Parliament after the
Union, when the Opposition challenged the
Government as to whether it would resign if
it no longer had a majority in the House.
Attorney-General Draper stated.for the Government, that in such circumstances it would
resign.
About that time the House passed the Harrison resolution, whose sponsor was a member of the Administration. The gist of that
resolution was:
That the ehief advisers of the representative
of the Sovereign, constituting a provincial
admi nistration unier hi m, ought to be men
possessed of the confidence of the elected
representatives of the people.
That was claimed to be proof that responsible
government had been definitely secured.
But the s.ystem had its ips and downs over
a long period. Sir Charles Bagot. who was
perhaps the most liberal of our governors of
those days, t1heoretically refused to accept
the system, but in practice was guided by its
principles to a great extent. Under bis successor, Lord Metcalfe, there was such a strong
reaction that the country was in danger of
having another crisis ahnost equal to that of
1837. Calm was restored only when te was
recalled. partly on account of illness. He was
succeeded by Lord Elgin, and I think it may
be said that then responsible government was
achieved.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: It was not until the
coming of Lord Elgin in 1846 that the principle
was adopted to the extent of its logical
conclusion, which was tiat not only should the
Executive possess the confidence of the

should be guided by the advice of the
Executive, or Cabinet, as we should say to-day.

would be a task for someone whose powers
of expression are superior to mine.
I already tave been asked why official
recognition should be given to a rebel or
rebels. Perhaps the word "rebel" tas not the
same significance to-day that it lad one hundred or more years ago. But, after al, rebels
have done some important work, and have
done it well. There is scarcely a country that
does net pay tribute to one or more of them.
On the wvole North American continent there
is not a sovereign nation but was established
by rebels. There is not one wtere you do not
find memorials to so-called rebels. They are
rebels whien they do not succeed in overthrowing the government; they become patriots
when they are surcessful. How many countries
are there in Europe to-day that bave not their
very foundations in revolution? The French
Republic is the child of the greatest revolution the world ever saw until perhaps the
Russian political upteaval. Italy as a united
country is the cbild of rebellion. Spain to-day
is in the throes of a rebellion which tas been
in progress intermittently during our lifetime.
There is not a Balkan state to-day that does
not owe its existence to rebellion. Norway
is the child of rebellion. England tas been
bred in rebellion, from the day when the
rebellious barons forced King John to sign
Magna Charta, down to the rebellion of 1641,
wien Charles I was deposed. The monarchal
system was suspended during the Protectorate.
Later again there was a rebellion against
James Il, to which George I. the progenitor
of ouir present dynasty, actually o-wed his
crown.
Therefore I submiit that when we use the
word "rebel" we should bear in mind what
results followed from the so-called rebel's
action. Those of my honourable friends who
have been in England will recollect the statue
erected to that great rebel George Washington. oeelooking the centre of the EmpireTrafalgar Square. A mile a-way there is the
colossal statue to Oliver Cromwell, the greatest rebel of them all. As for ourselves, we
have only to look 100 yards beyond the
confines of this building to sec a monument
to the great Sir George Cartier. During the
very rebellion to which I have been referring
te was a fugitive from justice, with a price
on his head. It is truc, the monument tas
been erected. not on account of his activities as a rebel, but in recognition of his
great services to Canada later; but he was
once a rebel.
I think I may now ask my honourable
leader if the Government will in any way
give official recognition to that event which
took place in 1837 and which led, as I

APRiL 29, 1936
have tried to show, to the establishment of
respo.nsibl-e government in this province.
Hon. C. E. TANNER:
I am not sure
that I heard distinctly all that the honourable member who has just resumed his seat
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) said, but in case what I
have in mind was not covered by him, I
wish to direct his attention to the fact that
the provinces to which he was referring do
not constitute the whole of- Canada. I would
remind bim that there was such a man as
Joseph Howe,Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. TANNER: -that in 1835, more
than 100 years ago, he stood before the High
Court of Nova Scotia in defence of free
speech and a free press, that that historic
trial in Halifax established those two princi.ples, and that it was the opening of the
campaign for responsible government which
he carried on in Nova Scotia. I am merely

My honourable friend

Hon. Mr. TANNER: -as
a supplement
to my honourable
friend's speech.
The
Legislature of Nova Scotia goes back to
1758. It is the oldest legisliature in Canada.
Joe Howe, as I say, won the trial in 1835.
In 1836 he was elected to the Legislature
of Nova Scotia, and, three years ahead of
the date mentioned by my honourable friend,
the battle for responsible government was
finaIly won in Nova Scotia by Joseph Howe.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The honourable senator is, I believe, quite right.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should have added
that in Nova Scotia the battle for constitutional government was won by Joe Howe and
his colleagues by constitutional means. There
was no rebelHion.

because I realize this motion would have
special significance, the Administration being
under its present head, and possibly its representative in this House would like to have
some expression of opinion before he speaks
in the name of the leader of the Government.
I hope that in.what I have ta say I shall be
acquitted of anything in the nature of animosity to anybody from an historical standpoint, and particularly ta any descendant of
the great figure referred to by my honourable friend in his address. Indeed, I wish
12745-14J

to open by complimenting him on the very
fair, scholarly and certainly inoffensive manner in which he presented the issue. He
declared it was bis desire not to arouse a
controversy if such could be avoided, but
to seek a unified acclaim in a movement to
celebrate the event around which bis address
circled.
I tried to follow with the utmost care the

taken by the present Administration to celebrate the rebellion of 1837 and the memory
of the man who in this province was the
leader of the movement, because in his
view that rebellion started a chain of events
which led to the appointment of Lord Durham and, through his report, resulted finally
in the establishment of responsible government in Upper Canada.
He stated, if I understood correctly his
intent, that be did not wish to discuss the
merits of the rebellion itself, that is to say,
whether or not this violent action was necessary ta attain the legitimate objects which
the leaders of it had in mind. I can think
of no more appropriate comment on his
stand than what we have just heard from the
honourable senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner). The necessity of responsible government in those days was naturaliy not as
patent to leaders of opinion in the Old
Land as it would be after the developments
of the intervening years. But even at the
time of this event, in another province of
our country, an older one indeed than either
of those to which my honourable friend has
referred, victory had been won without bloodshed, without violence, under the leadership
of pioneers in our public life at that time.
I congratulate my honourable friend that
he does not raise the issue as to whether the
extreme step taken in 1837 was necessary to
its goal. Now, I wish to inquire whether or
not, regard being had to the honourable
gentleman's representations, it is proper to
ask that we celebrate the rebellion, or that
we request the Government to initiate some
commemoration thereof.
Aside entirely from the necessity of the
rebellion of 1837, I do not dispute that it did
lead to the appointment of Lord Durhain, who
previously had been requested to come to
Canada and had declined, and that the Durham Report led to the establishment of the
new form of government, the essentials of
which survive to this hour. But I do dispute
that that makes the rebellion itself the subject
of commemoration.
The same reasoning
would lead us into very dangerous conclusions
I do not think it can be disputed that the
sinking of the Lusitania was the first link in

SENATE

212

a long chain of events which led through the
submarine campaign to the intervention of
the United States, and, through that intervention and by the help they gave, te the
ultimate winning of the late war. But I ask
honourable senators if that would be a cause
for celebrating the sinking of the Lusitania.
If so, we ought very soon te begin to conmemorate the twenty-first anniversa.ry of that
monstrous crime. In a word, unless we are
prepared te conclude the rebellion of 1837
was justified-indeed, I go further-unless we
are prepared to conclude such is now the
almost universal view of the people of this
Dominion, it ýprobably is not wise to ask the
Government to initiate a celebration of that
event.
I am certainly net one who is prepared te
admit that the steps taken in 1837 were
essential and necessary steps. I am net prepared te admit that the far more excellent
way adopted by Joseph Howe of Nova Sceotia
would not have been also the successful way
I ask
in the province of Upper Canada.
that the honourable member take that consideration into account and reflect as to
whether it would be wise to suggest to the
Government at this hour, whatever may be
its own conclusions, that it revive the embers,
now almost extinct, of a controversy which
was deadly in its tinte.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I say to my right
honourable friend and also to the honourable
senator from Pictou that after the Durham
Report Joseph Howe was the one man above
all others who relied on it, and the history
of Nova Sceotia is full of references to the
Durham Report and shows that as a result
we obtained responsible government. There
is no doubt about that. It would take too
long to go into it fully. I had it in my notes,
but felt I should net develop it to-night,
that after the Durham Report was made
instructions to the governors were couched
in very different terms, and that responsible
government in Nova Scotia was based on the
Durham Report.
I will grant the honourable senator from
Pictou this: Nova Scotians are the wisest
people in this Dominion. They have more
Scotch blood than any of their fellow-Canadians, and I believe they are our soundest
philosophers. That is perhaps why it was
settled definitely that Nova Scotia should
have responsible government three years before
Ontario. I am surprised that Nova Scotians
did not get it earlier.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: This was Joe Howe's
policy as stated by bim in his first election
campaign in 1836:
Right Hon. Mr

MEIGHEN.

All we ask is for what exists at home ... a
system of responsibility to the people, extending through all the departments supported at
the public expense.
That is the policy which carried him to victory.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If no other honourable member desires to adjourn the debate,
I will do se myself.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.
INDIAN BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND 'noved the
second reading of Bill 4, an Act te amend the
Indian Act.
He said: Honourable members of the
Senate, the remark that fell from the lips of my
right honourable friend yesterday concerning
this Bill prompted me te examine it with
particular attention, and I may say that,
although I believe the substance of the
various clauses will be generally accepted by
this House, the Bill may need te be redrafted
when it goes te committee. I shall not enter
into the reasons.
The Bill contains a number of amendments
on differeit subjects. I think I may say
there is no general principle covering them
all. If honourable members wil'l look at the
marginal notes they will find that the first
clause deals with the sale of land d.evised
or bequeathed te non-residents. The present
Act permits of sale te members of the band;
the amendment inserts the words "te the

band is given the right to acquire the land.
Clause 2 governs laws for the prevention
of disease and laws respecting motor vehicles.
Clause 3 has to do with the power of the
Governor in Council over the expenditure
of capital.
The Bill then deals with the method of
electing councillors, I believeRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.

cerning intoxicants and the sale of intoxicants. Following those there are some provisions with respect to gambling and drinking.

Commerce may find it necessary to redraft
one or two of the clauses of the Bill. Clause

reserves, of course, are under the direct legislation of the Dominion Parliament. We can

213

APRIL 29, 1936
see that the intent of the Bill is to apply
certain provincial enactments. I feeli that
this can be done, and that the powers to be
granted to the Superintendent General can
be granted to him directly by this Parliament, not through legislation now on the
provincial Statute Book.
MEIGHEN:
Hon. ARTHUR
Right
Honourable members, my remark of yesterday was elicited principally by the abortive
attempt at legislation which is contained in
clause 2. I do not think the leader of the
Government has bis mind on the constitutional aspect of this clause, as it ought to be
or would be if he were giving more attention to it. As a legislative effort this is
really the most hideous monster I have ever
seen in either branch of Parliament. We
undertake to give the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs power to select certain
clauses of a provincial statute and to declare them to be in effect in an Indian
reserve. It is a most primitive constitutional element that we cannot divest ourselves of power. We cannot add to provincial powers or subtract from our own.
This clause would put the provinces in a
position to enact laws respecting our reserves by getting the approval of the Superintendent General.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To legislate for
the Indian reserves.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It cannot be
donc. That is so obvious that it is simply
absurd to suggest such a clause. If we liked
some provincial law and wanted it to become
operative in a reserve, the most we could do
would be to say that section so-and-so of
the Act of a certain legislature shall be
in effect in that reserve. That would be just
the same as if we quoted the section and
said it was the law. But we do not attempt
to do so here. We give someone the right
to select whatever he may choose out of the
provincial statute.
That, surely, is absurd enough; but honourable iembers will be surprised when I
say there is something still more grotesque.
We say that the Superintendent General
may declare some provincial Act to be law.
Very good. Suppose he does that. Is it law?
We do not say so. All we say is that he
can declare it; and even if he declares it
from a platform in front of these builings,
things are exactly in the same position as
before. We do not say that it shall be the
law if lie declares it. Whoever drafted this
Bill certainly should get the Victoria CrossSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: With all due respect
to my leader, I should like to know what
connection this Bill has with Banking and
Commerce in any way whatsoever. I think
we should find another committee for it, or
refer it to Committee of the Whole.

CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 11, an Act to amend
the Customs Act.
Honourable members of the
He said:
Senate, this Bill covers a number of matters
which might well be discussed either in Committee of the Whole or in the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. It deals with
entries by bill of sight, the valuation of
imported goodsRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the
honourable gentleman will tell us one thing
which I think is more important than the
details. 'I this legislation obligatory upon

Yes. There

are two clauses which are consequential.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Which two

and the United StatesRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.

Mr. MURDOCK:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Clause 6 is a
result of the agreements with the United
States and Japan. I think these are the
clauses.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
the others are obligatory at all?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

None

of

No.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Can the honourable leader tell us exactly what will be the
result of taking the valuation set in the
country of origin -or export?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under the Act
as it stands at present the Minister may
determine the rate of discount to be applied.
The amendment has the effect of preventing
the fixing of a discount different from tat
applying to the price of the goods in the
country of origin; in this case the United
States. If on certain goods American manufacturers allowed a discount of, say, thirty
per cent, Canada could not fix the discount
at twenty per cent; we should be bound to
maintain the same rate as that given in the
country of origin.
Hon. Mr. MURDGCK: I think the explanatory note to section 4 deals with that point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
It was undertaken in connection with the
trade agreement between Canada and the
United States that no rate of discount established under section 37 will operate to increase
the value for duty of any goods beyond the
price at which such or sinilar goods are freely
offered for sale to purchasers at the time and
place of shipment in the country of export, in
the usual quantities and in the ordinary
course of trade.
This undertaking renders
unnecessary section 37 as it stands at present,
as other provisions of the Act provide for
determining the fair market value.
Section 5 provides:
Paragrapi (e) of subsection one of section
forty-one of the said Act is repealed, and the
following is substituted therefor:(e) suc goods by reason of the fact that
the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable are sold under conditions or
to a class of purehaser under or to which
similar goods are not sold by the exporter for
home consumption; or such goods are sold or
imported in or under any other unusual or
peculiar manner or conditions.
Thie change consists in the addition of the
words underlined in the Bill, that is, al. the
words from the beginning of the new paraRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

graph down to "home consumption." The
explanatory note reads:
As an exampile of conditions different thoughs
not unusual, an exporter may sell in the home
market to consumers, dealers or wholesalers
only, while for export he may sel] to distributors. jobbers or dealers who undertake
certain marketing expenses not borne by the
purchasers in the home market. but borne by
the manufacturer, and in consequence the
exporter may sell at a lower price and claim
such lower price as a fair market value though
it is not a value as actually sold for hone
consumption.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
follow the treaty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Does that

No; not section 5.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why pass it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The section inserted to comply with undertakings entered
into with the United States and Jaýpan is
section 6, which reads:
Section forty-three of the said Act as
enacted by section four of chapter two of the
statutes of 1930 (2nd Session), and as amended
by section one of chapter seven of the statutes
of 1932-33, is further anended by adding the
following subsection thereto as subsection
three:(3) In the case of any value for duty
establislhed under the provisions of this section
after the first day of January, 1936, any interested party may apply to the Tariff Board
by way of appeal therefrom. The Tariff Board
shall thereupon conduct a public inquiry and
inake its finding as to whether, to whbat extent,
and for what period such value is required to
prevent the importation of goods into Canada
froi prejudicially or injuriously affecting the
interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers. If no fixed value is found by the Tariff

Board to be required, or if a lower value is
found to

be

appropriate, the

finding

of

the

Tariff Board will become at once effective. If
appeal is made to the Tariff Board such value
authorized by the Minister shall in default of
any finding by the Tariff Board in the meantime cease to bave force and effect upon the
expiration of three months from the date of
any sucb application to the Tariff Board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Does that
correspond with the similar provision in the
Ottawa Agreements?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sure.
Right Hon.
does.

I am not quite

Mr. MEIGHEN:

I think it

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It simply means,
so far as the American treaty is concerned,
that exporters from the United States, the
largest manufacturing country in the world,
witlh mass production and low costs, will fix
the valuation for purposes of duty when their
goods are sold for export to Canada. That
will be very detrimental te our industries.

APRIL 29, 1936
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The principle
is laid down that the sale price on the domestic market in the United States governs
the valuation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So if a discount
is allowed to American purchasers, the same
discount will be applied when the goods are
valued at the frontier.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite so. But
my honourable friend misses my point.
American manufacturers are organized on such
a huge scale and in so highly efficient a
manner that the sale price of their products
in their own country is an extremely low level
for purposes of valuation when the goods are
admitted to this country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But how can we
proceed otherwise than by accepting the sale
price that prevails on the American market?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The former
Government very properly provided. I think
under No. 48 in the Customs Regulations,
that when the price of any imports was considered to be an unfair basis of valuation for
purposes of duty, owing to debased currency,
or a lower standard of living in the country
of origin, or to any other reasonable cause,
the Minister should have power without
reference to Parliament to fix a fair valuation
for duty, within certain limitations. But now
that bas been changed and we shall be at the
mercy of all those people to whom I have
referred.
Hýon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I would
draw my honourable friend's attention to the
fact that that very arbitrary way of valuing
goods hampered to a formidable degree the
movement of trade between other countries
and Canada. A Canadian importer might
purchase goods at a certain price in a foreign
country and. before their arrival, sell them
here at what he considered a fair profit, only
to find when they did arrive that because of
an arbitrary valuation he was deprived of all
profit and sometimes was even put to a loss.
It was, I think, just that kind of - legislation
that caused a great deal of irritation and
disturbance of trade. When a man buys
goods abroad and knows that to the price he
pays it is hecessary to add only the customs
duties and taxes, he can then fix his rate of
profit and proceed to make sales. But if he
is absolutely at sea as to the customs valuation
of those goods, will he not hesitate to trade?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think I understand my honourable friend's reasoning very
clearly. If Japan is shipping rayon to this

215

country, and the rate of wages there is 25
cents a day as against $1.50 or $2 a day here,
he says: "Oh, very well. That rayon was
shipped at the fair market price in Japan; the
importer here has resold it; so the Government of Canada has no responsibility whatsoever to our workmen or to our manufacturers. In short, the price of the rayon to be
shipped to Canada is fixed by Japan, and that
is all there is to it."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My bonourable
friend knows that Canada bas power to
modify the situation any day. It is a question of dealing with countries on general
principles, but conditions may arise which
will bring about a change in our tariff legislation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Have we not
definitely surrendered that power in the case
of Japan?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
we have. We are still masters of our tariff
legislation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not if I read
correctly reports of this celebrated rearrangement with Japan.
But I want to point out to my honourable
friend that this very power against which he
declaims, and which he thinks is an unreasonable impediment to trade, is a power which
his Government in its treaty with the United
States has in respect of fruit specifically reserved in all its fullness; and unless it is
exercised as reserved, our fruit will be destroyed. Now, his Government having reserved
it in respect of fruit, a most obvious case, how
can he then use the general language of
declamation against it when it is mentioned
in relation to rayon from Japan?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend speaks of the United States and
then of Japan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know, but
it is the same power and the same principle
which in the treaty with United States my
honourable friend's Government has reserved
only in respect of fruit, so far as I can recall.
He can make no argument in respect of fruit
that he cannot make in respect of Japanese
products.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend knows that in the agreement
with the United States there is a schedule
covering fixed amounts, which cannot be altered; but outside of that schedule Parliament
remains free to deal with its general tariff,
and its intermediate tariff as well.

senators, before the Orders of the Day are

the Covernment has sold certain ships. If so,
will he be good enough to tell this House
how many ships were sold, and what was the

shall make inquiry and reply to my honourable

were sold, and what were the operating profits
of the ships for ast year.

to chapter 15 of the statutes of 1920.
In chapter 21 of the statutes of 1925 the
period of the agreement was extended for five

empowered to agree on behalf of His Majesty
to pay to the Corporation annually the sum
of $100,000 during the period of five years from
1st July, 1925, instead of the annual sum of
875,000 as provided for in the agreement. By
chapter 43 of the statutes of 1931 this period

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTAUTHORITY TO AMEND
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the inquiry by Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton:
That he will draw the attention of the
Senate to, and inquire of the Government,
whether it is the intention of the Government
to take steps to have legislation passed by
the Imperial Parliament to the end that the
Parliament of Canada shall have the authority
to from time to time amend the British North
Ainerica Act as it may deem proper.

APRIL 30, 1936
Hon. J. P. B. CAS GRAIN: Honourable
members, as y.ou are aware, when yesterday
I moved the adjournment of this debate I did
flot think I could adid very much to what had
been so ably said by the honourable -member
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lysich-Staunton).
Since then I have been fortunate ini getiting
some information which agrees preÙty much
with what he said. I must crave the indulgence
of the Huse, because my remarks may not
be so consecutive as they would have been had
I had time to prepare full notes.
I feit proud of being an Imperialist when
my honourable f riend sang the praises of the
British Army. He told us that one day while
travelling in the Soudlan he came upon a long,
low-thatched building over which flew the
Union Jack; that the only people &bout were
two young lieutenants of the British Army;
that he went up (to them and said, "Boys, what
are you doinýg here?" and tVhey a'nswered,
"Keeping the peace, sir." What he saw there
he would have seen on a much larger scale on
the northern frontier of India.
I have read recently a book by Sir Samuel
Hoare. When he was made Minister of
Aviation he flew to Delhi, accompanied by
Lady Hoare. Some of her friends toid her
it was a very perilous trip, but she replied,
"Weil, if one goes the other one mîght just
as well go too." That shows the British
spirit and a happy family if e. There are
some wivea who might wish it the oCher way.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Froim Delhi Sir
Samuel Hoare made a tour of the military
posts by army planes, and this took him over
what is probably the most dangerous place in
all our Empire, the bordera of Afghanistan.
There the warlike frontier tribes are always
ready to shoot without a moment's warning.
He inspected the various garrison posts manned
hy loyal natives under a few English officers.
Always he found the land around the posts
cleared for a considerable distance, so that no
hostile tribes could take adv-antage of cover
to, sur-prise the garrison. At the Khyber Pass
Sir Samuel transferred from his plane to a
motor-car to make a close inspection and
ascertain local, conditions. As honourable
members know, Afghanistan is about the only
territory that the Empire bas lost. My
ho-nourable fniendâ will recal Lord Roberts'
campaign. The Afghans struck for independence. Perbaps it is just as weli tbey
succeeded, for it used to, cost Great Britain
a great deal of money Vo retain ber hold on the
country in order to protect India from the
southward march of the Russians, wbich was
the ambition of aIl the Czars. Now

217

Afghanistan is a buffer state betweeu India
and Russia. The Afghans, jealous of their
independence, naturally would oppose any
encroachment by the Russians. This is
another instance of the cleverness of England.
Whilst I arn on that subject I might recaîl
another matter to show how clever England
is. Throughout India there are magnificent
native regiments, the Bengal Lancers and
others, commanded by Eglish officers. They
lack but onee thîng necessary in warfare: they
have no artillery. That is a great drawback.
As a matter of fact, at -one time the chiefs
said: "Look here, we are wil'ling to, flght, but
we cannot fight against' your artillerýy."
Except for artillery every branch of the
service is represented in the Indian Army.
A somewhat similar situation exists. in
Egypt at this very minute. As you know,
only a short time ago, England sent some
f orty big warships to Alexandria, where there
was considerable agitation. Some of the
Egyptians are Copts. They are of the same
religion as the Ethiopians, and, as England
was sympathetie towards them, she said she
would send them something that would be
useful if there was trouble. While there
may be difficulties and border wars, and the
EgyptianB have rifles, England has the cartridges.
If I 'stray too far from my subjeet I hope
the bouse will forgive me, because in speaking impromptu one cannot help expressing
the thoughts that corne into ne's mmnd, and
this occupies a little time.
I must say that 1 have a soft spot in my
heart for the honourable member from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), for he
is the only convert I ever made. The fact
that I was able to convert a man of his
intelligence and induce him Vo, side with me
for once is, I think, complimentary to me,
though I do not guarantee that be will side

years I spoke against the St. Lawrence shîp
canal. On one occasion he said to me:
"You made a pretty good speech. I should
like Vo read what you said. Have you a copy
of it?" I gave him a copy, and apparently
lie read it, for shortly afterwards I learned
from the papers that he had made a speech
againat the proposal. Senator Reid, of Prescott, who was aIl for the canal, up'braidcd
the bonourable gentleman for *what he had
done, whereupon be replied: "Don't blame
me. Here is the man who converted me."
So I arn going to stand by the bonourable

picture at all. In Australia they have a
federation, whereas in Canada we have a
confederation. I took the trouble to look
up the dictionary to see what it says about
these words, and I am going to give it to this
House. We all know that if Sir John A.
Macdonald had had his way we should have
had legislative union, one government for
the whole of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the Kingdom of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will come to that
kingdom business in a little while.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There will not be

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Oxford Dictionary says:

This is what the

Federation: the union of several states, etc.,
under a federal governnent, each retaining
control of its own internal affairs.
That is the case of Australia; it is also the
case of the United States. Certain powers
were delegated to the central Government,
and the residue was retained by the states.
That is the reverse of what was done in
Canada. When we formed a confederation
we gave the power to the central Government, but certain matters, like ed-ucation and
so on, were left to the provinces as a sort
of sop to keep them quiet and give them an
excuse for setting up a government. That is
all there was to it.
A confederation is
different. Here is the definition:
Confederation: a number of states united
by a league, now usually on a more permanent
basis than in the case of a confederacy.
Then a man who wrote a dictionary has
something to say about this. I refer to the
author of Fowler's Modern English Usage.
He says:
Federation,
confederation,
confederacyWriting in 1918, one may say that the Entente
Powers are now a confederacy, that the proposed League of Nations would be a confederation, and that if that were further developed
into a United States of Europe, that would be
a federation. The following extracts from the
Oxford English Dictionary bear this out:Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

"Confederacy now usually implies a looser or
more temporary association than confederation,
which is applied to a union of states organized
on an intentionally permanent basis."
"In
modern political use, confederation is usually
limited to a permanent union of sovereign
states for common action in relation to
externals.... The United States of America
are commonly described as a confederation (or
confederacy) from 1777 to 1789; but from 1789
their closer union lias been considered a
federation, or Federal Republic." On Federation: "Now chiefly special-the formation of a
political unity out of a number of separate
States, so that eaeh retains the management
of its internal affairs."
I think that is very plain, and anybody
who reads it in Hansard will probably have
a better conception of it than he will get
from hearing me read it.
Not very many hours ago I was fortunate enough to receive a pamphlet that was
read before the Royal Society of Canada.
The author of the pamphlet, Hon. P. B.
Mignault, was kind enough to write on it, "A
mon ami J. P. B. Casgrain." I am sûre
all honourable gentlemen who are members
of the legal profession are acquainted with
P. B. Mignault. He bas written many books
on Legal subjects, and I am told they are of
great value. He is such a legal celebrity
that when he went to Europe last summer
the legal fraternity in various countries
velcomed him as an eminent authority. In
his pamphlet he discusses our status. Perhaps the honourable member from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has the book
and gave us what he read there. That might
be. The honourable gentleman does not say
a word; so I am afraid I am right.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

The book is enHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
titled, "Some Considerations on the Development and the Principle of Autonomy in Canada before and since the Statute of Westminster, 1931." The author first discusses the
representation of Canada in foreign countries.
He says the first of our representatives was
the agent in Paris, the Bon. Hector Fabre,
who resigned a senatorship to take a more
paying jobSome Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -and who remained
in Paris until he died. He was succeeded

time keep his family in Edmonton. He is
in Paris yet.

fault of bis that hie occupies a position which
I do nlot think anyone shouid have. We
boast that there bas been peace between this
country and the UJnited States for 1.15 years
or more. During most of that time we were
represented by the British am-bassadýors in
Washington. In those days, wlien friction
arose, what happened? 0f course, und-er tbe
Iaws of diplomacy we could not corne into
direct contact wîtb the United States: any
matter in dispute was referred to the British
Ambassador. Usually hie was a very clever
man. He would say, "Very well, 1I sball
make representations to the Home Government," and lie would make representations.
I suppose hie would al-ways add a postcript:
"Don't be in a hurry"ýSorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -and bis letter
would ha pigeonholed in the Foreign Office.
After a time, nothing having been done, bie
would be approached again, and hie would
say, "But 1 have not had any reply." Those
were the days of sailing ships, and communication with the Old Land .took a long time.
Meanwhile the people would have cooled
off a littie. But if they were insistent and
carne again and said, "We must bave an
answer," hie would write once more, and
finally hie would receive a reply stating tbat
the matter was under consideration.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
This gave the
people stili more tirne to cool off, and before
the correspondence was finished everybody
had forgotten what it was ail about, and we
had peace again for a number of years.
But now we are in direct contact with the
United States--of late we bave bad our
national brotber-in-law in Washington-and
we do not know at wbat time we may get
into difficulty. When we had that buffer, the
British Ambassador, we were kept out of
trouble. I asic honourable members of thie
flouse, have we had any trouble with the
United States in -the last 120 years?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The Alaskca
boundary question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That was not
trouble. There was a friendly settlement.
England always gave in.
Now, in Washington the British Ambassador
is going j ust as strong as ever. Australia also
has a Minister there, if you please. And so
has New Zealand. Tbey are ail representing
one man, the Ring of England.
Honý. Mr. DANDURAND: The King of
Australia.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How can you split
a king into six parts? There is also at
Washington a Minister from South Africa,
and one fromn the Irish Free State-and lie is
not the easiest one to bandle, eitlier. When
anytbing cornes up they go to President
Roosevelt, or to the Secretary of State, Cordeil
Hull, and make their representations.
If
they ail agree there is no trouble. But wbat
happens when they disagree? AIl that the
President or So.cretary of State can do then
is to write to the King and say: "You bave
six representatives here in Washington; one
ays one t'hing and another says sometbing
aise. What arn I to dýo?" And wh.at can
the Ring do? Wbose aide wouid lie take?
Perhaps hie would toss a coin to decide who
wvins. This shows tha-t one King should not
bave a number of representatives in one
capital at the saine time. One representative
ouglit to be enough. If lie cannot do the
work lie should be removed and another
appointed. That bas been donc before.
What we do need is something not so
"swell," but more practical and yielding sorne
financial return. We ouglit to have consuls
to do business for us. We bave trade coinmissioners, but tbey are without autliority
and are nlot recognized. I made a long speech
in the Senate to show that we need consuls,
but I was ail alone on my side, as usual.
Now I tome to wbat used to be calied
Colonial Conferences. Tbey are now styled
Imperial Conferences. Tbe new title is more
"sweil," and is supposed to make us like the
affairs better. It lias been said that at the
Conference* of 1926 we got a new Magna
Charta. Well, Mr. Justice Mignault did not
think we got a Magna Charta, and I do not
think we did. Mr. Bruce, the then Prime
Minister of Australia, was in Montreal after
the Conference and I was fortunate enough
to lunch witli him at Sir Henry Tliornton's
boeuse. After lunch, wlien we were srnoking,
I askad hum, "fias -there been, any change?"
He said: "No, not at ahl. Everything is just
the saine."
But let us see wbat Lord Balfour said. That
Conference appointed a committee, of wbich
Lord Balfour was chairman, to consider questions of inter-Imperial relations. Speakîng
of the "self-governing communities composed
of Great Britain and the Dominions," the
committee's report said:
They are autonomous communities within the
British Empire, equal in status, in no way
subordinate one to another in any aspect of
their domestic or external affairs, though
united by a common allegiance to the Crown,
and freely associated as members of the
British Commonwealth of Nations.
Well, that is nicely written, I must say.

Hoýn. Mr. DANDURAND:

I did flot use

Right Hon. Mr. MEG E:N;tIe
cxpressions arc mline. Tliey are perhaîîs more

APRIL 30, 1936
pointed and specific than the rather vague
and valueless language in which the thought
was expressed in the memorandum. But that
was its purpose. I therefore intend, first of
ail, te analyse the difference between this
legislation and that unconstitutional and autocratie stuff that we used to have to submit to.
I want to begin by painting out that in the
old legislation, as in this, the limitation of
parliamentary vote prevailed. Nothing else
is possible. The vote must be there. That
limitation prevailed in other sessions and
under other governments, just as it does today.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
By Order in
Council, under the peace, order and good government provision.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Money cannot be paid out witho.ut having been voted.
I shall come to the peace, order and good
government nonsense very soon. I emphasize
now that the same limitation prevails: the
money must be voted.
"But," says the honourable member, "the
great difference is this. Under this Bill you
vote it only for relief. It is intended that
it shall be for relief and nothing else; not
for those terrible things known as peace,
order and good government.
We write a
blank cheque for relief, but not for peace,
order and good government." That is a fair
expression of his position.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg pardon.
No money willi be spent until it is appropriated by a special bill now before the House
of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly
No money can be spent unless it is voted by
a special bill.
Hýon. Mr. DANDURAND:

And earmarked.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Earmarked,
of course.
This Bill merely pr.ovides that when the
money is voted it can be applied for relief,
but it contains no limitation in respect of
relief. It is a blank cheque in respect of
relief in the same sense that other bills were
blank cheques in respect of other things.
The honourable gentleman is entirely content
with blank-cheque legislation as long as it is
restricted to relief.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that.

I do not admit

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman could not admit that. If he
did he would be called to account by the
formulators of this humbug all over Canada.
Nevertheless, it is the fact.

Nýow I am going to examine the legislation. I suggest first of all that there is no
such restriction in it as has been intimated.
Under this legislation the Government can do
virtually anything at all. Let us read the
Bill. It says:
Whereas it is in the national interest that
Canada should co-operate with its provinces
and with certain organizations and individuals
in their endeavours to expand industrial
employment. to foster agricultural settlement
and re-settlement, to conserve and develop
natural resources and to construct and to
assist in the construction of public works,
for the purposes, amongst other things, of
further accelerating the recovery of trade,
industry and employment and thereby lessening the present governmental burdens consequent upon unemployment.
It can construct public works; it can establish settlement schemes; it can launch upon
agricultural settlement and any other plans
to develop the natural resources of Canada.
All these things it can do so long as, among
other things, they tend to the recovery of
trade. I put it to the ingenuity of any honourable member of this House to suggest
anything between heaven and earth that the
Government cannot do under that provision.
I speak pointedly now to the leader of the
Government.
Can he suggest to me anything between heaven and earth which the
Government cannot do because it is not embraced in that objective?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer is
that when we receive the consequential bill,
the Supply Bill containing the appropriations
which will come under the direction of this
Act, we shall see what are the limitations
of the present Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will tell
the honourable gentleman now the form in
which that Supply Bill will come: it will be
for the administration and supervision of
funds under the Act, and te assist in the
relief of unemployment. That is how it will
come. That is the way such a Bill always
comes. Under this anti-blank-cheque legislatien the Government is going to be empowered
te spend in any way which in the wealth of
its fancy it may deem to be right. Again I
challenge any member of this House te invent
in the depths of his resourcefulness any single
thing that will not come within the purview
of this legislation. It cannot be done. All
the academie talk we are hearing about the
immediate, intermediate and final objectives
of relief measures, and the intermediate study
of the subject, is just so much eye-wash to
keep us satisfied until something practical
takes place. The argument against blankcheque legislation is now exploded and is

seen to be the veriest humbug and insincerity.
It never had an atom of sincerity behind it.
Fifteen years ago I heard it stated with just
as great emphasis and with just as deep and
malodorous insincerity as I have heard it during the last year. I hope I have heard the
last of it.
Not
What is the situation in Canada?
more than two hours since I read that in
this city of Ottawa the number of those on
relief is from one thousand to two thousand
more than it was a year ago-an increase
of 5.5 per cent-and that the cost of sustaining that relief for the first three months
of this year as compared with the first three
months of last year has increased by 20-19
per cent. That is the situation existing three
or four months after the arrival on the scene
of North American affairs of this famous
treaty with the United States to which the
memorandum made reference, and three or
four months after the new arrangement with
Japan. Is Ottawa an exception? Is Montreal
in a better position? Is Quebec? Is Toronto?
There are multiplied numbers on relief and
a multiplied cost of relief under the aegis
of the settlement with Japan and the treaty
wit the United States, and we get learned
dissertations on what will come after the
subject is stidied and reviewed.
I bave no objection to this measure if it
will armi the Government with any autliority.
I am not going to complain about any of its
open features. Let it go. But I am one of
those who would like something to be done,
who would like some practical step to be
taken to better things in this Dominion. When
I heard the reference to a further study of
the subject my mind went to the province
of Alberta, where the leaders are yet studying tieir subject, and have gone just as
far towards solution as has the Government
bere. I should like the leader of the Government in this House, when he returns to his
colleagues, to tell them for goodness sake to
get down to business and do something which
will reduce the number of persons on relief,
or whici. if it will not reduce the number,
will at least reduce the cost, so that we shall
net have te stand here and observe close at
hand an increasing number of poor fellows
out of work and a still more rapidly increasing
cost of maintaining them, while we have
nothing but dissertations on an academic subject to take the place of a remedy.
In reply to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the right honourable gentleman I should like
to state that when this Government came
into office it faced the most important problem
which my right honourable friend and his
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEX.

colleagues had to deal with for five years.
The present Government made no promises.
It simply said that it would apply its best
efforts toward solving the problem with which
it was confronted. I do not know of any
country where the problem has been solved.
It will be some time before the unemployed
are reabsorbed into industry.
What will this Government endeavour to
do? It will try by divers methods to obtain
some results. It will do this not only by
co-operating with the provinces and the municipalities, but also through the instrumentality
of all employers of labour. The primary
function of the commission which has been
appointed and is to be organized will be to
devise some means of interesting many
thousands of manufacturers and other industrial and financial people in this problem
in order that a goal may be reached as soon
as possible. I have yet to meet the man
who can say that that will be within three
or six months.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That was said in
1930.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable the ex-Prime Minister in 1930, not
knowing exactly what was before him,, made
the statement-in good faith, I believe-that
the difficulty would soon be settled. I an
net sure that be did not say within six months.
But he discovered, as did Mr. Hoover, that
the distress was something more than a small
national affair; that it had seized and gripped
the whole world. We in Canada will do our
level best to improve conditions, and I only
hope we may achieve some results.

senators, I am sure the right honourable the
leader of the Opposition is sincere in expressing the hopeHon. Mr. LACASSE: You are more generous

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -that
concrete and definite may be done to relieve
the unemployed or to lessen their numbers.
I wonder, though, if we are not entitled to
take into consideration anything that has
happened during the last three or four months
with respect to certain matters to which the
right honourable the leader of the Opposition
has referred. In another place, out of the
245 elected representatives of the people,
there are about 180 who presumably were to
do certain things promulgated or suggested by
a certain party in a general election held
some months ago. What co-operation and
assistance have the unemployed people of
Canada received at the hands of those who

APRIL 30, 1936

Let us get down to brass tacks. 1 arn quite

demonstration as we have witnessed under

dissatisfied Opposition has been delaying the
measure and preparing an argument for future
use.
I had hoped thet in the course of the next
day or two I could obtain some concrete
figures which rnight show that the unem.ployment situation in many other places is not
comparable to that in Ottawa. As a ýresident
of Ottawa I think there is a reason for that.
But these figures eau be secured by -the right
honourable leader on the other side, and any
other honoureble member, just as well as by
myself.
If we are all sincerely desirous of puttiug
the Governent in a position to do something
for unemployed men and women, as I hope
and think we are, let us get behind this legislation; let us give the Government an opportunity to put it into effeet and have something
doue.

The honourable leader of the Bouse has
said that the United States agreement would
help ta diminish uneanployment, Western
newspapers tell their readers that the agreement will be of assistance ta dairy producers
and cattie raisers. It wilI not benefit grain
growers. And it is said that production costs
will be reduced bec-ause implements wili- be
imported from the United States; but if that
is done a number of factories in Ontario and
elsewbere will have ta lay off muen.
My honourable friend has said that industrial revival will take care of many people
at prese'nt not ernployed;. In Winnipeg,
which is the third manufacturing city of
Canada, a number o£ factories have carried
staffs larger than they need; sa, there wo*uld
have ta be a very large in-crease in produc-.
tion before it became neeessary ta add ta
personnel.
It has been suggested that the Government
should seriously consider lowering the age at
wbich people become eligible for aId age
pensions. That may sound unorthodox in a
Bouse ol this kind, but candidly 1 do flot
see how men who were fartyfive or fifty in
1930 can ever 'hope te 'be taken back into
industry. In 1929 twenty per cent of the
people employed in Winnipeg were rallway
workers. There is nothing in Vhis legisiation
that helps the elderly unemployed in the
least.
The people of the West ask that the whole
burden of relief be taken over by the
Government. If t-hat is not done there will
be defaul't on tbe bonds of other provinces
besides Alberta.
Unless the Government
assists Manitoba, that province will bave ta
default; and if no 'money is lent to Winnipeg. that city too will have to default.
The honourable senator from Parkdaie
(Hon. Mr. Murciock) made what sounded
ta me like a political speech. It reminded
me of the aid days when I was in the Legislature. However, that is not the point about
which I am concerned. The important thing
is that ini Winn.ipeg there have been 6,000
heads of families on relief for a long time,
and relief eosts are going Up. At the, outset unemployed people needed ta be given
only food; laVer on tbey reqtbired shelter,
and then clothes; and now it has become
necessary ta replace 'household utensils.
Many a man in Winnipeg whe> three years
ago said ha would not go on relief has been
forced ta take that step. And I want ta
tell this Bouse that the unemployment outlook in that city is worse than it was a
year agio.
12745-154

My honourable friend froan Parkdale also
said that the Government, had so far not
been able ta do what it wanted to, do. But
it eould have proceeded. under the aid legislation, up ta the 31st of March, and in fact
it did niake use of that old legislation ta
some extent, as the honourable leader of the
Government pointed out.
Here are some questions I sbould like ta,
ask. What are the property awners going ta
do in those cities whicb cannat carry the laad
any longer? What plans has tbe Government
for relieving unemployment among aIder
people wha have got out of work in the last
five or six years? If you wîll pardon a
personal reference, I may say that I am the
president of a construction company. Just
before I left, Winnipeg the manager of the
company tld me he could build a certain
number af bouses in Winnipeg if ha were
able ta get boan-s. Someone may say that
the Government bas a bousing secheme in
aperation, but the trouble i.s that the people
out there find the terms for borrowing are
too severe. The only way in which a housing
scheme can be made effective in Western
Canada is for the Government ta lend the
money direct, and if that were done more
employment wauld be made available than
through any other ebannel.
My real purpose in rising was ta warn the
Goveroment that it must carry the whole load
of unemployrment relief if tbe credit of
Western provinces and muicipalities is ta
be saved. Lt may he that an incerease in trade
will bring. about some increase in employment. Apparently tbe pTesent Administration
thinks tbat the wbole problem could be solved
by expanding trade. That may ha true, a.nd
I hope it is; but I do flot see how we can
have increased trade when Germany is arming
ta the teeth, whien France is doing the same,
when Great Britain is spending mare money
on armaments this year tban ever before,
whien Russia, Italy and Japan are all enlarging their armies and navies. How ean we
build up business with Germany, for instance,
wben tbe people af that country know that
they lost tbe last war because their countrymen who stayed at home were starved almost
ta deatb? They are determined not ta be
caught in that position again; so they are
stimulating home production. I tbink it must
be realized that no matter how strongly we
hold ta tbe belief that decreased tariffs will
bring increased. trade, wbicb is apparently
what the present Government believes, the
tbeory will not work out satisfactorily with
world conditions as they exist at the present
time.

SENATE

228

It is our duty to try to realize the unfortunate position in which unemployed Canadians are to-day. If we do not do something
for them they will be ruined. Young men
and young women are growing up without
hope. I know of many of them, and know
how unpromising the future appears to them.
A farmer friend of mine who cultivates 1,900
acres of land used to employ twenty men on
his farm at this time of year. A week ago
he was in my office and said to me: "Jack, I
am buying a tractor. With it one man nan
do the work of seven." So he will require
six fewer workers on that one farm. That
kind of thing is going on all over the country,
in factories and on farms.
I hope the Government will realize the
situation that confronts the Western Provinces. The Prime Minister of Manitoba, the
Minister of Public Works and the Provincial
Treasurer are now in the city looking for
money to finance relief; I understand the
Prime Minister of Saskatchewan was here a
few days ago, and the Prime Minister of
British Columbia before that; and I have
heard that the Prime Minister of Ontario is
here or hereabouts to-day. I am not concerned so much about what these provincial

remains that the only way to handle the
relief problem is to have the Dominion
Government assume the whole burden. If
that is not donc, the credit of the provinces
and municipalities, and finally of the
Dominion, will go down.

INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adijourned debate on the inquiry by the Hon.
Mr. Hardy:
That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the fact that the year 1937
marks the 100th anniversary of the rising in

Upper Canada (now Ontario) under William
Lyon Mackenzie, which with the concurrent
one in Lower Canada, directly led to the
establishment of responsible government in
Canada, and that he will inquire of the Government as to whether it will give some official
recognition

thereto.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: The answer
of the Government to the inquiry by the
honourable gentleman from Leeds reads as
follows:
Although recognizing the truth of the statement of fact set forth in this inquiry, which
in all justice should have contained also the
name of Louis Joseph Papineau, the Government as at present constituted is precluded from taking any initiative in this
matter as suggested or implied by the honourable gentleman's question.
That is the attitude of the Government, but
it does not preclude me from expressing my
personal views. I have listened with considerable interest to the speeches of my
honourable frien.d. from Leeds and my right
honourable friend who leads the other side
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
The events of 1837 have always profoundly
interested me, and I seize this opportunity
to discuss them.
Some time between 1763 and 1789 there
was in one of the departments of the British
Governnent an astute gentleman who wrote
to the Home Secretary drawing his attention
to the danger of according the colony of CanHe
ada any measure of self-government.
said: "If you do grant the colony any kind
of representative government you will be in
danger of its breaking away in the near or
distant future. You should make up your
mind to govern the colony from London. If
you do not do so, it will soon be your colony
no longer." Up to that time colonies, not
only of Great Britain, but of other countries as well, were acquired to be exploited.

APRIL 30, 1936
On October 20, 1789, William Wynd.ham
Grenville, a cousin of William Pitt,' in hie
capacity of Seoretary of State for the Home
Department, addressed a dispatch to Lord
Dorchester, the then Governor General of
Canada, informing him "of the intention of
Hie Majesty's servants, with respect to the
plan to be proposed in Parliament for altering the present Constitution of Canada." I
am quoting Doughty and -McArthur'e Constitutional Documents at page 969. With the
dispatch Grenville sent a "Discussion of
petitione and couniter-petitionS Te change of
government in Canada." These petitions related to a modification of the Act of 1774.
In the Discussion I find this passage:
It may perbape he justly doubted whether
any forma of administration which could now
bc established would prevent the separation of
so great and distant a dominion after it should
have arrived at a certain point of extension
and improvement.
But the real question now to be decided je,
wbat syetemn je best calculated to remove thîs
event to a distant period and to render the
connection, in the interval, advantageous to
the Mother Country witbout oppression or
injury to the colony?
A little furthcr on is thie paragraph:
The establishment of a separate and local
Legielature in a distant province under any
form. or model which can be adopted for the
purpose, leade so evidently to habituai notions
of a distinct intereet. and to the existence of
a virtual independence as to many of the moit
important pointe of government, that it seeme
naturally to prepare the way for an entire
separation, whenever other circumetances shall
bring it forward.
In spite -of these misgivings the Constitutional Act of 1791 was passed. Grenville and
the other gentleman to whomn I have referred,
whose name I do not recaîl at the moment,
were quite logical. Nevertheless an attempt

was answerable to the Governor. Above ahl
wae the Governior, and hie was directly under
the control of the Colonial Secretary. In
fact, down to 1841 the sole authority was to
be found in Downing Street.
It soon became evident that the gentlemen
to whom 1 have referred were correct in their
surmise that there would be a desire for
real representative governiment, and before
long the struggle began.
Lord Durham, who came here in 183,
states in hie report:

2%~

It ie difficuit to understand how any English
statesman could have imagined that representative and irresponsible government could be
successfully combined.... It has neyer been
very clearly explained what are the Imperial
intereste which require this complete nullification of representative government.
That state of mind in Downing St.reet was
ail the more surprising since the desire to
control the New England Colonies had
brought about the American Revolution.
Speakin-g of the Executive Council, Lord
Durham said:
The real advisers of the Governor have in
f act been the Executive Council, and an institution more singularly calculated for preventing the responsibility of the acte of goverfiment resting on anybody can hardly be
imagined.
Apparently, free institutions were flot an exportable commodity.
The situation was bound to end in an explosion of some kind. The Lower Canada
Aseembly had sent a list of grievances to
London, and a royal commission consisting
of Lord Gosford, Sir Charles Grey and Sir
George Gipps was appointed to inquire into
them. While they suggested some reforme,
they clearly reported against a responeible
executive. Lord John Russell, acting upon
that report, but going further than it recommended, suhmitted to the British Parliament
resolutions giving favourable answers to some
of the demande. But one resolution, dealing
with responsible government, read as follows:
That while it je expedient to improve the
composition of the Executive Council in Lower
Canada. it je unadvisable to subject it to the
responsibility demanded by the House of
Aseembly of that province.
While that was in reply to the appeal from
the Assembly of Lower Canada, it also applied
to the sixuilar appeal from Upper Canada.
In bringing hie resolutions before the House
of Commone, Lord John Russell said:
That the demand for an Executive Council,
similar to the Cabinet which existe in Great
Britain, sets up a dlaima for what je incompatible with the relations which ought to exiet
between the colony and the Mother Country.
And hie added:
These relations require that Hie Majesty
sh.ould be repreeented in the colony not by
m!istere, but by a governor sent out by the
King, and reeponeible to the Parliament of
G'reat Britain.
The resolutione authorized the eeizing of
funde in the bande of the Receiver General
of Lower Canada and the applying of them
to certain purposes, for which the Assemhly
would flot grant them unlees reforme were
efiected.

SENATE

Mr. Hume, who spoke after Lord John
Russell in the House of Commons, expressed
fear that a war might ensue. He said:
If the Canadians did not resist they would
deserve the slavish bonds which the resolution
of Lord John Russell would prepare for them.
Hume's prediction came truc. A formidable
agitation developed, and indignation meetings
were held from one end of Quebec to the
other. There was a similar and concurrent
agitation throughout Upper Canada.
Warrants for treason were issued against leaders
of the popular Assembly in Lower Canada.
Then carne the uprising, and at last British
authorities had to take notice of what was
going on.
They sent out to Canada as Governor a
statesman. Lord Durham, who had played
an important part in the public life of Great
Britain and who in the House of Commons had
advocated advanced reforms. Of his recommendation that the French majority in Lower
Canada be sacrificed by a merging of the
peoples of the two Canadas I wsill only say
that he puîrposely advised a cruel step, but
he considered it to bc necessary in order
tiat within a generation or two the French
Canadians might be transformed into part
of a big Anglo-Canadian population in the
united province.
Lord Durham suggested a confederation of
the British North American colonies. Had
lie lived until 1867 be would have been surprised and happy to sec his dream come true;
and had his life been spared for another
thirty years, tiat is, until 1897, te would no
doubt have been a witness to the fact that at
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebralion tbis proud Dominion of Canada was
represented by a Canadian of French origin,
whose name was Wilfrid Laurier.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That effort of
his to merge the two races and wipe ont
the separate identity of one of them proved
abortive. However, J will net say more along
that line, for I intend to limit my remarks
this evening to the uprising in the two provinces, and its consequences.
Speaking of Upper Canada, Lord Durham
said, at page 111 of his report:
It cannot be denied, indeed, that the continuance of the many practical grievances,
whicl I have described as subjects of complaints. and. above all, the determined resistance to such a systemn of responsible government as would give the people a real control
nver its owii destinies, have, together with the
irritation
duced a
look witlh
Hon. Mr.

eaused by the late insurrection, inlarge portion of the population to

their neighbours in the United States, under
a perfectly
government;

free and eminently responsible
and in despair of obtaining such

benefits. under their present institutions, to
desire the adoption of a republican constitution, or even an incorporation with the
American union ... I cannot but express my
belief that this is the last effort of their
exhausted patience, and that the disappointment of their hopes, on the present occasion,
will destroy forever their expectation of good
resulting from British connection.
If now frustrated from their expectations
and kept in hopeless subjection to rulers irresponsible to the people, they will at best only
await, in sullen prudence, the contingencies
whieh may render the preservation of the
province dependent on the devoted loyalty of
the great mass of its population.
Lord Durham was succeeded as Governor
Ceneral by Charles Poulett Thompson, the
future Lord Sydenham. In a letter addressed
to a friend in England in November, 1839,
which appears in Scrope's Life of Lord
Sydenham, page 148, after referring to the
situation in Lower Canada he said':
In Upper Canada the case, as it appears to
nie, is widely different. The state of things
bere is far iworse than I had expected. The
couiitry is split into factions animated by the
most deadly hatred of each other. The people
have got into the habit of talking so much
of separation tlhat they begin to believe in it.
'Tlie Constitutional party is as bad or worse
than the other, in spite of all tleir professions of loyalty.
'ilie finances are more
deranged than we believed even in England;

the deficit, 75.000 pounds a year, more than
equal to the inconie. All publie works suspended. Emîigration going on fast from the
province.

Every

W'hen I look to the state of
government. and to the departimental administration of the province, instead of being
surprised at the condition in which J find it,
J ans only astonislhed it lias endured se long.

lialf what it was.

I know that, much as J dislike Yankee institutions and rule, I would not have fouglt against
them, wliiel thousands of tliese poor fellows,
whoin the Compact call "rebels," did, if it was
onîly to keep

up such a government

as they

got.
As the Governor needed the assent of the
Upper Canada House of Assembly to the
union. and the assent of the special Council
established in Lower Canada after the suspension of its constitution, ho wrote in
December, 1839:
It is impossible to describe to you the difficulties I have had to contend with to get this
matter settled as it bas been in the Assembly.
I owe my success altogether to the confidence
whici
the Refori party have reposed in me
personally.

the

manner

in

ewhii tlhey have acted with nie. A dissolution
would have been greatly to thîeir advantage,
because there is no doubt they would have lad
a great maajority in the next Assembly; and it
must have been nost galling to them to see
nie, as well as themaselves, opposed by a num-

ber of the place-liolders without my turning
theni out. But they gave up all these con-

APRIL 30, 1936
siderations (and in this country where the
feeling of hatred to the Family Compact is
intense, they are not light) and went gallantly
through with me to the end.
At last there was a new constitution, the
Union Act of 1840, bringing with it responsible
government.
In the first session Robert
Baldwin was called te the Executive, but he
resigned, dissatisfied with its constitution. In
the session of 1841 he moved resolutions
asserting the principle of responsible government. As my honourable friend from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) bas said, the Provincial
Secretary, S. B. Harrison, moved in amendment resolutions which were unanimously
adopted, one of which reads as follows:
That in order to preserve between the
different branches of the provincial parliament that harmony which is essential to the
peace, welfare and good government of the
province, the chief advisers of the representative of the Sovereign, constituting a provincial
administration under him, ought to be men
possessed of the confidence of the representatives of the people, thus affording a guarantee
that the well-understood wishes and interests
of the pedple, which our gracious Sovereign
has declared shall be the rule of the provincial
government, will, on all occasions, be faithfully
represented and advocated.
Not only was this resolution approved by
Lord Sydenham, but it seems to be well
established that it was drafted by him.
Now I would ask my honourable friends to
bring together and compare side by side Lord
John Russell's resolution of March, 1837,
which curtly refused responsible government,
and the resolution of September, 1841, of the
House of Assembly under the union of the
two Canadas, which clearly recognized responsible government. What had been the
cause of this sudden reversal of policy after
years of obstinate refusal, if it was not the
rising in Lower and Upper Canada? The
principle contained in that resolution which
was proclaimed by the Assembly had te be
applied in practice to all the legislative enactments and all the actions of the Executive.
It was not all plain sailing. The machinery
to be set up as representing responsible government had to be set in motion. May I not
affirm that the credit for bringing about uniform and regular practice is due te the reformers who led the fight during the first
years of the union of the Canadas?
A monument bas been erected on Parliament Hill te Baldwin and Lafontaine. I confess that I should have liked to see the figure
of Lord Elgin appearing between them,
because it was due te his understanding of
what the relations between the Governor and
bis Executive must bc that after 1848-49 the
principle of responsible government was carried
into every act of the Government.

I have another regret te voice. It is
that the pioneers and the leaders in the
struggle which gained for us responsible government-Papineau and Mackenzie-had not
been first honoured by the erection of a
monument te their memory as a just testimonial fron a grateful people. They won
for us the eherished liberties which we enjoy, and-may I emphasize th.is fact-they
won for the Crown the affection of a nation
which was drifting away in sheer desperation.
Why this neglect on the part of our contemporaries? Is it because these men were
called rebels and that a price was put upon
their heads? According to all I have learned
from my reading of the traditional doctrine
of the right to rebel, it would appear that
the sole justification ie success. Success
implies that the wiIl of the people bas
asserted itself. Yet the will of the vast
majority of the people may be thwarted by
an armed force. lu 1837 a vast majority
of the people in the two Canadas were undoubteday with Papineau and Mackenzie, and
although they were temiporarily held in check,
they won their fight for free institutions.
If they are te be judged by the most severe
orthodox doctrine on the right of rebellion,
surely success is their justification.
It is my fervent hope that the present
generation will express its wish that a monui1 te
ment be erected on Parliament
these two indomitable tribunes of the people,
and that the names of the men who mounted
the scaffold .te expiate the crime of having
loved their country too well will be inscribed thereon. As a poet bas aptly said,
"There are scaffolds that are pedestals."
Hon. RUFUS POPE: Honourable senators,
I am delighted to have listened te the oration
delivered by my honourable friend opposite.

Go through -the whole history of the world

1837 the process of government, of the administration of public affairs, had been changed
very mauch What was needed to, bring about
redress was flot rebellion, not fthe action of
men of extreme views, but reasonable
pressure.
I de. mit care te whoin you would put

lli for these people
d.oes not appeal to me when we have forgotten to raise monuments to, many men
who played important parts in the development of the Dominion of Canada. Those
rebels are f0 have a monument, you say.
If they are, I would suggest that, as the

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members. the remarks of my honourable friend from Bedford (Hlon. Mr. Pope)

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable members,
in closing the debate may I say that I a;n
quite satisfied witli the decision of the Government as sfated by the leader of the House.
I foresaw from tlic beginning that the right
honourable Prime Minister, being also a
grandson of the sô-callcd rebel, would be
placed in an invidious position if bis Adîministration inserted an item in the Estimates
f0 eover the cost of a monument to bis grandfather. I think I can, ho'wever, assure this
honourable House that a memorial f0. William Lyn
Mackenzie will be erccted in
Onfario in 1937 or 1938. 1 trust that some of
our French Canadian friends in the province
of Quebec will similarly honeur their great
leader Louis Joseph Papineau.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY.

I 'arn sorry the right bonourable leader on
flic other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meigben) is
nof in bis seat. I wish to, fhank him for the
kind way in wbicha be deait with my rcmarks.
He said I had nef jusfificd the rebellion. But
I ws ai. a disadvantage yesterdiiy, for had I
recited the long lisf of the people's grievances
in 1837, I should have run' counfer te the
very stafement I made at tbe eutsef of my
remarks, thaf I did net desire te fouch on
any confroversial subjeet which might arouse
ill-fccling. Howcver, I tlîank my honourable
leader for baving se ably corne f0 my assistance to-nighf.
Ycstcrday
my honourable friend from
Picton (Hon. Mr. Tanner) told us about
Joseph Howc's strugglc for responsible gevernmenf. We all knowv thaf he was one of
the greafcst of our early Canadians; and in
1836 was figbting for responsible gevernment
in Nova Stofia, just as Mackenzie and
Papineau were flghting for if in Ontario and
Q uebec in. 182.
As my honourable friend

before Ont.ario reached fhe saine goal.
But I disagree with my honourable friend's
statement that there was no rebellion in
Nova Scotia. Truc, the Nova Scotians did
nef actually rebel. They wcre canny Scofs,
and knew whaf ivas geing on in Ontario, thoir
leaders bcing in constant communication witb
the leaders in this, province. Cerfainly they
were nef geing te spcnd their five-shilling

whcn their brothers in Ontario and Qucbec

Nova Scotia fook
advanfagc of what was donc in the central
prevines,-and they have 'beien doing se ever
since. I adm.ire them aIl the more for if.
There neyer was a time when our Nova
Scotian friends did net know the very best
way -te fiîrn a bargain in their faveur. The
sanie remarks a.ppl'y te New Brunswick. OS
course, I arn speaking jocularly about fhe
thriftiness of our Maritime friends.
lt is enly fair for me te point ouf that af
the beginning of fthe ninetcenth century streng
British garrisens werc maintained in New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and the authoritics could have crushcd a rising within
twenty-feur heurs. I do net think our Nova
Setian friends can plume fhemrselves on
being Simon Pure loyalists, for iîndoubtedly
in those turbulent days nine-tenths of the
people of Nova Scotia were eager for respensible geverniment. They simply waifed te -e
wlîaf would happen te the fcllews in Ont-ario
before they thernselves took extrerne action.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
That will be great
news for Nova Scotia.

APRIL 30, 1936
Hon. LOUIS COTE: Honourable mambers,
yesterday I listened with great interest to the
speech of the honourable anember from, Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy), and to-night 1 bave followed wi'th close attention the well-documented address by the honourable leader of
the Goverament (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
I associate with the rebellion of 1837 not
only its leaders in the two provinces, but
also those who for twenty-five or thirty years
before carried on the fight for responsible
government in the Legislatures of Upper and
Lower Canada, and I think we should pay
tribute to their untiring efforts.
Personally I have neyer regarded the leaders
of the rebellion of 1837 and their associates
as rehels. Reading the history of those days,
I long ago came to the conclusion that their
act was flot a repudiation of allegiance to their
King, but rather an expression of the anger,
and the justified anger, of men born to he
free and eager to enjoy responsible government.
I fully appreciate the propriety of the Govecpressed through its
ernment's decision as11
leader in this House to-night when he said
thait the Administration as constituted could
not take part in any manifestation of approbation of the leaders of the rebellion of 1837.
However, I think we who to-day enjoy to
tihe fullest extent the bounty of British parliamenitoiry institutions would be ungrateful if
we were 'to refuse our personal tribute to
those whose toil and sacrifice brought about
the happy condition which prevails to-day.
I have made these brief remarks because
I did not think it at all fit#ting that the words
of gratitude and admiration which. we owe
to those men of a century ago should corne
only from one side of this House.

INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, before the Orders of the Day
are called I desire to give to my honourable
friend from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) an

233

angwer to the inquiry he made at the last
sitting. I .may inform the honourable gentleman that the Government bas sold to the
Ellermnan & Bucknall Steamship Company,
Limited, Commonwealth and Dominion Line,
Limited, and the New Zealand Shipping
Company, Li.mited, the ten remaining vessels
of the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine which have heen operating in the
Australia and New Zealand service. It is
the intention of the new owners to scrap
these vessels and to provide faster and more
suitable boats for the Australian services,
which they have agreed to maintain for a
period of at Ieast five years without any subsidy. They have also agreed to take over
the staffs ünd crews of the Canadian Goverument Marchant Marine, afloat and ashore.
Merchant
Government
The Canadian
Marine management having advised the Government that the vessels in question were
neaeing the end of their usefulness, and that
an expenditure of between five and six
million d-ollars would be neoessary for the
construction of new hoats if the services were
to be maintained, 'the Government considered
it advisable to dispose of this residue of the
original fleet of more than sixty chips constructed by Canada> after tihe Great War.
The sale was recom-mended by the Board of
Directors of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine (who ara also the Trustees of
the Canadian National Railways) by resolution of the Board of Apoeil 18 Iast.
While the operation of these vessels in
1935 had resulted in a srnll opersting surplus, there has been an annual operating
deficit from 1921 to 1934, inclusive, the total
operating defirit over that period having
amounted to $11,064,725. In view of these
heavy deficits and the necesity for further
extensive capital expenditures if the Australian services were to, be maintained, the
Government conside.red it in the public intcrest to, accapt the offer of these Australian
shipping firms, who, as already stated, are
undertaking to provide an improved service
witiout subsidy.
The ships which are being disposed of
should not be confused with the Canadian
National (West Indies) Steamships, Limite,
which are a saparate concern. It is the
present intention -of the Government to
continue the operation of these vessels.
I desire also to lay on the Table a copy
of the form, of agreement of sale, and, a copy
of the Order in Council concurng in the
sale.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What was the
price?

234

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will give the
names of the ships and the price of each.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

are not totalled here. The names of the
ships and the sale price of each are as follows:

I am under the impression that yesterday
one of those ships was sunk. If the contract of sale had not been signed we should
have the advantage of the insurance. I understand that the Canadian Government Merchant Marine sets aside a fund to cover such
losses.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I thank the honourable leader of
the Government for the information he bas
just furnished to the House. Though I do not
claim to be a shipping expert, I am amazed
that the Government sold these ships at such
an extraordinarily low price. AltogetherHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg my bonourable friend's pardon, but if ho intends to
speak on this matterHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

ask him to give notice, so I may be in a
position to answer him.
"Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The price appears to me to be extraordinarily low, in view
of the details which I intend to give to the
House in a moment. I must congratulate
Mr. Reford and his associates on their business shrewdness in negotiating such an advantageous bargain.
I may say that Mr.
Reford approached the former Prime Minister and also Dr. Manion with an offer to
purchase the ships, but his price was so very
low that the Government declined to sell. I
have been informed by two good steamship
men that the ships could have been sold in
the open market for double the price paid
bhy Mr. Reford, and that even on a scrap
basis a much botter price could have been
obtained.
Hon.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would again
remind my honourable friend that it is somewhat irregular to make a statement which
may Jead to a debate when there is nothing
before the Chair.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The ries of
this House are so broad and elastic, as compared with those of the other House, where
I bave had more experience, that I consulted
the Clerk to know what latitude might be
expected on such an occasion as this, and he
told me it would be all rigit for me to proceed. In the other House under similar circumstances I should be out of order. However, as the honourable leader is invoking
the rigid rule of the other House, I am perfectly willing to accept his suggestion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no, I am
not changing the rule. I would remind ny
honourable friend that no debate is in order
on an inquiry. If on asking his question he
had given notice that he would call attention
to the subject-matter of his inquiry, he would
now be in order. He did not do so. Across
the Chamber he put to me his question. I
have just answered it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman opposite if he would
be good enough to give notice, as I also have
something to say about the matter?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman from Alma was out of order, and
now the honourable leader of the House is
also out of order, as I have the floor for the
time beinig, with the leave of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; I have
called the honourable gentleman to order.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable senator from Alma give notice that he
intends to call attention to the subject-matter
of his inquiry?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am just
going to do that. With the consent of the
House, I should like to specak to this matter
to-morrow, and I now give notice accordingly.

INDIAN BILL
CONSIIYERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 4, an
Act to amend the Indian Act.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-laws for preventing diseases;
laws rcspecting motor vehirles:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, there was one thing upon which
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and- I agreed when we were discussing -this Bill on the second reading, namely,
that the second clauseshould be redrafted. It
has since been found that section 69 of the
Act, which covers the matter contained in
section 2 of this Bill, should he redirafted coinpletely.
Will my honourable friend from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) move
for me that section 2 read as follows?
Section sixty-nine of the said Act is repealed
and the f ollowing is substituted therefor:
(1) The Superintendent General, subject to
the approval of the Governor in Council, may,
as in this section provided, inake regulations
which, upon publication thereof in the Canada
Gazette, shahl apphy with the saine force as if
the ternis of such regulations had been herein
enacted.
(2) The regulations niay provide for appropriate penalties, not exceeding, as to imprisonme~nt, thrcte murths, anid not exceeding, as to
fine. one hundred dollars, for violation or nonobservance of any provision of any regulation.

235

(3) Without restricting the generality of
the provisions of subsection one of this section, the regulations may provide, inter alia,
for the incorporation by reference, as part of
such regulations, of any specifie and indicated
law or regulation of and in force wîthin any
province of Canada, and in particular, and
whether or not by way of the incorporation
by reference of provincial laws or regulations,
such regulations may provide:
(a) with relation to Indians within the province of Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta or
within the Territories, as the case may be, or
to Indians in such parts of such provinces
and Territories as to hini seenis expedient,
that laws either in the samne ternis as, or in
like ternis to, or in other ternis than, those in
force in such provinces and territories, respectively, with relation to gamne in general or to
specific gaine, shahl apply, upon publication
thereof in the Canada Gazette, with the saine
force as if enacted in this Act, to such Indians
as such regulations shail prescribe;
(b) for the de'struction of noxious weeds
and the prevention of the breeding, spreading
or prevalence of any insect, pest or disease
which may or might be destructive of or injurious to vegetation on Indian reserves;
(c) governing the speed and operation of
vehicles on highways within Indian reserves.
As honourable senators wilh notice, the
clause of the Bill, as it came to us froni the
other House, stated:
The Superintendent General niay fromn tume
to tume by public notice declare that the
regulations in force in any province fbr preventing the spread of any insect, pest, or
disease destructive to vegetation, and ail that
such regulations may prescribe, shall apply to
Indians and Indian reserves within such province or such parts thereof as to bun seems
expedient.
As niy right honourable friend apthy remarked,
the Superintendent General was given the
righit to dechare that regulations arising out
of the legislation in force in any province
should apply to the Indian reserves in that
province. 1 think my right honourable friend
was correct in stating that this declaration did
not convey any right, or even any sanction; it
was purely and, simply a declaration. Besides,
the clause was weak in that it allowcd the
Superintendent to declare that provincial laws
should apply to a reserve, whereas it is for
the Federal Parliament to enact laws thus
applicable.
The justification or excuse for
the drafting of this Bill is that it is but an
amiendaient to section 69 of the Act, which,
without even appropriating the sanction
necessary in order to niake themn the law
of Canada, provided that the Superintendent
should have the right to declare parts of the
provincial law applicable to Indian reserves.
These weaknesses in the legishation are
cured by the suggested amendnient which I
ask my honourable friend to move.

236

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I move that this
amendment be adopted. I hope it is all right.
To me it is just as clear as mud.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Chairman
will please explain.
The CHAIRMAN: The motion is to strike
out all the words following the word "is" in
line 15, page 1 of the Bill, and to substitute
the amendment which has been read. I do
not suppose I need read it again. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the amendment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendment recognizes not only that the Bill was
very poorly drafted, but also that the amended
section of the Act was subject to the same
infirmity. The amendment repeals and supersedes the original section.
In the re-enactment the draftsman, I think,
has skirted just as closely as he could the
same error, but with.his usual skill, I suppose,
he has avoidýed it. I would far rather that the
Superintendent General, subject to -the approval
of the Governor in Council, should be empowered to enact the regulations, and that
it should be left to us to fix the penalties in
our enactments.
Then the Superintendent,
if he liked the legislation of a province, could
quote it in his regulations and make it a
Dominion regulation. He does not need to
do it by reference at all.
However, I do not press my preference. The
proposed amendment is a vast improvement
over the Bill as it stood.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope the remarks of my right honourable friend will
reach the Superinteudent, and that he will act
under these suggestions.
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Section 2 as amended was agreed to.
Sections 3 to 6, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 7-selling intoxicants:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why is subsection 2 of section 126 repealed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With respect to
clauses 7 to 12 I sec that the explanation is
as follows:
The amendments as contained in these sections repeal the provisions giving a moiety of
the fines imposed to the informer. Various
requests have been made to the department
for the repeal of these provisions.
It is
claimed that informers are likely to be over
zealous in undertaking prosecutions, having in
view the prospect of some monetary interest,
which lessens respect for the impartial administration of the law. It is realized that while
such provisions may have been considered
necessary to ensure vigilance for the enforcement of the provisions of the Act, such proHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

visions are generally considered objectionable.
With the increased police supervision now
prevailing, it is not considered that such
provisions are longer required.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The last
sentence is the important one. It may be
correct. But what is this increased police
supervision? To take away the incentive that
is now given to informers who keep a watch
over the use of liquor on Indian reserves is
a pretty serious thing. Everyone knows how
liquor would flow on the reserves if there
were not very careful supervision. Is the
explanation that the Mounted Police are
doing the work very much better than the
former police did?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not complete information as to that. The department
has its agents on these reserves, and I suppose
it must rely on the advice received from them
as to the undesirability of giving informers a
share of the fines. Sometimes a great injury
may be donc to the public morals of a band by
the. making of a serious denunciation with
regard to a very trivial offence. I know that
during my practice at the Bar in Montreal I
would hear now and then considerable recriminations because of ugly charges arising
ont of some small act that technically violated
the law, but had donc no harm to anyone.
There is something to be said either for or
against this view, but in any event the department states that because of increased police
supervision it is no longer necessary to continue paying part of the fines to informants
who lay charges.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am entirely
in agreement with that if there is such police
supervision as to do away with the necessity
of putting a premium on the giving of information; but I should like to know where
that increased police supervision comes from.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Has the right
honourable gentleman not read in the papers
lately that the provincial governments have
entrusted this matter to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police?
Right
what?

Hon.

Mr.

MEICHEN:

Entrusted

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The matter of looking after whiskey. That has been taken from
the jurisdiction of the provincial police.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know. The
provincial police have been virtually superseded in most provinces. The first step in
that direction was taken a good many years
ago, I think about 1919. and I know that the
change has been for the better. I hope it is
truc that the Mounted Police are able to supervise Indýian reserves without having to be

MAY 5, 1936
assisted by informers, but I want my 'inquiry
on the record because I arn afraid a great
many policemen will be required- if the
Mounted Police are to keep a watch over ail
liquor transactions on Indian reserves.
Hon. Mr>. DANDURAND: I shall give my
riglit bonourable friend an answer when we

AND) DISCUSSION

On t-le niotice of inquiry:
By Hon. Mr. Ballantyne:

That he will caîl t-be attention of t-be Senate
t-o the reported sale of certain sbips owned
or cont-rolled by thbe Canadian Governrnent
Merchant Marine, Limited, and inquire of the
Government as to t-be price paid and t-he terrns
of t-be sale.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would suggest t-o my honourable friend t.bat lie postpone bis discussion on t-bis inquiry until tmorrow or next -week. I bave some informat-ion to give t-o lim in answer to bis inquiry,
but it is sonewliat lengtby and, I t-hink,
sbould be preseinted in a suinmarized form.
As I b-ave oot yet bad time t-o go into it,
I sbould be glad if my bonourable firiend
would act on my suggestion and postpone
t-be discussion. But of course I arn in bis
bands.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: I sbould very

I arn leaving t-be city and sball not bave

238

SENATE

because in the meantime I have had an
opportunity oif reading the agreement; and
after reading it I must say the transaction
does not appear in so favourable a light as
it did at first blush.
May I say at the outset that I am greatly
surprised that the Government should make
a sale of this magnitude by Order in Council.
We have all heard condemnation of
the previous Government for allegedly doing
toc much by Order in Council. Here is a
big national question, affecting the maritime
trade of not only Canada, but also our
sister Dominions, Australia and New Zealand. It also affects labour, and in addition
is important from the viewpoint of transName of Ship:

portation of our products to those sister
Dominions and of their products to us.
Now let us see what the Government has
sold. I intend to quote only from officiai
documents; so if any honourable senato-r
doubts the accuracy of any of my statements
he ca.n go to the Department of Marine and
verify them. These ten ships sold by the
Government were launched in the year 1920, if
I remember correetly, and so are about
sixteen years old. They are of British design
and were constructed by Canadian workmen in a very creditable manner. The ships
for whose sale it appears the negotiations are
about, completed are as follows:

The sea speed of the two largest vessels.
the Canadian Constructor and the Canadian
Cruiiser. is 13 knots an hour, and that of the
other ships is 11 knots. Anyone who doubts
the aecuracy of that statement may find the
officiil re(tord in the Department of Marine,
of which I was the head whien the ships were
bought.
The department would zot take
delivery of the ships unless it was proved by
trial trips that they could make these speeds
whioh I have stated.
Let us turn for a moment to the annual
report of the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine, Limited, to see what it says about
these ships. The report, dated March 10, 1936,
is addressed to Hon. C. D. Howe, Minister
of Railways and Canals. It says:
Tiere
ivere
24
completed voyages to
Australia and/or New Zealand, being the same
nunber as in 1934. Loadings were exceptionally good. most of the vessels securing capacity
cargoes both inbound and outbound. There
was no important change in freight rates.
Notwithstanding 24.701 tons of additional
cargo to be handled with an increase of 20
per cent in operating revenue, the operating
expenses show an increase of less than one per
cent. This may be regarded as a very satisfactory performance, reflecting careful administration and strict economy on the part of all
concerned, and the Directors take this opportunity of expressing their appreciation of the
loyal and efficient service rendered by the
Comapany's officers and emaployees both ashore
and afloat.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

h'le operations of the fleet were carried on
vithout serions casualty.
There is a self-insurance fund for the ships,
and out of this fund the Dominion Government was paid $1,000,000 in 1933 and $1,000,000
in 1934. The report goes on:
In addition to the payment to the Government of the profit for the year of $311,822,
the amount of working capital required in the
business was reduced by $250,000 and the
amount refunded to the Government.
Canada built the Merchant Marine as a
war-time effort, the vessels being constructed
in Canada at war-time prices, and such vessels

as remain stand in the accounts at the rate
of $205 per dead-weight ton.
Such a value
is altogether out of line with any present
value the vessels may have.
The published
accounts include bookkeeping accruals for interest and depreciation based on the said wartime costs, the resuit being that the annual
income statement of the Merchant Marine
Limited as publislhed is distorted to such an
extent as to serve no useful purpose.
Based
on a reasonable valuation of the vessels and
after making adequate provision for interest
and depreciation, the income surplus of the
Merchant Marine Limited for the year 1935
was $200,000 instead of a loss of $2,001,000 as
shown by the accounts.
I am not going to make any statement
here to-day in justification of the building

of the Merchant Marine.

It

is unnecessary

that I sh,ould do so. But I might point out
that the policy of building these ships was

the result of a unanimous decision by the

MAY 6,1936
Government of the day, which policy was
unanimously approved by Parliament, as was
every vote, year after year,, in another place.
I am very much surprised that the Government would sell the ships at such a ridiculously
low price as was obtained. It is less than
$5 a ton dead weight. When the late Government was in power these same purchasers,
represented by Mr. Reford, approached not
only the Prime Minister, but also the Minister
of Railways and Canals, Dr. Manion, but
their ridiculously low offer was not accepted.
I have been told by two experienced steamship
men that if the present Government had disposed of the ships on the open market it could
have obtained twice the price that these companies are paying. I am also told on reliable
authority that had the vessels been scrapped,
double the present price could have been
secured.
Judging by the operating profit as shown by
the official records of the Merchant Marine,
these shrewd buyers will make almost double
the cost of these ships in the first year. The
ships have been in operation over a period of
sixteen years, during some five years of which
we have had a depression. After the expenditure of a lot of money in the building up of
trade be,tween Canada and Australia-New Zealand the service has 'become profitable, and it
does seem strange to me that when this
desirable point has been reached the Government should sell to these shrewd steamship
men at so low a price that they can get a
return of almost double their money from
the first year's operation. I might say that
the officially estimated profit -for this year
will be at least $700,000. One would think
that when the Minister was negotiating for
the sale he would have said', as a business man
who is selling out a business would say:
"What about the goodwill? What about all
the time and money we have spent in building up this trade? We have now reached a
point where the service is profitable.
So
in addition to the price for the ships, what
will you offer for goodwill?" But nothing of
the kind was said at all.
These vessels have a life of at least ten
more years, and all they will require in the
meantime is an annual overhauling.
Al
ships that make long voyages, as these do.
have to be put in dock and overhauled regula-rly. But that expense will not be very
great.
I now turn to the statement the honourable
leader of the House made yesterday, when he
gave an outline of the Government's policy
in this matter. It is a very misleading statement, for which I do not hold him accountable.
He said:

239

Honourable senators, before the Orders of
the Day are called I desire to give to my
honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) an answer to the inquiry he made
at the last sitting. I may inform the honourable gentleman that the Government has sold
to the Ellerman & Bucknall Steamship Company, Limited, Commonwealth and Dominion
Line, Limited, and the New Zealand Shipping
Company, Limited. the ten remaining vessels
of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine
which have been operating in the Australia
and New Zealand service. It is the intention
of the new owners to scrap these vesselsI ask honourable senators to take special
note of that.
-and
to provide faster and more suitable
boats for the Australian services, which they
have agreed to maintain for a period of at
least five years without any subsidy. They
have also agreed to take over the staffs and
crews of the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine, afloat and ashore.
The Canadian Government Merchant Marine
management having advised the Government
that the vessels in question were nearing the
end of their usefulness, and that an expenditure of between five and six million dollars
would be necessary for the construction of new
boats if the services were to be maintained,
the Government considered it advisable to
dispose of this residue of the original fleet of
more than sixty ships constructed by Canada
after the Great War. The sale was recoinmended by the Board of Directors of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine (who are
also the Trustees of the Canadian National
Railways) by resolution of the Board of
April 18 last.
While the operation of these vessels in 1935
had resulted in a small operating surplus, there
has been an annual operating deficit from 1921
to 1934, inclusive, the total operating deficit
over
that period
having
amounted
to
$11.064.725.
In view of these heavy deficits
and the necessity for further extensive capital
expenditures if the Australian services were
to be maintained, the Government considered
it in the publie interest to accept the offer
of these Australian shipping firms, who, as
already stated, are undertaking to provide an
improved service without subsidy.
The public has been advised that these ships
are already old and useless, and that new ships
are to be put on the route; but this agreement
does not make any reference whatever to new
ships.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is that the blank
form of agreement?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cates the form.

It simply indi-

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: This is a printed
form of the agreement made in quadruplicate.
Clause 7 provides:
That they will take over and efficiently
operate or cause to be operated approximately
the same sei-vice to and from Australia, New
Zealand and Canada as at present provided by

SENATE

240

the above mentioned ships for a period of at
least five years, without any subsidy for or in
connection with such service, or without any
contract other than herein provided, with sailings from Canada to Australia and New
Zealand and from Australia and New Zealand
to Canada (subject to alteration in the number
of sailings as hereinafter provided) as follows.
May I draw the attention of honourable
members to the fact that the purchasers are
to operate, for five years at least, these very
ships that the Government considers obsolete
and too slow. They are not too obsolete or
too slow for these enterprising men. As I
have already stated, they have bought the
fleet at a very low figure and will make a
very handsome profit on the transaction.
Durin.g the period of five years the ships
are to be operated under the following
conditions:
(a) Twenty-four sailings from Canada each
year, such sailings to be approximatelyThat is a word J do not like.
-two in eaci month, all sailings to be direct
from Montreal during the St. Lawrence season
of navigation and from the Maritime ports in
Eastern Canada during the winter season, provided that if after the first two years of operation. direct service from Canada to Australia
andx New Zealand is not warranted in the
opinion of the Minister, the ships shall be
peritted to eall en route at United States
ports to pick up cargo. The Minister shall
not withhold his consent if it is shown that
the service is unprofitable.
(b) Twelve sailings fromn Australia and New
Zealand during eacli year in which the agree-

ment

renains in force, such

sailings to be

approxiiately one in each nonth, all sailings
to be to Mioitreal during the St. Lawrence
season of navigation and to ports in Eastern

Canada during, the winter season, with the
liberty to call at Paniaima, West Indies (for
discharging cargo only)
and
ports. provided that if after

United States
the agreement

has been in force for a full period of twelve
nonths, the tonnage carried in the service
herein contemplated during said twelve months
period or aiy snbsequcit six months period
falls, to an appreciable amount, below the
tonnage carried by said above mentioned ships
fron Australia and New Zealand to Canadian
and United States ports during the corresponding period in the calendar year of 1935,
then and in that event the sailings from

Australia and New Zealand may be reduced
to a minimum of not less than one sailing
every six weeks for tbe balance of the term
hereof; provided further that should the
tonnage

in any

six monthis period

thereafter

equal or exceed the tonnage carried by said
ships durinsg the corresponding period in the
calenadar year of 1935, then the month.y sailings from Australia and New Zealand shall
be restored in the following six months period
or periods, and shall be so maintained until
the tonnage in any succeeding six months period
again drops below the tonnage carried by said
ships during the corresponding period in the
calendar year of 1935, whereupon said sailings
nay be agains reduced to a minimum of one

sailing every six weeks; provided further that
Hon. Nr. BALLANTYNE.

if a ship arriving in Canada during the St.
Lawrence season of navigation has not sufficient cargo to warrant said ship proceeding to
Montreal, the cargo may be discharged at an
eastern port in Canada and forwarded by rail
to point of destination, the ship or its owners
to assume and bear the difference between the
amount that it would have cost to transport
such cargo by rail from Montreal to point of
destination and the amount of rail charges on
such cargo from such eastern port to point of
destination.
I would point out that when the trustees
were managing these ships Canadian exporters
and importers could depend on the stipulated time schedule of sailings. This agreement does not commit the purchasers to maintain sustained sailing dates. Indeed, under
certain conditions they may reduce the service,
then they may restore it. In short, it is a wideopen agreement and no one can depend on the
continuity of the service.
Now I direct attention to another important
clause, No. 10:
That in the purchasing of supplies and stores,
including coal and fuel oil. the making of
repairs and the employing of help for the ships
engaged in the service herein contemplated,
preference shall be given to Canada in the
making of all such purchases and repairs and
in the enployment of labour, provided that it
is reasonable to do so.
I leave honourable members of the legal profession to interpret the word "reasonable."
In my view the word nullifies the agreement
in that respect.
Section 9 provides:
That they will take over or arrange with the
new coipany to take over as many members
of the existing shore staffs in Canada,
Australia and New Zealand of the Canadian
Governmient Merchant Marine Limited as can
reasonably be absorbed by the Purcliasers or
the new company in the landling of said service, said menbers to be retained in the
service of the Purcliasers or said new company,
subject to dismissal of any of them for good
cause, for a period of at least two years.

It

is the Pirchasers' intention in the first instance to operate in tbis trade any or all of
tie ships purchased under this agreement and
it is agreed that so long as any or all of said
ships are being so operated, then the said ship
or ships shall be manned by personnel available from those already in the service.
Under big headlines in the press bas
appeared the official statement issued by the

Governmwent that the new company will take
care of the staffs for two years. That is not so
definitely stated in the agreement; it is
qualified by the word "reasonable." In short,
it is left to the company to decide how many
members of the staffs they will retain in the
service. The sane qualification covers supplies.
I find nothing in the agreement about repairs. Ship repairing is very important to

Canada.

We have a magnificent drydock at

MAY 6, 1936
the port of Saint John, which Hia Honour the
Speaker is so proud of, and we have aiea
drydock accommodation at Montreal, Quebec
and Halifax. I repeat, there je nothing whatever in the agreement to ensure that the ships
sh-al be repaired in Canada. Australian labour
is sa mucb cheaper than Canadian that I
imagine any repaire will be doue in Australian
shipyards, or perhaps in England; anywbere
but in Canada.
]Recently Mr. Fullerton, Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the Canadian, Goverument Merchant Marine, appeared before the
Select Standing Committee on Railways and
Shipping of the other House. When hie was
asked what profit, if any, the ships had made
in the three months of this year, hie answered:
There was a profit of $78,000 to the end of
March. A lot of our ships have yet to corne
in, and we possibly may make that up ta
$200,000.
The operating surplus for the same three
months last year was only $21,000. New it
has gone up to 3200,000; yet the Governmeut
is selling these splen-did chips at the paltry
rate of less than $5 a ton. It is a sale whicb
will cause the disebarge of hundrede of seamen frorn the Maritime Provînces--and there
are no better sailors in the world.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That je contrary
to the statemeut of the Minister.
Hou. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What does the
Minister say?
Hou. Mr' DANDURAND: My honouTable
friend bias just quoted xny statement of yesterday.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I have quoted
frmi -the agreement that the men are to be
retained ouly if they cau be reasonably
employed; which meaus virtually notbing.
So Iarn not muoli interested in wbhat the Minister said.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If the
new oompany does not employ the men, wbat
is the penalty?
Han. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am coming
to that. I tbought I might find in this
agreement sometbing in the way of penalties
to ensure fulfilment of its conditions, but I
find no penalty clauses s.t ali. I do flot pretend too be a lawyer, but I venture the opinion
that a horse and cart could be driven through
the agreemnent.' It is absolutely one-sided,
very muoli in favour of the purchaser and
very rnuch against the intterest of the Dominion.
I regret that the fleet should have been
sold just when it had begun to show an

241

operating surplus. I regret the sale for the
furtber reason that it will add to unemployment.
This, honoursble senators, ie not aly a
Canadian, it je au Imperial question. These
shi-ps have perforrned au important part in
developing Emnpire trade. I shahý not take
up the time of the Hause ta give comparative figures of our trade witb the Wegt-Indies
for 1919 and to-day, but tbey are amazing.
These ships have also been of great service
to the lumbermen of British Columbia. Before they were put juta operation thbe lurnber trade was manopolized by American sbipping. I have not the figures under my baud,
but tbey ho-w tbe very creditable part played
by our Merchant Marine in regaining that
trade.
I would ask honouTable members ta reflect on the excellent advertising that Canada bas received during the sixteen years
that the Canadian Governint Merchant
Marine bas been sailing Vo ail parte of tbe
world. Business men a.ttach a great deal of
importance ta the value of advertising. Wby
sbould we not appreciate the effective advertising of Canada by these ships, ecd flying its
distinctive house fiag and bearing a namne
with the title "Canadian"?
The Government's w-ar shipbuilding programme was conflrmed by that great statesman the Rigit Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Wben, in 1918, 1 introduced in the House of
Gommons the Bill origiuating the policy, that
distinguished gentleman listened ta my remarks
sud, as I proceeded, he frequently rapped bis
desk and sbouted, "Hear, bear." He was, a
strong believer in a Canadian <3overnment
Merchant Marine. As I said befoae, that policy
received unanimous endorsement in the sessions of 1918, 1919 aud 1920. It was not until
the session of 1921, wben, with a general
election in the offing, certain newspapers were
decrying the Canadian Goverument Merchaut
Marine, and sorte of my bonourable friends
on the opposite side in the other House
though-t they might maike political capital,
that for the first time objection was raised
ta the policy.
Why did the Government go juta it? I
do not iutend to break the oath tbat ail
Privy Counicillors take, but I may say that
8,500,000 toos of British sbipping were sunk
by German suibmarines, and the Home Govment was appealing to tbe Goverument of
Canada to do what it oould Vo make up the
loss. We very wisely took over the shipyards
in order ta build only Canadian Goverument
sabips. Pre'vious ta that turne the Canadian

shipyards were building some ships for noncombatant. aounitries, as well as some for
British registry. The Governmeni policy was
to control ail Canadian shipyarde exclusively
for the building of Governmen-t ship.9, in
accordance with its war shi.pbuilding programme. 1 admit that the war was over
were
xnany
of
these
ships

launched; but when you are engaged in a
great war you cannot sit down and say: "We
wiIl go slowly, because the war may be over
to-morrow, or in six rnonths." You have
to go full steam ahead. That is what the
Government did.
It is said:
"We could understand ships
being buit before and during the War, but
why build eighteen ships after the War?"
Well, we have no regrets in that regard. The
condition of the country was alarming. Great
disturbances were octurring in many of our
centres--we had a riot in Winnipeg-and
hundreds of tâhousands of men were coming
back from overseas. The Goverriment would
have beon derelict in its duty if it had not
built more ships in order to give 'the employment which was so badly needed.
I shall answer one more question and then
I àhall be finished. We are asked. "Could
you Dlot have sold the ships?" 0f course we
could have sold them, 'but after the War
was over the cargo space available to Canadian importers and exporters was limited to
thirty per cent and the importers and exporters were bowling at the door of the Government and asking-, "What are you going
to do about sh',ips?" We would not seil the
ships then, because we had to take care of
the trade. Our action at that time met with
the approval of the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right H-on. Mr. Graham)
and the honourable senator from Rougemont
(lion. Mr. Lemieux), for at the great Liberal
convention held in thîs city in 1919 a st.rong
resolution was moved by the right honourable senator from Eganville, seconded by the
hon-ourable senator from Rougemont, condemning the Government of the day for having been deiTelict in its duty in not having
built more ships and built them fa.ster.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I arn sure we have listcned with a great
deal of interest to the excellent speech made
by the honourable senator from Aima (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne), but as I listcned to him I
was thinking *of the passage which appears, I
believe. in Longfel'low's Psalm of Life: "Let
the dead past bury its dead." It seems to

by the Union Government in 1918, and the
results which have accrued since, that everybody in Parliament, especially those who were
here during those bectie days, had muclh better
say as little as possible about the building,
operation. and sale of -the Canadian Government Merchant Marine.
I can quite understand, honourable senators, why, when the War was at its height
and Canada was sending hundreds of thousands of men overseas to help the Mother
Country, and when âhips were being sunk
day by day, the Government of that time,
or the righ't honourable senator from Eganville, the honourable senator from Rouge,mont, or anybody else might have thought

sece what happened wben the Armistice was
signed in November, 1918. Al.though contracts had been made by the Union Government for the 'building of some sixty-three
ships, only (?ne keel was laid.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My honourable
friend is very much astray there.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: 0f course I must take
the word of the honourable gentleman, but
perhaps he should give me credit for having
given this matter just as much study as he
or anybody else has given it. I have the
record wjth me and will read the exact words
which I have taken from it, if my honourable
frienýd's memory is bad.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

It is nlot bad.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Here is what it says:
The first unit of the fleet. the Canadian
Voyageur, bujît by Canadian Vickers, Limited,
%vas delivered to the eompany February 22,
1919.

launched and in commission in the faîl of
1918, and immediately following her was
the Canadian Pioncer.
Hlon. Mr. DUFF: 0f -course I must take
the honourable gentleman's word, but I arn
readinEý from the record. The fact rermains
thiat after the Armistice in 1918, although
cu)ntira'cts had been madc for sixty-three ships
at a cost of more than $79.000.000 to the
people of this couîntry, not one ship was in
operation; and, as I said in the session of
1919 when I discussed this matter in another
place. only one keel was laid in 1918. At

that time, because the War was over and Britain and the countries o£ Europe bave not
because Britain and the other European co *un- been able to, employ ail the shipwrights they

tries and the United States were 'building large
fleets of sbips-and 1 arn sure the fhonourable

senator frorn Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
must remember this--I urged upon the Government the advisa'bility of discontinuing this
venture and of making a settlement wîth the
fourteen shipyards and the various contractors
wi-th whorn contracts had been ma-de for the

building of the-se sixty-three ships. I arn going to prove, I think, that if that had been
done the country would have saved anywhere

from S140,0OO to $175,00,000«
It is ail ver@y well for my honouraible friend
to say that if these ships had flot been built
the trade of Canada co'uld flot have been carried on. Sur-ely, as a business man, he knows
better than that. My honourable friend should
know that Canadian trade bas flot suifered
and is flot suifering by reason of the fact
that the Canadian Merchant Marine bas been
reduced fromn sixty-three ships to eleven ships;
for will it suifer when this mess is ail cleaned

up. I say that when the War was over and
it was found that there was no necessity for
the building of these ships, thi6 country should

not have gone on and spent this large sum
of money.
My honourable friend, in order to 'make bis
point, was good enough to invoke the shade
of my late lamented leader, Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
I would rather hýe had talked about somebody
who was al-ive and able to defend himself.
The honouýrable gentleman went on to say
that the building of these ships enabled the

men who returned fromn the War to secure
empînyment. My bonourabie friend knows
better than I do tha.t in order to build these
ships it was neaessary to bring shipwrigh.ts
from the United States, Great Britain, and
Europe-an countries, because in Canada we

had not the men to build vessels of that size
and kind.

When my honourable fýriend says

the reburned soldiers benefitedHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
How could
Canada bring skilled workmen from abroad
when Great Britain was up to bier eyee in
shipbuilding and needed ail her own men?
I hope my honourable friend will stick more
closely to facts.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I did not say that Great
Britain could use ahl the shipwrights sbe had.
Immediately after the War Giýeat Britain
started a sbipbuilding program; but even during the last fifteen or twenty years Great

12745--161

ba.ve in tihose countries. The 'building of the
Queen Mary in Britain and of the Normandie
in France was undertaken largely te provide
work for unernployed shipwrights.
Canada, in order to build ships, had te import shipwrights fromi the United States and

from Europe, and when my honourable friend
tries te, make a point by saying that reburned
soldiers benefited by these operations, I say
bis argument is unsound.
My honourable friend to-day made the
statement-and I think he made it yesterday,
thougli it is not recorded in Hansard in the
words I thought he used, and I do. not want
te misrepresent him-that the leader of the
late Government and the Minister of Railways
in the late Government refused te seil any of
these ships. Now, what is the fact? Many
accuse the present Government in the disposaI
of the ten ships sold twe or three days agoHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn sorry te
risc se often, but I must ask my honourable
friend net te mislead the buse. I know he
is net doing se, intentionally. I was speaking
of Mr. Reford's negotiations with respect te
the ships now sold, net other ships.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Very good. That makes

my argument ail the stronger. It is truc,
perhaps, as the honourable gentleman says,
that the late Prime Minister and bis Mi-nister

of Railways d.id net negotiate with this Mr.
Reford. I do not know him at ail. But I
notice that Mr. Bennett and Mr. Manion
negotiated with ether people for the sale of a

number of these ships.

And let me say here,

h-oneurable senaters,

that as far as price is
cencerned there is ne comparison whatever

between the prices oifered te Mr. Bennett and
Mr. Manion and those for which the directors
of the Canadian National Railways sold the
present ten ships now partieularly mentioned
by the honourable senater f rom Aima. Perhaps
the honourable senator will enlighten me.
I find that a great. many ships have been
sold in the iast few years.
I should like, with theconeent of honourable
senators, te place upon Hansard a statemient
showing Canadian Gevernment Merchant
Marine, Limited, vessels disposed of u-p te
December 31, 1935, and anether statement as
te the sale of ten steamships a few days age,
which sale evidently raised the ire of my
honourable friend the senator from AIma (Hlon.
Mr. Ballantyne).

sailed between Montreal and Australia and

Boston, not brought direct to Canada.
My honourable friend from Alma said that
these ships were needed to carry cargoes from
Canada to varions places.
However, the
directors
of the
Canadian
Government
Merchant Marine point out that sailings to
South American ports, which were commenced
in 1919, were discontinued in 1921 owing to
falling off in cargoes. In 1928 this trade was
revived at the request of the Department of
Trade and Commerce with an annual subsidy
of $120,000 for guaranteed monthly sailings.
The Government which was in power at that
time paid an annual subsidy of $120,000 to
the Canadian Government Merchant Marine
in an effort to maintain the sailings to South
America. In spite of that, the service had
to be discontinued early in 1933, after the
late Government came into power, owing to
lack of homeward cargoes.
The intercoastal service, commenced in 1924
to develop the British Columbia lumber
business in Eastern Canada, was discontinued
at the end of 1932-again when the late
Government was in power-because

business from other shippers to warrant a
continuation of the service. Yet my honourable friend from Alma spoke of the British
Columbia business as though it would have
justified the keeping of sorne ships.
My honourable friend also pointed out
what a great thing it was to have ships flying
the flag of Canada on the high seas between
Canada and the United Kingdom. Here are
the facts. The Atlantic ports service to the
United Kingdom was maintained until 1929,
when the impossibility of operating this
service, with the obsolete tonnage at the
company's disposal, in competition with the
up-to-date tonnage of other steamship lines,
was realized. The Pacific coast service to
California was maintained until 1929.
In
that year, on account of the paper shippers
having made other arrangements, the service
had to be discontinued. The Newfoundland
service was maintained until 1928, when it was
discontinued because our vessels were unable
to meet the competition of up-to-date ships
from other lines. In other words, honourable
senators, we were unable to meet the competition from private enterprise.
I am a
believer in private enterprise myself.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: There is too .much Government money being spent for purposes like
this. Here we have an exhibition of the
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

failure of Government ownership. In spite
of the fact that the Government of Canada
was pouring out tens of millions of dollars
year after year to pay operating deficitsvirtual-ly no interest on capital was ever
paid except on two occasions-yet private
enterprise in the constituency of the bonourable senator from Bedford-Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Quinn) could put boats in service between Halifax and other Canadian and Newfoundland ports, make money out *of the
business, and drive this great Canadian Government Merchant Marine off the sea.
Sorie Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF:
The Pacific coast to
Australia service had to be inaugurated
because my honourable friend from Alma,
finding these ships so many white elephants
on his hands, had to do something with
them.
So he sent them here, there and
everywhere, without knowing whether there
was any business for them, thus driving
Canadian and British ships off the sea, for
apparently it did net make any difference
whether the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine piled up operating deficits or made
profits.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
If my honourable friend will allow me to interrupt
him once more, I may tell him that I had
nothing whatever to do with the operation
of the ships; neither had the Government.
We turned them o.ver to the Canadian
National Railways.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
I am coming to that
if my honourable friend will only be patient.
I am not deliberately trying to blame him
for what happened.. Indeed, I think he is
more to be pitied than blamed, for the
fact is ho was compelled for war and other
reasons to build and operate these ships.
He is a good business man, and I am confident ho would never, even in war-time, have
wished to spend millions of money on a
inerchant marine. Consequently I am not
trying to lay either at bis door or at the door
of any Government all the blame for this
unprofitable venture.
But my honourable
friend started this controversy when ho tried
to criticize the present Minister of Railways,
or the Government, or the trustees of the
Canadian National Railways, for getting rid
of the last ten ships, and I submit I am
quite justified in laying the whole story
before honourable members and before the
public at large who by any chance may listen
to or read my remarks.

MAY 6, 1936
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Could the
honourable member tell me whether tha trustees or the Goverument negotiated this saie?
Hon. Mr. DUFE: My right honourable
friend is just as wisa as I arn with respect
to that. I do flot know, neither do I care,
who negotiated the sale, but I want te give
credit to Mr. Bennett, to Mr. Manion, to
Mr. Dunning-he was Minister of Raiiways
'n 19R29-to Sir Henry Thornton, to Mr.
Fuilerton, to Mr. Labelle, to Mr. Morrow, or
to anybody elsa who decided it was in the
best interest of Canada to. get. clear o-f the
various ships.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To geV clear
of the small, useless ones.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: I shall deai with that in
a moment. I corne now to the Pacifie coast
service to Australia. I arn sure my honourable
friand from Aima will agree with me that the
large type of ships were used in that service.
They were noV the flat-bottom canal size;
they were 8,500-ton boats..
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: A tonnage of
10,500.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Thanks. The Pacifie coast
service to Australia, the Orient and India was
commenced in 1920 to davelop the lumbar
business frorn British Columbia, but it was
discontinued soa time afterwards owing Vo
low rates on outward cargoes and lack of
homeward cargoes. In other words, honourable mem'hers, that oId sea lawyer, Robert
Dollar, could run rings around the Canadian
National Railways management in operating
ships. The vessels buit in 1919 and 1920
by the people of Vhis country had te be taken
off that service bacausa Robert Dollar was
making money hand over tist, w.hile our
vessais, being unsuitable-whether they were
obsolete or too slow 1 need not argue-lost
money year after year, as I shahl show in a
moment.
The Pacifie cost service to the United
Kingdorn was commencad in 1924 to develop
the grain and lumber business from Vancouver, but it was discontinued in 1927 ewing
te lack of homaward, or westbound, cargees.
I have shown that from 1925 to 1934 56 of
the 66 ships wera disposed of. I cannot taell
my right honourable friand whather it was
the Government itself or the aperators of the
Canadian National Railways who sold those 56
shîps, 'but the fact remains that both Li-beral
and Conservatîva Governments rarne to the
conclusion that the Canadian Governrnent
Marchant Marine was an ill-advised venture,
and decîded that the sooner they geV eut of
il, the better. Se during those nina yaars thosa
Governments reduoed tha fleet te tan ships.

249

The 56 ships so sold represanted a total of
302,633 dead.-weight tons. Thair original cost
was 861,396,823.49. I dio not wish to talk
politics in this Chambar, and therefora 1 de
net blame either the Liberal or the Censervativa régime in this connaction, but let
us sea, what was the result of the sale of thase
56 ships by both Governments. As I have
said, they cat originally alrnost 862,000,000.
The two Govarnments, or the two sets ef
tirustees, or the two, boards of directors,
whichever were responsible, sol-d them for
$2,019,936.67. That is, ships that cost $180
te $210 a ton sold at less than $7 a ton.
Hon., Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will the
honourable membar shlow a question ?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Cartainly.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I notice
the honourahie gentýleman is talking about
something which tha honourable senator frorn
Alma neyeir mentioned at ail. The question
is whether the Governmant was justifiad in
selling these particular ten shîps. Why does
hie not confina himsalf te that question?
Hon. Mr. DUPE: Tha honeurabla senator

honourable f riend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) in -the few months during which hie
had the honour of being Prime Ministerthese right honourable gentlemen and their
Cabinet colleagues must -have given ample
consideration as to whether it was in the
national interest týo retain the;se ships and
have them plying on the seven seas. Indeed,
my right honou.rable friend opposite was
from 1930 to 1935 a member of the Government without portfolio, and surely somne time
during those years hie must 'have been present
in Council when it was decided ta sell 30
of those ships at an average price of $7 par
ton.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: They ought te seil the
railwvays at the samne price.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: If my honourable friend
opposite wants te hear my views on that
subjeet, I may tell hiim that I was neyer in
favour of the amalgamation of the Grand
Trunk, the Grand Trunk Pacific, the Intercolonial. the Canadian Northern, and the
other railway systems. I believe that our
Canadian railways cau he better opera.ted
under private than under Government ownership.
Somne Hon. SENATORS:

to me semae time ago that certain persans in
this country would flot mind absorhing anI do not know what my

Hon. Mr. QUINN: I feed quite certain,
honourable senators, that a sale of the railways at the samne rate as the sale of the

would be a wondýerful bargain for Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I ýwill deal with that
wlien we are discussing railway matters. For
the present I am dealing with one mess. That
is enoug-h at a time.
Now I come to the recent sale of the tan
ships. I must confess the honourable senator from Alma wvas net, consulted about that
sale. He appears to think that if the past or
the present Government had but consulted
him. and one or two other honourable gentlemen whom I migbt mention, on shipping and
other mnatters, no such blunder would have
been made. Anyway, I wa.s not consulted
on the sale. and therefora I take no respousibility for it, nor am 1 standing on my feet

Hon. Mr. DLFF.

view of what bas happened in the last fifteen
years with regard to the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, I can, without entering the rmalin of polities, reach only one conclusion-that these ships should have been
sold long ago.
I ýhope now to prove the soundness of my
conclusion. Whether Judge Fullerton negotiated this transaction or not, the fact remains that these ten ships, Canadian Cruiser.
Canadian Constructor, Canadian Challenger,
Britisher,
Canadian Hig.hlander, Canadian
Canadian Leader, Canadian Scottish, Canadian Conqueror, Canadian Victor and Canadian Planter wvere sold at the fabulous price
of $4.30 a ton! That is almost five years
after my honourable friend's friends sold
other ships of the Canadian Government
Merchant Marine at $2.10 a ton.
They were

entirely different ships. My honourable friend
might as well compare the price of a Ford
car with the price of a Rolîs Royce limousine
as compare the sale price of those small ships
xvîth the sale price of these large vessels.

to the ships my honourable fricnd talks
about. Some smaller ships of other steamship

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But they neyer

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I k-now that, but there

Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: That is merely an
assertion, which the honourable gentleman
cannot substantiate.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Which assertion is my
honourable friend referring to?
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: I am referring to the
remarkz that ships of 2,500 tons are more
profitable than ships of 10.000 tons.

MAY 6, 1936
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The reason I say that isHon. Mr. CANTLEY: That the honourable
gentleman does not know.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I admit the superior
knowledge of my honourable friend from New
Glasgow; but he knows as well as I do that
sometimes a 100-ton boat makes more money
for its owners than a 10,000-ton boat. There
are small steamers to-day plying between
Liverpool and Halifax and New York which,
during the next twelve months, will make a
great deal more money than either the
Normandie or the Queen Mary. What is the
use of splitting hairs about this matter? I
submit it must have been proved conclusively
to the trustees of the Canadian National
Railways-and, if you like, to the present
Government-that it was advisable to sell
these ten ships. I believe it was the right
course to take.
But more than anything else I am interested
in what this venture cost the country. These
ten ships of 88,579 tons dead weight cost
originally $18,118,838.42.

I have compiled a

short statement showing exactly how the
country stands with respect to the Canadian
Government Merchant Marine. The original
cost of the 66 vessels was $79,521,932.32. This
information is contained in the statements
which, with the consent of honourable members, I have placed on Hansard. The country
received from the sale of those ships, including
the ten, for which, I presume, payment has
not yet been made, but we hope it will beRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It wili not
make much difference.

251

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Not a great deal in com.
parison with the total expenditure. On the
sale of the 66 vessels we have realized
$2,491,339.93. In other words, there bas been
a total capital loss of $77,074,750.17.
In
addition to the capital loss there was also
a total operating deficit to December 31, 1935,
of $11,064,725.06.
My honourable friend stated that these
vessels made some money in the first two
years of their operation. That is quite true.
In 1919 the operating profit was $1,056,767.8.
That, of course, was gross profit and did not
take into account depreciation or marine or
fire insurance on the hulls of the vessels. In
1920 the gross profit was $1,263,306.95.
Later there were losses year after year, as
follows:

In 1935, instead of a loss, there was a gross
profit of $311,82226; but on the operations of
all those years there was an operating deficit,
inclusive of interest and depreciation, of
$11,064,725.06. With the permission of the
Senate I should like also to put this statement on Hansard.

'Son. Mr. DUFF.

MAY 6, 1936
Now, honourable senators, there is a more
serious aspect of this matter. The sum of
879.606,000 was borrowed fromn the people of
Canada, and from 1919 and 1920 to the
end of December iast year the total interest
due on the money borrowed was $50,777,136.63.
In 1-919, there having been a gross profit of
a million dollars, there was paid 'back to
the Government in interest $415,358.36, and
in 1920, M57,415.60.
Those two amounts
added together make $1,012,773e9.
In addition to that, out of what is called the Insurance Reserve Fund there was paid hack
S3,00,00 manking a total of 84.012,773.96.
That 'leaves due a balance of interest on the
capital amounting to 846,764,36.67, and when
this sum is added to the 888,000,000 advanced
by the Governrnent on ca.pital account and
for deficits, there is shown. a los to the
people of this toun.try of 8134,933,837.90.
Now let us go a littie further. During the
years that these ship-s were ope.rating there
was bujîlt up, as I mentioned a few moments
ago, a certain insurance fund. This fund,
which was accumulated from year to year,
waa built up not on the total value or total
coat of the ships, but on a value which was
less than the ships would have brought ln
the open market at the time. Consequently,
if the ships had been owned by a private
individual or corporation instead of 'by the
Government of the country, and if that
private individual or corporation had borrowed the $79,000,000 from banks or trust
companies, or elsewhere, one of the firet
things the lender woul have insisted upon
would have been t.hat the ships be insured
to the full amount of the loan; and if you
figure the premium on a risk of 879,000,000
at h~ per cent, which je a fair and reasonable premium, you will see that the Government was carrying a risk of 845,000,000 during the time these ships were being operated.

255

Therefore I say that up to the time the
slips were disposed of, -in addition to losing
$134,000,000, we were assuming a risk of
$45,000.000 leas the 84,000,000 which was in
reserve and paid back to the Governmen.t;
or, in other words, $40,987,226.04. So as a
result of this venture the people of this
country are out, in the final analysis.
8175,921,063.94; and,-although -I think the
honourable senator- from Alma said that these
trade routes lad to le maintained by the
people of the country-tle Government, in
addition to losing 846,000,000 interest and
this total investment of almost 888,000,000,
had Vo give the Canadian Government
Merchant Marine 8712,000 in subsidies.

Honl. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In the total
figures do you include the Lady boats built
by Vhe King Government, or the Prince
boats at Victoria?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, I do flot, buit I
sbouid le delighted to discuss them laVer.
My honourable friend should not endeavour
to draw a Ted herring across the trail.
Honl. Mr. LYN-GH-ýSTAUNTON: The honlourable gentleman himeelf should stop drawinýg a herring, and should come to the point.
Honl. Mr. DUFF: I have heard memibers
make speeches of four or five hours in another
place, and though I am not egotistical, I
think I have clone just as well as some of
those gentlemen. The honourable gentleman
will re-member that on one occasion I madle
a speeeh of some five hours and paid him
compliments all through it.
In an attemapt to keep these routes revivified by the use of Goivernment Merchant
Marine ships the Government of the country
gave another $712,000 in addition Vo the
investment. I desire also to place a statement of these figures on the record.

SENATE

256

Now, honourable senators, I have given
you in a few words the story of the Canadian
Nobody
Marine.
Government
Merchant
would have been better pleased than I if
the operation had been a success. I believe
the honourable gentleman from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) was sincere when he brought
the legislation down te the House in 1918,
and I think he was sincere up to the time
when, as he said himself, he quietly passed
it over and threw the burden on someone else's
shoulders.
My honourable friend spoke about the
present agreement not being specifie. He said
it used the word "reasonable," which might
be construed as meaning anything. Let me
say that I should like to see the ocean full
of ships registered in Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec, Halifax, Saint John or Vancouver. Nobody would be more delighted at that than I,
even though fifteen years ago I pointed out
what I thought was going to happen with
regard to these ships. I said immediately
the War was over there was no necessity for
building them, and I advised the Government
of the day to sell those tha.t had been built
and pay off and settle with the shiphuilders.
That might have cost us $5,000,000 or
$10.000.000, but if we had followed that course,
instead of having a loss of $150,000,000, we
should to-day be in a very different position. I
have been brought up among sailors, and in
my humble way have always taken an interest
in the scamen of this country; and whether
there arc sixty-six ships or ten in the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, I take
second place to no man in my interest with
regard to captains, mates, engineers and
The honourable member knows
stewards.
that when he was Minister I pressed upon
hin the desirability of having those ships
manned and sailed by men from the Maritime
Provinces and the Pacifie Coast. With regard
to the Lady boats and those two monstrosities
-what are the names?Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Henry and the other one.

The

Prince

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I have my own views
about them, but I have never at any time
failed to urge that Canadians should man and
sail our ships in the seven seas of the world.
I am proud to say that from my own adopted
county of Lunenburg there were on the sixtysix ships of the Canadian Merchant Marine
more captains, mates, quartermasters, cooks
and sailors than from perhaps any other part
of Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR: But only one Admiral.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am the Admiral.
As we are having a funeral, it would be
as well to let the "dead past bury its dead,"
and say requiescat in pace.
I shall have to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
examine into the statement of the honourable
senator from Alma and the reply of the honourable gentleman from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Duff) to see if all the points have been
covered. One or two questions put by the
honourable gentleman from Alma may not
have been answered, and with respect to these
I shall be glad to secure information from the
Minister of Marine to bring to my honourable
friend. I move the adjournment of the debate.
The debate was adjourned.
DISCHARGE OF UNEMPLOYED FROM
CONCENTRATION CAMPS
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to ask the leader of the Government-I do
net expect an answer at once-if he would
put himself in a position to give us some
information as to what is to be done after the
1st of July with the unemployed men who
are in our concentration camps. What is the
Government's program with respect to the
twelve or thirteen thousand men who on that
date are to be turned adrift from the camps?
I believe there is some arrangement for
utilizing all who can be used in railway work,
on the basis that part of their remuneration
wilil be paid by the Government. But what I
am anxious about, and what I should like the
honourable gentleman te keep particularly in
mind, is the question of what is to happen
these men during the coming winter, at the
expiration of the three months' employment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They will be happy.
They did not like the camps. They found
fault.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be,
but there are certain people who have to be
taken care of notwithstanding their own
foolishness.
Furthermore, what is to happen the proportion, which I fear will be considerable, who
will not be of any service at all in the railway
work which the Government appears to have
in mind? I think it is time we knew. I am
net so much concerned about the speed with
which the information is brought down as with
the specific intention of the Government regarding this vast number of men. Much that
will go te the very root of our social welfare
in the next few months or the next year will
depend upon this.

MAY 6,1936
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I understand
the question, it is this. A certain number
of these men-I think the figure of ten thousand has been mentioned-will be employed
for a certain time on the railways. My right
honourable friend deiires to know what is to
bo their fate after that work is done, and also
what will be the fate of those who are not
employed and who stand to be turned out of
the camps on the lst of July. I shall secure
an answer for my right honourable friend.
INDIAN BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 4, an Act to amend the Indian
Act.
He said: My right honourable friend has
asked about the special form of police control
lately established with respect to the Indian
reserves. I sent a query to the department,
but the only answer I got was with respect
to informers. On the point about which my
right honourable friend inquired most partieularly there has been no answer except the
statement, on the subject of generali policy,
that it was considered better for the good
administration of the reserves that informers
should not be encouraged to denounce their
neighbours in order to secure a moiety of the
fine. I shall try again to secure the answer
to the question of my right honourable friend.
In the meantime we may give the Bill third
reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not intend
to oppose the passing of the Bill, because this
matter, though important, does not go to the
root of the measure. It is indicated in the
explanatory note on the right-hand page of
the Bill that there are special means of police
supervision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.: I want to
place on record my opinion that these reserves will inevitably be exposed to corruption unless same system of constant supervision and scrutiny is established. In the
past we have followed the practice of paying
a premiurm to informers. I say it is exceedingly perilous to discontinue that practice,
as this Bill seeks to do, unless we provide for
special police supervision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I quite realize
the point of the right honourable gentleman,
and I shall obtain the information for which
he has asked.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

257

DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE BILL
MOTION

FOR. SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. J. J. HUGHES moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act respecting the
remairriage of certain divorced persons.
to discuss and to hear discussed the motion
He said: Honourable senators, reasoning
upon the theory that all things come to those
who wait, I am glad to have an opportunity
to discuss and to hear discussed the motion
that has stood on the Order Paper in my
name for some wees.
The difficulty in
reaching this measure, because of the busiindicate that honourable senators are a very
busy body of men.
The purpose of the Bill now before this
House is to change the divorce law of the
country so that hereafter when a divorce is
granted in Canada by statute or by court of
competent jurisdiction the guilty party, or
respondent, shall not be permiitted to marry
any person other than his or her former
spouse during the lifetime of the said spouse.
In asking Parliament so to determine, I
think the duty devolves on me to show that
the change would be in the interest of the
State and in accordance with Divine law.
Whate.ver is in accordance with Divine law
cannot fail to be for the good of the individual
and the State. I should much prefer to get
an Act of Parliament preventing all divorcees
from marrying other than their former spouses
during the lifetime of such spouses, but I am
afraid Parliament would not pass such a bill,
and I think it is the part of wisdom to accept
the best law we can get in the matter.
I am basing my arguments upon the assumption that Parliament is a Christian assembly
in at least a supposedly Christian nation.
Every sitting of both Houses is opened with
prayer for Divine blessing upon the nation
and the Royal Family, also for Divine guidance in our work. But, as I sec it, we are
not consistent with our profession,
for
although the chief part of the prayer we
use was made by Christ Himself and is of
such a profound character that no merely
human being could have composed it, immediately after prayers we proceed to enact
legislation that goes directly contrary to the
public teaching of Him who made the Lord's
prayer.
Now, where shall I go to obtain proof to
justify the strong statements I have made?
Speaking by and large, there are in Christendom two large bodies of Christians-Catholics
and Protestants-who hold the Bible to be
the written record of God's revelation to man.
Therefore, to the Bible I apipeal. And if this

tion and the attention of the House ta the
fact that apparently the leader of the Rouse,
who is also my leader, thought very littile
of -my proposed legisiation. A short discussion followed as ta whether the second reading of rny Bill shoull nlot be put off tili
after thec Easter holidays. The riglit honourable leader of the other side inîterjected a
rem-ark to the effect that it iniglit be postpon-ed tili a much later date, implying thereby that if the, second reading were put off
for ever no great interest would suifer.
Now, whie I have much respeot for the views
of ouT two leaders and of every other honourable senato-r on ail subjects that corne
beoare this Ilouse, I arn compelled ta have
stili greater respect for the clear statements
of the Evangelists, the Apostie Paul and our
Lord Himself, on the subject of marriage and
divorce.
lit lias been argued,, even in this House.
that by foýrbidding the respondent in a
divorce action frorn marrying a person other
than his former spouse we probaàbly sliould
nlot prevent the guilty parties frorn cohabiting, and that the last state would be worse
than the first. 1 ar n ot at aIl sure of that.
I think I could present strong arguments
on the other aide. But, after alll, such argurnents would decide nothing; they would be
one mnan's opinion aganst another's. The
real question, the question which the Christian
mnust always consider, is tbis: Did the
Omniscient G.od legnislate on this subjeoi?
St. Paul and the Evangelists in the Bible
say tha.t Hie did, and that Hie made no provision for the guilty party or either party
rnarrying another. Therefore the opponents
of such legislation as I propose must ho]d
that Christ mnade a rnistake, that He d-id flot
realize the consequences cf His own teacliimg, and that we of the twentieth oentury
rnust correct these defects. To whiat terràble
conclusion does this reasoning Iead? It
ieads inevitably to the conclusion thiat Ch-rist
was not God. I could understand in atheist
or a pagan using sucli arguments, but I have
no idea, of ho-w a Christian could use thesn.
That is entirely beyond rne. They are, I
t-hink, a good illustration of the Ioase thinking of the age, and af the rnockery that a
large part of Cliristendorn is making of
Chiristianity.
It lias also been stated in this House and
elsewhere that ycu cannat make men moral
hy legislation and that the teaching of maraIs
is flot the primrary or particular duty of legielative bodies. Even if this is adrnitted. to
be true, it does flot follow that legislatures
should provide and legalize facilities for the
dcdng of evil; nor dces iii falIlow that legis-

259

lative bodies should not caîl attention to,
what rnay be sorne of the moral weaknesses
of aur social systern and age. I read muny
of the sermons published in the secular press
an Saturdays, Mandays and other days of
the week, and I hear over the radio sume
of the sermons preaclied on Sundays. While
goodn ess, mora:lity and aestheticisrn are
properly empliasized in there, if evil is
den.ounced ai ail it is denounccd in such
general terrms that no sinner in any congregation could be offended, no matter hýow influential or powerful le migît be. If John
the Baptist had been satisfied with ibis kind
of preaching, in ail hurnan pro'bability he
would have died in his led. But then le
would not have been John the BaptÀst.
A short tirne ago I read in a notable
English dýenominational publication an article
or sermon written or dclivered hy the Rev.
Dr. FoSdick, an outstanding Modern±ist, and
pastor of a very wealthy and fashionable
congregation in New York City. This article
or sermon was given first.page prorninence
in the publication referred ta. Hie stated that
he lad gotten away beyond Modernism and
was still progressing ta somne unknawn place
where very Iearned, scientific people would
be faund, anil wliere duc regard would be
given ta su-ch parts of Christianity as ta hirn
and thern seemed sensible. But the Christianity that we and aour fathers believed and practised would have to accammodate itself ta
the Iatest vagaries of the pseudo-scientists, or
get off the earth.
Newman, of whorn it was said that he had
a mind as sharp as a diarnond aad as clear
as the glass wbich the d.iarnonld cuts, saw
no confliat between religion and science. 0f
course lie saw no conflict: it would be bard
ta see what does flot exist. God is the author
of bath religion and science, and Gýod is truth.
Truil is neyer in confliet with itself. There
is hardly anything to-day that people will
not believe, or pretend ta believe, if presented
ta tbern in the name of science; and there ia
hardly anything which tîhe sarne people wilI
not doubt or dishelieve if presented ta them
as God's revelation ta moan. Yet if anything
in ibis world is certain it is that God spoke
ta man and is still spcaking to him. The
scbool ta which Dr. Fosdick belongs is large
and grawing, and I must ask: is Cornrunisrn
as preacbed and practised in Russia, Mexico
and other countries the greatest menace
Christianity bas ta face? In the countries
named, Coni.runisrn cornes more or less into
the open; it does not masquerade, ta the

became law in England in 1857. Again in
1800 a Bill similar to that now before uswas
introduced in the British House of Commons,
with the exception that it did not seek to
constitute adultery as a crime. The honourable gentleman would add a new crime to the
calendar, which is pretty well filled up already.
True, marriage is not a crime: to bring
yourself within the scope of the Bill you
must get married, then you must commit
adultery, and then you must marry again.
The whole basis of the Bill, I fancy, is adultery,
because without the commission of this act
there cannot possibly be any crime. And
British law-makers have never made adultery
a crime. It never was a crime under the law
of Great Britain or any other country that
I know of.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Do I understand the
honourable gentleman to say never?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Never.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: All right.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It has always been
the policy of Great Britain not to interfere
with the morals of the people with respect
to marital misconduct.
The honourable gentleman's whole argument
is directed against remarriage of divorced
persons. I am sure no one who has listened
to his speeches in this House would accuse
him of a desire to promote immorality. Certainly I should be the last one to accuse him
of such a purpose. But there cannot be the
least doubt that if his Bill became law it
would increase immorality among the people.
Let me give my honourable friend an
illustration. I refer him to a case which was
decided in the English courts in 1919. The
applicant for divorce, a captain in the British
army, on his return from the front found his
wife had neglected their children and was
leading an immoral life. He took the children
away and put them in charge of another
woman, with whom he lived. The judge held
that the plaintiff was guilty of adultery, but
that under the circumstances it was in the
interest of public morality to give him a
chance to marry the woman with whom he
was living. The King's Proctor intervened,
but the judgment of the trial court was
upheld. I am citing Wilson vs. Wilson, which
will be found in 1920 Law Reports (Probate)
at page 20. It is now regarded as a leading
case in support of the principle that in such
circumstances it is wise to grant a divorce
in order to put an end to the immoral relations
and let the children be brought up under
proper domestic conditions.
Prior to 1857 a poor man could not afford
the expense incident to divorce. Only the

very wealthy could obtain it, after securing
a judgment in the bigh court, then applying
to the ecclesiastical court for a divorce
a mensa et thoro-from bed and board-and
then filing a petition in the House of Lords.
Reverting to the question of immorality,
I may say that even as far back as 1771 the
argument that my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) has advanced here was advanced
in the House of Lords.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In 1771?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
In 1771. A Bill
similar to the present one was introduced
in the House of Lords and was rejected by
the Commons.
Here is what I find regarding Mr. Fox, that
great orator and contemporary of Burke:
Mr. Fox entered into a long discussion of
the Bill.... He took it up on the doctrine of
non-representation. which he said had been so
many years agitated in that House; he averred
the ladies to be totally unrepresented, therefore entitled to the most tender treatment in
cases where the sexes were to be distinguished.
He then inveighed against the Bill in its present
form. as unequal, unjust, and tyrannical, tending to do more hurt than good by preventing
the fair delinquents from making the only
atonement to society in their power for past
errors, and driving them to become common
prostitutes.
I think that if the honourable gentleman
had given more consideration to this Bill,
he undoubtedly would have found that it
would promote immorality among the people.
I am glad of an opportunity to say a few
words on the question of divorce. I think
that in Canada we have, without doubt, a
most disgraceful state of affairs. An applicant who is domiciled in Quebec has

goes to the other House, where it is referred
to a committee, and the case is tried over
again without the taking of any evidence at
all. Counsel are employed, and they go
among the members of that committee and'
use what influence they can, and make any
speeches they desire, and if the application
is defended and the respondent can bear
sufficient expense the Bill is likely to be
thrown out. That has happened time after
time. You can pretty well make up your
mind that if a case is defended strongly

passed which gave the courts in those provinces the same jurisdiction as was possessed
by the courts at Westminster. Automatically
the law of 1857 came into éffect. But this was
not known in the West, and in 1888, when there
was some doubt about what law was in force,
an Act was passed declaring that the law

DIVORCE AND

REMARRIAGE

BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READINGBILL REJECTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hughes for the second reading of Bill C, an
Act respecting the remarriage of certain
divorced persons.
Honourable
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
senators, whenever I hear any reference to
the subjects of marriage, divorce and remarriage I am reminded of that old Arab
proverb which says that marriage is like a
besieged fortress: those outside are desirous
of getting in, while those inside want to get
out. Like many another proverb, this is
partly truc and partly false. It is true that
most single people would like to marry, but
untrue that most married people desire to
become single again.
I welcome the opportunity of saying a few
words on this most interesting subject. I
find questions of marriage, divorce and re.marriage are vital matters about which most
persons, who have very little information on
the subject, are frequently wrong in their
conceptions.
In speaking in opposition to the motion for
second reading, I do not for a moment question the sincerity of the honourable senator
from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes), or those who
think along the same lines. Nevertheless, it
seems to me our time wauld be much better
occupied in giving thought as to how jurisdiction can be conferred on the province of
Quebec to enable its courts in future to deal
with matters of divorce. I base this statement on the fact that on a petition for
divorce the Parliament of Canada has no
jurisdiotion to grant alimony, order costs,
give damages or deal with the custody of
the children. The Superior Court would
have that jurisdiction and could allow costs,
give alimony, award damages, and make an
order for the custody of the children on one
and the same application. As the law stands,
the petitioner loses costs, damages and alimony, and is obliged, at considerable cost,
to make a new application to the Quebec
courts for the custody of his or her children.
There is another aspect of this important
question which is occupying the attention of
the people of England, and also of Canada,
namely, the reform of our divorce laws, not
in the direction advocated by the sponsor of
this Bill, but in the opposite direction, and it
seems to me that we might more fittingly
spend our time talking reform than talking
restriction. To place further restrictions than
those already existing, when the whole world

SENATE
is clamouring for more freedom, is in my
opinion the height of folly.
Those who oppose reform in our divorce
laws are confused by the thought that divorce
is an evil in itself, whereas divorce is really
a remedv to cure the evil, and has been called
"a safetv-valve."
In a book recantly published under the
SoIf "Marrid Mi-ry
Lord Buckmaster
points out that in England no one can obtain
a divorce for any of the following causes:
incurable insanity, incurable drunkenness,
homicidal mania, life sentence for crime, perpetual desertion, persistent cruelty; nor can
a woman obtain a divorce because she
bas been infected by lier lusband, unless
there is evidence of adultery, or because her
husband has forced her to submit to prostitution. As a result thousands of applications
are made yearly for separation. Another book
called[ "Holy Deadlock" bas, I think, been
read by several members of our Divorce
Committee, and is well worth perusal.
In Germany it is considered against public
policy to grant a separation without liberty
to remarry. I would ask honourable senators if thev do not think the German view is
sound. If it is sound. then our law and
practice must b wrong.
In Norway separations are granted on
mutual request, and are later convertible into
divorce, with the right to remarry. No one
would 'reriouisly contend, I think, that there
is more scandalous immorality in Norway
and Germany than, say, in Italy or Spain, or
that Sootland, where divorce is granted for
mualicious desertion, is worse off morally than
England, wbich does not grant divorce on
that ground.
I have taken the trouble to read the
speech made by the honourable senator from
King's on April 4, 1935, on the subject of
divorce. I have also read again the debate
Dn the Bill wbich he sponsored later on that
.ear, which debate was participated in by
meveral honourable members. That Bill was
ntended
to
prexvent the remarriage of
:livorced persons to other than their former
spouses. and was dropped without receiving
second reading. This Bill does n-ot go so
far, but is merely intended to prevent the
remarriage of the guilty .party. Still J say
that it would be contrary to public policy
to enact such a measure. It seems to me to
be quite clear from the remarks of the honourable sponsor of the Bill that he is opposed
to divorce being granted to any married per.on on any ground whatsoever. No matter
how grave the marital offence might be, he
would have the married couple continue
living together. or would have the marriage
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

left undissolved, but have them live separate
and apart from each other. In either case
the probable result would be that one or
hoth would live in adultery.
The honourable senator, however, does not
openly advocate doing away with divorce. He
merely advocates that Parliament put a curb
on divorce by forbidding the delinquent
spouse to remarry and by making it a
criminal offence for such person to do so,
either in Canada or abroad.
In his speech of a year ago, be refers to
the increase in divorce in the last thirtyfive or forty years. I would point out to
him that there are those good reasons for the
increase: (1) our population, was small;
(2) d.ivorce by Parliament was expensive;
(3)
the Western Provin es had net disecovered that they had the right to grant
divorces; (4) now all provinces but one
have the right; (5) divorce is now cheaper
and courts have full power over costs,
alimony, damages and custody of children.
It is .only natural, therefore, that there
should be macny more divorces at the present
time th:an there were thirty-five or forty
yîars ago.
A brief suuîmary of the history of marriage,
divorce and renuIrriage niight be helpful to
a fuller understanding of the subject. After
this speech had been prepared I ran across
an article in the January, 1936, number
of the Quarterly Retview, London, which is
so much in point that I feel I should quote
the opening paragraph. The writer says:
Mulih of the controversy about divorce
revolves around religious scruples, and the
interpretation of Holy Scripture; but a great
deal of muddled thinking is due to a nisconception of the nature and history of the
institution of marriage. The London Gazette
some tine ago contained the announcement of
a royal bethrothal. It referred to a "contract
of matrimoniy." That, in fact, is exactly what
a ceremony of marriage always is: a contract.
It is always a contract: it can also be a
sacrament to those who believe it to be so,
and to no others. The mistake is to insist
upon its being a sacrament and to forget that
it is a contract.
flic English legal definition of marriage is
entirely satisfactory: in an English court it
simply means the voluntary union for life of
one man and one woman to the exclusion of
ail others. "For life." of course, refers to the
intention of the parties at the time of making
the contract, and does not impart the idea of
irrevocability in all circumstances.
As to forrms and ceremonies, these may be
religious if the parties wish, but there is no
necessity for anything but a civil contract.
Many people think that marriage is a Divine
institution, but actually
the history of
marriage shows it to be something quite
different. Mr. Cecil Chapman says:

MAY 7,1936
Historically, it is nothing of the kind. It is
the product of social evolution, and has been
the subject of change and growth controlled
by cosmic or universal laws, exactly in the
sane way as political and all other human
institutions have been. It is not a discovery,
but a growth from the necessity of human
nature. It bas in consequence taken every
variety of form, from simple concubinage
terminable at will to polyandry, ... polygamy,
. monogamy.
Another writer says that "Marriage is the
oldest and most universal of all human institutions." If we go back to the Chinese annals
we find that in the very beginning of society
men differed not at all from the animals in
their way of life. They wandered up and
down the land; they had no restraint, no laws,
no morality. Women were held in common.
Later we come to the first mention of marriage.
The Chinese Emperor Fow-Hi is supposed to
have invented marriage. The Egyptians say
it was Menes; the Greeks give the credit to
Kekrops; the Indian legends say it was Prince
Swetapetu.
The Bible narrative is contained in Genesis,
chapter 2, the 18th to the 25th verse. The
wedding ritual was extremely simple:
-and the rib, which the Lord God had taken
from the man, maide he a woman, and he
broughît ber unto the man.
I repeat the last seven words, "and lie brought
her unto the man." That is all, there was to
if in those days. Primitive man married without any religious or civil ceremony, and even
in sorne modern countries, like Japan, a
wedding ritual is considered all but superfluous.
Our chief marriage ceremonies have been
derived from heathen customs. such as espousal
gifts, which were a guarantee that the marriage
would take place, and the ring which was
the token of fidelity.
Amongst the Mohammedans marriage was
merely a civil contract; and so it was with
the ancient Hebrews. According to the Old
Testament, and the Talmud, marriage was not
a religious ordinance, or sacrament, but rather
a civil contract; and there was no restriction
whatever on divorce and remarriage.
With the Romans there were three modes
of marriage: Confarreatio-a ceremony before
ten witnesses, the sacrifice of an ox, and the
division of a wheat cake amongst the participants and witnesses; Coemptio in manuma sort of fictitious sale of the woman to the
man; and Usus--by prescription-one year's
co-habitation without the wife being absent
for three consecutive nights. Nevertheless, a
valid Roman marriage could be concluded
by interchange of consent; that is, by offer and
acceptance, which are the gist of every civil
contract, even to-day.

267

It is not my intention to deal with the
easy morality of those olden times, except to
say that many reputable men were accustomed
to lend their wives to their friends, and
divorce was frequent and easy. There were
no restrictions whatever with respect to remarriage.
There were three principal forms of
marriage: monogamy-the condition of having
one wife; polygamy-the state of having more
than one wife; and polyandry-a system under
which the woman bas more than one husband,
and which prevails even to-day in arid, driedout countries like Tibet. I do not recommend
it for Canada, even in the dried-out areas.
It wi'll be seen that marriage is a very
ancient institution; that it was a contractual
relation between the man and the woman, and
not a religious sacrament.
Divorce is just as ancient as marriage, and
is just as fuly sanctioned by history, necessity
and authority. If you read the 24th chapter
of Deuteronomy you will find the following:
When a man hath taken a wife and married
her, and it come to pass that she find no
favour in his eyes, because he hath found some
uncleanliness in ber, then let him write her a
bill of divorcement, and give it in ber hand,
and send lier out of his bouse. And when she
is departed out of his bouse, she may go and
be another man's wife.
This law was in force in Abraham's time, and
continued to be accepted by the Jews until
the eleventh century. It was quite consistent
with the patriarchal system in vogue. The
head of a family could divorce his wife at
By way of example, we have
pleasure.
Abraham's divorcement of Hagar. This was
the simplest of all forms of divorce. There
were no lawyers, no courts, no delay; the
husband merely appointed himself the chairman of the divorce committee, and granted
himself a favourable decree. And in every
case the divorced wife could remarry.
The Mosaie law as stated in Deuteronomy
was in force when Christ was on earth. In
the 19th chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew
we read that he was questioned with respect
to this law. He was also asked why Moses
commanded the giving of a writing of divorcement. Jesus, although declaring against the
breadth of the Mosaic law, did not declare
against divorce. Quite the contrary, for He
said:
Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
it be for fornication, and shall marry another,
committeth adultery.
So much for that angle of the case. There
is another angle which bas an important bearing, namely, the dogma that marriage is a
sacrament. I have said that from the beginning of time the marriage relationship was

SENATE

The reasons are: first, very few people know
anything about free ports; second, still fewer
want to know anything about free ports;
third, what the majority know about free
ports is mostly wrong. I might add a fourth
reason, that much of what is claimed in favour
of free ports sounds so paradoxical to the
uninitiated. People will accept without demur
the statement that the free port of Hamburg
has made Germany prosperous, for apparently
they are ready to believe alnost anything
about a distant country; but tell them that
a free port on the St. Lawrence would add
to the prosperity of all cities on this river,
and they are likely to smile incredulously.
Probably the name given te this particular
system of port operation is misleading and
arouses prejudice. It is more aptly described
in the title of the Bill-free foreign trade
zones. This description should at least help
to remove the common but false impression
that a free port is a port where everything
is free.
The public might be educated te think
of a free port as a huge open-air bonded warehouse covering an area of several square
miles, on which individual importers are at
liberty to ereet buildings for the storage of
their goods. In a word, a free port is a port
free from customs duties.
Before we study the national advantages
of free ports, we must consider their advantages to the shipper of goods. If we can show
that it would be te the advantage of a firm
shipping goods from, say, Liverpool to Minneapolis to land ther at a free port in Canada, we can proceed to demonstrate that
Canada would benefit by the increased shipping business resulting from the unloading of
goods out of ocean-going vessels, and their
reloading at Montreal or elsewhere into canal
boats or lake steamers for transit to destinatien. But still greater advantages accrue, as
I hope to convince honourable meinbers before
I resume my seat.
To the importer the outstanding attraction
of the free port is that he is free of all customs worries. He can discharge his cargo
at the wharf and store it in the warehouse,
without paying customs d.uties. The free port
area is walled and barricaded as securely as
a jail. No goods can be transferred te the
protected country surrounding that area unless
customs duties bave first been paid; but so
long as the goods remain in storage the
vexatious problem of customs duties sim:ply
does not exist for the importer. If after a
few weeks or months he decides, say, to ship
his goods to Detroit, he loads them on to a
vessel, pays his warehousing and habour
charges, and has no more worry about CanaHon. Mr. RAINVILLE

dian customs than if the ship in which the'
originally rea,ched Canada had sailed right up
the St. Lawrence and through the Grea-t Lakes
to the point of destination in the United
States.
The advantage is obvious. All the inconvenience of paying customs duties and then
claiming drawback for re-export is donc away
with. Reserve stocks of commodities can be
stored within a few days' or, in many cases,
a few heurs' journey of ultimate destination,
without the trouble and expense of paying
customs duties at once, or carting the goods
to an expensive bonded warehouse near the
port.
Again, assenbling and processing can ce
done in the free port area without prelim:inary payment of customs duties and the
probability of subsequent claiming of drawbacks. For instance, parts of automobiles,
sewing
machines,
agricultural
machinery,
pianos, electrical apparatus, watches, and so
on, could be imported from various countries,
wherever obtainable on the best terms, assembled in the free port by Canadian labour,
and then shipped out to destination. If this
destination were in Canada, of course customs would be payable; if in a foreign couîntry, the question of duty would i
only
'v
when the goods arrived there. Goods imported in bulk could be repacked. bottled
and blended without interference fron our
customs officers.
The advantage to importers of goods for
sale or manufacture in North America is selfevident. The advantage to Canada would
be that such a free port would become the
maritime transhipment and distribution centre
of the whole American Middle West.
There can be no doubt that until Hanburg
became a free port Great Britain enjoyel a
monopoly of the transhipment trade of Western Europe. Because of Free Trade-whatever may be our opinion in regard to this
as a fiscal policy-Great Britain became the
clearing-house of Europe. Hamburg is now
one of the four greatest ports of the world,
and the concurrent development of the German merchant marine is well known.
Canada would need several free ports. Each
would naturally be a location for warchouses
and ass-cmbling plants preferred by importers
of goods fron the old world for distribution
all over North America, particularly if it
were so situated as to give quick, cheap and
convenient transportation to all parts of the
continent. The saving and convenience resulting from net having to pay customs duties
until such time as the goods were shipped into
protected territory would induce many manu-

MAY 7, 1936
facturers and importers in Canada and the
United States, and also exporters from countries overseas, to establish warehouses and
factories within the free port area. This, in
turn, would attract a great deal of shipping,
warehouaing and manufacturing business.
Another outstanding advantage accruing to
Canada would be the increa.ecl marine freight
accommodation.
There has at times been
considýerable complaint about the difficulty of
bringing coal to Canada from the Old Country,
becauýke vessels could not find return freights
from Saint John, Halifax, Quebec and Montreal. It is not profitable for a vessel to corne
to Montreal with coal and then have to proceed to a distant port empty or in ballast.
Io other years we have seen the opposite
condition-the port of Montreal congested
with wheat, and no vessais available to carry
it overseas, simply because there had been
no shipping business into Montreal. In other
worda, shipowners could. not afford to send
their boats to Montreal empty or in ballast
in order to take our wheat out.
The canal boats also meet with this difficulty. They carry wheat to the porta of
Montreal, Sorel, Quebec-and soon will bring
it to Three Rivera also-and they cannot find
return eargoes. So in nine cases out of ten
wheat brought down the St. Lawrence is
charged with expense of the ratura trip of
the ship in ballast.
Thosa difficultias would to a certain axtant
be solved by the free port. With the additional shipping activity, both tran.satlantic
and coastwise, there would always be a
aufficient nunvber of ships coming to the free
port with goods to assure our grain exportera
of adequate tonnage to take their grain
ovarseas; and whether there was grain awaiting shipment or not, vessela bninging goods
to Canada would ha reasonably assured in
advance of finding a cargo for soma part of
the world at Montreal, Quebee, Sorel or
T.hrea Rivera. Every Canradian export and
import business would benefit, because shipowners, knowing that they were sure of a
reaisonably profitable -cargo both waya, eould
afford to quote bed-rock figures on freight
rates and charters.
This question of free ports is not a ne 'w
one. The Harbour Commi.ssioners of Montreal
have pronounced many times in favour of the
system. The annual reporta of the harbour,
under George W. Stephena, Caneral Ross and
others, contain favourable references to the
syste.m.
If we wish to go further back it is intereating to note that Canada had two free porta
in 1859.

1 have here the National Revenue Review
of January, 1934, which contains an article
entitled "When Canada Had Free Porta.
Let me quota a few lines from this. It saya:
The story of Customs and Excise as ravealed

reachied the Editor f romn widely separated
poits in Canada, has proved of intarest to
Inany readers of the Review, and the Editor
is pleased to continue these brief sketches fromn
time to time. The following was taken fromi
a volume printed at Toronto, in 1859, entitlecl
"Customs, Excise and Commercial Laws of
Canada." It records, among other things, the
estahlishing hy Queen Victoria by Royal
Proclamation, of Gaspé Basin and Sault Ste.
Marie as free ports. Georges Etianne Cartier
was Attorney-General when the first proclamation was issued and John A. Mhcdonald when
the second was issued.
Then follows the proclamation constituting
those two free ports. I shall not take time
to read it now.
Some honourable members may asIc why
these two free porta no longer exist. The
rea.son is that Gaspé lacked the rail connections wbich are so essential to a free port,
and Sault Ste. Marie, because of a lack of
depth in the canals, could only be reached by
small boata,
and
apparently
this was
uneconomical.
Free ports have made phenomenal progress
in Europe during the last century. Germany
bas had the free porta of Hamburg, Bremen,
Lübeck, Kiel, and, aince 1924, Flensburg and
Koenigsberg.

In Denmark, there is one splendidly organized free port, Copenhagen, which has been
in operation aince 1894. Copenhagen is to-day
a vaast clearing-house. It is a centre for the
breaking up and storing of cargoes, the
fabrication of raw materials assembled from
overseas, and transhipment to aIl parts of
Northern Europe. For centuries it waa an
important shipping centre, but not un-til the
creation of the free port in 1894 did its- era
of greatness begin.
In Italy, Genoa is a free port, and, according to a law passed in Decemnber, 1927, there
may be from fiva to eight more. In Swedan
there are three free ports: Stockholm, GothanSpain hms Barcelona;
bourg and Malmo.
Greece bas Salonika; Hlungary has Budapest

This is not by any means a complote ist,
there beng many other free ports, soine of
them in Africa. It is a wonder that, except
foi' Buenos Aires, and Nueva Palmira, on the
River de la Plata. froe ports have not yet
been etablished in Anerica.
But New York is aw.ikening. I find in the
New York Times of February 2, 1936, an
article witlh the following title:
Free Port Offers Boon to Trade. In the

door to a consideration of whcre one or more
frec ports can best be located in Cniiiida.
Montreal, Saint John, Quebec. Halifax. Vancouver and Victoria have all been mentioned
as suitable places for such ports. I belive
it would ultimately be profitable for Canada
to have froe ports at or near each of these
Canada's dimensions and the implaces.
portance of her trade are such as te justify
that number of free ports. One would not
be too much to have on the west coast:
Victoria seems a very favourablo location.
As the St. Lawrence river is closed te navigatien for four months of every year, it would
be very important for the continuity of free
port facilities to have a port at, say. Saint
John or Halifax to carry on the work when
the St. Lawrence is elosed.
But Montreal
has outstanding claims as a suitable location
for such a port. It has a more central location, in respect of easy access to all parts of
thie continent in which it is located, than
any other port in the world.
All of the
world's greatest seaports are located as far
inland as possible.
Montreal enjoys the
advantage of being 960 miles from the sea.
Furthermore, apart from being at the head
of a colossal notwork of railways, including
the two greatest systems of their kind in the
w'orld. it offers easy and inexpensive canal,
Hon. Mi. RAINVILLE

river and lake transportation to an enormous
portion of the most industrially active parts
of Canada and the United States.
Convenient water transport and short rail-hauls
provide access to virtually every busy section
of the United States and to the principal
industrial centres of Canada. If the river
St. Lawrence were navigable by ocean vessels
all the way to Lake Ontario, Toronto would
be an excellent location for the establishment of a froc port; but Montreal is an
ideal distributing centre for the whole of
the East and the Middle West of North
America.
When I speak of a free port at Montreal I
mean at the port of Montreal, net on the
Island of Montreal. The jurisdiotion of the
port of Montreal extends to both sides of
the river as far as the county of Portneuf,
125 miles froi the city, whereas the harbour
extends only about sixteen miles on both
shores, up to high-water mark.
A froc port within the limits of the present
Montreal harbour is not thinkable. Where
within the present harbour could the Dominion Governnent find the necessary waterfront and vacant land to est'ablish it? Free
port facilities cannot be mixed up with bonded
warehouses and all the paraphernalia of a
regular protected port. The result would be
confusion worse confounded.
Montreal harbour has all the business it can be expieted
to liandle with its present facilities and under
the present methîod of operation.
On the south shore of the river St. Lawrence there is an abundance of water frontage
and land available et modest prices as far
down as the progressive city of Sorel. which
would be an ideal place for a free port.
This stretch of land forms a "V" botween the
St. Lawrence river and the Richelieu river,
and co.uld be securely walled off and barricaded on the land side, and customs offices
and all the adjuncts of the protectionist
regime could be set up on the roads and railways at points of exit from the free port
area, to colleet cistoms taxes on goods which
left the free area for destinations in Canada.
The hulk of the goods destined to points
within Canada would be taken by lighters to
the port of Sorel or up the river from the
free port te the present Montreal harbour,
and -on arrival at Sorel or Montreal would
come under the attention of customs authorities. Goods intended to be shipped by canal,
river and lake to points in Canada could be
tra.nsferred direct from the lighters to barges
or lake steamers. Ships would bring cargoes
into the free port. and would tither take
cargoes out of the free port or come to
Montreal harbour, Sorel, Three Rivers or

MAY 7,1936
Quebec to seek outwa'rd cargoes there. The
aniount of M-on:treal hanbour's existing business diverted to, the free port would lie
negligilile, cûmpared with the amou-nit of
additional. business t.he free port would hand
over to the harbo>ur.
I see in the Estimates that hall a million
dollars have been or will .be voted for making
a deeper waterway on the Richelieu river.
No doubt this will lie done in conjunction
with the seheme wit.h respect to which some
Canadian engineers (recently went to Washington. The project is to get deep navigation from New York via Hudson river, Whitehall canal, Lake Champlain and Charnhly
canal dlown to, the St. Lawrence at Sorel. I
venture to predict that if this project is consummated the business c&ning to, the free
port bebween Sorel and M-ontreal, despite
the fact that the St. Lawrence is closed
four months in the year, wil be more substantial than that going bo the free port
zone of Staten Island, near New York. I
make that prediction because of the favourable location of Montreal, to which 1 have
aiready r-eferred. When I was chairma~n of
the Montreal Hai'bour Commission I read
an înteresting bookiet contai'ning bitter coinplaints from the eastern provinces that so
muich of our Canadian bu.siness was going
through the por~t of New York, for which
fact the shippers were blamed. Three or four
days later it was stated in the newspapers
that members of the Shipping Federation
had answered this criticismn.
One of the
points they made was that whenever patriotism and the dollar come into confliet the
dollar wins. Now, I want to state to honouïra.ble senatocs as strongly as I can thtat I
do not believe it is true that we get more
for our dollar in the United States than
in Canada. Let me cite an instance to show
that it is not true. Frorn my o'wn files I
have extracted a document deýaling wïth
handling charges in the port of New York.
Port Information Bulletin No. 2 of the Port
of New York Authoirity, page 14, states:
Service is not cheap in the Port of New
York.
I am quoting fromn one df their own documente.
About 1921 the Port of New York Authority
was formed, and one of its principal functions
was to attempt by unification of the hundreds
of confiicting and diverse interests in the port
of New York to straighten out the tangle of
traffic, and attempt to reduce port handling
costs.
Elaborate surveys were made, and amongst
other things the cost of bringing abag of
potatoes from the Middle West to New York
was carefully noted. It was found that after
the car containing the bag of potatoes in

question reached New York, the subsequent
costs of handling from one point to another
in the congested port district were greater
than the cost of moving it by rail f rom the
Middle West to New York.
The Summary of Joint Report of the New
York-New Jersey Port and Harbour Development Commission, publiýhed in 1921, states,
with regard to the coste of cargo transfer:
A detailed study *as made of the discharging and loading costs of two of the slips
covered by the Commission's clockings. These
ships showed direct discharging costs of $1.13
and $1.28 respectively per ton, and direct loading costs of $1.53 and $1.75 per ton respectively. These figures take no account of the
cost of bringing the ship to port, of docking
it or of maintenance of shîp or pier.
As honourable mem-bers are aware, shipping
companies ini New York have their own
wharves.
The Summary also stat-es:
The Commission's analysis gives the following figures for railroad operating costs in 1914:
For goods handled at Manhattan car-float pier
stations or inland rail stations, $1.60 per ton;
for goods handled at Brooklyn, Harlem or
Bronx stations, $1.48 per ton; for goods lightered, $2.14 per ton.
These figures cover only the cost to the
carrier. To arrive at the full cost of handling
the f reight within the port district there
should lie added substantial sums for trucking
and handling by local shipper or consignes
between his plant and the railroad station or
other point of delivery.
On the basis of 1918 prices the Commission
estimates that the total terminal costs to the
railroads were about $2.25 per ton for freight
hiandled to or f rom Manhattan stations, $2.08
for that handled to or from Brooklyn, Harlemn
or Bronx stations and $3.01 for freight liglitered.
Now, honourable senators, the cost of loadlng a full cargo of grain in Montreal runs from

only 50 cents to 90 cents a ton, depending on
the character of the slip, the num-ber of baga
required, and sn on. It is evident that in
handling charges and services the port of New,
York and surrounding district cannot compete
with us. So the argument that the dollar
always wins when it cornes into confiet with
patriotisma does not apply, and some

other

reason must lie looked for.

Sorel and Montreal have a real opportunity
here to help Canada compete with New York
in a business with respect to which the odids
are greatly in our favour.
I want to make some reference to the question of cost. A well-managed port really costs
the Government nothing. Port dues more
than cover the cost of operation, including
interest on borrowed money. The varionus
shipping dues are usually somewhat heavier
in free ports than in ordinary protected ports.
This indicates that free port revenues would
be bigger. Necessary funds would be readily
available for initial expenditures on free ports,
because they are an excellent business enterprise, and there is little doubt that resulting
traffic would abundantly pay interest and
operating costs. There is a further consideration. The ad-ditional traffic that would come
here because of free ports would increase the
revenues of all neighbouring ports.
In leaving these few points with you, honourable senators, I would throw out a brief
warning. The day may come when it will be
too late for Canada to seek to establish free
ports as a means of attracting a big share of
the trans'hipment and distribution businesses,
which this country is so well equiprped to
handle because of its marvellous arteries of
commerce-the St. Lawrence river and our
great railroads. It does not take much to
cause a country to lose trade, but the regaining of trade once lost is a difficult and slow
process. Gustave LeBon says: "The number
of people who have missed opportunities is
greater than the number to whom opportunities have failed to come." The present
Bill gives Canada a very valuable and important opportunity to establish free ports.
I should like my closing word to be one
of praise of the honourable senator from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), who,
through this measure, is paving the way for
Government action.

CANADIAN COLONIZATION PLAN
MOTION

AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE rose to move the
following resolution:
While recognizing the necessity of utilizing
our immense territory according to a rational
plan of exploitation and colonization, this House
is of opinion that:
(a) immigration into Canada must be conducted along lines of the greatest prudence,
su as to protect our traditions, strengthen our
institutions, and also so as not to complicate
our national problems nor aggravate those
affecting agriculture and unemployment;
(b) that the repatriation of emigrated
Canadians should be efficiently encouragedbefore any other immigration;

MAY 12, 1936
(c) the emigration of naturalized Canadians
should be controlled in such a way as to reduce
it to its lowest possible form, if not to prohibit
it altogether.
He said: Honourable members, the very
nature of my argument in support of this
motion is such that, in order to express clearly
my thoughts with regard to it, I am once
more compelled to speak in my mother tongue.
In doing this I do not wish my colleagues to
interpret my action as a determination to
speak only in French, and in my next attempt
to address this Chamber I shall speak in the
language of the majority of its members.
Through consideration for this majority I
will now endeavour to explain in a few words
the fundamental nature of my address. The
few lines contained in my motion cover the
whole ground of the populating of our country
and express the full meaning of my thoughts
on this subject. I am approaching the matter,
not from a narrow point of view, but with
one main idea-the real and true interest of
Canada. I am not opposed to an immigration
policy which is limited by the real needs and
conditions of the country. I realize that this
question must be examined, not froma the
standpoint of racial considerations, but from
the point of view of the country at large. I
advance the claims of a system of colonization
which will not complicate our agricultural
problems, but will conform to the needs of
production and commerce. I wish to see
immigrants who will come here not as
conquerors, but as true collaborators with
our people, and who will respect the laws and
institutions of the land, intent only on the
national development of this country.
(Official Translation): Honourable senators,
the motion I have the honour to submit to
your due consideration speaks for itself. It
relates to a problem as old as the world, since,
according to one writer, "Universal history is
but the record of migrations." Did not the
Supreme Ruler say: "Crescite ac multiplicamini
et replete terram?" At all times the immigration problem has been the great concern of
the leading minds in all civilized nations,
though it was never the subject-matter of any
defined political or economical planning. Like
most other problems, immigration dependa on
conditions and circumstances peculiar to any
country.
One cannot but feel both admiration and
regret when reading, in the most reliable
records, of errors, blunders and abuses going
on precisely at the time when, at the price
of blood and great sacrifices, a small people,
numbering but 60,000, forgotten by its motherland, kept up such a wonderful resistance as
to render possible its miraculous survival.

The history of nations, ours included,
teaches one great lesson, that is the necessity
of a much more rational, human, Christian
and national policy of settlement than the
policy followed in the past. That which
obtained at certain periods during the nineteenth century, not to speak of other days,
was far from edifying.
In Canada why should not the primary
races, custodians of our institutions, consider
it their duty to get closer, to unite on a
common ideal, and so give the foreigner or
new-comer the impressive example and
splendid spectacle of fellowship and solidarity? Such solidarity would bind Canadians
still more firmly to their own land, compel a
better selection cf immigrants, and also compel countries with a population desirous of
settling elsewhere, to cease evincing that
contempt so much in evidence in the exportation of their undesirable and guilty ones as
it was in the last century and after.
Proud of being a nation, Canada must therefore strive to signalize herself according to her
resources, and still more by the character of
her people than by her physical wealth.
Human assets and natural wealth are the
two main factors which make for the greatness
of a nation.
In his splendid survey of rural conditions
and problems in Canada, Mr. Thomas Adam
wisely shows that "conservation of human and
natural resources means not only good husbanding of what we have, but also planning
for our future growth."
That is why my motion covers the economie
moral, national and social features of the
problem. Immigration, restriction of emigration, and bringing back those who so desire:
these are the three main points to be considered in the settlement of our country.
And that is why I thought so vast a question worthy of the patriotic attention of this
Upper House which I have the honour to
address.
Of course, the purpose of my modest observations is not to teach but rather to invite
opinions from a group of men trained in the
study and solution of our problems, from the
point of view of the highest interests of the
country, so that in the inspiring light of such
wide outlooks the possibilities, obstacles and
wisest solutions may appear more clearly.
In every parliament since this House has
been in existence, different features of this
question have been dealt with authoritatively
by honourable senators.
Over twenty-five years ago our honourable
friend for Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Paquet), then a
member of the House of Commons for L'Islet,

SENATE

276

was among those who viewed with alarm and
denounced the policy of excessive immigration,
the insignificant methods of repatriation and
the lack of control with regard to emigration
of Canadians.
I am sure that our colleagues would listen
with pleasure to an analysis by my honourable
friend of the debates of that time on this
matter. So I pass on.
The fact that, under one form or another,
immigration is still advocated in Canada by
various organizations, provincial legislatures,
newspapers, and men of indisputable influence and activity, justifies my motion, and
indeed strengthens it.
At such a stage in our economic life it
would be idle to deny the importance of knowing what our immigration policy will be in the
immediate future. It would be foolish also to
deny the urgency of a well-defined plan in
regard to immigration, emigration and the
bringing home of those who are willing to come
back. A full discussion of such a question in a
country like Canada is certainly a delicate
matter. It often tends to misunderstandings,
imputations of motives, excessive and rasi
judgnents, regrettable accusations and frictions which frequently are the result of poor
training and very detrimental to the country
and the two races intended to be protected
under oui Constitution. For the irritation
resulting front the fight between the advocates
of intensive immigration and the ultra-nationalists bas not yct dicd out. Consequently
I propos( to deal with the matter in such a
way as to sereen myself against the least suspicion of racial or political fanaticism or narrow provincialism, and even of that dislike of
strangers which causes one to see in every
foreigner a suspicions individual. I am one
of those who believe that Canadian problems
iust lte considered with that broadmindedness
bofitting inhabitants of a country so vast in
territory and so rich in natural resources,
and wifh due respect for bistorical facts. But
that does not mean that the two main races,
or either of them, ought to permit or tolerate
contempt for their rights, their traditions and
their common or respective institutions.
To my mind it would be unfair, illogical and
useless for a minority, whatever its constitutional or other special rights, to try to prevent
the rational settlement of Canada ont of fear
of being weakened or submerged. I do not
know that such a school of thought exists in

choice, the fitness, and mentality of the immigrants; and also the possible ulterior design,
on the part of certain partisans of intensive
immigration, to repress or get rid of the descendants of the pioneers of the country. That
is a view I heartily share, as, I am sure, do all
true friends of Canada and fairness. I am satisfied that, true to its principle, jurisdiction and
constitution as defined and provided by the
Fathers of Confederation, the Senate acts according to reason and justice, without yielding to popular anger and prejudices. It bas been
shown more than once that it is to the
interest of Canada to keep in this country the
descendants of the first settlers. If at certain
times the sons of Canada had been dealt with
more justly, we should have been spared the
disastrous migrations which so seriously complicated our problems, altered our institutions
and wenkened our economic structure.
In order to stop or prevent such migrations,
I wonder if the leading inds of both races
would not consider that the time bas come to
meet and agree on aspirations acceptable to
both, to be termed Canada's Creed.
It iS in Canada's interest to welcome immigrants of the right class, willing to be honest,
friendly and respectful partners, and to share
with iheni the benefits of lier wealth; but not
to receive concealed or avowed revolutionists
baving but contempt for her treaties, her Constitution and lier rights. We need co-operators
ready to help us solve our problems, instead of
people whose presence would of necessity complicate them.
But it would be unfair and intolerable to bave
immigrants settling here as daring conquerors
and defying invaders, full of scorn for the will
of the native people and their devotion to their
country.
Errors and abuses committed at home even
as late as the first part of the twentieth century,
and previously in other countries, should serve
as warning. Canada, with a population of only
ten millions, is already suffering from a moral
and econornic deformation due to an excessive
immigration policy actuated wholly by materialistic motives instead of by national ideals
such as should govern our anticipations and
activities. Allow me to quote a splendid
thought eloquently expressed by the Right
Hon. Lloyd George:
Nothing could be more fatal to a nation than
to concentrate its mind exclusively on the material
needs of the moment. National ideals without
vision are but thistles in the desert, of no use
either as food or fuel. A nation relying on
that only is bound to die. After the war we
shall have better workshops, but we shall need
more than ever institutions capable of lifting
the minds of the people above workshops and
shop-counters. We shall need every national

tradition recalling ta men that they cannot
live on bread alone.
Let the real Canadian leader work out the
solution of our problems in the liglit of such
lofty ideals. That d-oes flot mean neglecting
and seorning material things. They are indispensable. I would, fot have my compatriats
believe that Canadians must live only on
ideals and traditions. Our duty is ta make
Canadian life attractive ta the new-comers,
enticing by its idealistie manifestations and
respectful devotion ta commendable customs;
and assimilating 'by a solid education and
sound methads of economic development.
"Generally, trees rooted through atones 'bear
but poor fruit's', writes Frederic Gerbier, in
his colourful way. What a splendid thought,
considered in the light of aur history. Ta the
general astonishment, however, some miracu'lously withstand and go on persistently
producing. They are from strong stock, that
is from pioneers of a well-tempered faith.
A great Frenchman and a goed friend of
Canada, Monsieur Rameau, said one day,
when visiting Montreal: "The transplanting
of men requires as mueh care and causes as
many difficulties as does the transplanting of
trees; for one must make sure that they root
anew sa as ta adapt thems9elves properly t-o
thpir new life."
That indeed should be the guiiding principle of aur immigration policy. Count de
Gobineau recommends an understanding of
how ta graf t the stock so that it may not only
survive, but prasper.
Dr. René Martial, in charge of a course of
lessons on immigration at the Health Institutý
of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris, holds
however that interracial grafting is not alwa.ys
easy nor effective. Non-assimilation has hurt
many great nations wben unassimilable immigrants became centers of contamination and
inveterate enemies. True it is that some
Canadians are no better, while many newcorners are valuable auxiliaries and great uphalders of their adopted land. History
abounds with such examples. Gobineau, a
French writer an sociology, says that the
French people w*ere, from the start, after the
Gallo Romans, a blend of races without
paralle]. This explains why sa many Frenchmen
bear such foreign namnes as ta astound FrenchCanadians. Well, in Canada, we have Wilson
and many other names of Bnglish, Dutch,
Italian and variaus other arigîna borne by
people who have turned Frencb-Canadians,
while many Canadians with French-Canadian
names bave turned English or Irish. But, on
the who]e, assimilation wvas rather uncammon
in Canada. Did the two races in a position

that the iFreneh-Canadians, layai ta the British
crawn and British institutions, would xiat
attempt ta use it as a means of ehecking the
majority.
During the nineteenth century about fil ty
per cent of European emigrants, that is over
twenty millions of people, went ta the United
States.
Though English is the language
learned at American schools and spoken everywhere, there are still alI aver that country many
unassimilated groupa eausing an.xiety and
seriaus trouble.
In bis history of migrations, M.r. R. Connard, professor of law, of the Faculty of Lyon,
shows that the United States, anxious about
the weakening effect of immigration, decided
ta restrict it vigorously. That policy has
been accentuated since the War, but was
worke-d out before. "The rush of immigrants
composed mostly of people deemed ta be of a
low class, destitute, poorly trained and more
or less sound, determined," says hie, "a reaction
already started among the working men afraid
af the ensuing and ever increasing competition
of cbeap labour." Mr. Connard. states that the
United States is flot the only averseas country
with a prohibitive or restrictive immigration
policy. Australia and South Af rica closed
their doors ta Asiatics. He also points out
that Canada, formerly sa wide open, did like
the United States, especially with regard ta
Asiatir, immigration.

English historians, such as E. J. Wakefield,
Stanley Johnson and Thorold, have criticized
very strongly the immigration mebhods of
England, accusing hier of having too often
tried ta rid herself of her bad citizens under
the pretext of responding ta the needs of bier

colonies.

We know the reports of investi-

gations carried on under Governor Durham.,
but ta sif t themn again would serve no purpose.
The history of immigration ta Canada since
the conquest may be summarized under four
heads.
First, there is the period extending from
the conquest ta 1840; then the period under
Durham, when the writings of Wakefield and
Rogers produced their effeet.
In a wellprepared essay rend before la Société Historique de Montréal, Mr. Langlois, an able
journalist, has this ta say of the main English
groupa settled in Canada:
At that time it was believed that Irish
immigration ta Canada would rid the Englishman of his heavy burden. Emi gration ta the
colonies was preferred ta the Mal thusian birth
contrai by "conjugal restraint." After their
gloriaus dýefence of the country against the
Americans, the situation of the native Canadians, born of parents long established in

SENATE
Canada was far from improving. When speaking
of ethnical antagonism Lord Durham clearly
has in mind the treatment inflicted on the
settlers, who became indignant at being considered as outcasts. But though angry about
this among thenselves, they seemed to forget
their strength and their natural pow-ers, and
kept on firmly devoted to the land of their
ancestors.
Next comes the period of railway development and the most intensive immigration
propaganda. The inauguration of the Canadian Pacifie, in 1885, gave promise of a great
era of progress. To settle those lands and
support the railway, population and traffic
were needed.
That is obvious.
Nation
builders, statesmen, manufacturers and churchmen gazed on that immense territory known
as the Western Prairies.
It was the hope of settling those vast plains
which moved the great nephew of de la
Verendrye, Mgr. Taché, the eminent missionary bishop, to write in his "Esquisse du NordOuest" published in 1882:
One naturally wonders if such an immense
wilderness will forever remain as Providence
has kept it till this day. Isolated in this
boundless area, one often asks himself whether
European activities, or the still more feverish
exertions and the daring ambitions of the
great neighbouring republic, or the creation of
Canada, will not operate strongly liere. Will
our great and beautiful rivers and our immense lakes never see but the Indian barkcanoe or the heavy-oared barge of the fur
trader?
Are the agricultural resources, the
mineral wealth, the forest and water riches of
this territory never to be estimated at their
real value?
Well, not long after the publication of bis
book, Bislhop Taché witnessed the realization
of his dream: the great West became part of
Canada. And thon it was that Lord Dufferin,
the Governor General, wrote:
Frou its geographical position and its peculiar
characteristics, Manitoba may be regarded as
the keystone of that mighty arch of sister
provinces which spans the continent from the
Atlantic to the Pacifie.
lt was here that

unexpected revelation, that her historical territories of the Canadas, her castern seaboards

sinews of her material might, the peer of any
power on earth.
However, one would have to be blind
te deny that Canada will attract immigrants.
In fact some people dream and talk of
bringing in millions of them. Out of a total
area of 3,750 square miles, Canada bas a land
area of 2,306,502,153 acres, of which it is
estimated that 300 million acres can be made

eight per cent of ber total area. In the old
province of Quebec hardly more than three
per cent of the land is under cultiviation. Four
hundred thousand farms, measured or surveyed, are awaiting settlers. The urban
population, which fifty years ago was approximately only thirty-five per cent, now exceeds
the rural population.
Ratzel, a writer on geography, says "that
the future belongs to those who will hold
in the world sufficient space to live, breathe
freely, and be on an eauality with their
neighbours."
Space is certainly not what Canada Jacks
to become, in time, one of the great nations
of the world, but her population is still too
small for ber to be on an equality with ber
neigbbour. The more reason, it will be said,
to favour a fair amount cf immigration, which
would not deprive us of the control over our
own affairs, our economic development and
social stability. But is that possible? By
what methods? A better selection of immigrants? Is that easy?
That docs not mean opposing every
scientific development. Even if we were So
inclined, our young and keen generation,
brouglit up in the motor-car age, would get
indignant much sooner than some people are
willing to admit.
W/e are in the same sittuatiion as all young
countries blessed with superabundant resources
and enjoying a degree of civilization such as
to mould and form nations. The historian
Burke says: "Flocking to rich and potential
industrial countries lacking in population. for
whatever reason. is as natural as the rush of
donse air through less compact strata. Besides,
the world was created to b peopled." Which,
truly, is a divine preceet in effect long
centuries before any period known to scientists
and bistorians.
But how should we pursue the settlement of

teaches us that we must first stop the emigration of our own people, thon have a system
which will encourage large families, a more
effective health organization and a selected
immigration.
My purpose in briefly going over past
history in company with my honourable

MAY 12, 1936
colleagues was to remind us all of the results
of immigration at certain times in certain
interesting countries, ta point out examples
and evidences by which our country should
profit, and also to support the principle I
enunciated as the basis of the settlement policy
that should long ago have obtained in Canada.
I now core to the present period, which
must be considered in the light of facts. Some
of those that I have stated are taken from
my own records and others are from books
that I have already mentioned or shall mention
as I proceed.
Need I repeat that I have not the least
intention to belittle or ta slight immigrants
now considered as good Canadians? Of such
as those we desire more, but always subject
to the actual needs of the country.
What is the situation after more than a
quarter-century of intensive immigration and
regrettable emigration?
Financially and
morally, what is the result, on the whole?
Have we gained more than we have lost?
How many Canadians have left the country
in fifty years? What did we do to retain them
or to bring them back? How many Canadians
did we lose for lack of effective health
organizations?
Our statistical records are
fairly exact for only about fifteen years.
In the Canada Year Book I find the following in support of my own statements:
While the great majority of French Canadians can trace their descent ta ancestors who
left the Old World two hundred and fifty
years ago and even longer, most Englishspeaking Canadians are comparative newcomers both to Canada and te this continent,
though a considerable number of the United
Empire Loyalist families had been resident in
the old colonies for generations before they
moved north te establish English-speaking
settlements in what is now the Dominion of
Canada. During the middle third of the nineteenth century, a great English-speaking migration entered the province of Ontario, and made
it for the first time more populous than the
sister province of Quebec, thus bringing about
the agitation for representation by population.
Thereafter, immigration slackened until the
dawn of the twentieth century brought another
flood of settlers te the newly opened territories of the great Northwest, resulting in an
increase of population between the censuses of
1901 and 1911 greater than the combined increase of the three decades from 1871 te 1901.
Immigration during the second decade of the
twentieth century promised, at its commencement, te be even greater than during the first.
In its first three years no fewer than 1,084,934
persons entered Canada for purposes of settlement.
What have Canadian schools done to
develop the love of country, ta impress the
minds of children with a national spirit? And,
generally speaking, what was the role of our
educational institutions in the same field?
And, all of us, have we acted in such a way

as to instil love of the Canadian land? Have
we preached confidence and national pride?
Are we doing se now? So many questions we
ought to consider seriously in a spirit of
repentance.
I quoted the views of many eminent people,
which are confirmed by reliable and instructive
statistics. At the risk of wearying the majority
in this Chamber, I should like te quote some
others. And to show my firm desire for impartiality I have quoted even more from English than from French-Canadian writers.
Extracting precise conclusions from official
figures means some minute work.
I was quite amazed to find so many severe
critjcisms of our immigration policy by AngloCanadians. Were they of my own race, I would
probably hesitate to quote them.
Strange to say, incredible indeed,, from the
point of view of population our immigration
policy would seem to have resulted in a deficit.
Mr. Roland Wilson, a renowned writer, does
net hesitate te say se, in a minute survey
published in the Canadian Historical Review,
1932.
In a carefully prepared statement he shows
that during the period extending from 1867
ta 1925 emigration from Canada exceeded by
535,000 immigration to Canada, which means
an annual deficit of 9,000 people. Mr. Wilson's
contribution was the subject-matter of most
thoughtful observations in the Geographical
Review and l'Actualité Economique. Professor
Jackson of the University of Toronto judged
it worthy of critical comments. Two years
before Professor R. M. Lower of Wesley
University, Winnipeg, arrived at the same
conclusion (Queen's Quarterly Review,-Spring
1930).
Like Mr. Wilson, Mr. Lower, comparing
emigration with immigration, comes to the
conclusion that Canada's population would
number about the same to-day, had net one
single immigrant come for sixty-three years.
Should not every good Canadian seriously
ponder over Mr. Lower's statements? For
instance, he notes that until 1859, with
scarcely any immigration, the Canadian
population doubled every twentyfive years,
whereas from 1851 te 1901 the rate of increase
fell so low that it took Canada ninety years
te double its population. Why such a difference? Emigration of our people to the
United States is the answer. Professor Lower
goes se far as to say that during the last half
century one of every two children born in
Canada had ultimately ta move over the
boundary.
Without going into detailed comparisons as
they did two years later, Messrs. Wilson and
Lower stated, that immigration did not counter-

SENATE
balance emigration and that, far from increasing our population, immigration in the
end caused emigration.
All these statements, based upon carefully
prepared statistics, fully justify the view of
Mr. Esdras Minville, an eminent professor
at l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales,
who, in October last, pointed out the necessity
for a "settlement policy" rather than for
holding solely to an "immigration. policy."
But settlement is above all a social problem.
In November. 1933, Dr. Milton Hersey,
addressing la Ligue du Progrès civique in
Montreal, set down rather accurately the main
points of the problem:
Some time, when the depression is over,- we
shall have to face the immigration problem.
Let us hope that Canada shall not then repeat
the errors of the past. Future immigrants
will have to make up their minds to become
Canadians and agree to bear their share of
Canadian responsibilities. We have already
too many foreigners hindering the administration and the progress of the country. The
normal and natural development of Canada
requires more population, and we shall have,
of course, to welcome qualified people from
other lands willing to lelp us: healthy and
earnest settlers with enough capital to take
care of themselves. A careful selection will
be necessary in order to avoid bringing in, as
was donc in the past, people who become a
hindrance to progress and competitors against
our workmen.
Many wise Canadians before Mr. Hersey
had expressed similar views.
On the same occasion Mr. Joseph Jenkins,
an English-speaking lawyer of Montreal,
delivered over the radio a talk on immigration.
In harsh terms, for which I do not take
responsibility, he said, among other things:
In Canada, at the conquest, there were two
ethnicail groups: the French and the English.
At the begipning of the twentieth century an
active propaganda for the settlement of the
Western prairies was carried on. On the invitation of Canada, Europe purged herself of
her undesirables and, for a decade, a heterogeneous and polyglot immigration flowed
steadily towards the prairies. War stopped
the finow, but no sooner was the War over than
immigration was resumed on a larger scale
than ever. Over 500.000 immigrants came to
help us settle the Western prairies.
What were the effects of that immigration
on our national life? And on our social life?
We do not know yet. A million would not be
too much to defray the cost of an effective
survey of the situation created in Canada by
that kind of immigration.
Nudist parades, communistic activities, agitations against education, violent strikes, socialistic propaganda, and those so-called colleges
dedicated to the teaching of Marxist principles: all such occurrences of recent years
should open our eyes.
And our labour people, our workmen? In
the province of Quebec the French-Canadian
workman is displaced by cheap foreign labour;
and so deprived of his living in Canada, he

has to move to the United States. Such a
situation is abnormal. Fortunately the United
States closed their doors to our people, but
what assurance have we as to the future?
We have to thank our neighbours for so doing.
But, then, we have to admit that it is the
United States and not we that are preventing
them from emigrating.
Mr. Jenkins goes on:
We have an immense country abounding in
natural resources, but we are also carrying on
under a very heavy burden of indebtedness,
in1 fact toc heavy for so small a population.
We cannot rely on natural increases, even if
the methods of Hitlerism and Fascism could
obtain liere: the process would be too slow for
the normal development of sueh a vast country
as ours. What we have to offer to the immigrant ceost us too much in sacrifices to be given
to anyone who is incapable of gratitude: immigration will require careful selection.
Is the English-speaking Canadian wrong in
his criticism? I admit he should have made
exceptions, for, I repeat, there are immigrants
who are already good Canadians. Do they
constitute the majority? One has to admit
that Mr. Jenkins gave expression to very open
truths.
The late Mr. Arthur Dansereau, a journalist
of great repute, Inown by the honourable
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and a confidant of Cartier, John A.
Macdonald, Chapleau, Charles Tupper, and,
later, of Laurier, wrote in La Presse in 1902
the following wise and far-sighted warning as
to American immigration:
The close proximity of Canada and the
United States gives rise to constant and
various problems in our confederation. Some
years ago emigration of Canadian people to
the United States, from Ontario as well as
from Quebec, though the latter was more talked

of, was one of the most important questions our
governments had to consider.
Concerning Canada's progress, La Presse
added:
The result bas been the immigration to
Western Canada of American farmers in such
numbers as to give the impression of an exodus
of such proportions as to concern American
economists and also to require from Canada a
careful study of the new conditions created by
such mass immigration.
The chief editor of La Presse -points out the
danger of a peaceful invasion of our Western
prairies, an invasion which, however peaceful,
may nevertheless have considerable economie
and political consequences.
Bordering our country they were in a position to appreciate its advantages, not only for
wheat-farming but for the production of other
grains as wiell.
Well. the result was the organization of big
companies. which secured large tracts of land

in Manitoba and the North West Territories,
whsere tey will direct a constant flow of immigrants. Since the beginning of that undertak-

MAY 12, 1936
ing over twenty-five thousand farmers settled
there and emigration is increasing and spreading from other parts of the American republic,
as evidenced by the coming in of settlers from
Texas and Colorado.
It is impossible to foresee what proportions
such an influx will eventually assume. Our lands
are just as fertile in wheat as those of the
Western states of the neighbouring republic,
which last year yielded 200 million bushels.
Canada's production was only one-third of that,
but, with sufficient tillers, the yield may easily
equal that of the United States. It would
certainly not be surprising to see at least one
hundred thousand American farmers settled in
Western Canada inside of four or five years.
One day that same year the Honourable
Mr. Tarte, who was still a member of the
Laurier -Government, if my memory serves me
right, made a splendid speech in reply to
Messers. Oliver and Davis, both of whom
were favourable to intensive immigration. He
disclosed his concern at such a sudden inrush
of Americans, and especially at the coming
of large groups of a new, element usuallty
bustling and exacting and never evidencing
for our institutions and customs that consideration and regard one would expect from

such close neighbours.
.Mr. Tarte died young, a victim of hard
work. Most Canadians did not agree with
him on all matters, but he certainly was an
able man, at times capable of fine patriotie
gestures, and never inclined to shrink before
the enemy.
Commenting on Mr. Tarte's speech, Mr.
Dansereau wrote:
Mr. Tarte's concern is quite timely, as
evidenced by the expressions of views to be
found in the American newspapers dealing with
this matter.
The other day a gentleman addressing the
Illinois Manufacturing Association bewailed the
emigration of his compatriots to Canada and
expressed the hope that the time had not yét
come when Americans had to abandon their
country and their flag to take refuge in a
foreign land.
To which the St. Paul Globe replied that
alarm beyond reason would be wrong. The
Globe points out that all those American
farmers remain true to the democratic representative institutions that may have determined their forefathers to choose the United
States as their home when they decided to
free themselves from the yokes of European
powers.
If the Americans come to Canada with the
intention of shaping a new course for our institutions, they may cause troubles which it
would be a mistake not to warn against from
the start.
Canada bas always asked of immigrants
who come and settle here to leave behind them
the ideas nourislied or acquired in the countries from which they come, and to identify
themselves with all Canadian ideas and sentiments, without exception.
It cannot be otherwise with respect to the
new population which comes from the United
States, and we certainly cannot allow them to

281

retain American ideas which do not conform
to the Canadian constitution.
To mention one example, expansion or
imperialistie policy having been adopted as an
American doctrine, it would hardly be pleasant
for us to be indebted to our new settlers for
the adoption of the principle. After hesitating so long before meddling with South African
affairs it would be strange if, from democratic
motives, we came to meddle with those of the
Philippines.
To sum it all up, the arrival of new settlers
is of great benefit. from an economie point of
view, but it would be better to avoid all
possible error as to their political ideals: they
must conform to those of all other citizens,
having the same aspirations, if possible, but,
at any rate, being true to the same allegiance.
Then years later, in 1913, Mr. Georges
Pelletier, professor at the University of Montreal, who from 1909 to 1912 was probably
the most brilliant member of the Ottawa
Press Gallery and is now editor of Le Devoir,
published as a pamphlet his report of a
judicious inquiry into our immigration policy
and its results. He came to the conclusion
"that our rulers could not begin too soon to
measure the whole scope of the impossible
task, so as to bring to an end this blind policy
on immigration; and if they do not act their
successors and all Canada will to-morrow have
to face one of the most formidable and most
insoluble problerns imaginable to the human
mind."
Evidently, this warning did not come from
a mind blind and indifferent to the country's
interests.
In the last issue of the Canada Year Book,
published by order of the Hon. Mr. Euler,
Minister of Trade and Commerce, I find the
following acknowledgment:
The depression which began about the close
of 1929, with its accompanying unemplofment
and unsold surplus of farm products, raised
the question whether it was desirable that
Canada should accept immigrants in any considerable number.
Faced with this situation which it inherited,
the new Government (the Bennett Government), faithful to its policy of "Canada First,"
nine days after being sworn in, that is, on the
14th of August, 1930, passed an Order in
Council limiting immigration, except as to
British subjects coming from the Mother
Country or from the self-governing Dominions
and American subjects coming from the
United States, to two classes: (a) wives and
unmarried children under eighteen years of
age coming here to join the father of the
family, provided the latter was settled here
and already able to assume the charges; (b)
farmers with enough money to settle on Canadian farms. This restriction applied to the
whole of continental Europe as well as to
many other countries. The rules concerning

282

SENATE

immigration from the British Isles, the British
Dominions overseas and the United States
remained unchanged, but all publicity and
propaganda were stopped. As a consequence
of that policy, in 1931, the Department of
Immigration and Colonization closed all its
information offices in the United States and
reduced its representation in the British Isles.
The result of that policy was to reduce our
immigration to the same low level as in the
first years of Confederation. But it would be
unjust to hide the fact that for several years
the rules on immigration have contained a
clause that all immigrants entering Canada
must own sufficient funds to keep themselves
until they can find jobs. Of course, a sum
which might be considered sufficient when
there is plenty of work might net be-so in
times when employment is bard to find, and
the application of this rule is an important
factor in the reduction of immigration to-day.
Moreover, an Order in Council passed on
August 7, 1929, forbids any immigrant from
landing in Canada if lie is coming here in
fulfilment of a contract or agreement,
expressed or understood, to do any kind of
work or give any kind of service; on the
other hand, the rule does not apply to farmers,
farm labourers or domestics. Under the same
order, the Minister of Immigration and
Colonization nay admit any workman on a
special job, if the said Minister considers the
workman's craft or services necessary to the
country. Sad te relate, the last paragraph
has given rise to numerous and scandalous
abuses.
About the time of Confederation, according to the ceusus of 1871, the country's
population was 3,689,257. That population
was mostly concentrated in the two Canadas,
Quebec and Ontario, and in the lower provinces. Manitoba's population was only 25,000,
British Columbia's 36,000, and the Northwest
Territories' 48.000.
The Fathers of Confederation, to render
the federal pact acceptable, had undertaken
to unite the lower provinces and the port of
Montreal by a railroad. A little later, wlien
British Columbia came into Confederation,
Canada pledged itself to unite the Pacifie
coast to the rest of the country through another railroad. The reconstitution of the
country according to the federal plan aimed,
therefore, among other things, at establishing railroad communications ta facilitate commercial relationship between the East and
the West, and vice versa.
I do net hesitate to repeat, therefore, that
the building, first of the Canadian Pacifie,
then of the Intercolonial, and finally of the
two other transcontinental railroads, was the
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

most important question for nearly forty years
of our political annals.
Althouglh the Canadian Pacifie Railway was
started by a private company, it was built
with the aid of federal money grants and
grants of land all along the line.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway had two main
reasons for seeking outside labour: first, there
was insufficient population between Ontario
and the Pacifie coast; second, it was to the
interest of the company to inaugurate a policy
of intense colonization in order to dispose of
the millions of acres which the company had
received from the Crown.
It was the building of railroads which swept
Canada into this policy of intense immigration and colonization. This same policy was
revived and stimulated when the Liberal
party came into power in 1896. Following
in the footsteps of Macdonald and Cartier,
the main ambition of the Laurier Administration was to make of our Western prairies
the "granary" of the world. And from 1896
te 1911, the Government concentrated nearly
ail its energies on establishing in the Western
Provinces an ever-growing population devoted
to wheat-growing. In 1905 two new provinces,
Saskatchewan and Alberta, were detached
from the Northwest Territories. In order,
first of all, te help colonization, and also to
prevent the Canadian Pacifie Railway from
becoming a railroad monopoly-wliich was
feared even in those days-tlhe same Administration built two other great transcontinental lines. I shall make no comment now
on that great error.
The construction of those railroads naturally attracted to this country large numbers
of labourers who, it was expected, would later
settle the lands granted to the promoters.
I therefore venture te say that the main
motives of intense immigration in Canada
were, first, the construction of the Canadian
Pacific Railway, and, later, the settlement
of a colony of wheat-growers in the immense
Western prairies.
As a net result of this immigration policy
instigated and stimulated by the carrier conpanies, three of the Western Provinces were
populated:
Manitoba,
Alberta
and Saskatchewan.
Need I repeat it? Since 1867 we have
brought into this country something like
six million foreigners, at an approximate cost
of $55,000,000. It is no exaggeration te say
that our carrier companies and the colonizatien societies spent as much again.
The country has kept 2,300.000 of those
foreigners, who cost us $110.000,000; so that
we vasted $74,000,000.

MAY 12, 1936
Between 1927 and 1930, another period of
intense immigration, we received 1,218,500
immigrants, at a cost of $45,000,000 or thereabouts, $22,000,000 of which, at least, was
spent by the federal treasury.
Needless to say, we cannot start now another period of railroad construction, except
perhaps a few branch ines, such as the one
we need in my constituency, between St.
Eustache and Oka. Both the Acworth-lrayton Commission, in 1917, and the Duff Commission came to the conclusion that Canada,
because of its population and economic condition, already had too many railroads.
Furthermore, it is now admitted we must
eliminate, as far as possible, the excessive
railway mileage which makes up a large
percentage of our liabilities to-day. I shall
not try to settle that question now.
It must not be forgotten either that during the two great periode of railroad construction the immigration of foreign labour did
not represent a liability, for it was balanced
by a tremendous importation of foreign
capital. England and the United States provided nearly eighty per cent of the capital
used in the building of our railroads. If
the immigrant is not immediately and
remuneratively employed, after his arrival,
he threatens to become a public charge.
If we must encourage the entrance here
of thousands of foreigners, and if such a
situation is not to become a liability, their
arrival must be justified through the importation of foreign capital which will serve to
employ these newly arrived people, as was
the case when our railroads were built.
We cannot bring to reality our predecessors' dream of making the Western Provinces
the "granary" of Europe.
The economic life of the prairies was based
nearly exclusively on wheat-growing, which
represented the total or the near total of
public and private revenues. Because of new
conditions in the world market, we must to-day
decrease our wheat acreage and submit our
exportations to quotas. It is unthinkable,
therefore, that we should continue to settle
the prairies for wheat-growing as in the
past.
Well-informed economists have reached the
conclusion that the West can only survive
if it takes up mixed farming and industry,
and that, at present, would be a calamity
for the rest of Canada. We must not let a
machine-made settlement scheme complicate
the problems of agriculture through the choice
of poor settlers or through overproduction
beyond the power of our markets to absorb.
It is therefore said that there is at present

282

no question of sending new settIers to the
West, for the problem there is no longer one
of population.
The population already seems more than
sufficient to develop that part of the country,
for the results of the past do not justify a
return to our former policy. According to
the last census, nearly twenty-two per cent
of our population is not Canadian-born. The
foreign-born population of each province is
in the following ratio:
Per cent
3.16
Prince Edward Island.. ........
8.15
Nova Scotia.. ..............
5.98
New Brunswick.. ............
8.75
Quebec.. ..................
23.43
Ontario.. ................
33.79
Manitoba.. ................
34.55
Saskatchewan.. ..............
41.78
Alberta.. ..................
46.02
British Columbia.. ............
Our immigration policy has had practically
no other result than to establish a foreign
country within the boundaries of Canada.
Indeed, that policy intended from the first
that the immigrant population should be
grouped in the four Western Provinces, which
have become, in the last twenty-five years,
one of the dominating factors of our political
and economic life. Besides constituting in
the midst of our population a nucleus of
foreigners, immigration, especially since the
War, served to alter the ethnical character of
the country. It is a well-known fact that the
great majority of communists, socialists and
other radicals is found among these immigrants. So that such new-comers threaten to
change our political course in a radical manner.
Mr. Edgar Boutet, a too modest newspaperman, who is extremely well informed on most
interesting and most useful statistics, has
proven in a notable essay that about sixtyfi-ve per cent of the unemployed now living
on direct relief came to this country only
during the last ten years. It has been rightly
said that it is not the country which is not
suitable to those people, but the immigrants
who do not suit the country.
And further, before bringing population to
Canada, we must bring our own people back
to rural life. Before we can solve our economic
problems we must return to a fair equilibrium
in the distribution of our population and our
economic activities.
Let us first come back to the land. According to the census of 1931 the country has
seen a progressive forsaking of the land.
Aocording to the same authority, our population is distributed in the following way:

SENATE

1891...... .. .. .. .. . ...
1901...... ... .. . ... .. .
1911............
1921.............

Rural

45.42
49.52
62.03

That table shows ton large a surplus of
population in urban centres, which. is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the continued
aggravation of unempînyment.
Therefore, before we tbink of bringinýg other
elements here we should look after emergencies
and re-establish equilibrium between the rural
and the urban classes. In other words, before
we try te settie the country, let us try te
ruralize it. Because of its very nature, its
possibilities and its mission, it must become
once more and above all a farming community.

In some ways the French Canadians protected the expatriates by supplying them, in

ignored the advice of a great economist:
In so far as conservation of lufe involves
the development of efficiency and ability to

the increase of production.
Have our educational institutions, our press,
*our parliaments shown the Canadian people,

what Canadian patriotismn and the Canadian
soul should be? As Father Lalande would

not brook insincerity as to the sources of

the line from which it springs, the treasures
which it received and guards jealously before

heroic songs, patriotic tales, transmitted from
one generation to another and becoming imprerishable lessons of unyielding endurance, of
tradition and history which no one would
dare to soit nor to destroy?

Meighen) desired to know what police supervision had been established on the Indian
rese¶'ves. At the time I bad not the information be-fore, me. I have since received
it in this form:
In order to provide a unifnrm standard oi
service and more efficient law enforcement, in
recent years it bas been the policy of. the
departmnent to substitute the services nf the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and provincial
police for those of part-time Indian c-nstables
wherever it bas been found convenient to
do so.
On a number of reserves special detachments
ni the Royal Canadian Mountcd Police have
been established for Indian Act administration;
for example at the Vanconver, Kootenay, Nicola,
Alert Bay and Skeena Indian ageocies in
British Columbia; at the Stony and Blackfoot
agencies in Alberta; at the Brantford and
Caradoc agencies in Ontario, and at the St.
Regis and Bersimis ageies in Quebec. At
some other agencies thedpartoient employs
fuîl-time Dominion constables who are regular
members nf the departmental staff. On some
reserves where infractions nf the Act are rare,
it is fonnd that the services oi part-time
constables suffice.
In addition to the varins special provisions
above mentioned, the department thrnughnut
the Dominion avails itself ni the services of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and varions
prov'incial police forces. These have proven
to he ready and reliable, and in the opinion
ni the department are equal to the requirements

FREE FOREIGN TRADE ZONES BILL
SECOND R~EADING
The Senate resumned from May 7 the
adjourned debate on the motion for second
reading of Bill E2, an Act to enable the
establishment, operation and maintenance of
free foreign trade zones by provinces and
municipalities or by public agencies of either
thereof.
-Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Honourable senators, I lrise witb a great deal 6f diffidence
after the admirable speech that was made by
the seconder of my motion MHon. Mr. Ramnville). I readily admit that he has a great
advantage over me in years, at least. As we
ail know, the Good Book says:
Dies annorum nostrorum in ipsis, septuaginta
anni. Si autem in potentatibus octoginta anni;
et amplius eorumn, labor et dolor.
Which in English means:
The days of our years are threescore years
and ten; and if by reason of strength they
be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour
and sorrow.
I will admit at once that it was labour for me
to try to prepare a speech on this subject,
when the only tools I had were arguments
presented seventeen years ago. A great advance bas been made in free foreign trade
zones in the interval.
The seconder of tbe motion is a lawyer,
and an able one. Besides, lie was Chairman
of the Montreal Harbour Commission and as
sucb lie could devote-in, f act, be was paid
to devote-considerable time to a study of
the question of free ports, and hie did so.
He bas given more hours to studying the
question than anyone else whom I know, and
bas iectured about it at numerous times in
the last twenty years. Also, lie has an
exhaustive file of documents on the subject,
perbaps more exhaustive than is possessed
by anyone else in the Senate or the other
House.
In dealing with the matter to-day I crave
the indulgence of the House. Any honourable
member who lias conversed with people about
free ports, or ports francs, as tbey are called
in Frenchi, must bave been surprised at the
extremely limited knowledge the public have,
of this subjeet. In Montreal 1 was talking
'to one of tbe brightest Canadians, a man who
is a director of one of the biggest banks and
president of a very large company. I tried
to tell him about free ports, but lie would not

287

listen to me. Be said: "Oh, no. They are
no good at aîl. We have bonded warebouses."
Be had no conception of free ports and
would not look into the subjeet. I aisked hima
to read about them, at least, but lie said, "No,
I won't read about them." Well, you cannot
teacli people who will not go tu school.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And lie is.
president of a bankl
Riglit Hoil. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The obstinacy
of St. James street!
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: One place that is
always referred to by every person dealing
with this subject is the port of Hamburg,
which is the world's greatest example of wbat
a free zone can do. There are some people-'
British people, if you please-who say, "It
is strange tbere is no free port in the British
Empire." Why, every port in Great Britain
was a free port when tbat country bad free
trade. But now it bas gone in for protectionand I tbink it is perfectly right. When I ws
in England at tbe time of the late King's
coronation a number of us were visiting a
wonderful works at a certain place, and kve
were shown a most powerful crane, which
could- lift an incredible number of tons. We
were surprised to see stamped on it, "Made in
Germany.
In England at that time there
were plenty of idle people who could bave
built a crane like that. However, at last the
people of Great Britain bave had enougli
sense to see it is necessary to protect themselves, as everybody else is doing.
There is a very interesting story about
Hamburg. It is an extremely old city, and I
hope tbat my bonourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand-), who bas visited the place, will
have sometbing to say about it, even if lie
does not agree with my motion. Tbe city
existed in the Middle Ages, and perliaps
before them. It was one of the cities in the
Hanseatie League. I may say bere to tbose
who do not know it tbat "Hanse" means
"union." The League was formed in the year
1200, and from then until 1400 as many as
eighty-five cities became members of i't. They
joined together to protect their common
interests. In those days the mariner's compass,
which. the Chinese had used thousands of
years 'before Christ, was unknown, and the
Iack of tbis instrument and the constant
danger from piratical attacks made it vitally
necessary that shipowners sbould always be
ready to help one another in time of trouble.
The maj ority of these independent communities were ruled by a bisbop or archbishop, for
this was before 'the Reformation, when there
was only one churcli in Europe, the Churcli
of Rome. From 1669 onward the League

SENATE
began to weaken and ultimately it was
dissolved.
I may say that the hansa of Cologne was
one of the most important members of the
League, and its regulations were adopted by
many of the other member-cities.
In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian war,
the German Empire was formed. The German Government tried for eleven years to
persuade Hamburg to become part of Germany. An independent republic was a great
impediment and inconvenience to the German
Empire, for much of its trade passed through
the port. For eleven years the German Government failed to induce Hamburg to surrender its independence. Not until 1882, when
the German Government offered 40,000,000
marks, did the little republic consent to become part of the German Empire. That
money was used to develop what is now one
of the greatest ports in the world.
My honourable friend from Repentigny
(Hon. Mr. Rainville), who kindly seconded
my motion for second reading of this Bill,
stated that there were 150 manufacturing and
other establishments in Hamburg, employing
25,000 workmen. That seems to me a small
number, for the Dominion Steel and Coal
Company alone gives work to 14,000 men at
Sydney and other places. When that conpany enjoyed the benefit of the Fielding
bounties-whieh, as the late Mr. Fielding
conclusively dernonstrated in another place,
never cost the country a penny-it employed
23,000 men.
An honourable gentleman has just handed
me an article written in 1932, in whieh the
writer states that Great Britain intended to
create several free ports in an.effort to retain
its re-export trade.
Copenhagen is a famous scaport. To my
knowledge it bas for thirty years been operated as a froc port, and has developed an
immense foreign trade with the Baltie and
with Norway, Sweden and Holland .
Spain is usually regarded as a backward
country, but it bas free ports. Barcelona became one in 1916, and Bilbao and Santander were established as free ports in 1918.
Near Bilbao arc wonderful iron mines, the
ore containing 62 or 63 per cent of iron. A
steamer leaves the port of Bilbao every half
hour throughout the twenty-four hours with
iron ore for England,. There are also froe
ports at Vigo and Coruia.
Sweden established a froe port at Stockholm in 1919. Gothenburg and Malmo are
also free ports. France has La Havre and
Marseilles; Norway has Christiania, Bergen,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Christiansand and Trondhjem; Portugal has
Lisbon.
A curious fact has been called to my attention. Switzerland is about to establish a free
zone, a port of entrepôt, where the goods of
Italy and France may be exhibited and perhaps sold to Austria and Germany, and Austrian and German goods exhibited and sold
to Italy and France. It will be seen that it
is not necessary for a place to be a seaport
in order to operate as a froc zone.
There is no reason in the world why goods
cannot be brought into any free zone in Switzerland and there broken up into smaller lots
and sold. Contrary to what my big financial
friend in Montreal said to me, you cannot
break bulk and dispose of goods in a bonded
warehouse. You have also the further advantage in a frec zone of being able to show
your goods to prospective buyers and either
to sell them for cash or exchange them for
other goods.
Hong Kong and Singapore are both free
ports. They serve the commerce of Asia, and,
as honourable senators know, on that continent
A
live balf the population of the world.
vessel arriving at Hong Kong may unload
1.000 or 1,500 tons of freight for a snaller
steamer to pick up and carry to destination, for
it would not pay the larger vessel te peddle
this comparatively small tonnage, but, the port
of destination of the transhipped tonnage
being on the regular route of the other ship,
the business is so much found money for it.
On the other hand, the larger ship may be
able to pick up at Hong Kong additional tonnage destined for. the port to which she is
taking her main cargo. So the transaction
suits both parties. Similar business can be
donc at Singapore.
There is also a free port at Gibraltar, but,
of course, it is free in the sense that England
is still virtually a free trade country.
Generally, it may be said that the establishment of a free port would stimulate manufacturing industry and thus provide more employment for our skilled workers. It would
also give work to the men needed for the
handling of goods passing in and out of such
free port. Conceivably a Canadian manufacturer could import all bis raw materials
and export his manufactured product, to the
great benefit of Canadian labour.
I would remind honourable members that
the establishment of free ports in this
country would not involve a cent of expense
to our taxpayers. The proposed legislation
is permissive. net mandatory. It would be
left to private enterprise to furnish the capital

MAY 13, 1936
necessary for the building of a free port.
Naturally those engaged in the enterprise
would request the Federal Governiment or the
government of a province or a municipality
to give them a fair chance to make a profit
on their investment. If there is a loss they,
and not the taxpayers, will have .to bear it.
I am sorry ta say that Government operation
in this country has not proved a success. A
striking instance of this is the control of radio
by a commission. Formerly we paid only $1
a year for a radio licence, and the various
broadcasting stations were operated at a
profit by their owners. To-day we have to
pay a licence fee of $2 a year, and the revenue
has not been sufficient to cover the cost of
Government operation, but has had to be
supplemented by a grant from the treasury
-an additional burden on our taxpayers.
A few years ago a certain Government
decided to give public ownership and operation of our railroads a trial. What further
trial was needed? For fifty-five years the
Intercolonial Railway was operated by the
Govenment. Did it ever pay a cent on its
bonds? We are still giving public ownership
and operation of our railroads a trial.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend had better confine his remarks to free
ports.
Hon. Mr. CASGRtAIN: Yes; but I cannot
resist the temptation. The Maritime Provinces, having suffered that affliction for more
than half a century, were left behind by
Quebec and Ontario, and even by the Western
Provinces. I remember when Nova Scotia
sent .twenty-two members to the House of
Commons; now its representation is cut down
to twellve. Similarly with New Brunswick;
its former membership of twenty has been
reduced to ten.

As I have said, this proposed legislation
is permissive, not mandatory, and, I repeat,
it would not cost the taxpayers a cent. It is
not ailways easy to find men ready to risk

their money, but I am confident that private
enterprise would engage in this undertaking.
Now let me direct the attention of honourable members .to some of the advantages
of free ports.
transhipment.

The first advantage is that of
I am told that when boats

of the Canada Steamship Lines come down
from Fort William with grain they stop at
Detroit, the greatest automobile manufacturing city in the world, and automobiles are
loaded on their decks. There is not much
risk of stormy weather except on Lake Brie,
and that is a comparatively

short portion

of the route to Montreal. At Montreal the
automobiles are transhipped to ocean steamers

289

for transit to Europe. This all-water transportation from Detroit cuts down freight
charges, an important economy, for competition in the automobile field is so keen that a
difference in price of a few dollars may
adversely affect sales. A free zone in Montreal would be a clearing-house for the distribution of automobiles to all the countries
of the world. I have ascertained at Montreal
that ships leave that port for the seven seas.
It would be found money to them to take
a few automobiles or trucks to the ports where
they are to be sold. A profit would also
accrue to the free zone in the form of storage
charges. My remarks would apply also ta
commodities from Chicago or from any other
points in the United States.
Another great advantage of a free port
over a bonded warehouse is that you can
break bulk and then grade or blend your
goods and invite the public to corne and
inspect them with a view to purchase.
A further advantage would result from the
development of our manufacturing industry.
Various materials and parts could be assembled
and manufactured by Canadian labour.
A' f ourth advantage is that gooda could be
consigned to a free port and stored until sold,
without payment of customs duties.
The New York Times is very much in
favour of establishing a free port on Staten
Island.
These free zones would not be limited to
the seaboard; they could be set up anywhere
in Canada, and would add greatly to our
foreign commerce. The establishment of
factories within these zones would be a boon
to trade and commerce.
I forgot a 'few moments ago to say that
Genoa became a free port in 1927.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that.

It was before

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The information
I have shows that it was in 1927. In Hungary
there are free ports at Budapest and Espel;
in Austria at Trieste and Fiume-I think
Fiume is now in Italy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: At all events it
is on the Adriatic.
Not a dollar of Government money would
be asked for. If the Bill is allowed to go to
committee I shall leave it to the committee
to insert a clause forbidding the company
from aacepting any subsidy or any Federal
Government moneys. If some clever lawyer
could draw a clause which would prohibit
the company not only from asking, but from
receiving or accepting any public moneys,

12745-19
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
I should like to have sucli a clause inserted.
Then, if anything were to happen to prevent
the success of the project, only those people
who had taken a chance and put their money
into it would be the losers. Naturally the
investors would expect a reasonable return
on their money.
A very large sum would be necessary in
order to establish even a very modest zone.
Remember, you first have to enclose your
zone to make absolutely sure that there shall
be no smuggling through it. Then before
you commence ýto erect buildings you must
have streets, scwers, watcr mains and gas
mains, as weil as a lighting system and an
aqueduct. These things cost a great deal
of money. Some one may ask where we
could get enough people to put up the sum
required. Well, as I have said, the Bill is
permissive, and if nothing comes of the
proposal the country will be no poorer by
reason of it. I have strong hopes tha-t we
may find people who are willing to invest in
such a project. I think even the honourable
senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
who is kind enough to listen to me, would put
up some money. He would have faith.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

No, I would

10t.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am sorry.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is not the
honourable gentleman's last word. Maybe he
would like to be one of the biggest stockholders and wants to get bis stock cheap.
The regulations would be such that the
investors would not be hampered by one
probe after another simply because people
said they were making too great a profit. It
is questionable. in the first place, whether
they would make a profit at all, but I say, let
us give them a run for their money.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What would be the
source of revenue, and what would be the
charges?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If there were a
free zone, naturally the company would have
to own the land on which it was situated.
It could not have a free zone on property
that did not belong to it. It would have to
acquire the land.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It could be leased.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does the honourable gentleman think that any farmer is
going to tear down his buildings and lease the
land?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
would lease it for 99 years.

Sure. He

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
The land
would have to be purchased outright. Tien
parts of the property within the area would
be sold to anybody who wanted to erect a
building for manufacturing.
He would not
pay rent for the land, but would own it. He
would build his plant and carry on operations
there. and would pay a certain amount for
the right to do that. The Bill provides that
the Minister of National Revenue shall settle
the amount of the charges. If the honourable
gentleman reads -the Bill he will sec that it
contains every possible safeguard to prevent
anybody from taking advantage of the publie.
If, when the Bill goes to committee. it can
be made any stronger in that respect, so
much the better.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable
gentleman will pardon me for interrupting
again. but J am interested. All we have had
so far is a picture of people investiiig large
suims of monev in connection with the estahlishment of a free port. J am interested in
knowing how they are going to get a return
on their investment. They acquîire the property and sell it off, and I can understand
how they would make a profit on that. But
what other sources of revenue are there?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
storage and other charges.

There

are

the

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Do those who establish free zones put up all the buildings?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No. Every man
puts up his own factory in the free zone. He
buys the land and pays a certain rental for
the privilege.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
real estate deal.

It looks like a big

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is one part
of it.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: The honourable
gentleman speaks of the free port of Hamburg.
Is the free zone of the city of Hamburg
owned by the city or by a private corporation
such as my honourable friend has just outlined?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I cannot tell the
honourable gentleman, but there are honourable members of this House who have been
there and probably will be able to answer
bis question.

MAY 13, 1936
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: It is a private
company. Before the free port was established at Hamburg there had been practically
nothing at all constructed in the selected
area. It had been occupied by fishermen.
Afterwards land, upon which warehouses,
factories, and even wharves were erected, was
leased to business men of other countries
who wanted to bring in goods. To-day the
port belongs to the city of Hamburg. The
same procedure would have to be followed
in Canada or anywhere else.
A company
would have to buy the land and lease it to
foreign companies which wished to establish
plants there. The revenue would be derived
from the leasing of the areas inside the free
port, and from harbour dues, which in free
ports are usually about double the dues of
ordinary ports.

291

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It would give
work to Canadians.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will my bonourable friend allow me to say that the
expression "free ports" should not be used?
What the honourable gentleman has in mind
is a zone to which goods will be brought,
either for storage or for manufacture, and
where the customs charges will not be paid
until the goods are reshipped.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, it would give
employment to Canadian labour and cause
prosperity such as we had in the time of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
My seconder has requested me to read a
long article which appeared in yesterday's
Montreal Herald-there was another article
in Le Canada-but I shall read only a few
lines:
Certain local interests, it is true. are
doubtful of the success of the "free port" idea
on this side of the Atlantic, chiefly on the
ground that it would be an experiment.
In this connection it should be pointed out
that the Bill is an enabling one. The "free
port" would not be another case of public
ownership. The Bill does not provide for that,
but clears the way for private initiative,
financed by private capital, to provide the
"free port" .zone and operate it.
Just one word more and I am through.
Trade is peculiar. For instance, Chicago is,
and has been for years. a great market for
wool. English merchants buy wool in Chicago,
take it to England and manufacture it, and
then send back the beautiful English tweeds
with which we are all familiar, and sell them
in Chicago. Nobody denies that. The whole
operation of manufacturing and exporting
could be carried on in the free zone without
any trouble.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: When the goods
are shipped out of the country there are no
duties paid.

That is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
done now, is it not? If imported goods are
later exported, there is a rebate of duty.

Hon. Mr.
Canada.

Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: But when you
have a free port you avoid the necessity of
getting a drawback. Furthermore, in a free
port you are allowed to work on goods
brought in, even to change the character of
gods, and, to assemble machinery and so on;
but you cannot do so in a bonded warehouse.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
dues?

The port

Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes, port dues.

DANDURAND:

But

within

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: When the goods
that have come into the free zone are shipped
out again the regular customs tariff will have
to be paid.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no.
Goods
shipped into Canada would be subject to duty,
but if they were taken to Detroit, for instance,
the dues would have to be paid there.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Under the
present system a man can put his goods into
a bonded warehouse. But does the honourable
gentleman mean to say that if. I were to
bring raw materials from abroad into a free
zone and manufacture a product there, it
would be free from customs duties when I
shipped it out?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes. That is the
essential, if the destination is out of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Then the Government would get no revenue at all.
12745-19J

Hon. M.r. CASGRAIN:
In conclusion I
will enunciate a truism. I make no apology
for doing so, because truisms do bear
enunciating sometimes in order that we may
be reminded of their solid, if seif-evident,
trutihs.
Material wealth, in its ultimate analysis,
is the transformation of the raw materials of
nature into useful commocdities, and the
transportation of such materials and commodities from where they are produced to
where they are wanted. That transformation
requires po-wer, plentiful and cheap, and also
highways,
commod'ious
and
economical.
Goods can be carried far more cheaply on
an ocean than on land. The cost of carrying a ton one thousand miles by sea is no

SENATE

292

more than for carrying it one hundred miles
by raihvay. Now Montrea.1, wbich is 960
miles inland, is still an ocean port; so it has
cheap transportation facilities. And there is
plenty of ceuap power. Right now there is
available at Montreal more than 200,.000 horsepower in electric current that is absolutely
idle. owing to the repudiation by the Ontario
Government of contracts whicli it had made.
I suppose that could be bought as cieaply as
any power in the world. I. there any place
on earth where one could find a better
port, with cheaper transportation facilities
and power, than in and around Montreal?
Hon.
Bay?

Mr. GILLIS: Whbat about Hudson

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It would give nie
much pleasure to deal with the honourable

Hon. THOMAS CANTLEY: Honourable
senators, having had some acquaintance with
ports referred to by ny honourable friend
from Le Lanaudière (lon. Mr. Casgrain), I
should like to make a few remarks on the
question that is before us. And perhaps,
following the example of my bonourable friend
fron Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Rainville), I may
read a good deal of what I have to say.
Probably the oldest free ports where products of foreign countries were exchanged were
those of Tyro and Sidon, denouneud by the
prophet Ezekiel, who foretold the decay and
destruction of these cities. Following them as
great uxchnge ports cane Venice and Genoa,
for miny years the modern frce ports of the
Europe later saw a conMediterrane.an.
sidorable numuber of exchange ports more or
less free: Hamburg, Bremen, Danzig, Stockholm. Marseilles and Havre.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Libeck.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: London as a great
port bas lasted longer than Tyre and Sidon.
That is a fact not often realized.
The world's present great seaports perhaps
have not as ricb a trade as had old-time
ports such as Carthage, Bruges, Cadiz and
Venice, with their business in ivory, peacocks, gold, myrrh, and other luxuries of the
rich.
At present the great bulk of the world
transport trade is in coal, ores. metals, fibres
and foodsuffs, which provide the raw materials
and the energy to drive the furnaces and mills
of present-day industry.

Ir. CASGRAIN.

Gernany bas in all nine froe ports, ranging
in size from Hamiburg on the Elbe, with an
aiea about twenty-five hundred acres in extent, to Danzig on the Oder, having an area
of only about one acre. When, in 1871, Hamburg and Bremen entered the German Empire
they stipulated that they should remain outside the Customs Union. In 1879 Cermany
enacted a protective tariff to develop her inlustries and save lier threatened agriculture,
against which the grain of the American
prairies was flowing in. Cheapened production
and cheap transportation then made possible
the exchange of natural products and goods
that had never before moved in quantity
fron their place of production. It was this
change in Cermany's economic life that made
Hamrburg decide to accede to the importunicf Bismarck and enter the Customs Union.
i
Yet so strongly did the belief in transhipment
tride p-rsist that the greater part of the port
was fenced off and set apart to remain a free
port outside the Customs Union, just as the
sshPole city had previously been outAide the
Union.
Hamburg has no docks, so-called, but has
an open tidal basin. Large vessels destined
for Hamburg, which is situate eighty-five ruiles
from -the North Sea, have to transfer to
ligbters at Brunshausen, some miles below the
harbour. Indeed, the big German liners before the War were forced to dock at Cuxhaven. During the winter months in some
years ice forms in the river, and powerful
ice-breakurs and tugs are provided by the
port to a.ist vessels up and down. The port
lias 185 miles of railway sidings within the
free port area, while the docks are splendidly
equipped with locomotive cranes and immense
warehouses. They have warebousus exceeding in size any to be found in this country.
They are huge build:ings of eight and, nine
stories, every floor having elevator service and
being devoted to the storage and reassortnient of goods that come in.
One would expect te find a good deal of
remanufacturing carried on in this froe port,
but the curious thing is that such is net the
case. It might be thought that if a free
port were established in our Maritime Provinces automobile manufacturers, for instance,
would bring in there such accessories as they
get from the United States, on which they
now pay duty, and automobiles would be
assembled and shipped out to all parts of
the world. I think that could be done. But
the experience of Hamburg has been that the
amount of manufacturing 'done within the
free zone is comeparatively small. That is a
curious fact, which up to the present time
has net been explained.

into by one of those able administrators
whomt for generations the French Government
had at its command, and hie reported that
Louishurg would neyer truly flourish unless
it had free trade with the English colonies
of Canada and the West Indies. It was
suggested that to enable them to make two
voyages to Europe instead of only one, transatlantic ships should corne to Louisburg and
discharge their cargoes inito smaller vessels
better fitted for the long and difficuit route
up the St. Lawrence.
The regulations of those days hampered
legitimate trade, though they were ignored
by both Frcnch and English seamen, because
thc profits derived front smuggling were a
strong inducement to break the law. The
condition was somewhat analogous to that
which prevailed during prohibition in the
United States.
That admirable harbour, open ail the year

of that day, made little headway until it

Trade with New Enigland was constant and
lucrative. The great clipper chips front India
and South America called regularly. In short,
the port was a meeting-place for traders
front ail countries, some wishing to seil, others
to buy. Louisburg dev eloped steadily until
it came to be thc third port on the North
Atlantic coast, being surpassed only by New
York and, I think, Philadelphia.
During those years pamphlets werc published and sent to the British Ministry
prophesying destruction of aIl British trade
by the more entcrprising Frenchimen. Visitors
from France were much impressed by Louisburg and predicted a great fututre for it. Then
there came war.
It seems to me that the work of preservîing

Hon. G. H. BARNARD: Honourable menmbers, we are, 1 think, indeb)ted te the honourable senator who sponsors this Bill (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain'i for a very interesting discussion.
1 muet take issue with the honourable
gentleman from New Glasgow (Hon. Mr.
Cantley). He stated there were only two
ports in the Dominion suitable as free ports
or free t.rading zones. For many years past
the people of my cit.y have been very strongly
of opinion that Victoria is absoiutely the
logical place for the establishment of such
a port on the Pacifie ceast.

matter of fact it is se easy of access that
pilotage dutes are negl-igible.
Many ships passing Victoria go. net to
Vancouver and tihe other mainiand ports of
British Columbia, but to the ports of Seattle,
Tacoma, Evcrett and other populous centres
on Puget Sound. The recuit is that Victoria
is the first and the last port of eaul for al
navigation to and fromt the North Paicifie
coast of t.his continent. That in itef is an
important point in the location of a free
port.
Victoria lias two grax ing docks. one capable
of accoiritmodating any passenger shîp on the
Pacifie coast. The topography is such that
te establish an isoiated section as a free
port wonld he ea-sy and economical.
There is. I think, an erroneous impression
abroad as te what a free port means. Many
persons hiave the idea. that if they iived je
or adijacent te a free port they would get
their goohi- frce of customs duty, and that
c onseq tentlvy it would be a cheap place and
very desirahie residentialiy. This impression,
of course. is; aIl wrong,. Geods st.ored in a
free zone could net be taken eut for consuînption in the adjacent locality until psyment of the usuai Canadian customs duty.

MAY 13, 1936
The advantages of a free port lie in the
tremendous increase of shipping, the larger
amount of freight and other business, and the
establishment of shipbuilding. As far as I
cau sec, m'anufacturing would be more or
less a muiner factor. A very important factor would be the greater number of comnmercial and financial transactions, including
banking, exchange, lending of money on warebouse certificates, and, so on-operations that
naturally bring in their train a considerable
volume of business.
As I understand it, in the free zone itself
no one would be allowed to reside except
possibly such persons as were employed in the
works within the zone, and ships' crews.
Personatly. I shýal be very glad to see this
Bill given third reading if it will have the
effect of causing the Governme-nt to give
the matter serious considieration. I do flot
for a moment anticipate that the Bill wil
become law th-is session, but this discussion
certainly can do no harm, and I hope it
wi]l do some good.
1 intend to vote for the second reading.
Hon.,C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable. members, my purpose in ris3ing is to give to
the mover of this resohution (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) occasion to answer a few oibjections that quite naturally arise -i the minds
of those wh'o have listened with a gre-at deal
of interest to bis explanation of the Bill. I
desire to tbank the sponsor for having cenceived the usefulness of this discussion, and
bis seconder (Hon. Mr. Rainville) for having
propounded thbe question.
My first objection-if it be an objection
-would be this. I doubt whether there would
be any prospect of profit sufiicient to induce
a group of men to estabâ.sb a free port.
If there is not, we must rely on a m-urncipality, a province, or the Dominion Government to undertake the venture. This weuld,
in part, be an objection to the proposai, for
undou.btedly it would be preferable to have
an enterprise of this kind controlied and
administered by private initiative.
Hon. Mr. CASGRUN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: This is my second
objection. The purpose of thie Bill is to
carve out a free t.rade area.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Precisely.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIiEN: I grant that one
of the resultant advantages would be to save
the trouble and expense of paying customs
duties. If1 you store a cargo of goods in a
bonded warehuuse you must pay the entire
duty, which m-ight arnount te $1,000,000.

295

When those goods are taken out of bond for
export you get a refund of 99 We cent of
the duty, 'but flot one cent of înterest on
your money.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: And it may have
been outstanding tbree monthýs.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That ineonçvenience and expense would be done away with.
You could store your goods in the free trade
zone, break bulk there, and then sort or
blend themn as you might desire. That eanflot be donc under our present bonded warebouse system.
Now, honourable senators, I put this question: Our country, like ail other proteeted
countries, is menaced. by f oreign indu.stry, anid
the greater the facility for foreign industry
to penetrate into our domestie mariket the
worsc it will be for Canada-if you agree
that protection is necessary. If yeu establisha
a free zone in this country are yen flot thereby
giving a great advantage to the natural comnpetitors* of Canadian industry? They ean
bring in their Taw materials by water at low
oost, and they can manufacture their preducts
here, and keep themn here until they find it
advantageous to throw them on the Canadian
market.
Hon. Mr. CASGIRAIN: Then they have to
pay.
Hon. M.r. BEAUBIEN: 0f course they
have to pay, like everybody else; but they
arc flot subject-to any of the disadvantages
encountered by those who bring the raw
materials to their own country, to be manufactured there. and then send the finished preduct te Canada at a very much greater expense.
That, it seems to me, may be one objection.
I do net say it is prohibitive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On the other
hand. the raw matorial would have te be
transformed into the finished product by
Canadian 'labour.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That, of cour"e,
is an advantage. But if the free zone sheuld
become a large manufacturing centre the
effeot would be felt throughout Canada. I
just bring that phase of the matter te the
attention of the honourable gentleman, so
that he may reply. I should like te be
assured that we are net providing in Canada
a -place which would sirrply enable f oreign
industries te compete with ouýr ewn industries
te better advantage. There is no doubt that
foreign manufactuirers wouild enjoy an advantage in being able te bring their geods in
under favourable conditions as far as freight
rates are cencerned. They would aIse have
the advantage ef being able te manufacture

the sea, instead of ascending the cliff upon
which Genoa is buit. 1 told the chauffeur
how to proceed, and was very much surprised,
when passing by the wharves, to be suddenly
stopped by gendarmes, or policemen, and
customs officers, and, to learn that I was a
prisoner ini a free zone. I then recalled that
as we had entered the gate there had been a
noise as if someone had calied, though neither
rny chauffeur nor myseif had realized that it
concerned our.selves. However, information
had evidently been teiephoned ahead, and we
were stopped. Neither my chauffeur, who
was a Montreaier, nor myseif couid discuas
the situation in Italian. Ail I couid say was
"Firenze." But when one of the gendarmes
jumpýed in beside my chauffeur and compelied
us ýto back at ieast three-quarters of a mile,
I reaiized what was meant by a free port.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nameiy, one
that is flot free.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The customs
officers wanted to open my trunks and see if
I had anything to declare.
Ail I desire to say is that I believe a
gpecial cornmittee might, weil examine this
proposai. My honourable friend (Hion. Mr.
Casgrain) has brought the subi ect before us
in the form of a Bill, but I venture to say
that we shouid hesitate to pass the Bill before
being thoroughly enlightened as to what, effeet
a free port would have upon our national
economy.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Then, in order to
simplify the matter, I would move, seconded
by the honourabie member from Repentigny
(Hon. Mr. Rainville), that the Bill be referred
to the Committee on Railways, Teiegraphs
and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: May I say one
word more? This Bill is brought in now
because New York is organizing a free port,
or a free zone, which means the same thing,
and is going abead with it very fast. If we
do not do something the United States is
going to get the business. I arn convinced
that if we were prepared we should. get a
bigger share of the business than the United
States. One of my reasons for saying this is
that the cost of a free port in Canada would
be much lower than the cost of the one in
New York ha.rbour; and as soon as our free
port was estabiisbed we should get the benefit
of harbour dues and the revenues derived
from the leasing of land.
Another word. We are not interested in
knowing definiteiy whether a private company, a municipality or a province will uxidertake to build a free port, or whether those
who go into it are going to make money on

297

their investment. I am sure that before anybody invests any money in a free port he
will make a study of the question. Furthermore, this Bill is pureiy permissive.
Free ports have been the subject of study
and agitation in the United States for twentyfive or thirty yea.rs. Two or three inquiries
have been made, and I have seen one large
book containing discussions pro and con. But
one fart remains: they have decided to have
a free port in the United States. This being
so, should we wait a year before thoroughly
studying the question? I am afraid that if
we do we shahl he too late. If the question
couid be studied immediateiy by a special
committee, composed possibly of members of
both Houses of Parliament, and with instructions to report before the end of this session,
we should have a chance.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask one
question?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The honourabkt
gentleman says that in the United States this
matter has been studied for twenty-five years.
Up to the present time have any free zones
been created?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes. There is one
at Staten Island. Already wharves have been
built.
Hon. Mr. BEATJBIEN: When was it
created?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: About five weeks
ago. It is right in the port of New York, on
the south shore of the bay. It has an immense
acreage of land, and the wbarves have already
been transferred by the Government to the
cornpany.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is it privateiy
owned?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: It is a private
company, but eyidently the Governmcnt bat
furnished the land and wharves.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Which Government,
State or Federal?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: That I cannot
tell you.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The company is
managing the Government's investment?
Hon. Mr. RAIN VILLE: The honours.ble
senator from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) bas said that he wanted to be sure
there would be no contribution from the
Government. G-eneraliy, in countries which
have free ports, the governments have contributed 50 per cent of the organization

expenses. In France the Government does
that nlot only in the case of free ports, but
for ail ports.
After ail, governiments are
intercsted in encouraging shipping.
Again I refer to a feature with respect to
which my honourable friend bias made a point.
Duty is payable at *once on any goods caming
into a bonded warehousc at Montreal, Vancouver, Halifax, Saint, John, Quebec, or anywhere cîne. If any sucb goods are shiýpped
out to another country a drawback may be
applied for, but it will be perhaps two, three,
four or fi e, mont'bs before the shipper gets
bis moncy baek from the Gýovernment. That
situation is not an agrecable anc to business
me.n generally. ýContrast that with what would
liappen ;in a free port. The goods would be
brougfit into a walled bonded area, snd while
they remained there fia d'uty would be payable. On any goods taken out of tbat wall.cd
arca for delivery elsewbere in Canada the fuîl
duty would bave to be paid at once; but in
the case of anytbing takien out for sbipment
to another country not a cent of duty would
be charged by Ca-nada, and none at ahl would
have to bc paid until the destination was
reacbed.
Tbe difference is, bonourahie senatars, that
aIl gonds putt into and taken out of a walled
area would be handled by Canadian labour.
1 tbink ýthat is an important diýfference at a
time like this, ivben we are trying to salve
the problemn of unemployment.
It is the
(luty of every government ta cansider carefully wbethcr any public works it undertakes
will create tbe greatest amount of permanent
enaployment tbat can be obtained for the
mony. Tbe building of a public higbway
from Vancouver to Halifax is a spiendid
s<bIerne; it will resuit in a great increase in
toulrist traffic; but it is not sa satisfactory
when considered from tbe point of view of
the crecation of jobs later on. Whien we build
roads ino mining districts we make it easier
for people to get ta tbose parts of the country
and di-sciver mines. and in that way we are
likely to open up a great amount of permanent
employment.
And that is wbat we sbould
be doing if we establislhed a frce port.
Some people say that the St. Lawrence
river cannot be succe.ssfuilly dredged. It can
bc. and 1 contend tbat if it were made as
safe witb respect to dredging as it is witb
respect ta ligbting and to arganization. the

MOTION

FOR REFERENCE TO COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. ýCASGRAIN: 1 move, seconded
by the honourable senator from Repentigny
(Hon. Mr. Rainville), that the Bill be
referred to t.he Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I rise simply to point out that
there is likely to be sent over to us an
impôrtant Railway Bill which may keep the
Railway Committee busy for practically ail
the remainder of the session. I think it
would be in the interest of the present
measure te have it rederred to a speolal committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAjM: This is a
special subject and should be reiferred to
a committee composed, of members who
know so.mething about it. As chairman of
the Railway Committee I ar n ft trying to
avoid work. I have become accustorned
t0 committees by this time. It strikes me,
h*owever, that in the interest of the project
it would ha better to have a special cornmittee, selected after consultation. I would
suggest that the motion be not put until the
muver and the seconder discuss with the
leaders on both aides and with other honourable members the question whether it would
nlot be wise to have a special committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do nlot think we
cou]d have a ibetter chairman than the chairman of the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. He is the chairman
for me. It wo'uld not take very long to
consider this Bill. X~ we have a special
committee the measure will probably be
given a first-class funeraL.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
desire to send this Bill to a cemetery, but
I agree with the right honourable gentleman
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
We are going to have the Railway Bill before
us at some timeHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And the Harbours Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MFIIGHEN: The Railway Bill w-ihl necessarily be referred to the
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours, and it seems t0 me that if we
give it the attention we should, it will occupy
us pretty continuously for a considerable
period. And we shall have another measure,
a bih for consolidating the management of
h.arbours, whieh will quite properly go to the

299

same coimittee. If I were the father of the
present Bill I too should like to have it
referred to a committee of which the right
honourable senator from Eganville is chairman, but I should prefer to have it before
a committee other than the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAI'N: Could the right
honourable senator from Eganville be chairman of a special cominittee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He could
he a member, if not the chairman. 1 wiIl
move t.he adjournment of the debate on the
motion to commit. It will be possible
to-morrow, I think, to name a very good
committee to consider this measure. I have
one or two names in mind at the moment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to support the view expreased by my right honourable friend fTom Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) and my right honourable friend
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I draw
the attention of the mover and the seconder
of the Bill to the fact that the special committee would be given power to hear avidence
froni experts-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN : From. boards
of trade, for instance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The committee
would have the power to procure ah the data
whieh Parliament requires in dealing with
this messure. My honourabie friends wilI
agree tihat in both Houses there are probably
not altogetiher tanl members who knoîw very
much about the subject of free ports. It will
be for the sponsors of the Bill to bring forward
such expert evidence as will carry weight in
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would a report
by a special committea carry as much weight
as one from the Railway Comimittee?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGR.AIN: Then I have no
objection to a special committee. And if
my seconder is agreeable I would leave the
selection of the conimi.ttee f0 the leaders on
both sides.
Hon. MT. RAINVILLE: That is agreeable.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: And I would suggest that the committee 'be as small as
possible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Seven?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes.
On motion of Right Honl. Mr. Meighen,
the debate was adjourned.

SENATE
SALE

OF GOVERNMENT

INQUIRY-DISCUSSION

SHIPS

CONCLUDED

The Senate resoned from May 6 the
adjourned debate on the question proposed
by Hon. Mr. Ballantyne:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
te the reported sale of certain ships owned or
controlled by the
Canadian
Government
Merchant Marine. Limited, and inquire of the
Government as te the price paid and the terrms
of the sale.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honouîrable
members of the Senate, the honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ball'antyne), who
is the father of the Canadian Government
Merchant Marine, takes strong exception to
the recent sale by the Government of he
remaining ten vessels of the original fleet of
If the honourable gentleman is
sixty-six.
now opposed to the sale of Canadian Govern-ment Merchant Marine ships he is somewhat tardy in his opposition, as sales bave
been made almost ever since the fleet was
constructed and placed in commission.
I have in my hand the third annual report
Merchant
Government
of the Canadian
Marine by Mr. D. B. Hanna, President of the
Board of Directors. That Board was appointed
by the Government in which the honourable
senator from Alma held the important portfolio of Marine and Fisheries. The Board's
experience covering the first three years of the
operation of the fleet led it te make certain
definite recommendations. which will be found
set out on pages 8 and 9 of the report; and
these recommendations, I may say, were reaffirmed by the Thornton Board in the following year.
The first recommendation, at the end of
1921 operations, was that all the small-type
vessels. twenty-nine in number, be disposed
if and the fleet reduced te thirty-seven ships.
At the same time the management recommended that the construction cost of the
vessels, approximately $191 per dead-weight
ton, should be reduced te $75, the then current
construction cost of vessels of similar type in
both Canada and Great Britain. That is net
my statement, but the statement of a friendly
Board of Directors. On the basis of this
official report and recommendation a great deal
of money might have been saved the Canadian
taxpayer if the construction of the Canadian
Government Merchant Marine had been deferred only a few years; but of course much
more migbt have been saved if the fleet had
never been buil:t, as will be seen by the data
presented last week by the honourable senator
from Guysborough (Hon. Mr. Duff).
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE.

It is of interest to note that the recoummended sale of twenty-nine vessels was made
in April, 1922, within three months of the
completion of the final vessel of the fleet.
There was a short delay, but during 1925
eight vessels were disposed of, and by the end
of 1926 seventeen had been sold. During 1928
seven were transferred te the West Indies
service of the Canadian National Steamships,
for use with the "Lady" boats built te implement the West Indies trade agreement of 1925.
During 1929 seven vessels were sold, and one
more was disposed of in 1930.
At the end of 1931 the Canadian Government Merchant Marine fleet had been reduced
te twenty-nine vessels, of which ten were laid
up as a measure of economy. By the end of
1933 the fleet had been reduced te twelve, of
which three were laid up; and from 1934 until
the recent sale the fleet consisted of ten ships.
one of which was out of commission. It will
thus be seen that the entire history of the
fleet has been one prolonged sale. That policy
was forced upon successive governments since
1920 by the difficulties of the situation which
these governments in turn were obliged to
face.
Net the least of these difficulties has been
the gradual shrinkage in world trade. In 1921
there was a total of 235 voyages made by the
Canadian Government Merchant Marine to all
parts of the world, and on those services there
was an operating loss of $2,325,905. In 1929
the West Indies business was taken over entirely by the Canadian National (West Indies)
Steamships, Limited, $8,608,711 having been
spent for five more suitable vessels, known as
the "Lady" boats, for that service. With each
succeeding year from 1929 te 1934 there was a
gradual reduction in services until thc
voyages came to be confined entirely between
Canada and Australia and New Zealand.
That was the situation at the end of 1935.
The honourable senator from Alma expresses
surprise that a sale of such magnitude should
be made by Order in Couneil. He ought net
to be too greatly surprised, for, as will be
noted from information printed in Senate
Hansard, the late Government between the
years 1930 and 1935 disposed by Order in
Council of no fewer than twenty-one of these
vessels, singly and in groups.
The honourable senator also takes exception
te the sale of these ships at what he terms a
ridiculously low price, less than $5 a ton dead
weight. As te that, it is perhaps sufficient te
point out that the sale of the ten vessels, te
which exception is taken, brought an average
price of $41,992 a ship, or $4.76 a dead-weight
ton. A little computation in arithmetic from
the printed information already available te
honourable senators will show that the twenty-

MAY 13, 1936
one vessels disposed of by the late Government
for $363,906 brought an average price of
$17,328, or $2.52 a dead-weight ton. In the circumstances, the honourable senator from Alma
would seem to have very little to complain of
when the results of the sales by the late Government and the present Government are contrasted.
The honourable senator stated lie had been
told by two experienced steamship men that
if the present Government had sold the ships
on the open market it could have obtained
twice the prioe received from the recent sale.
It was the policy of previous Governments
and the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine to sell surplus vessels in the open
market, but in time that method became a
handicap rather than a safeguard. On that
point I would quote from a letter of December 30, 1932, signed by Mr. A. H. Allan,
General Manager of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, to Mr. E. E. Fairweather, now Chief Counsel of Canadian
National Railways, Montreal. In that letter
Mr. Allan pointed out that it had been
customary to advertise vessels for sale by
public tender, and he went on to say:
We have in the past received satisfactory
tenders on this basis, but since the value of
second-hand world tonnage has depreciated, we
have been unsuccessful in securing any satisfactory
offers
by
public
advertisement.
Tenderers recently have qualified their offers
by naming numerous restrictions, such as:
delivery in foreign country, stipulating that
the vessel must be in class, or only agreeing
after bottom examination.
In a subsequent paragraph Mr. Allan stated
that all offers worthy of consideration were
submitted to the Board of Directors of the
Canadian Government Merchant Marine. At
the time that Board was also the Canadian
National Railway Board of Directors, just as
when the recent sale was approved the
Canadian National Board of Trustees also
formed the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine Board. The sale now complained of
was duly approved by resolution of that board
before authority to acoept the offer was given
by the Governor in Council.
The complete letter from Mr. Allan to Mr.
Fairweather was as follows:
Montreal, Que.,
December 30, 1932.
E. E. Fairweather, Esq.,
General Executive Assistant & Counsel,
Canadian National Railways,
Montreal, Quebec.
Dear Sir,
Further to our conversation of this morning
in regard to the oractice adopted by this
company in relation ta the sale of steamers.
As you no doubt are aware, before any
vessels can be disposed of they must be
advertised for sale by public tender. Copy

301

of standard form of advertisement is attached
hereto. [t is customary for the tender to be
opened at the office designated in the advertisement and telegraphic advice sent to this
office of any offers received, with special conditions attached.
We have in the past received satisfactory
tenders on this basis, but since the value of
second-hand world tonnage has depreciated, we
have been unsuccessful in securing any satisby
public
advertisement.
factory
offers
Tenderers recently have qualified their offers
by naming numerous restrictions, such as:
delivery in foreign country, stipulating that
the vessel must be in class, or only agreeing
after bottom examination.
It has been our practice when this type of
tender has been received to refuse to consider,
solely for the reason that the expenses involved
in operations of this nature are not warranted.
When consideration is given to the price that
is being offered for second-hand vessels to-day,
and we are only selling vessels on the basis
"as is, where is," subject to examination afloat,
public advertisement invariably brings into the
picture a number of brokers who on behalf of
their clients make offers by private sale. These
are duly considered by the management and
provided we can get a price which we figure
approximates the market value for similar
vessels in Great Britain on the conditions that'
the vessel is delivered in Canada and the Canadian flag is substituted with a flag of the
country under which it is to be registered,
these offers are submitted to the Board of
Directors. If approved by them and in turn
by Ottawa, an Order in Council is passed, or
approval for the price is secured from the
Minister of Railways.
We have not deviated from the foregoing
practice for the last three years, and as I have
already stated, in view of the general depressed
conditions we feel it is the only satisfactory
basis on which the present surplus tonnage can
lie disposed of.
Yours very truly,
A.H.A.
General Manager.
(Papers in which advertisements are made:
Halifax Herald, Vancouver Sun, Montreal Star,

The honourable senator from Alma claimed
on reliaible authority that had the vessels
been scrapped, double the present price could
have been secured. In that connection, I
am advised that the salvage officer of the
Dominion Government at Ottawa states that
on a scrap basis these vessels would have
brought approximately $10,000 each, which
is about one-quarter of the price secured
Some of
under the present arrangement.
the vessels preiviously disposed of were sold
for scrap or dismantling purposes, and the
prices secured were nearer $1 per dead-weight
ton than the figure of $10 which the honourable senator evidently had in mind.
The vessels now being sold were built in
1919, 1920 and 1921, and are handicapped
by having a speed of only 8j to 10J knots,
with heavy consumiption of fuel and lack of
refrigeration. They are compelled to com-

SENATE
pete with modern ships of greater speed, lower
operating costs, and in all respects better
adapted to the trade. This being the case.
the Government was faced with the necessity
of providing at least six new and modern
vessels. and this consideration had great
weight with it in its decision to dispose of
the remaining vessels of the fleet and at
the same time arrange for a continuation
of the services on an improved basis.
It is the intention of the purchasers to incorporate a new Canadian company. My
information is that the vessels now being
sold are intended to be scrapped, but that,
as provid
h
by paragraph 9 of the agreement,
it is the intention of the purchasers "in the
first instance" to opcrate in this trade any or
all of the ships purchased, and that "so long
as any or al of these ships are being operated, then the ship or ships shall bu manned
by pecrsonnel available from those already in
serv.ire,"
If the vessels are to be operated for the
entire five-year term, as claimed by the honourable senator from Alma, although the
agreement (loes not so statu. tien the employment assurance would cover the fiveyear period. and not the two-year period
concerning whieh b complained. and whih.
as a matter of fact, may be regard-ed as the
minimum undertaking with respect to both
shore staff and crews. These arrangements
are appreciated by those protected and are
at least evidence that the Government bas
made reasonable effort to provide for the
human el-ement in the transaction.
The
records do not disclose that in any previous
sale similar provision was made in the case
of vessels disposed of for service elsewhere.
To su'm up. it will be apparent that the
sale of these ships is but the carrying to its
logical conclusion of the accepted policy of
every Canadian Government during the last
fifteen years. There bas been no change in
that policy except. for the better. All sales
have been by Oî4er in Couneil, and all have
been approved by the directors of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine.
The
present sale differs from previous sales in
that provision is made for the carrying on of
the trade involved, and for the protection
of the employees concerned. Therefore, when
the honourable senator frorm Alma speaks of
loss of trade and loss of employment he d.oes
not speak by the book.
The Select Standing Committee on Railways and Shipping owned, operated and controlled by the Govcrnment, a committee
appointed during the term of the late Administration, reported in 1931:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Your committee believe that the time has
come wben the Government should carefully
consider the abandonment of the Canadian
Government Merchant Marine, and the making
of arrangements with other shipping companies
so that the external trade of Canada will not
bu jeopardized.
In the following year, 1932, the committee
reaffirmed its stand in the following recommendation:
Your committee reiterate their view and
believe that the time ias come when the
Government should, if possible, abandon the
po*liy of operating a Government Merchant
Marine, and if possible arrange for the sale
or lease of the fleet, and where practicable
anid not contrary to Imperial or inter-liperial

relations. make arrangenents with other
shipping companies so that the trade of Canada
may be protected.
Honourable enators will note that what bas
been done is thus in entire accord with the two
recommendations to the late Government.
The cost of Canada's incursion into the field
of merchantile marine has been fully set forth
in official statements recently made available
in the course of this debate. From these
st:tements it will bu seen that the capital Ioss
has hien 79 millions. The operating loss has
been il millions-and would have been 31
millions greater if depreciation had been made
a charge on operation instead of a mere book
entry. Failure to provide for depreciation
ias useant that the entire loss bas had to be
absorbed on the sale. There is an additional
loss of 50 millions in interest accrued and
unpaid. Against these losses may bu offlet
four millions from the self-insurance fund.
and a million of interest paid when the fleet
was in its infancy, and before it grew too large
to stand the burden. In addition, there is the
$2,438,000 received from sale of ships, and the
value, less than a million, of the vessels
transferred to the Canadian National West
Indies services. A salvage of roughly 7
millions from a loss of 140 millions, not including depreciation: a final dividend of a
little more than five per cent.
In the circumstances, it is submitted that
in writing "finis" to such an entirely unsatisfactory chapter of public endeavour the
Government deserves from this Chamber, with
respect to the disposal of t'hese vessels, a
measure of commendation rather than the censure which bas been directed against it by the
honourable senator frorm Alma.
My honourable friend had to face execrable
economic conditions. No one will question
his sincerity and good faith, but, alas! fate was
against him.
Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Faith without works
is dead.

MAY 13, 1936
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourabie
senators, last week my right honourahie leader
(Right Hon. Mr. Maighen) said with reference
to the bad draftsmanship of a certain Bill
that the draftsman shouid have been given
the Victoria Cross. I would suggest that the
Victoria Cross be eonferred on the gentleman
who draftad the answer which the honourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has just raad. It does flot contain
a word in regard to the issue I placed bafore

the Housa. One would think from listaning
to the historical sketch that the ships sold

of 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920, and aiso the
unanimous approval of the Governinent of
the day.
In th-is memorandumn I have raceived no
answar to the questions I put to the honourable leader of the Govarninent. I do not
objeet to the selling of the ships, but I do
obj ait to the Govarninant selling ships of
that typa at sueh a very low price. Two of
those ships wara the iargast of the ships that
we buiit. They wara of 10,500 tons deadwaight carrying capacity, with threa dacks;
yat they were sold at a littia over $4 a ton.
The memorandum states that the speed of
the ships was Si knots. Either the writer of
the memorandum purposaiy intended to mislead the honourabla leader of the House or

he was totally ignorant of the details of the
fleet. I said the other day that the officiai
records in the Departinent of Marine show
tha-t the sea speed of the two large vessels is
13 knots an hour, and of the other vessais
11J knots.

because the word "reasonably" qualifies the
agreement as to the engaging of these men
and the 'buying of supplies. The long history
of what we have done or what the trustees
have recommended, let me say once more,
dodges the whole issue.
The speeds of these ships are as I have
indicated them to be, not as stated in the
memorandum read. Beifore I resume my seat
allow me once more to place my objections
categorically before the House. First, I say
that $4 a ton is a ridiculous price; second,
I say the agreement does not take care of
the men at all; in the third place, it does
not take care of the supplies; in the fourth
place there is not a word about repairs to
the ships, and in the fifth place there is not
a line to indicate that this company is going
to put new ships on the route. I compliment
the buyers and sympathize with the Government.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When the
honourable gentleman says-he did not say
it before-that the Government was acting
on the recommendation of the National
Board, he means the Board of Trustees?

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
honourable genitleman say the Board of
Trustees recommended this action?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Recommended

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, they did
not. That is not what took place at all. The
approval is there; but the ships belonged to
the Government, and the Government made
the sale and called upon the Board of Trustees
to approve of it. The Board did not recommend it at all.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Undoubtedly
the new company, or the purchasers, may
utilize these ships; but I may say that they
will utilise them while they are building new
ships.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thank my
honourable friend for correcting me. The
Select Standing Committee on Railways and
Shipping appointed by the late Government
reported in 1931-

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is nothing of that in the agreement.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the point at ali. We are talking about this
sale, not the general policy of selling. I want
to point out to the honourable gentleman, so
he will not make the same mistake again,
that he said to this House that the Board of
Trustees recommended this sale.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They approved.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: After the
thing was done; because they were called
upon to approve.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend speaks as if their approval had been
dictated.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Practically
dictated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps, if it
was done by someone exercising tyrannical
powers over them. But that is an assertion;
it is a surmise.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I have
spoken to only one of the trustees-not the
Chairman-and that is the information I got.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I should
suspect it was the one who practically refused
to sit with the Chairman for a number of
years past; and that would explain why the
whole organization has broken down.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It has not
broken down.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They may use
these ships. They have become their own
ships, and they will be used by them while
they are preparing to transform their organization.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Why does the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have the
statement that these ships will be replaced,
and that if the Government had retained
them they would have àhad to be replaced
by new ships which would have been built
at a cost of five or six million dollars. How
long they will be utilized I do not know.
As to personnel, I say that under th.e word
"reason-able" they are bound to take those
employees unless they show cause why they
should not take them. I believe that what
was important under the circumstances was
the continuation of the service. Now the
service is to be continued. I am quite sure
we shall gradually get a better service and
shall not be subject to the risks of operation
that have been carried since 1020. We have
acted under recommend-ations from the
National
Boardt-the Merchant Marine
department-which has been urging the late
Government and the present one to prceed
alonig these lines.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Another trustee
repeated the same information Vo me.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If they would
put their signatures~ to an approval which
Vhey would renounce a few days afterwards,
that would establish, their absolute unfitness
for the position Vhey occupy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Property
committed Vo them would be a different
matter. Those ships were not Canadian National property; they belonged directly Vo the
Goveroment of Canada. The owners, and
not those people at ail, were the ones to
decide on the -sale. Con.sequently the approval
does flot mean anything.
Hon. Mr. DANDURIAND: The Merchant
Marine is under the direction of these men.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is owned
by the Government of Canada, and always
has been; therefore the responsihility of sale
is the Covernment's responsibility and cannot
be shifted. What I dispute is that in this
case there was an initial recommendation ot
the sale. There was a request to approve
after the sale was made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was a
suhmaission of the offer, and I do not see much
difference.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The responsibility cannot be put on trusteos. The Governrnent cannot bide behind the skirts of the
trustees in respect of a property of the
Goveroment itself.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Undoubtedly the
Government cannot shift the responsibility,
but-

and not in operation. During my tîme the
boats kept in operation were by far the largest
and best boats, and they were performing a
useful service. The smaller boats were out
of date and had no crews. I surmise that
the good showing of the remaining boats
during the past year or two is partly due to
the fact that it was flot necessary te, carry
a number of boats that were flot in operation.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN.

MAY 14, 1936
Ottawa, May 14, 1936.
Dear Senator Dandurand,
With reference to the question asked by the
Right Honourable Mr. Meighen in the Senate
on May 6 as ta what will be the fate of the
unemployed men who are left in the relief
camps on the first of July, and what will be
the fate of those employed on railway work
after that work is done, I would state that up
to May 1 there had been a voluntary exodus
from the camps of 6,100 men. Many of these
men went to work on ships, and others
returned to the farm and to logging operations. The number remaining in the relief
camps on May 1 was 14,276. At that time
there were 10,000 jobs in railway maintenance
still available for meeting the problem of
supplying work to these men. It is expected
that as a result of this railway work, together
with the normal reduction in camp strength,
no great difficulty will be encountered in having the men in the camps suitably placed in
employment on July 1 of this year.
It is anticipated that the men in question
will work from four to five months, and with
a reasonable amount of care should be able to
provide for themselves for some time.
The most important factor in the policy is
the opportunity offered ta men now resident in
the camps to work under normal conditions, in
many instances for the first time in three
years, and it is expected that the present
policy will permit many of these men to seek
avenues of employment that were impossible
while resident in the camps.
Yours sincerely,
Norman MeL. Rogers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable leader of the House bas not stated
my question correctly. I did not ask what
would be done with the men in camps after
the first of July, because I assumed, and sa
stated in my question, that the camps were
ta be entirely broken up on that date and
therefore no men would be left in them.
What I wanted ta know was what provision
is being made ta take care of the men when
the camps are broken up. The reply that
bas been read is an answer ta some degree,
in that it states that about 6,000 men have
already gone away and there remain approximately 14,000, a number of whom are expected
ta be in railway work for a space of four
ta five months. But there is the fact, not
referred ta in the answer, that a large proportion of those 14,000 are unemployable.
Saoe provision will have ta be made for
them when the camps are disbanded.
There is a further point. I am afraid it is
hardly possible that men who may find work
for four or five months will have sufficient
ta carry them through the winter, even if they
all are ideally thrifty, which is not likely.
The payments that can reasonably be made
ta them would not be such as ta provide for
them during the winter. Sa, even though the
very best possible resulta be obtained from
12745-20J

307

this railway work, the expenditures on which
the Government shares in, will not the
situation within one month after the work
is finished be exactly as it was before the
work was begun?
With respect ta the unemployable, it is
still a mystery ta me what is ta be done
with them after the first of July.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only information I have bas just been communicated
ta the House. The letter implies that the
men who are set ta work under normal conditions will be near sources of employment
in various parts of the country, and the inference I draw is that they may be expected
ta find work for themselves in the future.
I shall bring the comments of my right
honourable friend 'ta the attention of the
Minister of Labour, who may make a statement with regard ta them.
Right Hon. Mr. 'MEIGHEN: May I call
attention ta another feature of the letter,
which has now been handed ta me? The last
paragra.ph says it is expected that the policy
of employing these men on railway work will
permit many of them ta seek avenues of
employment that were impossible while the
men were resident in camps. I am not aware
that there was any particular handicap ta
their getting employment while they were in
camps; nor would this letter show that there
was, for it states that some 6,000 have voluntarily left. It can be taken for granted that
they did not leave without having work. If
the new policy succeeds in enabling 6,000
more ta find jobs, I shall be very happy.
My right honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend will realize that when men
are congregated in a camp there is not a
strong incentive to them ta seek work, whereas
if they are sent back ta the communities
from which they came they may be absorbed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps hundreds are leaving all the time because they
get work?

CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL

REPORT OF

COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report
of the Standing Comrmittee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill U, an Act to amend
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932, and moved concurrence
thercin.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
is net now returned te the Senate in precisely
the same form as that in which the committec received it.
The Bill as introduced did net comply with
Senate rule 60a, which requires, in effect, that
when words are proposed to be added to or
taken fron statutes it sh-all be done by way
of repeal and substitution of sections, subsections or paragrapbs instead of by way of
amendmsent of expressions. This alone, there
being a number of such non-observances,
would have rendered it necessary to reprint
the Bill in committee, so that it might be
properly und.erstood in the Senate and in another place. But in addition the Superintendent of Insurance desired that certain corrections be made of erroneous references to
the numbers of sections of the Act, and
these eorrections had to be made.
I should add that the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act, which Bill U
am-ends, is in a deplorable condition from the
standpoint of even an expert counsel, with
respect to the numbering of its sections and
internal reference to sections by numbers, and
it would seem that a consolidation of the
Act should .be authorized at an early date.
Changes of numïberings have been frequent
and wholesale, with the result that it is now
next to impossible to be sure that when an
amendment purports to repeal, say, section
61, what really is desired is not the repeal
of section 72.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Apart from mere correction of original section numbers or of references to section
numbers, the committee made the following
amendments to the Bill as introduced:
1. Clause 2 was amended to provide for
annual meetings to be held in Canada.
2. Clause 3, for the reasons in the explanat'ory ,note, has been added to the Bill as
introdu-ced.
3. 'Clauses 6 and 7 of the original Bill
(clauses 7 and 8 of the Reprint) were struck
out.
4. Clause 19 of the Bill as reported, for
reasons appearing in an explanatory note
thereto, has been added to the Bill.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved the third reading
of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday the

an Act to enable the establishment, operation
and maintenance of free foreign trade zones
by provinces and municipalities or by public
agencies of either thereof, be referred to the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I move in amendment:
That this Bill be not referred to the Standing Comnittee on Railways, Telegraphis and
Harbours, but be referred to a special

con-

mittee to consist of the following senators,
namely. lon. Messrs. Casgrain. Rainville. King,
Iuiff, Beaubien, Sinclair, Barnard, Cantley,
Robinson.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I second the motion.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Quebec city is a
seaport, but apparently the membership of
the special committee does net include any
representatives from that quarter.
Righît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There are two,
the honourable senators from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) and Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien). Inasmuch as both are ardent
advocates, I tbink they will be heard from
in the committee. In fact this time Quebec,
numerically, is over-represented.
The amendment of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen
was agreed to.

MAY 14, 1!936
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
an honourable memýber has raised the question
of representation on the special comrnittee
which has been appointed. I wonder if the
House bas noticed that although there are
to be nine members of the committee, the
province of Ontario, with a representation of
twenty-one in this House, is flot represented
on the committee at ail. Yet the question to
be considered is, 1 presumne, a somewhat important one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suppose that
is another illustration of the generosity of
Ontario. The list of memnbers on the committee was prepared by the leader of the
Government and myseif very shortly before
the House met. I am flot certain that it is
important that Ontario be represented.
If
we have any inland provinces they are Ontario,
Saskatchewan, and, I suppose, Alberta, and
I arn quite sure that if Canada is ta have
a free port it will not be established in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Might not Toronto
be a free port?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
neyer anything free in Toronto.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
PROPOSED JOINT ADDRESS

The Senate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Commons with the following resolution:
That a message be sent to the Senate informing their Ilonours that this House has passed
an Address to His Most Excellent Majesty the
King, praying that he may graciously be
pleased to give his consent to submitting a
measure to the Parliament of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland to amend the British North America
Acts, 1867 to 1930, and the British North
America Act, 1907, and requesting their
Honours to unite with this House in the said
Address hereto attached.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved:
That the Senate do unite with the House
of Commons in the said Address, and do insert
in the blank space therein the words "Senate
and."
He said: Honourable members of the Senate,
the Address was placed on Hansard on Thursday last for the purpose of enabling honourable senators to familiarize themselves with

MAY 19, 1936
its contents. Therefore, if it please the Senate,
I shall proceed to explain the Address and
move its adoption, as the matter is somewhat
pressing. If the Senate concurs in the Address
passed by the Commons, it will be sent without delay to His Majesty in order that the
British Parliament may be asked to pass
legislation in consonance with the terms of
the proposed amendment.
The resolution covers two matters which,
though distinct, are somewhat correiated, as
they both tend to assist financially the provinces that are in need of help. The first
part of the proposed amendment widens the
field of taxation available to the provinces
and confirms certain action taken by them
in that direction. The object of the second
part of the amendment is to facilitate the
granting of financial guarantees to provinces
that cannot finance without those guarantees.
I may say that the provincial governments
are in accord with the purposes to be effected
by the proposed amendment to the British
North America Act. Inasmuch as nothing
is taken from the provinces, no one has raised
the objection that the legislatures should be
convened in order to give their approval.
The purpose of this legislation is simply to
extend the provincial jurisdiction. Some provinces have, I believe, expressed the opinion
that they would not need to ask any Dominion
guarantee in the future, but they are in
accord with the terms of the proposed amendments, inasmuch as they are interested in
the Dominion guarantee of loans that may be
made.
As to the first part of the resolution, I do
not intend to dilate upon what is direct and
what is indirect taxation, but shall simply
cite John Stuart Mill, who, in a very few
words, gives a clear definition of the two
systems of taxation. He says:
Taxes are either direct or indirect. A direct
tax is one which is demanded from the very
persons who it is intended or desired should
pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are
demanded from one person in the expectation
and intention that he shall indemnify himself
at the expense of another. Such are the excise
or customs. The producer or importer of a
commodity is called upon to pay a tax upon it,
not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him, but to tax through him
the consumers of the commodity from whom it
is supposed he will recover the amount by
means of an advance in price.
The Privy Council has more than once had
to give its opinion as to the constitutionality
of legislation on this very point. I would cite
but two decisions to indicate the view of the
Privy Council with respect to the right of a
province to tax directly or indirectly.
In 1924 the province of British Columbia
imposed a tax on oil. This tax was challenged,

311

the matter going as far as the Privy Council,
in the case of Attorney-General of British
Columbia vs. Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Here is the decision of the Privy
Council, which shows the nature of the action
attempted by the British Columbia Legislature:
Held, the British Columbia Fuel Oil Tax
Act, 1923, which provides that every person
who shall purchase within the province fuel oil
sold for the first time after its manufacture
in or importation into the province shall pay
a tax thereon, comes within the general principle which determines that the tax is an
indirect one and, therefore, invalid within the
meaning of the British North America Act,
1867, s. 92, head 2.
It will be seen that this tax was declared
invalid. However, the province of -British
Columbia wanted to tax fuel oil and gasoline;
so it proceeded in another way, and another
statute was passed. This also was challenged,
and finally was submitted to the Privy Council
in the case of Attorney-General for British
Columbia vs. Kingcome Navigation Company,
in which it was held:
The Fuel Oil Tax Act, 1930, of British
Columbia, which imposes a tax upon every
consumer of fuel oil according to the quantity
which he las consumed, is valid under s. 92,
head 2, of the British North America Act,
1867; the tax is direct taxation, because it is
demanded from the very persons who it is
intended or desired should pay it. As the tax
does not relate to any commercial dealing
with the commodity, it does not fall within
the category of customs and excise duties,
which are within the legislative powers of the
Dominion, both because they are by nature
indirect taxes and having regard to s. 122 of
the Act. The Act, being within the legislative
power given by s. 92, head 2, and not purporting to regulate trade and commerce, is not
invalid as infringing the Dominion authority
under s. 91, head 2, to legislate for that
purpose.
In this case, as will be seen, it was the
person who was being taxed, not the commodity. If, as has been recognized by this
latter judgment of the Privy Council, provinces have the right to tax directly, should we
intervene for the purpose of extending their
power where, under such procedure as the
British Columbia Legislature adopted, they
would be acting within their own rights?
My answer is that the provinces asked that
they be allowed to impose indirect taxation
on retail sales, because the method which they
have to adopt at present in levying direct
taxation is most cumbersome and difficult to
apply. Moreover, the taxes are expensive to
collect and, as they have been often
challenged by taxpayers, the provinces have
been subjected to very costly litigation.
It may be asked why we should come to
the aid of the provinces. The first reason is an

SENATE
obvious one. Some of the provinces are in
great need of income; they have been unable
to bàlance their budgets, and at times their
financial situation has been apparently hopeless. The second reason is that the Dominion
has invaded the field of the provinces to a
marked degree, though not unconstitutionally,
by imposing direct taxation. The Federal
Parliament has a righ.t to impose direct and
indirect taxes, but up to the War, when it
felt obliged to levy an income tax, it had
generally kep-t away from direct taxation. I
am quite sure that the provinces would be
more than willing to withdraw their request
for power to levy on retail sales if they were
granted exclusive rights to the field of income tax, but the Dominion has not felt disposed to surrender its right to that field.
It is felt that in helping the provinces to
raise taxes we are at the same time relieving
the federal treasury, because if the provinces
can balance their budgets they will be able to
borrow, in case of need, without a guarantee
from the Dominion Government.
At the time of Confederation the four
original provinces of the Dominion renounced
their right to customs and excise. I have
always felt that they received very little
in return. Of course, one is wiser after the
event. In exchange for this renunciation each
province was given a fixed amount-Ontario
$80,000, Quebec $70.000, Nova Scotia $60,000,
and New Brunswick $50,000-and 80 cents a
head of population, based on the census of
1861. Under that arrangement Quebec's share
came to $960.000. I mention Quebec alone,
but the share of the other provinces can be
easily ascertained. I recall that in 1880 I
dared to go on the platform and discuss provincial matters, including this very question
of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the federal
subsidy. My opinion as then stated was that
the Fathers of Confederation were not very
far-seeing when they thought that a province
like Quebec or Ontario could be administered
and have its laws applied at an annual cost
of less than $2,000,000. My memory is quite
clear that at the time I referred to the views
of Sir Hector Langevin and Sir A. T. Galt,
two of the Fathers of Confederation, to the
effect that the subsidy being granted would
be ample to pay the cost of administration of
the provinces. At least one of those gentlemen thought that $1,500,000 would be sufficient.
After Confederation the population of the
country increased steadily.
The federal
treasury derived from customs and excise a
revenue that grew larger every year, while
the provinces did not benefit at all from this
growth, because their subsidy was on a fixed
basis. The revision of 1907 increased the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

subsidy and based it upon the decennial census,
and since 1931 the annual subsidy to Quebec
has been $2,464,000.
The budget of that
province for the present year amounts to
$35,000,000.
The provinces were not slow in discovering
the kind of bargain they had made and
demanding better terms. In our times the
provincial governments, sometimes singly and
sometimes all together, have repeatedly asked
for larger subsidies. For a number of years
after 1867 the Dominion took the stand that
financial arrangements made at the time of
Confederation and embodied in the British
North America Act were final. As a matter
of fact, section 118 of that Act said se. Then,
before the War, the Dominion began to make
grants to varions provinces, and it bas continued to make them, it being stated as a
principle that the basis of settlement should
not be altered and that the grants should be

made according to population.
War was on, or perhaps before it started, the
House of Commons voted for roads a large
sum of money; I think, $10,000,000.
Hon. Mr. KING: Twenty millions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In this Chamber
we insisted on its being distributed according
to population, and we amended the Bill to
provide accordingly. I do not know whether
the Bill as amended was passed that session,
but the following session we received a Bill
embodying that principle. I realize, however,
that since the War, and more especially during
the last years of the crisis through which we
have been passing, all principles have been
scattered to the four winds. Grants have
been made in proportion, not to population,
but to the needs. In the last fiscal year the
Western Provinces borrowed from the Federal
Government, under various relief measures,
$32,000,000.
The total of their borrowings
from the Dominion since 1930 amounts to
$116,000,000.
This serious situation explains
and justifies the second part of the resolution.
If the Dominion is to guarantee provincial
obligations, it bas a vital interest in the
solvency of each and every province. - The
protection that the people of Canada would
receive under this clause would come from the
assurance of absolute security for moneys lent
to the provinces. There could be no surer
guarantee than that described in clause 4 of
the resolution.
Clause 2 provides:
The Parliament of Canada may authorize
the Government of Canada to guarantee the
payment of the principal, interest and sinking
fund of any securities (hereinafter called
"guaranteed securities") which any province of
Canada may from time to time make or issue,.

MAY 19, 1936
and, subject to the provisions of this Act may
prescribe the terms and conditions upon which
any guarantee so authorized shall be given, and
the provisions of this Act shall, in the event of
any such guarantee being given, apply and
have full force and effect notwithstanding anything contained in the British North America
Acts, 1867 to 1930, the British North America
Act, 1907, the Parliament of Canada Act, 1875,
the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889, the
Canadian Speaker (Appointment of Deputy)
Act, 1895, Session 2. or any Acts, orders, rules
and regulations passed or made thereunder or
pursuant thereto establishing a province or
admitting a colony or province into the Union
or affecting the constitutional relationship
between Canada and a province.
This is clause 3:
The Legislature of any province of Canada
may, with reference to the principal, interest
and sinking fund of securities which the province may from time to time make or issue,
authorize the Government of the said province
to enter into an arrangement with the Government of Canada whereby the Government of
Canada shall guarantee the payment of the
principal, interest and sinking fund of such
securities.
The important clause is No. 4:
(1) For the purpose of securing Canada
against loss resulting from the giving of a
guarantee under the authority of this Act, the
Government of Canada, whenever in its opinion
any default has occurred in respect of any
payment on account of principal, interest or
sinking fund of the guaranteed securities, may:
(a) withhold any payment to the province
on account of any grant payable by the Government of Canada to the province for its local
purposes or for the support of its government
and legislature or on account of interest in
respect of its public debt or in lieu of public
Jands or on any other account whatsoever;
(b) effect payment in whole or in part of
any such grant by payment direct to a creditor
of the province of any amount owing to such
creditor on account of the guaranteed securities.
In this and the next succeeding paragraph
"creditor" shall include a trustee of a sinking
fund;
(c) out of any revenue received or collected
by the Government of Canada or any department or officer thereof for or on behalf of the
province, make payment direct to a creditor
of the province of any amount owing to such
creditor on account of the guaranteed securities.
(2) The Legislature of any province may
charge the principal, interest or sinking fund
of the guaranteed securities on any revenue
of the province, upon terms that such revenue
shall, if the Government of Canada so requires,
he disbursed exclusively in payment of such
principal, interest or sinking fund and may, if
the Government of Canada so requires, provide
for the depositing of all funds from the revenue
so charged in a trust account in a bank or
banks for the purpose of implementing the said
charge.
Honourable members may ask: Why is this
atmendment needed?
The British North
America Act provides for payment of annual
subsidies to the provinces for the support of

313

their governments and legislatures. The law
officers of the Crown are of opinion that a
legislature cannot validly appropriate future
payments of subsidies, and thus deprive a
future government of its revenue.
Likewise, a special tax may be levied and applied
to the payment of interest on bonds and their
amortization, but it may be repealed at any
time thereafter.
Sections 111, 112, 114, 115 and 118 supply
the answer to the question, why this amendment is needed.
Section 111 reads:
Canada shall be liable for the debts and
liabilities of each province existing at the
Union.
This is section 112:
Ontario and Quebec conjointly shall e liahble
to Canada for the amount (if any) by which
the debt of the Province of Canada exceeds
at the Union sixty-two million five hundred
thousand dollars, and shall he charged with
interest at the rate of five per centum per
annum thereon.
Section 114 deals likewise with Nova Scotia:
Nova Scotia shall e liable to Canada for
the amount (if any) by which its public debt
exceeds at the Union eight milliod dollars, and
shall he charged with interest at the rate of
five per centum per annum thereon.
Section 115 deals with New Brunswick:
New Brunswick shall e liable to Canada for
the amount (if any) by which its public debt
exceeds at the Union seven million dollars,
and shall he charged with interest at the rate
of five per centum per annum thereon.
Section 118:
The following sums shal he paid yearly by
Canada to the several provinces for the support
of their governments and legislatures:
I have mentioned the amounts.
-and an annual grant in aid of each province
shall he made, equal to eighty cents per head
of the population as ascertained by the census
of One thousand eight hundred and sixty-one,
and in the case of Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census
until the population of each of those two provinces amounts to four hundred thousand Souls,
at which rate such grant shall thereafter
remain. Such grants shall be in full settlement of all future demands on Canada, and
shall he paid half-yearly in advance to each
province; but the Government of Canada shall
deduct from such grants, as against any province, all sums chargeable as interest on the
public debt of that province in excess of the
several amounts stipulated in this Act.
Honourable menibers willi notice that the Dominion Government retains the right to deduct
from such grants all sums chargeable as interest on the public debt of the provinces in
excess of the several ainounts stipulated in
the Act.

314

SENATE

There seems to be a consensus of opinion
among jurists that this limitation of the right
of the Dominion excludes its right to deduct
any sua for any other reason or cause. The
proposed legislation is introduced for the purpose of removing all doubt that the Dominion Government may retain from grants
to the provinces any amount due in default
of payment.
It bas been suggested that possibly the increased amounts which were agreed upon by
the legislation of 1907, when there was a revision upwards of the subsidies to the provinces, would not fall under the interpretation
of section 118. But the Act of 1907 reiterated
the proviso which I have read, and which
limits the right of the Dominion to retain
or deduct from the grant any amount that any
of the provinces might owe on some other
account.
Now, whatever may be the -opinion of legal
experts upon the interpretation of the law
officers of the Crown as to the right of the
Dominion to deduct from the grant anything
except the interest as mentioned in section
118, I believe it is good policy for the Dominion to be assured that when it does guarantee
provincial loans it shall have the undoubted
right to collect upon the grants made and due
to the provinces.
I may point out that the British Parliament took a similar course when it made an
advan-ce of £150,000 to the Government of
British Columbia under Chapter 52 of 55-56
Victoria. An arrangement had been made
between the British Government and the
Provincial Government with regard to the
settlement in British Columbia of families
from parishes in Scotland. The debentures of
the province were given to the treasury as
securities, and the advance was to be repaid
by instalments. Section 4 of the Act provides
against the possible action of the Legislature of
British Columbia in the future. It reads:
Every Act hereafter passed by the Legislature of the province of British Columbia
which in any way impairs the validity or
priority of the charge upon the revenues of
the province of the principal or interest of
any advance made or debenture deposited in
pursuance of tbis Act shall, so far as it impairs
such validity or priority, be void unless the
previous consent of the treasury bas been
obtained.
In this legislation we do not include any
such termas, but I feel that the safeguards
with which the Dominion Parliament would
surround future loans to provinces would be
welcomed, because our people have been considerably disturbed by the fact that the large
advances already made are without any assurance of repayment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I feel confident that the proposed legislation
will appeal to the judgment of his House.
Right
Hon.
ARTHUR
MEIGHEN:
Honourable members, the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
was good enough to place on Hansard before
this Address Lad reached us from the other
House a statement of its ternms, so we might
acquaint ourselves with the problemn which
would face us to-night. By reason of extraordinary preoccupation over the week-end, I
was not able to study this Address intently
until to-day. When the subject was broached
last Thursday I made no objection to its
being taken up now, and consequently I
would not think of offering opposition to its
immediate consideration, notwithstanding the
necessity of notice under our rules.
But, being impressed with a sense of the
unusual and far-reaching consequence of the
step we are now invited to take, I commence
by urging the leader of the Government not
to press unduly for the rapid disposition of
this subject to-night, to-morrow, or this week.
Even though we may be predisposed-and
certainly
honourable
gentlemen
opposite
would be strongly predisposed--to accept the
Government's view of the matter, and though
we on this side could offer no proper objection
to any measure designed to enable the provinces to carry on, provided it has no truly
dangerous features, I an confident that on
careful examination of the contents of this
Address to the Throne, honourable members
on either side will see that what is proposed
is something we should not do-something
which -in later days we might lament.
I (1o not think it is necessary to dwell on
the second feature of this Address. I am not
sure that I entirely follow arguments advanced
elsewhere. I believe, none the less, that the
Dominion of Canada has inherent in its
sovereign power the right to pledge its
guarantee where it may desire; that no special
statute has to be passed to enable this to be
done. And I know, of course, as we all know,
that year after year we have given guarantees
to corporations here and corporations there,
and even to provinces, without our right to
do so having ever been called in question.
Nor do I think the provinces need any
particular sanction of the natural right,
inherent and implicit in their sovereignty, to
pledge their assets for their debts where and
as they desire, whether those assets be subsidies in hand, or subsidies to come, or whatever their nature may be.
But this is only my view. I realize that in
matters of law a Government must follow the
advice of its law officers, and I understand

this legislature and that, in this conference
and ýthat, until finally concurrence was reached.
Now, in respect of a proposal that goes to the
revocation of that concurrence, that goes to
the ehattering of the whole framework which
was constructed, surely we ought to submit to
the Throne something more than a mere statement that it is desired by the Senate and the
House of Conmons of Canada.

That would be

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is this not
vital? Does my honourable friend suggest
it is not? It reaches to the very life-blood
of Confederation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I draw attention to the statement which I made, and
which I repeat, that we are taking nothing
away from the provinces, but, on the contrary, are granting them a larger jurisdiction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman will see before I am through
that we are taking away something that is
very essential to all the provinces. I would
ask the honourable gentleman to bide in
patience until I get through to the matter
he is raising. I am now at the point of
what should be the prerequisite of such an
Address. This is not one which is more or
less a matter of form, in respect of which
the interests of ail are mutual. We should
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

therefore base our demand on a recited narrative that all parties have concurred in
appropriate form, and we should be in a
position to demonstrate the truth of our
recital at the foot of the Throne.
The precedent we are establishing is that
no matter how crucial the matter may be, all
we have to do is to send an Address from
the Senate and House of Commons. Will
the honourable gentleman concur that such
should be a precedent? Let him think of
something touching which he is far more
sensitive than he is to a division of funds;
say a question of minority rights. Does he
think the Imperial Parliament should act
in such a matter on a mere resolution of the
Senate and House of Commons? Has not
his Government in weeks gone by been
struggling in conference with the provinces
to reach some basis of concurrence among
the contracting parties which would enable
them to act themselves to procure through
this Parliament a remedy of grievances of a
constitutional character under which they
feel they have been suffering? There were
discussed resolutions by this legislature and
by that; by ail-or by ail but one; but the
Government has not been able to get the
concurrence of provinces, which are sensitive
with respect to their rights, even though
they are ail of one political faith. Does he
say that in any future case the only thing
that will be necessary, under our Constitution as it now stands, will be an Address
from the Senate and House of Commons?
I do not think minority rights would be very
secure if that were established as a precedent.
Now I come to the essence of the resolution
itself. What is proposed to be done by this
amendment? The honourable gentleman has
emphasized that the provinces reluctantly
gave up their rights to customs and excise
revenues at the time of Confederation. No
doubt they were reluctant, and no doubt they
sought in as equitable a manner as possible
to get an adequate quid pro quo. But honour.
able members
undoubtedly
realize that
there never could have been a Dominion of
Canada unless the power to tax by customs
and excise was taken from the provinces and
reposed in the Dominion. That is the essence
of Confederation.
That power of indirect
taxation, with the effect it produces, is the
very substance, the corner-stone of Confederation. Around it, and on the question and
method of adjustment, the Fathers of Confederation battled for years. The power of
indirect taxation had to be taken from the
provinces; otherwise they could secure by
methods of indirect taxation the same effect
as if they were able to impose customs and

MAY 19, 1936
excise taxes. This right of the provinces had
to be surrendered and they had to agree to
take something else in its place. What they
agreed to take was first the plenary right of
direct taxation. But they said: "Direct taxation will not be enough. You will have to pay
us something more in return for the surrendered control over customs and excise." It was
objected that the handing over to one government for expenditure by it of moneys collected
in taxes by another government was w'rong
in principle, and there was force in that
objection. But in effect the objection had to
be abandoned and the Government of Canada
had finally to agree to give the provinces
subsidies on a certain scale. Those subsidies
may or m'ay not have been adequate. Subsequent events would make it appear that they
were not, and they have been added to
vicariously and unevenly ever since. At any
rate, all this had to be done in order that
indirect taxation should be surrendered by
the provinces.
Now it is proposed, rather lightly and
casually, ta restore to the provinces the power
of indirect taxation. Surely it behooves us to
examine with the utmost care just what this
would mean to the structure of Confederation.
What does it mean? I do not dispute the
validity of my honourable friend's definition
of indirect taxation and the distinction he
draws between it and direct taxation. The
Privy Council, in various cases that have
gone before it, has adopited pretty fully the
definition of John Stuart Mill, that the
essence of an indirect tax is that it is such
as may be passed on from him who pays, to
another; that it is a tax on the goods or
transaction rather than on the person. But
the power of immediately passing on is the
test which determines whether the tax is
direct or indirect. In a British Columbia case
an oil tax which had to be paid by the seller
on the transaction was held to be indirect and
therefore ultra vires of the province. But
when the province taxed the purchaser, the
consumer of the goods in personam, that was
held to be direct and intra vires. Unless one
is careful to see the significance of everything that is done, one is likely to consider this
a very fine distinction. It might be said that
if we allow the provinces to tax the consumer
we may as well allow them to tax the seller,
to tax the transaction itself. If honourable
members will follow me, I think they will
agree there is a very clear distinction. When
you tax the consumer you are taxing the
people in the province, and taxing them
without discrimination, but when you tax
the transaction and thus interfere with processes of trade, you can tax the outsider and
exempt the people of the province. That is

precisely what I venture to say is going to be
donc, and before I finish I shall produce evidence which I think will convince anyone
that I am right. And as soon as it is done
we shall have in effect tariffs between our
provinces.
Honourable members do not want tariffs
between our provinces. We on this side-as
indeed members on that-feel that as a nation
we need tariffs; that they are essential to our
growth. But we have ail considered that
Canada is .one united family, that the growth
of every extremity is the concern of all, and
that trade and commerce is national, not in
any sense provincial. We have all of us felt
that nothing direct or indirect must be
allowed to detract from the unity of this
Dominion as a trade and commerce entity.
There must be a free trade sweep from one
end of our Canada to the other. I venture
now to say I can convince any honourable
member opposite that such unity and such
free area for trade cannot exist if this Address
to the Throne is passed and is responded to
by -the Imperial Parliament. It would then
be within the power of the legislature of any
province in this Dominion to pass laws
affecting the selling rights of any citizen of
Canada outside the borders of that province,
to tax those selling rights by taxing transactions of sale, and to exempt from such
taxation anyone within the province. Does
any honourable member suggest such a thing
could not be done? It could be done immediately this amendment was passed. And does
anyone want to have it done?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will the right
honourable gentleman illustrate his point?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will illustrate it in a very forceful way. Will honourable members be surprised when I tell, them
it has been done already? One province has
passed a Bill which will be validated if the
Imperial Parliament enacts the requested
amendment, and which to-day is undoubtedly
invalid. That Bill is in effect a tariff around
the province that passed it. In my hand I
hold a statute which has been in force less
than one month--that is, assuming it to be
intra vires. It was passed by the province of
New Brunswick on the 24th of April of this
year, and is entitled: "Chapter 12. An Act
to amend Chapter 16 of the Revised Statutes
1927, The Corpo.rations Tax Act." I will read
a couple of sections. Section 7 provides:
The said Chapter.that is, the Corporations Tax Act-is further amended by enacting a new section
to be Section 10A thereof and to be inserted
after Section 10, as follows:-

318

SENATE

10A. (1) Every company or corporation, the
majority of whose stock issued and outstanding
is owned or held, either directly or indirectly,
by companies , corporations, or persuns incorporated or resident without the province, having an established place or places of business
within the province, and every partnersbip,
firm, association or person carrying on an
establisbed business witbin the province as a
brancb or part of or in connection with an
established business carried on witbout the
province and engaging in the sale of goods,
chattels, wares or merchandise within the
province direct to the consumer, shaîl pay a
tax upon the amount of its or bis gross sales
by retail of goods, chattels, wares or mercbandise to be delivered within the province.
That is a tax on -sales, a tax which the
Privy Council declared invalid in the British
Columbia case, but which will be peirfectly
legitimate and within the power of the province to impose if this requested amendment is
pa.ssed by the Imperial Parliamen.t.
The
proviso is even more significant than the law
itself.
lion. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Will the
right honourable gentleman excuse me? Are
these gonds delivered in the province to be
taxed?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Goeds brought
into the province and sold within the province
by any citizen of Canada other than a resident
of New Brunswick.
Here is the proviso:
Provided that this sub-section shiaîl fot

-or of manufacturing or botb.
Now, is the significance clear? If goods
are manufac.tured within the province the tax
does not apply; if they are manufactured
uutside the province the tax does apply. Dues
anyone want any better pruof of what I have
been saying than that? And unless honourable memiiers opposite are intuitive and even
insensate protýectionists they surely do not
desire nine separate tariffs within the Dominion
of Canada!
Are honourable members; still
convinced that trade and commerce is an
element of jurisdiction whichi should be
federal? Well, pass this resolution and trade
and commerce will be gene beyond federal
jurisdiction; the Dominion Parliament will
nu longer have control in that sphere. Instead of a united Dominion of Canada we
shall have nine more or less helpless provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

This Address shouki be entitled, "An Address
te provide for the inevitable dissolution of
Confe-deration."
Hon. Mr. ARTHURS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEýIGHEN: I have read
everything thiat was said about the reslution.
in another place, and I do not think that
the Gevernment of the dey realizes the
significance of its proposed amendment. If
this 'step is taken there will be nu way whatever of preventing provinces frem doing precisely what bias al.ready been dune by the
province of New Brunswick. And if 2 per
cent can be impeosed under suoh legisiation,
10 per cent or 20 per cent can be impesed;
tariffs whose height-is limited enly by the
ambition of the rea9pective provinces may be
erected. When this is d'une the essence of
Confederation, the" hracings and beltings of
its structure, will bave disappeared. Yet that
is the very thing this Address te the Throne
proposes to legalize, and te legalize retroactively.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: While the right
honourable gentleman is on that point, would
he read tw.e lines of the resolution and explain
them? The resolution refers te indirect taxation "other than of ahi goods and articles for
delivery without the province."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIENL: This is just
the samne as we do federally new. While the
Dominion imposes tariffs, iL exempts imports
wliceh go into production for expert. This
merehy provides that provinces, whihe they
can ýtax within their boundaries, cari exempt
goeds sent eut of the province. That dees
net affect the essential character of tlîc legislation itself. It is an exception te help people
within the province te seli te -peeple in other
provinces, but it ducs net prevent the province from raising barriers te prohibit outside
peuple from deing business in the province.
If this reselution is passed and acceded te,
there wili be nu way of escape from nine tariff
walls in Canada. The Government proposes
te surrender the first and most sacred citadel
of Confedieration. It cannot avoid that surrender if it insists upen the passing of the
resolution in its present f.erm. I invite the
ingenuity of any lawyer, of any thinking
man of vhatever training, to sugge-st how, if
this resolution is acceded te, it would ibe possible te attack legisiatien such as the province of New Brunswick bas passed, and whicb
is in character net very dissimilar from soe
that bas been passed by Alberta as wcll.
The honourable senator opposite says, "We
are enlarging the poweýrs of the provinces."

MAY 19, 1936
Yes, we are. We are putting into the hands
of each province a sharp sword to smite every
other province. If to do so is the conduct of
statesmen, I do not so understand our function. Where will Nova Scotia be if Quebec
passes retaliatory legislation such as New
Brunswick has passed? Where will Nova
Scotia find a market for its coal, for example?
And where will the immense industries of
Quebec find their market if New Brunswick
to-day, Nova Scotia to-morrow, then Alberta,
then Manitoba, and the rest of the provinces,
pass laws imposing taxes on the sale of Quebec goods within their respective domeins?
While a province applies taxation directly
upon consumers it spreads these taxes over
its citizens and is unable to legislate to the
prejudice of citizens of any other province.
But to give provinces power of indirect taxation on retail sales will be enabling them to
destroy what Confederation was intended to
build up. The long result of this resolution
will be to undo the work of the Fathers
of Confederation.
The honourable gentleman says: "What
are we going to do? Our provinces are in
debt and need money. They already receive
big subsidies, and we should like them, if
possible, to fend for themselves." He goes
on to say that the provinces have a ground
of complaint against the Dominion in that
the Dominion has invaded the field of direct
taxation. I well recal when this Federal
Parliament went into that field. Warning
was given at the time that some day we
might regret the step, because it was a field
not, it is true, reserved to the provinces,
but a field in which they could roam at
will and legislate as they liked. Our invasion
of it restricted their rights. I realize that
no solution is very attractive. It is hard
enough to give subsidies we are now giving,
but would not an increase in subsidies be far
better than what is proposed here? If we
want to keep on occupying all the fields
which we are now in, let us do so, but let
us see that provinces are given equitable
subsidies on the basis of population, perhaps
moderated or altered in certain degree,
according to disabilities in each case and not
according to extravagance. If we do not
want to do that, would it not be better
to retire altogether from the field of income
taxation and leave it to the provinces?
Then if it should be necessary-and it would
be-to increase indirect taxes, let us do so
and place the proceeds in the federal treasury.
In that way we should not be striking a
blow to divide the different sections of our
country. If we strike this blow the time
will not be long before we shall feel the

pains of severance. We can collect just
as much as the provinces by indirect tax
on retail sales. It is going to hurt just as
much if collected by them as if collected
by us, but collected by us it is equitable and
fair and there is no discrimination between
citizens of our various provinces; there is
no competitive rivalry, no competitive
destruction among our provinces. Let us
retire, perhaps not wholly, but in large
measure, from the field of income tax, and
let the provinces occupy the part from which
we retreat. But let us not encourage them
to establish a succession of competitive taxation levies, each one assessing the other, and
thus drive a wedge between various sections
of our Dominion.
I appeal to the honourable leader of the
Government to submit these considerations
to his colleagues. We do not approach this
subject, certainly I do not, in a feeling of
criticism or hostility towards the Administration. I do not suppose there is a more
harassed or harder worked man in this Dominion than the Minister of Finance at this hour.
I have read his address in the Commons. I
know from what he is trying to escape. I
believe he is acting in good faith in doing so.
But from the mire and the undýrbrush into
which, by this proposal, he is about to plunge
he will find extrication vastly more difficult
than from any of the difficulties with which
he is surrounded now. Those other methods,
some of them already tried, none of them
attractive, are vastly better than this. It is
a hard thing to find money to help our provinces through difficulties into which they have
got themselves. Some of them have been
unfortunate through visitations of nature.
Those we are glad to assist to the utmost of
our power. Others, and there are several of
them, are in their present position largely,
though not wholly, because of extravagance.
However, they are at our doors and we cannot
turn them coldly away. But let us meet them
in a sane and sensible manner. We do not
make it any harder for our people when we,
instead of our provinces, put taxes on retail
sales, if the measure of incidence is the
same; but we escape from difficulties into
which we are flying by the method proposed
by the Administration.
Now, I have made these observations in the
hope that there will not be an attempt to put
upon the Senate the onus of defeating this
measure. I should like to have it discussed
by all the people. I have had telegrams even
to-day from large bodies-not from individual
concerns, but from bodies representing industry
and commerce throughout the Dominionprotesting in the most emphatic terms. I do

320

SENATE

not think the true meaning of this proposed
legislation bas yet dawned upon those who
would be affected by it. Let us hear from
those people, let us see definitely and clearly
the course we are taking, and if it is dangerous,
if it is backward, if it is fraught at leat with
some of the perils I have tried te disclose,
then let us find another way.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, the
resolution now before the Senate is one of
extreme importance. It is important because
it represents an attempt by Parliament to
alter our Constitution, and this House should
always scrutinize very thoroughly all measures
to amend the British North America Act.
Two features of this resolution challenge
our attention: first, the method now used. to
amend the Constitution; and, secondly, the
merits and nature of the amendments.
Since the Balfour declaration regarding the
status of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, a declaration recited in the
Statute of Westminster, and since the enactment of that statute, which provides by
section 4 that:
No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom
passed after the eomnmenceient of this Act
shall exten<t or be deeme<i to extend, te a
Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion,
unless it is expressly decliared in that Act that
that Dominion has requested and consented to
the enactment thereof-it lias been argued by a number of professors. and by politicians as well, that this
Parliament bas alone the right to petition
Westminster and to obtain amendments to
our Constitution; that concurrence of the
provinces is not essential.
With that contention I definitely take issue.
It may be that vis-à-vis the Parliament of the
United Kingdom we have that right. But for
the present I neither admit nor refute the
proposition; it can be discussed on sone
other occasion.
It may also b a mot point whether or
not, as of right, even in view of our status
of equality, we may require the Mother
Parliament to use its machinery to sanction
a turpitude or an act on our part involving
a violation of rights which she herself lias
alwavs regarded as sacred. This I do not
discuss. But I do say that vis-à-vis the
Canadian provinces and certain classes of
the Canadian people, this Parliament's right
to demand amendments is restricted by the
necessity of obtaining the consent and
a.pproval of the provinces. Of course, when
I say "righit" I do not mean the capacity
of perfonming without fear of sanctions an
act which is against public or national
morality. I mean a power exereised within
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the bounds of moral and constitlutional
rights, written and unwritten.
I do not say, as has been so often stated,
that the British North America Act is a
contract or a treaty between the provinces.
Taken literally, these terms are too easy of
refutation by those who want a free hand to
change our Constitution without the consent
of the provinces. But I do affirm that though
an Imperial statute, the British North America
Act nwas based on an entente or compromise
among the provinces and the majority and
minority of the Canadian people, that our
Constitution partakes of that entente or
compromise, and that none of the powers
conferred on the provinces as such, and none
of the privileges conferred upon minorities,
can be taken away, either by denying those
rights or privileges or by changing the Constitution, without violating a moral or constitutional right, uniess, of course, it be with
the approval of the parties interested.
To affirm the contrary would be tantamount
te asserting that when the original provinces
of Confederation and later the other provinces joined Confederation they abandoned
to the central goverment not only those
powers which are enumerated in the Act, but
also the ultimate power to abolish the very
existence of the provinces as political entities.
That proposition is untenable.
The fact is that the provinces have a moral
and constitutional right to the integrity of
their own territory, to their self-government
as defined in the British North America
Act, and their racial minorities have guaranteed privileges which this Parliament has
no right to destroy or diminish. Therefore
amendments te the Constitution which involve, or may involve, the status of a province in relation te Canada or in relation to
its own people should not be passed or authorized hv this Parliament without the consent of all the provinces.
This is not a new proposition and in support of it there is a very recent precedent.
That precedent is based on what took place
prior to the passing of the Statute of Westminster. Honourable senators will remember
that at the special Imperial Conference on
the operation of Dominion legislation and
Merchant Shipping legislation, held in London in the fall of 1929, iti was resolved by the
representatives of the various Dominions and
of the Mother Country to obtain the passing
of an Imperial Act. This became the Statute
of Westminster. The draft of the statute was
settled, and during the discussion it became
necessary to deal with the question of the
effect of the proposed statute on the rights
of Canada and of the other Dominions to

MAY 19, 1936
amend their Constitution. It was suggested
that a section be included to provide:
That nothing in the Act shall be deemed to
confer any power to repeal or alter the Constitution Act of Canada, Australia and New
Zealand otherwise than in accordance with the
law and constitutional usage and practice theretofore existing.
It will be seen that if this section had become law, future amendments to our Constitution would have been made in accordance
with law and constitutional usage and practice
heretofore existing.
As a member of the Legislature of Ontario, in the winter of 1931, I commented
upon that situation, and perhaps I may be
allowed to quote in part what I then said:
Now, as far as Canada is concerned, there
is no statutory law providing for the amendments to the Constitution. So far as the constitutional usage and practice existing heretofore is concerned, I am afraid that the
weight of precedents would constitute a practice
inconsistent with the rights of the provinces as
partners in the Canadian Confederation. As
honourable gentlemen know, with a few exceptions, the Federal Parliament has on many
occasions petitioned the Imperial Parliament
for and has obtained amendments to the
B.N.A.. Act without any reference to the
wishes of the provinces.
As my ,right honourable leader (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) said to-night, and very properly
so, those amendments did not go to the root
of the pact or to the division of powers between
the provinces and the Dominion, or to any
matter of any great importance, but nevertheless a practice grew up which, had the
Statute of Westminster as originally drafted
been adopted, might have been construed as
binding on Canada.
I continue the quotation:
It is obvious that if the proposed sections
deding with the matter of constitutional
amendment had been allowed to pass the
Imperial House, a situation wholly contrary to
the rights of the province would have been
created.
Fortunately, the resolution of the
1929 conference had to be submitted to the
plenary Imperial Conference of 1930.
The
Government of this province, to its everlasting
credit, on the eve of that conference decided
to protest to the Prime Minister of Canada
against the passing of a statute which would
crystallize into law a mode of procedure for
amending our Constitution which did not take
into account the consent of the provinces and
the rights of the parties to the original compact.
Our representations were taken into
consideration, and last fall when the matter
came up before the Committee on InterImperial Relations, presided over by Lord
Sankey, the Solicitor General of Canada (Hon.
Maurice Dupré) submitted to the committee
our representations, with the statement that
Canada was not prepared, under the circumstances, to give its final assent to the law until
the provinces of Canada had been consulted.
As a result, the objectionable clause which I

321

have mentioned was deleted from the draft of
the proposed statute, and it was agreed that
Canada's adherence to the Act would stand in
abeyance and that a section dealing exclusively
with the Canadian position would be inserted
after the representations of the provinces had
received consideration.
Personally, I hope that whatever conclusion
the provincial conference may reach, the old
section will lie replaced by another section
vhich will provide adequate guarantees for
the preservation of provincial rights, of the
rights of minorities. and the maintenance of
those essential provisions which are embodied
in the Confederation pact.
I know that it is not the wish of this province to retard progress and to interfere with
development necessary to the welfare and
happiness of the people of this country, and
I commend this Government in the attitude
which it has taken regarding these mattersthe only attitude in conformity with the dignity
of our status as a province and with the desire
that I think we all have to allow nothing to
disturb the operation of our Constitution or
inject apprehension into the minds of Canadian
citizens as to its harmonious functioning in
relation to their most sacred rights.
Honourable senators, no doubt, know that
before Canada formally adhered to the Statute
of Westminster .the provinces were consulted
and the objectionable clause to which I referred was amended. It is now section 8 of
the Statute of Westminster and reads as
follows:
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to
confer any power to repeal or alter the Constitution or the Constitution Act of the
Commonwealth of Australia or the Constitution
Act of the Dominion of New Zealand otherwise
than in accordance with the law existing before
the commencement of this Act.
The new section makes no reference to Canada
as to its right to amend its Constitution, and
I submit to this House that the precedent
established by the formal procedure which was
followed prior to the passing of that Act was
based on a recognition of the rights of the
provinces to consent or dissent, and is one
from which this Parliament should not now
or on any other occasion depart.
The next question which arises is whether
the proposed changes to the constitution of
the provinces are such as require, in the light
of the principle which I have outlined, the
consent of the provinces. My humble opinion
is that undoubtedly they are. Whether the
changes operate restrictions or extensions of
powers does not alter the principle. The
provinces are entitled to their status quo, and
that status quo should not be altered without
their consent. Moreover, this Act does more
than confer powers on the provinces. If
its meaning was correctly stated in another
place, it will enable a legislature to assume
a state of inferiority as a self-governing body
by being allowed to restrict its own capacity
with regard to the repeal of its own legisla-

tion. No legislature can bind its sovereignty
in that way, but it may of course obligate
itself ex contractu or by treaty. I am not
saying that it may not be expedient to alter
the organic laws of the provinces, but I do
say that before we attempt to do so we
should obtain their consent through the expression of their legislatures. The resolution
under consideration affects the powers of those
legislatures.
I can think of amendments whieh are of
such importance that we should insist upon
a plebiscite being taken with regard to them.
After all, the principle of self-determination
is one we have no right to deny. Let us suppose that this Parliament decides to petition
the Throne to amend the Constitution with
a view to merging the three Maritime Provinces into one. Surely we would not take the
risk of accepting even resolutions of the legislatures then in session as sufficient authority
to abolish the territorial and corporate integrity of those three provinces. I think we
would say that the people of those provinces
had the right of self-determination, and that
a plebiscite should be taken before we would
petition the Mother Country.
I submit that for the purpose now suggested
we should obtain an expression of opinion
from all the provinces, because the amendment proposed would affect the rights and
powers of the legislatures. Therefore, honourable members, unless such a consent-that is,
a consent expressed by resolution of the legislatures of each of our provincesis exhibited
to this House, I shall vote against this resolution. More important than haste and
expediency are the national honour and the
full recognition of our covenants and constitutional obligations.
May I say a few words about the merits
and the nature of the proposed amendment?
The honourable the leader of the Government has dealt with it in two parts, the first
relating to taxation and the second to the
gua.rantee by the Dominion Government of
provincial loans.
The effect of paragraplh 1 of section 1 of
the proposed amendment is to empower a
legislature to impose a tax on retail sales
within a province, in the same way that we
impose a tax on wholesale sales within the
Dominion. The tax may be on the same
goods, with certain exceptions mentioned in
the amendment.
This, I submit, simply
means an extension of the evils of duplication of taxation, something which should be
curbed rather than encouraged.
I am not
going to repeat the argument so clearly and
forcibly expressed by my right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), which
Hon. Mr. COTE.

argument I fully concur in; but I will add
that surely this is not what we were expecting when we were told that the provinces
had got together in a conference to study
the duplication and re-alignment of the taxing
powers of the Dominion and the provincial
legislatures. The problemn is one which the
harassed taxpayer would like to have solved.
I admit the solution is not an easy one. It
challenges the common sense and business
acumen of business men and of legislatures.
But surely this sort of thing, which would
render the problem more baffling and more
difficult, is not a step in the right direction.
It is a retrograde step which will only add
Then why
to our common difficulties.
nibble at the problem and proceed in the
wrong direction?
As to the second part of the amendment,
it is admitted by the Minister of Justice
that sections 2 and 3 of the proposed Act
are but a restatement of the existing powers
of the Dominion and of the provinces, and
appear only in order to lay a foundation for
section 4. It is argued that section 4 is
needed to make sure that a legislature may
appropriate the subsidies payable to a province under section 118 of the British North
America Act, not only for the current year,
but also for future years, and to prevent a
legislature from repealing in the future the
very laws which appropriate the revenue the
,province has pledged as security for the
Dominion guarantee.
With regard to the first contention, I cannot admit that a province, to which a subsidy is payable as such, cannot by an Act of
its legislature assign, transfer or appropriate
that subsidy to the Dominion by contract or
treaty. The negation of that right is the
negation of the sovereignty of the province
when it is acting within the scope of its
powers as a province. However, I do not
want to substitute my opinion for that of
the officers of 'the Crown, and if they say
there is a doubt, I see no objection to that
doubt being removed.
With regard to the second contention,
namely, that legislation is required to prevent
a legislature from repealing its appropriating
law, and that its contract is not sufficient to
prevent it, I readily agree. If a province
broke its contract in this respect the Dominion would have no direct or effectual remedy.
But even with a limitation on the power of
the legislature to ýrepeal its appropriating Act
the Dominion would be without an effectual
remedy, because the province would still
possess the power to repeal its taxation law.
I would point out to the honourable the
lcader of the House that even what is pro-

MAY 19, 1936
posed would not prevent the province from
repealing its taxation law, the law which yields
the revenue. So you are no further ahead
with section 4 than you would be without it.
Still another step is required. You must prevent the legislature from repealing the taxation law, the revenue from which has been, by
another Act, appropriated to the protection
of the bond. If you cannot stay the hand of
the legislature and prevent it from repealing
its taxation law, the protection which the
Dominion Government is supposed to obtain
is futile.
Of course, I am not one of those who think
we should treat the provinces as we treat companies which borrow money. I do not know
that any guarantee a province can give by way
of the physical deposit of money means a
great deal. I think the real security a
Government obtains from a province or from
any other country with which it does business
is based on honour and fair dealing.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: That is what the
power companies thought.
Hon. Mr. COTE: However, if the Administration, with the consent of the legislatures
of the provinces, desires to amend the Constitution in that way, I should not have any
serious objection, though I doubt the wisdom
of such a course in dealing with a province,
which is a quasi sovereign state. If the Government wished to obtain what the leader
of the House referred to to-night as a complete guarantee-I do not think it would
get a complete guarantee, but it would be
such iphysical guarantee as it could obtainit might be advisable to add a section stipulating that no Act which the province might
hereafter pass should impair the validity or
priority of the guarantee unless such Act were
passed with the consent of the Dominiou of
Canada. Such a section would be somewhat
similar to the one read by the leader of the
House to-night from the Imperial statute with
respect to the loan to British Columbia. I
point out again that without such an express
enactment the amendment would not be sufficient to prevent a provincial legislature from
repealing its taxing laws.
There is another point I wish to make. As
I have stated, sections 2 and 3 are included
merely for the purpose of laying a foundation
for section 4. That has been mentioned
by the honourable leader of the House. But
if there is ever any legal question as to
the right of the Dominion to make loans,
past or future, to the provinces, the courts
wil not read our speeches as an aid to interpretation of the law and to finding out
why sections 2 and 3 were considered of
12745-21J

323

such importance as to be inserted as amendments to the Constitution. They will read
these sections in relation to the British
North America Acts from 1867 to date. Is
there not a possibility that the express
language in -the British North America Act
limiting the power to guarantee loans upon
certain conditions would be taken by the
courts as excluding the broader power to
loan? Should the draftsman not have guarded
against this doubt by inserting a fifth section,
to provide that nothing in this Act shall be
deemed to restrict the powers of the Dominion of Canada? As we are asked to legislate to remove doubt, I think we should be
very careful not to introduce any more
doubt into the Constitution.
My conclusions, briefly, are .these. Without
the consent of the provinces, formally ex,pressed by a resolution of their legislatures,
I am afraid that I cannot see my way clear
to support this resolution. If that consent
were obtained, I still could not bring myself
to support the taxation provision of the
resolution. I would, however, support the
second part, but I am suggesting that its
wording be amended so that the doubts I
have mentioned cannot be raised, and also
in order that better protection may be provided for the Dominion.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, as a layman I want to express two
or three thoughts in connection with the
resolution that we have before us. But before
doing so, may I ask the right honourable
leader on the other side if he would object
to giving us, in addition to the very interesting statements he has already made, his view
of a section of the British North America
Act that I am going to read? The right
honourable gentleman bas suggested that if
this resolution were passed the various provinces might possibly institute tariffs against
one another, and we might have nine tariffs
in effect across Canada. May I refer to
section 121 of the British North America
Act? The marginal heading is "'Canadian
manufactures, etc." It reads:
All articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from
and after the Union, be admitted free into
each of the other provinces.
Would the right honourable gentleman give
us his view as to how this resolution would
interfere with that specifie section of the
British North America Act?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Necessarily
it would not. That section would remain
intact and in full force. Because of thast
section, goods of one province could not be

passed 1ast session, and I have had to answer
that they are being considered as to whether
they are in line with provisions of the British
North Arnerica Act.
This resolution proposes to give the provines an opporturnity to -et sorne additional
money. I notice that section 92 of the British
North America Act reads:
In eachi province the Legisiature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming
wvithin the classes of subjects next he'reinafter
enumerated, that is to say:
And the second paragraph of that section
reads:
Direct taxation vvithin the province in order
to the raising of a revenue for provincial
purposes.
What more than that is involved in this first
portion of the resolution? I ask the question
as a layman, not as a Iawyer, for I know- a
gooci lawyer could present a convincing argument on either side of the question.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh,

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Yes, that is conceded, I arn sure. H1e would not be a good
lawyer if he could not do so. I arn talking
from the viewpoint of the average citizen,
and I say that eighty-five per cent of the
people of Canada are, in my humble judgrnent,
looking to us to cut out this bugaboo of
obstruction known as the British North
America Act. They are looking to us týo
undertake a real, concrete, definite way to
go somewhere and do somnething on behaîf
of those who are clamouring for certain
reforms which time and time again they have
been told cannot be made because of the
provisions of the British North America Act.

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Graham, the

THE LATE HON. SENATOR FORTIN
TRIBUTES TO RIS MEMORY

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators. when recently we heard that one of
our colleagues was dangerously iii we were
very much concerned, and ail ardently hoped
he would regain his health. I refer to the late
Senator Fortin, who represented De la
Durantaye. It was with deep sorrow that we
learned of his death.

Senator Fortin had sat in the buse of
Commons since 1930. H1e became a memnber
of this Chamber at the opening of the present
session. I think I saw him after he was sworn
in, but I doubt whether he was able to attend
any more of our sittings. Fate prematurely eut
short his termn in this Huse.
I had not the advantage of intimate association with hiîn, but I know that both for his
excellent personýal qualities and for his high
professional attainments hie was very much
este-emed in the constituency which chose him
to repiesent it in the othe4-r House. I have no
doubt that my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), from the advantage of
personal contact, will be better able to pay.
trihute to the fine character of our late
colleague.
I desire to express on behalf of honourable
members oui deep sympathy with his bereaved
family.
Right bon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: bonourable members, it is unfortunate indeed that
the respite we have had for some months
from casualties among our fellows in this
bouse should have been interrupted by the
death of Senator Fortin. I remember 'the
honourable gentleman as one of my colleagues
from the province of Quebec, not so numerous
as I should have liked them to be, but exceedîngly choîce. Particularly do I recaîl the
gallant battie he conducted in 1926, when,
with ail on his side in the province, he met
defeat.
That association, cherished though it is
by me, was practically ail my relationship
with Senator Fortin. H1e arrived in the bouse
of Commons during my absence from public
lite, took hjs part there, established himself
in his constituency as a man of weight with
the public, and at the close of the last Parliament was appointed to this assembly.
He was one of those numerous members"
of the medical profession who are chosen
members ot this Parliament or one of the
legieîstures because of their personal popularity and because of the services they render.
The only contact I had with him in this
House was to hear him regret that his health
was not such as to enable him to take the
part he desired among us. I realized that
he was suffering, and while it was not a
surprise, it was indeed a s9hock that atter so
very short a tenure of office he passed away.
bis death is especially sad because of the
large and splendid French Canadian family
he leaves to mourn his loss. One can understand their despair and dismay, and our
whole-hearted sympathy goes out to tihemn.
The House will be gratified to know that
the honourable senator trom Grandville (Hon,

SENATE

326

dir Thomas Chapais) desires to say a few
of the career of
words commemorative
Senator Fortin.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS -(Official
Translation): Honourable senators, once more
relentless and gloomy death has mowed among
us. When our colleague and friend, Dr. Emile
Fortin, seemed to be recovering, for a time
at least, from the dreadful illness which laid
him low at the beginning of the present
session, suddenly came the news that his noble
heart had ceased to .eat.
Both leaders of this House having justly
and eloquently praised bis memory, may I
be allowed, especially in the name of those
who had a more intimate knowledge of bis
career. to lay on bis open grave the expression of their mournful regret.
God had gifted our departed colleague with
the bighest attributes of mind and soul. After
a brilliant course of studies, his aptitudes and
inclinations led him to engage in the practice
af medicine. And for a long time, nearly thirty
ycars, in bis native city, Lévis, lie gave himself entirely to that noble calling, skilfully,
untiringly, and with an admirable sense of
professional devotedness. Soon, in every borne,
Dr. Fortin's nane was honoured, absolutely
trusted, and, better still, deeply loved. No
doubt ability, professional knowledge and what
I should call the "nedical gift," caused such
feeling-. But another and even more precious
gift, kindness, was perhaps the determining
factor of these feelings. Dr. Fortin was a
kindly man, and that tells all. May I be
permitted to quote here a great thought of
an illustrions man, whose name is not often
heard in parliamentary precincts? Bossuet,
eulogizing a hero, exclaimed: "When God
created man's heart and breast be implanted
in them first kindness, as evidence of the
kindly hand from wliich we come." Kindness, to a superior degree, was obvious in
Dr. Fortin; it was the very inspiration and
guide of bis life, and caused bis name to be
blessed in modest hores where straitened circunstances and distress prevail. As a crowning gift it surrounded hiim with a halo of
sympathy.
That was undoubtedly the main reason why
bis political friends induced him, against bis
own will, to enter the political and parliamentary field. Defeated in a first contest,
be was elected to the House of Commons at
the general election of 1930. To him it was
a sacrifice, and perhaps a fatal sacrifice. From
that day, ue might be tenpted to say, bis
kindness became a danger. Invested with a
popular inîandate, well lie would bave liked te

make it a means of attenuating all sufferings
and of providing relief for all distress. A
thankless and difficult task in these sombre
days. Our friend wore himself out at it.
Realizing bis inability to pursue the effort,
be conceived the idea, a perfectly legitimate
one, of passing into a quieter atmosphere
where bis vital power might recover. Such
a wish, a very natural one, and intensely
pursued, as we know, was realized. When
the present session opened, Dr. Fortin, having
taken the oath in presence of this Throne.
took his seat in the Canadian Senate. Joyful
day, a day of gratification and of intimate
satisfaction for our colleague, for bis family
and for bis friends! Alas! that day was to
be the first and last. That seat was to be
bis for a few moments only. Soon afterwards,
we heard that our colleague had to enter a
hospital, and, to-day, we bow at bis grave.
Mockery of hopes and frailty of human happiness!
There remains to his family and bis friends
but one consolation, yet the best. And it
must be to us also a comiforting lesson. A
firm and fervent Christian, Senator Fortin
took aeave of mortal honours to receive in
Heaven. the eternal abode, the reward of
lis noble life, the everlasting and immortal
reward.

in conversation he would often picture
sympathetically his children, and one felt
tihat his great concern was their present and
future welrfare.
Our departed colleague was also a firm and
true believer. Firmly rooted in him were the
religious principles that pass from generation
to generation in old Quebec. Those principles he practised in public as well as in
private life. Oh! truly, he could smile, and
smile to the end, for he was of those who
"have fought the good fight" and can await in
serene calmness "their just reward."
THE MARQUESS OF WILLINGDON
RECENTLY CONFERRED HONOUR

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Before the
Orders of the Day are called, may I be permitted, with the leave of the House, to inquire
if it would be fit and proper for the members
of the Senate to express their pleasure and
satisfaction at the fact that His Majesty has
been pleased to confer on the Earl of Willingdon a marquisate, the highest honour, next
to a dukedom, which can be granted.
When Lord Willingdon, after serving with
distinction as our Governor General, accepted
the position of Viceroy of India, be knew full
well that very great difficulties would beset
him in that high office by reason of "la situation tendue," or in plain English, the
strained relations between the Mother Country
and certain agitators in a large part of India.
He went there with his eyes open. Before
coming to us he had performed many, many
years of Imperial service in most responsible
positions in the Indian Empire.
He had
thoroughly studied the mentality of the Indian
people and understood them. His reign in
India was a peaceful and, successful one, notwithstanding the fully justified fears of the
real lovers of the Empire.
When be left India at the end of his term
the names of the most active agitators were
seldom even mentionSed in that country, as
be had wisely decided, ndt to enter into any
discussion with them until they had renounced their seditious campaign.
Six years ago, after a dinner in Montreal
at which I had been seated next to him, I
asked Lord Willingdon if I might be permitted to inquire what be thought of the
political situation in India. I added that for
seven years I had received monthly letters
from a Royal Engineer who had served during those years in many parts of India, and
the burden of these letters was that it was
useless to discuss policy with a Hindoo,
as be regarded this as a sign of weakness;

furthermore, that if the Hindoo had; the power
there would be no discussion. Lord Willingdon listened with great interest. I have no
authority to repeat what he said, but I am
convinced that my informant was probably
right.
His Majesty's Governrment has now named
Lord Willingdon the Warden of the Cinque
Ports. The position was formerly occupied by
another viceroy. This most distinguished post
carries with it comfortable emoluments, wbich
should not be amiss to one who has been
Governor General of Canada and Viceroy of
India, for, without a very long purse, these
positions give a great deal of material worry.
May I suggest that the Senate might give
some attention to this matter? The Marquess of Willingdon was one of the most
diplomatie governors Canada ever had. I
say that of my own knowledge, for I have
known all our Governors General personally,
from Lord Dufferin to the present distinguished
incumbent.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: In response
to the inquiry of the honourable gentleman
may I say that it has always given me great
satisfaction to contemplate the period during which Lord Willingdon occupied the post
of Governor General of Canada. It was my
privilege and pleasure to meet Lord and
Lady Willingdon at Geneva before their
occupancy of Rideau Hall.
At that time
Lord Willingdon was representing India.
Since then our relations have always been
most cordial, and I have read of his preferment with great satisfaction. We all have
been pleased to learn of the success of his
viceroyalty in India. There had been considerable agitation in that vast country prior
te the time be assumed his bigh office, but
be may take pride in the fact that the term
of years during which
be
served was
singularly distinguished by peace and apparent goodwill towards the Viceroy throughout
the whole of the Indian Empire. I am very
glad to know that his services have been se
highly recognized by the Crown.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, there may be a question as
to the appropriateness of comments by the
Senate, whether favourable or not, upon the
conferring of royal faveurs, but there can be
no question of the pleasure that we all as
individuals received through reading of the
very high honour conferred upon the Marquess
of Willingdon. His term of office as Governor
General of Canada was a distinguished one,
wholly acceptable to our people, and it will
long be remembered with gratitude. It is a

NOVA SCOTIA COAL MINING INDUSTRY
INQUIRY

AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. C. E. TANNER rose in accordance
with the foilowing notice:
That he will eall attention to the coal mining
industry of Nova Scotia. and will inquire if
the Goveroment are favourably considering
measures that will enable the industry to
expand its mnarkets within Canada.
Be said: Honourable senators, I arn rising
to direct attention to the coal mining industry
of Nova Scotia and tn, inquire if the Government are favourably considering measures that
will enable the industry to expand its markets
within Canada. I realýize, as 1 arn sure al
other honourable members do, that these are
troublous times, and that the Governrnent
of the day are confronted with ptroblerns of
very great -moment, problerns which far
transcend any that we have ever before
had to deal with in this country. So I arn
addressing myseif to this subjeet to-day in a
spirit not in any way criticaýl of the present
Administration. I feel it is the duty of al
members to render ail the
honourable
assistance they can to the Governinent and
the country. That is the spirit in which I arn

329

making this inquiry, and I hope tbat suggestions which I have to, make rnay be of a
belpful character.
One of the greatest problems confronting
this country to-day, as we ail know, is unemployment. and I -think everybody is agreed
that it can never be solved by what we cali
temporary measures. Our governments have
been expending very large sums of money
on works designed to give employment, and
they purpose continuing that policy. A large
part of these moneys goes to pay for work that
is recog-nized to ho of a temporary character;
that is, work wbich wvill give employment for
a few înonths at most. I was glad to observe
tbat on a recent occasion when the ilonourable
the Minister of Labour was addressing a group
of business men in Toronto hoe stated that
the problem of unemployment could not be
solved by the construction of public works.
Perbaps he bas stated the same thing on more
than that one occasion wbich happened to
He referred to, the
corne to my notice.
United Sta!t.es, in wbich country it is acknowledged that un-empboyrnenit continues ini spite
of tbe expe nditure of tremendous sums of
money on public works. As the Minister

I arn tberefore encouraged in directing
attention to the Nova Scotia coal mining
industry, wbich, as some honourable members
may know. bas very important steel and car
manufacturing industries allied witb it. In
fact, the industries are practically one. May
I say at once that the coal mining industry
is entirely outside the field of public works.
In Nova Scotia coal mining is a permanent.
long-standing and continuing industry giving
employment to a large body of workers in
winter and summer alike. It is therefore an
industry wbich I tbink sbould engage the
attention of the Government and be given
every possible assistance and encouragement
towards its upbuilding and stability.
In this connection I would rernind the
House that in 1934 tbe Governent of Nova
Scotia appointed a royal commission to inquire into the general econornic condition
of tbe province. Tbe commission devoted a
considerable part of its time to the coal
and steel industries. I hold in my hand the
report which the commission made in the
same year. To a large extent it is based
upon a voluminous brief which was prosented on behaîf of the Government, and
whirh I now hýold in rny hand. I arn glad to
say that this brief was prepared by the
Bon. Mr. Rogers, who is now the Minister
of Labour in Mr. King's Cabinet. I shaîl
refer to these documents from tirne to time,

330

SENATE

because they will help me a great deal in
submitting this case to the Government represented by my honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr Dandurand).
I am sure, honourable members, that I
need not dwell at length upon the importance of the coal mining industry to Nova
Scotia. and I shall net detain the House
with lengthy quotations from the brief and
the report.
The whole situation may be
summed up by this statement in the documents, that not only does the prosperity of
the coal and steel industries of Nova Scotia
mean stability and success to the workmen
directly interested, but at least one-half of
the population of the province are affected,
directly or indirectly, by these twin industries.
I intend now to point out to honourable
members what the coal industry has been
and still is up against. In the calendar year
1935 the total output of coal from the mines
of Nova Scotia was 5.800,000 tons-a decrease
of 500.000 tons as compared with the output
for 193'4.
During 1935 Canada imported
3.500.000 tons of anthracite coal. 9,500,000 tons
of bintuinnous coal--the kind which is
produced in Nova Scotia-and 500,000 tons
of coke. So the product of mines of the
province had te come into direct and very
aggressive competition with this tremendous
quantitv of imported coal. Canada imports
coal from the United Kingdom, the United
States. and Germany, and, if an embargo had

A good deal of Nova Scotia coal is sold
locally and to consumers in the other Maritime provinces. A very small anount triekles
through to Newfoundland, and last year
there was a very small movement to the
United States. Apart from these negligible
exports, there is no possibillity of expanding
the sale of Nova Scotia coal except within
the confines of Canada.
At this point I would refer to the positive
statement which appears several times in the
report and the brief, that if it were not for
subventions and tariff protection the coal of
Nova Scotia would not get beyond the
borders of the Maritime Provinces.
That is the position. I have already stated
my first proposition, that the coal industry
is one in which half the people of Nova
Scotia iare vitally interested. My second proposition is that our only market is within
the Dominion; that there is no possibility of
dvdloping an e xport moveiment.
I ans
absolutely buttressed in this position by the
findings of the royal commission and by the
brief.
I intend now to deal with the tariffs and
subventions. I may say that I have in my
hand statements prepared for me and verified by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.
The first statement shows the tariff rates:

Russian coal-Embargo, February 28, 1931.
The subvention principle was initiated by
the Government of 1925, when the Boards of
Trade for Eastern Nova Scotia made very
strong representations on the subject. Certain assistance was given in the way of a
preferred freight rate, which continued until
1931. J do not intend to burden the House
by giving this statement in detail. but I
may be permitted to place it on Hansard.
Between 1930 and 1936 substantial increases
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

were made in those subventions. In 1928
only 113,000 tons of coal were moved to
Quebec and Ontario; in 1931, 400.000 tons;
in 1932, 703,000 tons; and in 1935, 1,534.838
tons. In this year our coal reached points
as far west as London. Centralia. Creighton
and Kapuskasing. As I have said, were it
not for the subventions and the tariff protection of 75 cents a ton on coal and $1 a ton
on coke, Nova Scotia coal would never have

MAY 20, 1936
found a market beyond the borders of the
Maritime Provinces. But as compared with
the output of 1934 there is a drop of 500,000
tons, and in movement the penetration into
Quebec and Ontario was 280,000 tons less in
1935 than in the preceding year.
I desire now to direct the attention of
honourable members to the present state of
the coal industry in Nova Scotia, and I must
refer again to the royal commission report
and the brief.
They both point out that although the
protective tariff and the subventions have
been of great value there bas been, nevertheless, and still is, a very deplorable want of
employment in the coal mining districts, and
that in order to provide employment an
expansion in the markets of the provinces of
Quebec and Ontario is absolutely necessary.
I shall read just one comment on that
point from the brief of Hon. Mr. Rogers. At
page 129 of the brief he points out on behalf
of the Government of Nova Scotia:
The experience of the past few years bas
proved nevertheless that the subventions have
rendered great assistance to the coal industry
of Nova Scotia during very critical periods of
its history. Even with the support of these
subventions there bas been a marked decline
of employment in the colliery areas of the
province, and the future of the industry would
appear to depend upon a continuance and
extension of the subventions granted to assist
the movement of Nova Scotia coal into the
markets of the central provinces.
On that aspect of the matter I would refer
also to what has been done by the Hon.
Minister of Mines, Mr. Dwyer. He is, I am
glad to say, making a personal canvass of
those markets at the present time.
Mr.
Dwyer, who is a practical miner, bas pointed
out in public addresses, as well as in the
Lgqilature, that the men who engage in the
mining business in Nova Scotia did not have
last year more than one-half the employment
they should have had. The fact is that if a
man in the coal mines of Nova Sootia got
two days' work a week he might be considered
a very lucky man.
One of the most important coal mining
projects in Pictou County-the Acadia Coal
Company, which produces a very fine quality
of coal-has been in the hands of liquidators
for about two years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is that?

What company

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Acadia Coal
Company. For nearly two years it bas been
in the hands of, and bas been carried on by,
the Eastern Trust Company and other
liquidators. They employ about 1,000 men.
Recently, while the Nova Scotia Legislature
was sitting, Mr. Dwyer was asked what was

to happen to that coal mine.

owned by the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal
Company, but, as my honourable friend
knows, it is now in the hands of the Dominion
corporation, which is the holding company of
the whole concern-coal, steel and car plants.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What royalty do they
pay?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: About 12 cents a ton.
The Hon. Mr. Dwyer bas also been making
the statement which I find in this report of
the royal commission, namely, that the coal
mining industry of Nova Scotia will meet
with disaster if it cannot find a market for at
least two million tons more than it is producing to-day.
As I said a moment ago, I am glad to see
the Hon. Mr. Dwyer making an active
personal canvass. He bas been in Ottawa
and several other Ontario cities, and probably
in Montreal, looking for markets. It is very
pleasing to know that just now there is a
strong feeling of goodwill towards the industry on the part of the people of Ontario
and Quebec. This is due largely, I suppose
to the recent catastrophe which oceurred in a
gold mine at Moose River, and to the
heroism displayed on that occasion by the
Nova Scotia coal miners who went to the
rescue of the unfortunate men who were entombed. But I want to point out that though
enthusiasm and goodwill do exist, and no
doubt will result in the coal industry being
able to extend its business somewhat in
Quebec and in Ontario, enthusiasm and good,will are very likely to recede as time goes on,
and we must have something more stable to
depend upon than sentimental affection.
I am not saying the Government should do
everything. I am glad to see Mr. Dwyer at
work. I am surprised that the management of
the companies which have coal to selll, and
are very anxious to dispose of it, are not
accompanying and backing up Mr. Dwyer in
his efforts. I think there should be cooperation between the Government and the
companies, and I am bound to say that I do
not think the companies are at present doing
their part in supporting Mr. Dwyer's vigorous
cam'paign for more business.

enormous quantities of eggs and other foodstuffs produced outside our own province.
Nova Scotia is also a good market for implements. furniture and wearing apparel. Great
firms like Eaton's and Simpson's have representatives in the province and make sales
there in large volume. And there is no better
class of consumers in Nova Scotia than the
mining population.
Miners have to live
well; their industry demands that they do
so.

So I want to repeat that the coal mining
industry is of vast importance, not only
locally, but from coast to coast. It creates
employment for men on railways and ships
in all parts of the country, for farmers of
Quebec, Ontario and the West, as well as
for factory workers in Quebec and Ontario.
I am urging the Government to do all it
possibly can to give assistance to this great
national industry which now finds itself in
an emergency.
My honourable friends opposite are probably not in faveur of increasing tariffs. But
these are days of emergencies. This national
and permanent industry must not be allowed
to go down. What should be donc? The
industry must be enabled to sell its coal
in the markets of Ontario and Quebec. If
that is not donc the industry will inevitably
go down, for it cannot sell its coal elsewhere. I submit that when such an important national industry is struggling with an
emergency, the Government should not
refuse or delay assistance. On the contrary,
the Government should see to it that the
stability and progress of the industry are
assured. That can be done by stopping or
at least reducing the flood of competing
coal that is now pouring into this country.
If it is necessary to raise the tariff, let the
tariff be raised. If it is necessary to increase subventions, let the subventions be
increased.
I am not saying that the companies themselves cannot do something to improve conditions, but, as is shown by the figures which
I have already given to the House, the basis
of the whole trouble can be attacked through
the tariff and the subventions. It was
demonstrated by the royal commission set
up by the Government of Nova Scotia
that the tariff and subventions have been the
salvation of the industry so far.

333

Honourable members, I have presented
without elaboration the facts which I should
like to have laid before the Government.
In conclusion I express the hope that the
Government will give them very serious consideration and come to the rescue of this
great industry at an early date.
With the permission of honourable members I will now place on Hansard the stateIments that I received from the Dominion
Fuel Board.

Summary of Assisted Coal
Movements from Nova Scotia, 1928-1936
The first effort on the part of Government to
extend the markets for Nova Sceotia coal by
direct aid occurred in September, 1924. when
money was voted to reduce the freight charges.
This Order in Couneil, P.C. 1537, was passed
September 3, 1924, and expired March 31, 1925.
The select committee of the House of Conmons studying fuel matters during 1926 recommended that the assistance be restored, this
opinion being supported by the Duncan Commission of the same year. Little was done,
however, although the Board of Railway Commissioners were instrueted, vide Order in
Couneil P.C. 226 of February 13, 1926, to
ascertain the costs of transportation of coal
mined in Eastern Canada and transported to
the province of Quebec.
With a view to aiding this inquiry the
Government made effective on March 30, 1928.
Order in Council P.C. 539, which established
a test movement of coal shipments of both
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick coal to the
province of Quebec. Two distinct forms of
assistance were authorized:
(a) Established a temporary rate of $3 per
net ton from Nova Sceotia and $2.10 from New
Brunswick on coal moving 'vholly by rail to
points in the province of Quebec during the
season of the year when navigation on the St.
Lawrence was not practicable.
(b) Extended the assistance to coal shipped
by water to St. Lawrence ports and then transhipped by the railways to inland points. The
assistance provided was a rate of one-fifth of
one cent per ton per mile, with a maximun,
amount of 75 cents per net ton; railway coal
being excluded.
This assistance was extended by Order in
Coucil P.C. 2256 of October 2, 1930, for an
additional one year as from March 31, 1931,
but it was rescinded on May 30, 1931.
Order in Couneil P.C. 1300 of May 30,
1931, became effective and, in general. maintained the previous assistance. All rail movements were definitely limited to the period
November 15-April 15 in eacli year.
The
assistance was changed from a set temporary
rate to one-seventh of one cent per ton, with
a maximum of $2 per ton. Coal moving by
water to St. Lawrence ports for furtherance
was assisted to a greater extent. Movements
into province of Quebec received the same,
i.e., one-fifth with a 75 cent maximum; to
Ontario, however, the assistance was increased
to one-third of one cent per ton, with a $1.50
maximum. Railway coal was ineluded for the
first time and tonnages in éxcess of the average
consumption of 1928-29-30 were bonused at the
same rate as industrial coal.

334

SENATE

Order in Council P.C. 1048 of May 9, 1932,
superseded P.C. 1300. It extended the assistance to include areas which might be reached
by means other than direct rail from mines
or river ports.
On all rail movements and water-borne coal
moved inland the assistance remained the same.
Movements by water west of Montreal and
moved inland from lake ports were authorized
at this time. Railway coal was assisted to the
extent of the difference in cost up to a maximum
amount of $2 per ton on the tonnage in excess
of that purchased in 1931.
During July, 1932, representations were made
to Government by Nova Sceotia coal operators
who were without water shipping facilities to
provide assistance on coal moved wholly by
rail from Nova Scotia to Ontario and Quebec
during the full year instead of the limited
period then in force. This was concurred in
and Order in Couneil P.C. 1676 of July 23,
1932, revised section 4 of P.C. 1048.
In November, 1932, the railways objected
to assistance applying only on that portion of
eoal they purchased over and above the 1931
tonnage and requested that same apply on all
coal.
Government concurred and Council
approved of recommendation P.C. 2563 of
November 22, 1932. In April, 1933, the railways contended that the $2 maximum was
insufficient to meet all competition and
requested $2.50.
This the Government also
concurred in; vide Order in Council P.C. 604
of April 4, 1933.
May 28, 1934, saw the next change, when
Order in Council P.C. 1119 superseded P.C.
1048. The present assistance is summarized
hereunder:
1. Movements by water to St. Lawrence
ports and transhipped inland to points in the

province of Quebec, assistance amounts to onefifth of one cent per ton per mile, with a
maximum of 75 cents per net ton.
2. When moved ex St. Lawrence ports to
points in the province of Ontario the assistance
amounts to one-third of one cent per ton per
mile, with a maximum of $1.50 per net ton.
3. When moved all rail from Nova Scotia
mines to points in the province of Quebec the
assistance amounts to the difference in amount
between
rer net ton coal and the laid-down cost of
eva Scotia
the cost of imported
coal which would otherwise be used, the maximum is $2 per ton and the differences are
calculated by the Dominion Fuel Board.
4. When moved all rail from Nova Scotia
mines to points in the province of Ontario the
assistance is one-seventh of one cent per ton
per mile, with a maximum of $2 per ton.
5. Nova Scotia coal moved by water transportation west . of the island of Montreal,
assistance is granted at the rate of $1 per ton,
but cannot exceed the amount of rail subvention
authorized in paragraphs one and two of this
memorandum.
6. Water-borne coal moving west of Kingston,
Ontario, and transhipped by railways to inland
points in the province of Ontario, assistance
is at the rate of one-third of one cent per ton
per mile, with a maximum of $1 per net ton.
7. Nova Seotia coal purchased by the railways for their own use in Ontario and Quebec,
assistance is the difference in amount per net
ton between Nova Scotia coal and the laiddown eost of imported coal which would otherwise be used. The maximum is $2 per net ton
and the differences are calculated by the
Dominion Fuel Board.

MAY 20, 19-36
Hon. THO-MAS CANTLEY: Honourable
senators, in view of the fact that I have been
connected with the coal ind-ustry of Nova
Scotia since I was sixteen years of age, or
over sixty years aga, it may perhaps be
thought that I have some familiarity with the
subject. But as I was flot aware that the
honourable senator frorn Pîctou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) intended t.o bring up his inq.uiry tod.ay, I arn in some respects flot so well prepared to, speak as I otherwise should have
been.
Sorne factors affecting the coal mining industry at present are almost inexplicable.
For instance, right now two cargoes of coal
are en route from Indo-China, almoet haif
way around the workl, and due to arrive at
Montreal in a few days. That coal was mined
in Inda-China, whe.re, I arn told, the daily
wage of coal miners is only from 20 ta 30
cents. How can we compete against coal
produced under such conditions? There is
only one of two things for us to do. We can
prohibit coal produced under such conditions
fram coming into Canada at ail, because of
the unfair wages being paid in the country
-)f production; or we can impose a duty high
cnough to make importation prohibitive.
Neither of these courses bas yet been ta-ken,
and so the coal is en route to the port of
Montreal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the
honourable gentleman pardon me? I did not catch
the name of the country where he said the
coal was produced.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Indo-China, across
the Pacific, alrnost halýf .way around the world.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the quantity
is small, cornpared with what is comning from
other countries.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Some 12,000 tons.
It is a beginning. More will corne later unlcss importation is stopped.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is my honoiirable f riend distinguishing between anthracite
and bituminous?
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: It is anthracite coal,
and competes with Nova Scotia coke.
Here is another factor that can be and
ought to be dealt with by the Government.
Some few years ago the then head of the
Canadian National Railways took over a
coal property in the United States and spent
more than $200,000 ini further develioping it.
Coal frorn that property is to-day being
brought into Canada on tenders of locomotives
,operating in this country. When the property was purchased it was said that the coal

335

would be used by locomotives operating on
that portion of tihe railway between Chicago
and the Ontario district. But the fact is that
when a locomotive reaches the boundary the
tender is fihlled up with coal frorn this krnerican eolliery. A run of several hundred miles
is then made into Ontario or the West. In
this way coneiderable quantities of United
States coal, mined by the Canadian National
Railways, are brought inta Canada withaut
being subjected ta any duty whatever. That
situation prod-uces another difficulty for our
industry.
Sorne ten years ago, in the House of Commons, I brought to the attention of the Governrent the unfair treatrnent to which we in
the Maritime Provinces were subjected sa far
as freight rates on food-stuffis were cancerned.
A few days ago, speaking in another place,
the Hon. the late Secretary of State referred
ta what I said at that tirne. I have little
doubt that the sarne conditions prevail to-day.
I stated then that flour and meal could be,
and in fact were, shipped frorn Winnipeg dawn
ta Montreal and thence to Halifax, and frorn
there across the Atlantic to Rotterdarn at
rates lower than thase prevailing frorn the same
western points ta New Glasgow and Sydney.
So much lower were they, narnely 48 cents,
that we were able ta, and dlid, buy flour in
Rotterdam, the produot of Canadian milis in
Western Canada and Ontario, bring it back
acros the Atlantic and save twelve cents a
harrel aver the direct rate frorn the West ta
Nova Scotia. Those are facts, and chiele
that winna ding. Thase are most unfair conditions, and they shauld 'be renecticd.
The honourabde senator fromn Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) has referred ta the question of
coke and coal in Montreal. The parties who
buiit the coke avens there apparently had fia
intention whatever of using Nova Scotia
coal. I rnake that staternent deliberately, and
for this reason. If they had. sa intended they
wouild have located their coke avens down at
the lower reaches of the harbour, where Nova
Scotia coal could be unloaded at the lowest
passible cost of transportation and without
Vashipment. Inistead, thiey built -the ovins
above the locks. This meant that no ships
coming frorn the Maritime Provinces with a
cargo of eight or ten thausand tans of coail
could reach the avens at ahl, for the simple
reason that there was nat draught enough
through the canal, neither was there length
enough in the locks ta accammadate aur
colliers of eight ta twelve thousand tans dead
weight.
Thase are a few facta I desire ta bring ta
the attention of honourable mernbers. Had I
known this matter was ta, be discuased ta-day,
I shauld have been better prepared ta deal

with it. I can assure the House that it is a
matter of very considerable importance, and
will have to be effectively dealt with sooner
or later, and the sooner it is dealt with the
better it will be for the peace, order and good
government of this country.
Honourable
lon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
sunators. I amî interested in tiis discusion,
though I do net tliînk I could contribute very
iuch to the subject-matter were J to confine
my remarks to Nova Scotia. The problem of
the coal industrv ih not confined to thbat province. It is national in extent, in thbat it
affects every province producing coal, and
it is difficult to formilate a solution owing
to the varying conditions in each area of
For intance. conditions in
production.
Alberta are different fron tloe wlich exist
in Nova Scotia.
It may surprise honourable menmbers to
know that the city where I live was founded
as a coal camp over half a century ago. In
fact the carliest coal miining company in
Southern Alberta was estabislied Iv Sir
Alexander Galt and bis associates in Canada

laid with coal, but I venture to state tiat in
the local boutes seventy-five tr cent of the
fuel used for heating purposes is natural gas.
In the carly days the people of Alberta depended wholly upon coal. To-day in most
of the larger cities of the province, such as
Edmtonton and Calgary, and in all the urban
commutnities south of Calgary to the American boundary and east towards Medicine Hat,
the use of coal lias dropped to about a quarter
of the consumption in former years. We cannet change this condition, for of course the
people prefer natural gas. As a result, in the
coai areas of Alberta there is a condition of
unemployment similar to that wieh exists
in Nova Scotia, and unless we can find a
market for our coail the picture painted by
due honourable senator fron Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) may be accepted as a fair
representation of what will eventually develop in our mining camps. They will become dead and silent towns.
I think one mistake lias been made in the
development of the coal mining industry in
Western Canada. In past years there lias
been a too-ready granting of leases of coal
mining areas. without any consideration of
whether there would be a market for the
product. Unquestionably there is over-production of coali in Alberta. In a word, there
are too many mines operating for the markets
that exist.
As to the Eastern market. for somie vears
there Las been an agitation for the reduction

of railroad rates so as to permit of Alberta

rates have been reduced, but not sufficiently
to enable Alberta coal to compete with other
fuels in Ontario. In fact our market is largely
confined to Alberta itself, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba.
But we have a further difficulty to surmtount in Manitoba. Some years ago I read
a report by Mr. Sanford Evans in respect to
the movement of wbeat down the Groat Lakes.
He stated tliat the grain boats brougbt coal
back as ballast, and at such a very low rate
that coal from Pennsylvania could be sold
in Winnipeg and adjacent points at a price
to compete with coal produced in the province of Alberta. I presume that tbat condition still prevails.
I would suggest, since there is a coal problem not only in the Maritime Provines, but
also in the Western P.rovmes, that next
session a Senate committee

be

appointed to

study tie fuel problem as it affects dbe whole
Dominion. I bave no doubt that a ma"s of
information wouild be available from various
departmental officials bere in Ottawa. The
report of such a committee would doubtless
be of considerable help in reaching a solution
of the problem, wbîli we all recognize exists
in every coal mining section of the Dominion.
This suggestion may net appeal to the
honourable senator from Pictou, for I presume
be wants action to be taken at an early date.
Whiile bis inquiry relates solely to the provthe
ince of Nova Scotia, I could not allo
&ccasion to p.ass witlout making these obsu;rvtions with respect to the coal mining situation in the province of Alberta.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, the problem wbich has been brought
to our notice by the honourable gentleman
from Pictou deserves serions attention. Govhave
provincial,
and
federal
ernments,
attempted a solution, and from time te time
legislation bas been enacted to assist the coal
producers of the East and the West.
It is not a problem easy of solution, for it
concerns varions and conflicting interests, those
of consumers as well as those of producers.
Honourable gentlemen are aware that subventions have been granted to enable the railroads to carry Canadian coal at reduced rates,
so as to extend the domestic market for the
product of our coal mines.
I will bring this debate to the attention of
the honourable Minister of Mines, and I
hope at an early date to be able to advise
honourable members as to the policy of the
Government in an effort to benefit the mining
population of the coal-producing areas of the
Maritime and the Western provinces.

should be sorry indeed to see any action
hastily taken which beyond our own borders
mighr be m'isinterpreted. 1 have no sympathy
at al. for have any but a most negligible
percentage of our population, with the recent
action of Italy; nex eitheless, we must carefully and coolly consider whether that action
bas any bearing on the incorporation of a
mutual benefit society in Canada. The treatment which this measure should reccive at
this time would seemn to me to be a proper
case for careful inquiry and for guidance by
the Government:'
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, I must confess that,
apart from what bas been said by the bonourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse),
1 have littie knowledgc of this Bill. I cannot
reconcile myseif to the idea thaýt the introduction of such a subject should raise the
larger question of the action of Italy in
Ethiopia. 1 mnay have occasion (to dilate upon
this question, but I would do so only as the
mouthpiece of the Ca9n-adian Government.
On examining the Bill 1 fret that we may be,
in a sense. dealing with a group of men who
are Canadians rither by naturalization or by
birth, and who have the 'best of intentions.
I cannot express an opinion as to the wisdom of presenting this Bill at this time. We
ail know that -the situation crrated by the
Italian Government bas bren most embarrassing. flot only ta Canada, but to the worid
at large, particularly to members of the
League of Nations, who had to join in applying sanctions against an aggrrssor. 1 should
not be disposed to vote for the amendment.
Hon. JAMES A. CALDER: Honourable
members, my present view is that the Senate
should act very siowly in this matter. We
should not deal with it hurriedly. The adoption of the amrndment before us might have
consequences that we canno-t now foresce.
Judging fromn what has breen said, the Bill is
a harmlrss one. It asks for the incorporation of a socirty to carry on insurance and
mutua I benefit opera tions--activities that are
not at :ail new. Many of the people involved, probably most of thrm, are residents
of Canada, and I dare say a very large proportion of themn are Canadian citizens. I
doubt very much that we should let our feelings with regard to what bas happened elsewbere in the worid influence us in making a
decision at the present time. We should take
time to think -the matter over. I wou]d
suggest, therefore, that we let the matteT
stand until to-morrow at least, and I wouid
move the adjournment of the debate.
The debate was adjourned.

traffic. I know it will be said at once that in
pursuance of a decision of the Privy Council
the control of the liquor traffic was handed
over to the provinces, and it no longer
remained with the federal authorities. That
is true. We all have very vivid memories
of the circumstances of that liquor question.
The Privy Council decision confirms my statement that in certain circumstances the provinces can legislate against one another's trade.
As my rig'ht honourable friend pointed out,
the British North America Act prevents the
imposition of a duty, or something equivalent
to a duty, by one province on goods coming
into it from another province. Yet, what was
there in that liquor case between Quebec and
Ontario but an interference with goods coming into one province from another? There
were officials on the border and on trains for
the purpose of confiscating goods brought
from Quebec into Ontario, and persons who
were caught bringing in goods were punished.
I shall be told that the object of the Ontario law was restriction. But let me point
out to honourable senators that the power
to make such laws remains with the provinces;
they still have the right to pass such legislation.

tion? One object or aim in Ontario was
that no person in the province should purchase liquor except from the Government
Commission. The object in Quebec was the
same. I do not hesitate to say that one of the
principal reasons for the legislation in both
provinces was enhancement of provincial income through the sale of liquor.
But the Federal Government did not give
the provinces the same powers that customs
officers have with regard•to the seizing of
liquor. Before it could be touched by a provincial officer the liquor had to be within the
province. I submit that one of the objects
that had to be attained before the legislation
became effective was that the provincial government should have control over all liquor
sales in its own province. Provincial governments got that power and they have retained it ever since. They established liquor
stores, and there was the farce-or partial
farce. at least-of requiring a would-be purchaser to obtain a medical certificate.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
right honourable gentleman permit me to
interrupt?

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have now got
along to the matter of doctors' prescriptions,
and there is nothing I have said so far that I
want to take baek. In Ontario if a man had
a doctor's prescription he could go to a Government liquor store and buy a bottle. Of
course no honourable members had any experience with such things, but I was told that no
man who had any pain at all was refused a
prescription in Ontario. It is even said that
some men got prescriptions on the strength
of having premonitions of pain. But in the
province of Quebec purchasers were not required to secure medical certificates.
Hon. Mr. POPE: They had no pains.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The provincial
right in regard to which he is speaking arose
solely because of supplementary Dominion
legislation which made potent the desire of
the provinces to restrict the liquor traffic,
the Dominion legislation going to the extent
of preventing liquor entering a prohibition
province from being used contrary to the
lavs of that province. But for the supplementary Dominion legislation the provinces
would be utterly powerless. The same is
true here. Without this supplementary legislation the provinces will remain powerless.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am pointing
out what it is possible for the provinces to do.
In that instance the provinces made a request
for permissive legislation, as I understand my
right honourable friend. I think in the present
case also the provinces ought to be granted the
permissive legislation, for which they are
asking. I want to make clear what actually
occurred. While Ontario was called a prohibition province, it was not such in fact; it
was a restricted-liquor-consumption province.
Both Ontario and Quebec had control of the
liquor business within their respective territories. What was the object of the legisla-

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is the
right honourable gentleman quite sure about
that? My impression is that the legislation
to which he is referring was passed while the
prohibition Act was in force in Ontario.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There were
liquor stores throughout the province of Quebec, where you could buy liquor without any
permit or doctor's certificate. Now, if we
looked upon the matter from a business point
of view, without any prejudice at all, would
it not be clear that one aim of Quebec-I am
leaving my own province of Ontario out of
consideration for the minute-was control of
the sale of liquor through its own stores?
That of course would not prohibit the sale
of liquor at all, for a man could go to those
stores and make purchases without any permit. The real object was to increase the
income of the province. What I am doing
now is pointing out what powers the prov.

learn, they already have the power to issue
licences and so control those who from any
province may wish to enter another province
and carry on business. In other words, the
danger would not arise of nine different entities being invested with federal powers.
My right honourable friend is opposed
to granting to the provinces the powers set
forth in the resolution in the absence of the
consent of their respective legislatures. I admit
that under ordinary conditions to require such
consent is not unreasonable. But we are not
oonfronted with ordinary conditions. The
Federal Government has for some years been
trying to co-operate with the provincial governments in order to save them from bankruptcy, and I think that even if under these
circunstances powers have to be given that
ordinarily would not be given without the
consent of the legislatures, the special circumstances amply justify the present course
of action. All the provinces want is the right
to collect more money. As I have already
said, I think eaci province has the power to
collect licence and other fees, but while
the.se would discourage the entry of traders
from other provinces, the revenue would not
be sufficient to meet provincial needs.
During the depression the Federal Government has not stood strictly on its rights. Had
it done so, several of the provinces would
now be bankrupt. I say that advisedly. Under
the British North America Act the Parliament of Canada is not required to take care
of relief; that primarily is the duty of the
provinces and the municipalities. But the
Federal Government has said, "While it is not
our duty to grant unemployment relief
directly, the problem having become national
in gravity and extent, we will make gifts and
loans to the provinces on this account." Had
the federal authority adhered strictly to the
Constitution it would not have contributed
anything. I think honourable members will
agree with me that the only result would
have been financial disaster, or perhaps something even worse. As I have said, this is
not a theory, it is a condition, and governments, both federal and provincial, municipalities, business firms and private individuals have co-operated in a philanthropic effort
to relieve the necessities of our people.
Now, this being the case, and the need
being so urgent at the present time that the
leaders of the various provincial governments
have come to Ottawa and stated their requirements to the Federal Government, I ask honourable members: What should we do if such
a case were put before us in respect of our
own business? The provincial premiers have
asked for power to impose a sales tax. If no

343

action is to be taken until the legislatures of
the various provinces have been convened to
express their opinions, the Federal Government will have to lend the provinces more
money, and at the present time the treasury
is not over-supplied with that commodity. We
are already taxed to the limit of our capacity,
but as citizens and as legislators it is our duty
to do everything in our power to relieve the
wants of the people. It seems to me we shall
be assuming a grave responsibility if we say,
"We will not do anything until your legislatures have expressed their wishes in the matter." Here is an agreement arrived at by the
federal and provincial governments on behalf
of the people of Canada, many of whom are
in want. So far as the Federal Government
is concerned, the agreement has been passed
by the House of Commons without a division,
although I know a good deal of objection
was expressed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

On division.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We would not
call that a real division.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The motion
was not passed unanimously; it was opposed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Nobody went
on record. In arithmetical terms it might be
called "short division."
This agreement has been arrived at by men
representing the nine provinces and the
Dominion. The House of Commons, elected
not so long ago, endorsed the action of the
Government. This being so, are we not
assuming a grave responsibility if, on the
ground of problematical trouble, we veto an
agreement arrived at in the manner I have
described?
Hon. Mr. ARTHURS: Was this matter on
the agenda of the meeting between the Dominion and the provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think it was,
but I do not know. I am not consulted about
these agendas.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
it is not in the official report of the Conference.
Hon. Mr. ARTHURS: It was not on the
agenda.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is not disputed that the agreement was madle. Often
at company and other meetings business is
introduced which does not appear on the
agenda. Sometimes the new business is the
most important of alL. Simply because the
matter was not on the agenda it does not
follow it was not dealt with.

SEINATE

seriousiy because off wbat my right bonourabie

MAY 26, 1936
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
of that.

I amn not sure

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 0f course my right
b-onourable friend is correct w.hein he>sys that
certain direct taxes can be diffused, so, to
speak, and in that way bc passed on. In other
words, if a man pays a licence fee he charges
a littie -more for everything hie sells. But is
there not ail the difference in the world between a tax that now and then, and only to
a limited extent, can be passed on, and one
wbich is intended to be passed on and always
is passed on?
The right bonourable the leader on this
side of the House cited the text of certain
legislation just passed by the province of New
Brunswick. Wbat does it say? It says that
every representative of a principal who lives
outside of New Brunswick shahl be taxed on
tbe entire amount of business hie does for
bis principal in the province of New Brunswick. Wbat does that mean? It means that
the principal. who lives outside of New
Brunswick, will increase the price of bis goods
in order to absorb the tax, and that the
merchant wbo selîs tbose goods witbin tbe
province wili sirnply spread the tax throughout
the province.
May I caîl the attention of tbe House to
the fact tbat this legislation, in my opinion
at ail events, is ultra vires, because the tax
can be passed on; and if tbe resolution allowing indirect taxation by tbe provinces is
adopted, tbe road will be wide open, and
taxes can be passcd on witbout the slightest
obstacle. If suchi is tbe case, and if the
rigbt bonourable the leader on tbis side of
the House, and tbnse wbo share bis opinion,
should be right-I do flot say tbey are,
although I arn convinced tbat tbey are-is
the Governiment dealing witb tbis mnatter in
a proper manner?
I speak without resentment, but I must say tbat the manner in whicb
tbe Governiment bas presented tbis resolution
to both Houses bias surprised me. If wbiat is
proposed should be rigbt. it means tha;t every
province in tbis oountry can stDangle brade at
it, horders.
Honourable members very well understand
what will bappen. How long can New Brunswick impose a tax on tbe people of other
provinces wbo send tbeir goods into New
Brunswick, without causing retaliation? Are
the great provinces of Ontario and Quebec,
from wbich most manufactured gonds corne,
going to stand by and sec tbeir goods mulcted
every time tbey pass tbe frontier of tbe
province of New Brunswick, *ôr any otber
province for tbat matter, witbout adopting
similar measures on tbeir own bebaîf? Tbis
being so, are you not passing legislation wbich

M45

wiIl bave tbe result of disrupting Confederation? If you allow tbe provinces to retaliate
against one another, where are we going to
end?
Now tbat the dream of Sir John Macdonald
hias been realized, will you allow me to read
to you a description of Confederation as
bie conceived it, and to ask you if we bave
a right to, risk the monumental etructure resulting f rom the skdlfnul, powerful aind patriotic
Act of Con4iedoration.?
Listen -to what Sir
John Macdonaldd said in 1865 with regaird to
what hie hoped Gonfederation would accomplish. He said:
I think it will so appear to the peoples of
this country, that, if we wish to be a great
people, if we wish to form-using the expression wbich was sneered at tbe other eveninga great nationality, commanding the respect of
the world, able to hold our own against ail]
opponients, and to defend those institutions we
prize; if we wish to bave one system of government, and to establish a commercial union with
unrestricted free trade between people of the
five provinces, belonging, as they do, to the
same nation, obeying the same sovereign, owning tbe same allegiance, and being, for the
most part, of the saine blond and Eineage;
if we wish to be able to afford to each other
the mneans of mutual defence and support
against aggression and attack-this can only
be attained by a union of some kind between
the scattered and weak communities composing tbe British North American provinces.
Tbat was the vision of Sir John Macdonald.
If you refleet ynu will realize that it was
possible only because hie envisaged it against
a background of free trade tbrougbout tbe
country. Destroy this background and you
de.stroy Confederation; you tbrow the country
back seventy years and break it up into small,
insignificant units. I say to the Government:
if there is the sligbht-st danger of t4sis, wbat
r.gbt have you bo, sutbmit resýo1utions wbîch
may z4hatter Confederation, without first having submitted thern týo tbe provinces and
having them approvied by thýeir legislatures?
A scbool of tbougbt wbicb came intu being
a f ew years ago dlaims that Confederation
should be more flexible. May I qunte just a
few lines from the e' idence of a witness who
appeared bef-or the special commiýttee named
last year by the House of Commons to study
and ascertain the best means of amending
tbe British North America, Act?
Tbere is hardly any necessity of demonstrating the rigidity of our present written Constitution, and I could add of our unwritten
Constitution, as botb have been mentioned.
This bias resulted f rom the compact theory of
Confederation, of whicbi more will be said later
on.
Tbe Federal House is even in a niuch worse
position than the legisiatures.
Despite its
often expressed inclination to do so, it can
neither abolish for reform the Senate.

ministers and some other cabinet ministers,
and I think I ntay say th-at a greaat similiarity
in political views cbirew those gentlemen, velry
close together. But did they agree? No. They
named a sub-committee, made up of representatives of the Dominion aind of ail the
provinces, to st-udy the question and report.
I amrn ot aware t.hat a report Las been miadie
by thicmn as yet.
I think, it may be said that the Dominion
Government, regardless of which party was
in power, has a.lWays oonside.red Confederation
a treaty. It bam been feit that no amenýdment should be made to the British North
America Act unless the provinces agreed.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Every onje of them.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Now, honourable
senators, here we are face to face with a
proposal for une of the gravest and nst
dangerous amendinents that could be made
to the Confederation Act. The Government
bas the consent not of the legisiatures, but
of the provincial prime ministers, exeept,
one.
It seems to me thait il is not
u!nrea,3onable to, suggest to, the Governýment that somne *of those prime miisters rnay be very gLaci to have addjitional
sources of revenue made available to tbem.
Some might be greatly relieved to have their
doubtful legisiation of the past validated.
But bas the Governiment any assurance that
the legislatures would agree to, what is being
requested? Surely no province is more vitally
interested in the ternis of Confedieration than
is the province of Quebec. Is the Government sure that the Legisiature of Quebec
would agree to the proposed amendments?
And is the Government sure that the country
at large wvould agree if it understood the
real purpose bebind the amendments and
realized their far-reaching consequences?
I f eel that the more one studies these reso1',utions the more ocsnvin'oed one becomes thait
they must not pe.s. They emantot, pass without enttailing the gra'vest possible ccmsequenoes.
If the Governrment is wise it wiil not preasl
tlieir adoption by this flouse. The f act that
there is a doubt m. to the ton.sent of the
provinces is sufficient justification for submitting them to, the legisiatures. ShouId tbey
agree ýto these ainendmenta, 'th'en-aud only
then -wouild tbis flouse b>e .relieve-d of tbe
heavy responsibility placed upon it by Confedieration. If there was one reason more than
any other why this flouse w"s ereated at
the time of Confederation, it was that the
British North America Act requi-red protection
from an absoluitely independent, bodty. Minority rigbts and provincial ri.gbts were omfided
to its (are. Here again may I quote Sir John

A. Macdonald? I do so because no man was
more respected, hon-oured, and 1oved in bis
time thajn was be. In our country we have had
nio greater statesman than. Sir John A. Macdonald, whose conception of the Senate was
this:
To the Upper House is to be confided the
protection of sectional intercsts; therefore is
il that the three great divisions are there
equally representcd. for the purpose of defending such interests against the combinations of
majorities in the Asseibly. It wi]ll therefore

In closing I desiýre to address myscîf particularly to eminent lawyers ini this flouse.
I ask, tliem whether or mot the a.mendmemts
proposed by these résolutions may ba)ve dLsa&C'an
trous consequences for Confederation.
any -one of them, on eith-er siýde 'of the flouse,
,at ahl events conbend that there is no dtanger?
If so, whai is the dity of the guordiani of
Confederation?
What is the du-ty of this
flouse?
HonourHon. G. LYNCU-STAUNTON:
able senators, I desire 10 add a few words to
wbat bas been said in condemnation of this
resolution. 1 arn perfectly sincere when I say
that il is immaterial to me wbetber sucb a
resolution cornes from a Liberal or a Conservative government. I think il is my duty
to vote in the light of what I believe the
law is, and with regard to, the consequences
that may flow from the resolution, irrespective of ils origin.
My first objection 10 the resolution is that
it is not regularly bel ore us. I arn not going
to argue any question whiclh my righit honourable leader (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meiglien) bas
argued. In my opinion anyone who does not
agree with bis argument is in invincible ignorance and beyond the pos-sibililty of conviction.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Carried.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It bas
been argued here that we should pass Ibis
resolution because it is proposed to us by the
House of Commons, whicb bas been freshly
elected by tbe people. That is a wronig conception. If we pass the resolution it will be
coming from us; we shahl be joining, not
following, the flouse of Gommons. The resolution, might bave been originally presented
here. We arc not faced with a mandate from
the people, because the question at issue was
not 'before them. I have no confidence in
mandates, anyway. Mandates are usually
wbat the gentlemen who sit in the Privy
Council conceive the people desire.

SENATE
The passage of this resolution by the buse
of Commons does; fot influence me in the
least. I notice that whien it was, put to a vote,
every member w-ho did flot wear the Government harness voted against it. Had it been
proposedc by a Conservative administration it
would have had no greater effeet upon me. for
I know that under the party svstem members
of the House of Commons xvho support the
party in power muSt vote the way tbey are
told to vote. Su w -at we have here is only
an express-ion of desire of the Governmentcf the Cabinet. The Hou5-e of Commons was
neyer coný,ultcd about it at ail; it was simply
told to sign on the dotted line. aud it did so.
We are here for the purpose of safeguarding
the Britis- Nortli America Act and protecting
the people by rcfusing te pass any proposed
legislation wbieli in our opinion is undesirable
or likely to do injury to the courntry. We
have been tol-d that the re-iýon the Government dil net a-k for au expression of opinion

did not need this proposed legislation; all
they nieeded it for was to get more money.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
All taxing laws are for the purpose of getting more
money. I do not wish to say the right honourabje gentleman is not right, but I shall
be surprised if there is any provincial legislation preventing interprovincial trade.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
not be any.

There can-

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No. I
have known provinces to circumvent the
British North America Act- once or twice, and
they may have done so this time.
My submission is that the proposed resolution would confer an additional power on the
provinces, a power which the Fathers of Confederation, after debating it for four years,
de.cided they should not allow. I do not think
that after discussing this proposal for four
days ire are prepared to revoke their conclusion. They thought the Dominion could
not stand if that disease were injected into
the Constitution. I know that slavery, being
a fatal disease in the Constitution of the
United States, split the great Republic in
twain. caused a loss of 500,000 of its citizens
and nearly destroyed the Union.
I shall
hesitate long before I consent to vote for that
which may set up a terrible distemper in
our Constitution.
If there is no strength
or no coherence the Dominion may fail. We
must be verv careful how we meddle with
our Constitution.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
members, when the right honourable gentleman who leads t:his side of the House (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) was discussing this question, one week ago to-day, he made what, to
my mind, was an unanswerable argument to
show that this proposed resolution would
result in such provincial legislation as would
in effect allow each province to surround itself
with a tariff wall. While listening to his argument my mind was carried back to a very
strong speech, somewhat along the same lines,
made in this Chamber less than a year ago
by the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). At that time
we were discussing the proper definition of
the word "exporit."
I shall take the liberty
of reading part of his speech, for I know all
his fellow members have the highest respect
for his opinion. At page 437 of the Senate
Hansard of 1935 the right honourable gentleman said:
I am afraid that the effect of defining
"export" so as to include interprovincial trade
will be a very bad one. We shall probably
see in some American newspapers the state-

ment that the disintegration of Canada into
provinces has begun. I do not believe that
any province will ultimately gain by seeking
to restrict trade with other provinces, because
in the long run the people will not stand for
that kind of thing.
If some people have their way in getting
this new definition attached to the word
"export," we are likely to have before Parliament some day a proposition that each province should have a tariff of its own. Such a
proposition has already been made in one
province. This measure is a tariff in another
form, because it is a restriction on interprovincial trade. If the time ever comes when all our
provinces cannot deal with one another, it will
be very discouraging to those who have devoted
their lives to the ideal of a united Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, hear. It
was worth while repeating.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
Evidently the
effect of the first part of this resolution will
be to enable the provinces to increase taxation. I do not think that is desirable. Something along the lines of decreased .taxation and
expenditure would be much more appreciated
by the people of Canada.
I understand that many communications
have been received from boards of trade of
different cities and from other business interests, asking that they be given an opportunity to present their views to the Senate
before we dispose of this matter. In order
to bring this about, I move, seconded by
Hon. Mr. Gordon:
That the resolution now being considered by
the Senate be referred to the Standing Coiñmittee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
it is not my desire to prolong this discussion,
but it seems to me that we who are not constitutional lawyers are leit pretty much up in
the air by the technical arguments of our
colleagues of the legal profession.
We have a problem to solve, and I think
it is the duty of the Parliament of Canada to
find a solution as early as possible and not
continue the practice of the last three or four
years, of meeting the difficulties that arise
from day to day. We have so to arrange
if possible, that our provincial and municipal
governments shall be able to carry on the
functions and discharge the duties allocated
to them by the British North America Act.
That is the problem. To solve it the Government, by this resolution, esks for amendments to the British North America Act
which will enlarge the powers of taxation of
the provinces.
The resolution also deals with the matter of
loans to the provinces. During the last few
years some $114,000.000 odd has been loaned
to ttie Western Provinces. I find from talking to the man in the street that he is firmly

MAY 26, 1936
Hon. Mr. KING: Is that good business?
It on]y reduces their credit and makes it
more difficuit for them to carry on, and in
time it would embarrass the Dominion
treasury. I tbink wve are ail fully seized of
the fact th-at .some action should be taken.
Many taxes of the kind referred to are
being levied to-day. In British Columbia we
have a gasoline tax. It may flot *be constitutional. It is in this position: when a brilliant
lawyer said he would flot pay the tax, the
Government did not take him into court.
We alsn bad a meal tax in British Columbia:
wvhen a customer refused to pay it, the Government did nt dare proceed against him
for fear of jeopardizing- other taxes. Take
the theatre tax: that is not direct tax; it is
secured indirectly. The theatre is asked to,
have its man collect the tax for the Government. If the Government were taking the
tax directly it would have its own officiai,
with a box in the theatre. But it cannot
çlo that. That would be too expensive. The
same is truc of the gasoline tax. The Government does not take the tax directly from
the customer.
The vendor of the gasoline
aets as the agent of the Goveroýmenit. The city
of Mointreal,, the grcat metropo-lis *of ýthis
country, is taking f rom the eustomers a direct
tax which will amiount, to $5,000,000.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Iýt is a direct

Hon. Mr. KING: I am flot cager to enter
into any argument, for I am flot a constitutional lawyer; but as a citizen of British
Columbia and of Canada, and as a member
of this Huse, I want to impress upon hionoui-able senators how serious will be the whole
situation, flot only provincially but federally.
if we allow matters to continue as they bave
been for some time past.
Right Hon. ARTHUIR MEIGHEN: Honourable memibers, it is with some hesitation
that I venture to as], the indulgence of the
House for a few moments more. In doing
so I certainly have no intention of duplicating
what I endeavoured to expound the other
night. My purpose is, rather, to meet and
clarify, if I can. a point made by the right
bhonourable senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) whicb well deserves to
be answvered. I am flot intimating that anything wbicb bas been said is not worthy of
reply, but I think as I answer the right hon-

351

ourable senator from Eganville the honourable senator w.ho bas just taken bis seat
(Hon. Mr. King) will see the grenat distinction,
basic, fondamental and permanent, between
the character of tVax now possible and the
ebaracter and effect of the tax wbich would
be possible if tbis proposai were adoptied.
Before doing tbat, bowever, may I make
one 'exception?
May I emphasize, for fear
it bas not received the attention it, merits, the
argument adv'anced by the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Coté) the otber
nigbt?
The question is not wbetber taxes are needed
or not. Certainly tbey are needed-sadly
oeeded, distressingly needed, as tbey always
will be so, long as we are a dem.ocracy. But
bas not our main problem for years been tbe
duplication of taxation by provinces and
Dominion? How many debates bave we not
bad in the two buses as to effecting some
metbod of eliminating this duplication; flot
necessarily of reducing taxation, but of eliminating the duplication and the enormous expense and trouble incurred by it? Any in
this House-and I know there are many.who bave bad sncb experience as I bave had
of the multiplicity, tbe plethora, tbe terrible
abundance of returns wbich must be made
to this government, and to that, would bave
some idea. of what tbis awful duplication
means. In tbe larger institutions of our country there are departiments that do notbing but
prepare goverfiment returfis.
Are we now moving along tbe line of
eliminating tbis duplication?
No. We are
multiplying it; we are carrying it into other
fieldis. Wby not, divide the fields? Would it
not be economy to do so? Would there
not be simplification, and would there flot
be an unloading -of the terrific burden tdiat
now rests; on business? Wby did I get no
attention frum tbe bonourable senator fr-om
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) when I made
the suggestion that we retire wholly or in
part from the incomnp tax fie'ld? Wben Sir
Thomas White reluctantly agreed to that tax
be warned the country tbhat in adopting it
we were entering a field hitherto re.se-rved to
tbe provinces.
1If we mnade a mistake, ]et
us retire. even if we bave to put on an
additional sales ax-an indirect tax. Is not
that m-etbod far simpler and more economical?
Wby carry the curse of duplication into
every spbere of taxation?
So much for tbat. I now come Vo the
point I really want to answer. I tried tbe
other nigbt to make the argument that by
passing tbis resolution and obtaining the
amendment, asked for we enuble the provinces to discriminate between their own reisi-

The outsider,

Right Honý. Mr. MEIGHE'N: His goods,
certainly. That is mihat I mean. They can
shut thcm out or make the tax so higb
that the goods avili rot on the shelves. The
right hionourable senator -gays they can do
tbat now. H1e savs a city like Ottawa can

The Sonate resumed froni yeriday tbe
adjourncd debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Licasse for second reading of Bill N2, an
Art to incorporate Tbe Independent Order

MAY 27, 1936
of the Sons of Italy, and the amendment
moved by Hon. Mr. Hardy that the Bill be
flot now read a second time, but this day
six months.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, when yesteiday I moved the adjournment of the debate on the amendment of
the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) I did so in order that we might 'have
an opportunity of giving a little further consideration to the step-in a sense, the summary step-that it was proposed we should
take. Many questions are raised hy this
matter, but I arn not, going to dwell on them
at ail. The proposed measure is a private
Bill, and in my view it should go to the
Private Bis Committee. 1 understand it is
not dustomary to kili a measure of this kind
at this stage. If the honourabie gentleman
wishes to have the Bill defea-ted, fie wili have
ample opportunity to move to that effect
later on. The more I think over the matter
the more convinced I ami that there should
be a reference to the Private Buis Committee.
We cannot tell what may haippen there. In
view of what bas already taken place in this
House, there is a possibility that the promoters of the measure may consider it advisable to withdraw it.
There is onIy 'this consideration that I
should like to leave with honourable members. We should act carefully in the matter.
For long years the Italian nation was on the
most friendly terms with Great Britain and
ail the Dominions. It was one of our Allies
in the War. Who can say what conditions
ma:y exist three, 'four or five years from now?
It may be that we shahl be very strongly
desirous of another alliance at that time.
The situation referred ta yesterday by my
honourable friend from Leeds bas, I tbink
we will ail agree, been created largely by one
mndividual, who may or meay not be on the
scene a little later on. No one can tell. If
he is not, the whole course of Italian policy
may be changed. However, I do not wish te
say more about that aspect. I feel very
strongly that we ahould let this Bill take the
course that is ordinarily taken by private bills;
that is, it should go before the Private Bis
Committee. When we have that committee's
report we can take drastic action if we should
find it necessary. I certainly would suggest
to my honourabie friend from Leeds the
desirability of withdrawing bis amendment at
this stage.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators, needless to say, I do not wi.sh ta flnd
myself the centre of international complications. nor do I desire 'ta involve the Senate

of Canada in such a contretemps. After
listening ta the measured words of the right
honourable leader on the other side of the
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and to
those of the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. -Calder), I desire, with the
consent of my seconder (Hon. Mr. Sharpe),
ta asic for permission ta withdraw my motion.
The amendment was withdrawn.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Lacasse was agreed
ta, and the Bill was reail the second time.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA AC'TS
PROPOSED JOINT ADDRESSDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Commons in an Address to Ris Most Excellent
Majesty the King, praying that he may
graciously be pieased to give his consent to
submitting a measure ta the Parliament of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland ta amend the British North
America Acts, 1867 to 1930, and the British
North America Act, 1907, and that the Senate
do insert in the blank space therein the words
"Senate and,"
and on the motion of Hon. Mr. Donnelly
that the said motion and Address be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBA-CH: Honourabie
senators, during the course of this discussion
probably aIl that can be use'fully said at the
present time bas been said, with the possible
exception of reference ta legislation recently
enacted in Alberta, which province I have the
honour ta represent in this House. But
before I discuss that legisiation I desire ta
refer briefly to one or twa other matters.
A few days ago we listened with interest
ta an address by the honourable gentleman
from Parkdale (Hon. 'Mr. Murdock), in
which occur these two striking observations,
bath. of which I arn inclined to, think are in
same measure correct. I am quoting from
page 324 of the Senate Hansard of May 19:
WelI, I think I arn not exaggerating when
1 say that 85 per cent of the people ini every
province of Canada have said, "To H- with
the British North America Act!" when on
various occasions they have found it standing
in the way and preventing the doing of things
that should be done for their benefit and the
benefit of Canada. I prophesy that if this
Senate takes upon itself the responsibility of
saying, "Nay, nay, we cannot and wiil not
pass this resolution," the Canadian people will
have an additional concrete and definite
reason ta clamour for the abolition of the
Senate.

As I said a moment ago. I think ýthere is
perhaps a measure of truth in both observations. Nevertheless il is a sad commentary
upon our democracy and our systemn of education if 85 per cent of our people know very
little about and care somewhat iess for the
Constitution under which tbey live.

No; I said
Mr. GRIESBACH:
It was, I understand, a speech.

I beg- the hionHon. Mr. MURDOCK:
ourabl-e gentleman's pardon.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The more 1 study
the Britishi North America Act, the more my
admiration grows for it and for the great men
who some sixty-nine years ago crystallized
labours in that great document. The
tir
British North America Act bas been in effeet
long enough to enable us 10 contrast it with,
say, the Constitution of the United States.
Tbe contrast is on aIl points ntnst favourable
bo our own Constitution. For instance, with
rcspect to, bbe maintenance of law~ and order,
lot us consider the wise provision whereby the
Parliament of Canada enacts the criminal iaw
and the provinces enforce that law.* Therein
xvîll bo fouind an example of check and
balance whicb bas workcd most satisfactorily.
Vien there is tbe provision whereby the
legislattures pro%4dce the courts tbroughout the
Government
Federal
and t1e
provinces
appoints and pays the judges. That provision
also has worked out extremely wel, and our
judiciary enjoy the deepest respect of the
public for tbe integrity and skill With which
tbey administer our criminal and civil law.
As one reflects on the smootb operation of
our Constitution ox or a period of nearly
seventy years, one may well be pardoned for
wondering wvhetber to-day wxe have statesmen
capable of drafting sucb a notable document,
or wbetber wec bave a public opinion wbich
would ondorse il.
There is anotber fondamiental. principie
ruhining tbrouigb tbe Constitution, a principie
based upon sound common sonse, that individuals and goods may move freeiy tbroughout
our country front one province 10 another.
It is impossible to imagine a Confederation in

of trade.

inces, and he concluded by pointing out thiat
a reciprooal arrangement had ýbeen corne to
for the withdrawal of such obnoxious by-laws.
However, I tbink the right honourable gentleman missed the point. The point is, it see*ms
10 me. that both these communities, regardless
of wliat theïr legal powers may be, had come
to the conclusion that their legisiation was
not only unwise, unsound and foolish, but
inconsistent with a sound relationship 'bet;ween
provinces and between neighbouring cities in
different provinces.
The honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) in his second statement
said that if we opposed this resolution we
should be providing mnaterial for an attack
upon, or an agitation for the abolition of,
the Senate. The whole of the discussions
preceding Confedieration, and the writers upon
the subject, a-gree in declaring that the special
ta.sk and duty of the Senate is ýto watch ox or
and proteet the rights of provinces, and their
relations with one another. If this Senate
bas any duty at ail it is -to amend, 10 revise,
andi, if necessary, 10 rejeot legiisiationi froin
tbe Lower House. That is its lob. If it
can bo said tbat over a period of yoars the
Sencto lias acquicsced in ail the legislation
tbaL bas como frona tbe Lower Houso, tbat
it lias made of itsclf a rubber stamp by miecll
approving of thi legislation from thIe Low er
Houso, thot would bc the sounidest possible
argument for it.s abolition. It seenis t0 mce.
therefore. that in this case it is not only our
rigbit but our clear dtity t0 interveno.
Now I conte bo ciscuss tbe Alberta legislation. in wbicbi I am pairticularly interested.
My rigb t bionourable friend the leader of tînt
Opposition (Right Hon. Mr. Meighcn) piaced
before us the otbcr night the legisiation passed
by the prov ince of New Brunswick. Three
things may be said with respect 10 that and
the Albert'i le-gislation: in botb cases parts
of the legislation are ultra vires; in bollb
casecs the legislation so passed would be legalized by te poasae of the resolution before
us; and in botb cases a fundamental principle
of our Confederation is violated.
The Act to wbielh I refer is kýnown as the

in tliat province, is to be lex ied upon the

MAY 27, 1936
I arn not in a position to say whether or
not this legislation is ultra vires of the Legislature. Probably it is intra vires. I think
the Legislature has, under the existing law,
the right to place a direct tax upon the consumer. We seem to be agreed upon that.
I am not going to weary the House with
a discussion of the difficulties this measure
is causing purchasers, consumers, vendors and
the like, or the annoyance, trouble, and loss
of money it is occasioning. That may be
discussed in another place.
I cannot say whether the Governor in
Council of the province of Alberta has the
power under this Act to pass the regulations
which have been passed, but I am going to
draw the attention of the House to section
21 of the regulations for -the working of this
Act and the imposition of this 2 per cent tax
on sales in the province. Section 21 says:
Where a purchaser residing or having bis
place of business outside an exempt area in
the province purchases any commodity for use
or consumption within the province from a
vendor residing or having bis place of business
outside the province or in an exempt area, the
purchaser must pay the tax on such commodity
direct to the Sales Tax Branch within three
days of the receipt of such commodity.
The Bill provides that, by Order in Council,
certain areas may be made exempt from the
operation of the law; and by the regulations
the ýtown of Lloydmninster is made exempt.
That is so because the town of Lloydminster
extends on both sides of the interprovincial
boundary. In the Bill provision is made for
other exempt areas. Leaving out the words
'"exempt areas," one may read that section in
this way:
Where a purchaser residing or having bis
place of business in the province purchases
any commodity for use or consumption within
the province from a vendor residing or having
his place of business outside the province, the
purchaser must pay the tax on such commodity
direct to the Sales Tax Branch within three
days of the receipt of such commodity.
The effect of that regulation is just this. If
a person living in Alberta, or a resident of
Alberta who is temporarily outside his own
province, purchases an article in any other
province of Canada for bis own use and not
for resale, and brings that commodity into
the province of Alberta, or if a resident of
Alberta sends to another province for any
article and brings it into the province, be is
required by the regulations under this Bill to
pay a 2 per cent tax. Now, that is as
distinctly a tariff as any tariff can be.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is that a
tax on him or on the article?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On him.
12745-23J

355

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is a tax on him
in respect of the article he brings in from
another province. That is to say, it is a
tariff upon goods brought from other provinces of Canada into tbe province of Alberta.
That legislation will be validated if we pass
the resolution now before us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But did not the
honourable gentleman say that this was a
direct tax, and intra vires of the province?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I would say that
'the legislation is intra vires of the province
now. I am not .prepared to say that under
the Act the Governor in Council has the right
or power to pass this regulation. But the
Government has done so, and is now busily
engaged in collecting the tax wherever it
can find the goods, and hordes of inspectors
are busily engaged in looking for the goods.
If we pass the resolution before us now, by
its very terms we shail validate this Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If it is not
already valid.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We cannot vahidate that which is already valid. We shall be
validating something that is now invalid and
contrary to the Constitution. That is the
danger we should bu running in passing this
resolution.
I wished merely to bring before the House
the situation prevailing in the province of
Alberta, as my right honourable friend and
leader brought before us the situation prevailing in New Brunswick, and to suggest that if
we pass this resolution validating certain legislation passed in these two provinces, and all
legislation of the same kind that may be
passed in future, we shall be faced with the
condition against which my right honourable
leader has warned us. That is, we shall have
nine provinces surrounded by tariff walls. That
would be contrary to our Constitution, and,
what is worse, contrary to common sense in
such a Confederation as ours.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to take up much time. First
I want to register a protest. As I come from
a provincial legislature where protests are in
order, it is perhaps only meet that I should
make a protest in this House. The statement
of the honourable leader of the Government
and that of the right honourable leader of the
Opposition were undoubtedly made in good
faith, but I find that if a senator who is not a
member of a committee goes to one of its
meetings, it is just too bad for him. Being
present at a committee this morning, I asked
a question and was told to wait till a committee member got through. When that

SENATE

356

member had finished, the Chairman asked if
any other member of the committee had any
questions. He asked, not "Has any senator a
question?" but "Has any member of the committee a question?" That clearly ruled me
out. I protest against that.
I likewise protest against this Bill being
sent to the Banking and Commerce Committee, of which I am not a member. I submit that my right to consider this Bill and to
hear representations on it in committee is as
good as that of the senator who is senior in
point of years of service, the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
His right is exactly the same as mine; no
more, no less.
I object most strenuously to not having a
perfect right to get up in any committee at
any time and ask any question I like. Should
I happen to be out of order because of using
bad manners, it is not the duty of the chairmani to tell me so: the pity is that my father
and mother did not properly train me. I demand the right to ask questions in a committee. I want it known that if this Bill goes
to the Banking and Commerce Committee,
as I presume it will, I shall have the same right
as any other senator to ask questions of any
witness there, and neither the chairman nor
any member of the committee will have any
right to stop me from doing so. I want to
have an understanding about that before the
Bill goes to committee.
Hon. Mr.
senators,-

DANDURAND:

Honourable

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have not finished speaking, though I am through with my protest.
I read with a great deal of pleasure the
address of the right honourable leader of
the Opposition (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
in this debate. There is a clear demarcation
between the stand he takes and the stand
of the Government as expressed by the
honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King).
The proposal is to amend the British
North America Act. True, there have been
a number of amendments since 1867, but without exception they have been of a minor
character. For instance, one amendment increased the number of senators for Western
Canada from 16 to 24. Originally, at Confederation, there were three senatorial districts. each represented by 24 members. As
the Western Provinces came in or were
formed they were given four members each,
and in 1915 or the following year an amendment was obtained ta the British North
America Act to provide that each of the four
Western Provinces should have six senators.
Hon. MIr. HAlG

In other words, the West was then made to
form a senatorial district. That and the
other minor amendments to which I have
been referring were such that no province
would object to them.
But if I read correctly the British North
America Act and the history concerning it,
that Act was a contract or compact among
the four original provinces of the Union. I
am persuaded from reading history and from
meeting people of Lower Canada that the
Fathers of Confederation never would have
agreed to the British North America Act
if they had for one moment thought that an
important amendment could be made to it
simply on the petition of the Senate and
the House of Commons.
As respects the unity of our country, we
as senators have a duty to perform such as
I
seldom falls to the lot of legislators.
refer to our duty to represent and protect
minorities; not minorities in religion or
language, but minorities in population. Why
should the Maritime Provinces have 24 senators as against 26 members in the House of
Commons, Ontario 24 as against 82, Quebec
24 as against 65, and the Western Provinces
24 as against 71? Simply because it was intended that the different sections of the country should be equally represented here, regardless of population. The Maritimes and
the West have as many senators as have the
central provinces, with their comparatively
huge populations. I think we should take
very seriously our duty of guarding the
rights of the provinces. We should be very
careful ta make no move towards amending
our Constitution unless we are clear that it
will not have an injurious effect upon any
province.
Now. I am persuaded that there is not
a province in Canada which would agree to
the second clause of this resolution, although
I understand Saskatchewan has said it is in
favour of the proposed Dominion Loan
Council. What does this resolution say? It
simply says that we as a Dominion do not
trust the provinces; .that before we will back
one of their notes we want a lien on subsidies
coming to them. It further says that in each
case it is the consent not of the provincial
government but of the provincial legislature
If this amendment

requires the consent of the legislatures, why
is not the consent of every legislature in
I am convinced,
Canada signified to us?
honourable members, that the Legislature of
Manitoba, for instance. would never agree
It
to the second half of this resolution.
The Leader of the
said so last winter.

MAY 27, 1936
Opposition there challenged the Government
with this question: "Do you as a Government believe that this Loan Council proposal should be proceeded with?" And the
First Minister of that province said: "We
have never agreed to it. We have never
agreed to come under it." The Loan Council
provision of this resolution simply means
that the Dominion Government does not
believe in the promise of the provinces. The
Government says, in effect: "We are not
going to trust Manitoba, or Saskatchewan, or
Alberta, or British Columbia. Before we take
a note of a province we shall demand an
assignment of moneys coming to the province."
The other part of the resolution is very
much more serious. I cannot add anything
to the points made by the right honourable
leader of the Opposition (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) in his first speech on this resolution, and again last night. I am not able to
present those points half as well as he did.
But I want to emphasize that the business
people of this country are opposed to this
tax amendment. If we desired to help the
provinces it would be better to do what the
right honourable member suggested-to earmark a portion of our income taxes for the
purpose. I think that about $5,000,000 was
collected in incorne taxes from citizens of
Manitoba last year. The Dominion could
say to that province: "We shall earmark that
money for you to the extent of your unemployment relief, but when you no longer have
unemployment relief we shall keep all the
money." I understand that last year the
Dominion income tax produced a total revenue of approximately $77,000,000. If that
revenue were not sufficient to pay for al
unemployment relief of the country, the
Dominion Government would have to impose
further indirect taxes; but such taxes would
be on all the people of the Dominion.
I am a Westerner, but I was born in Ontario.
I say to the people of that province, and to
the people of Quebec, that, whether you like
it or not, you will never have much prosperity
unless the Prairie Provinces and the Maritime
Provinces are prosperous too. The difficulties
and problems of the West concern the East as
well. If you want the country to hold together you will have to play fair with the
Western Provinces. True, you have given us
$114,000,000 in the last six years, but we had
to have it or go down. The other day I sat
next to the Prime Minister of Manitoba at
a banquet. He said to me-I hope honourable senators will pardon the personal reference: " Haig. you are pretty lucky to be out
cf this political .turmoil. I can balance my

budget this year without providing for unemployment relief." Let us take the income
tax that we collect from Manitoba, for instance, and earmark it to be used in helping
that province out of the depression. If Manitoba does not corne back, if Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia do not come
back, Canada will not come back. And what
good would the bonds of Canada be if about
one-third of the whole country were unable
to make a recovery?
I believe that if the business people of
Canada understood the indirect taxation
provision of this resolution they would be
unanimously opposed to it, regardless of their
politics. And any person who makes a purchase, however small, will object to paying two
sales taxes. I do not know whether my
honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) has been home recently. If not,
he may be unaware of just what is going on
in his province. I saw some men from
that city and they told me: "There is a
regular racket in Alberta with regard to
the sales tax that the province is trying to
impose. It has caused more dissension and
more trouble than any other piece of legislation.' Is it not likely that Saskatchewan,
on one side, and Manitoba, on the other,
will pass retaliatory legislation if this resolution goes through? Already in the city of
Winnipeg there is a feeling of dissatisfaction
on account of the legislation to which the
honourable senator from Edmonton has
referred.
Now, honourable senators, I will not take
up any further time. I think the resolution
should be sent to a committee to which members of the publie may have access in order
to be heard. In my opinion the indirect taxation amendment ought to be rejected without our hearing any evidence upon it. If I
could do so I would vote right now against
that amendment. As to the provision respecting loans, why should not the Federal Government repose in the provinces the same trust
that it expects the world at large to repose
in them? Why should the Dominion insist
that before it guarantees a provincial loan it
must have security of a kind that the provinces are not required to give to other
creditors? Take the province of Alberta. It
owes to the public $160,000,000, in round
figures. If we passed this resolution and
Alberta wanted a federal guarantee for a
loan of $10,000,000, for instance, the Government could say: "We require in return for
our guarantee that you give us a lien on your
subsidy, or on your school lands, or on other
assets or moneys coming to you." Why should
not Alberta's creditors in general have the

W'itb the consent of tbe Sonate I sbould like
te refer te tbe statement of the bonourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Gries.bacb). He appears te concede that the Alberta Act is intra vires. I bave had ne
opportîinity te consider the measure, but I
tbink its validity is at least arguable. The

interprovincial trade. 1 do not think any
honourable member would contend that municipal authorities could impose a tax on certain
goods passing from one selected township or
county to another; and ini ry appreciation
of the law there is ne difference at ail between
that more or less local trade and the movement of goods from one province to another,
because for trade between provinces the
boundaries are obliterated; the provinces are
ail one. At least my contention will appear
plausible to semae pcrsons. I amn confident
it will be generally agreed that the Alberta
Act is mischievous, and that we should not
assume it to be intra vires when we are
considering this, resoltition. Certainly if we
are opposed to any such legisiation, then, for
that if for ne other reason, we should reject
tis resoluition.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I must refer te the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg South Centre (Hon.
Mr. Haig). I have for some littie time been
chairman of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. If he or any other honourable
senator tbinks it is an easy job te kecp tbings
running- smoothly in such a large committee,
with numerous witnesses and members in
attondance, I would suggo'st that a, doser
acquaintance %vith tbe w ork would quickly
dispel the illusion.
I must cal.l attention to this fact, that on one
occasion w'ben the bonourable gentleman wvas
present at a meeting- of the conimittee I
assured bim that every senator hiad a rigbt
te address it. So far as I am aware, ne
honourable member has been prevented from
expressing his views before any committee of
which I have been chairman. I am perfectly
Nwilling te accept the opinion of the Sonate as
te whether or net our cemmittees have been
conducted fairly.
I am sure that if my bonourable friend hadi
longer a member of this Huse, and had
bce
sat in the Banking and Commerce Committee
or in any of our other committees, lie would
realize the absolute ne-cessity of asking each
mnemiber :to speak jn ture. Without the
observ ance of sucb a rule we should get
nowliere and confusion would be wverse confotinded. No bonourable moimber has been
treated disceurteously. It has been my policy
te give everyene in turn an epportunity of
expressing- bis views, and te preteet him against
interruption. While I continue te preside over
tbe Banking and Commerce Committee I
shahl conduet its proceedings ie precisely the
samne way.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: I remember an
occasion when after attending ail the meetings of, I tbînlc, tbe Banking and Commerce

MAY 27, 1936
Committee and taking a very active part in
ail its proceedings, I finally voted on the
motion under discussion. If I ar n ot mistaken, my vote created a tie. Only then was
my attention call-ed to the fact that I was flot a
member of the committee, and therefore flot
entitled to vote. In my experience every
honourable senator bas always been privileged
to attend and take an active part in the proceedings of any cammittee of this House, and
to put questions to witnesses.
Now, addressing myseif to the resolution
under consideration at the moment, I intend
ta speak only for a very short timne, simply
because I ar n ot a member of the Committee
on Bankcing and Commerce and prohahly shall
not be able ta attend ail its meetings wbile it
is dealing with the resohition.
There is no question at ail that the problem
we must solve is a very seriaus and, ta some
extent, a very difficuit anc. I arn quite sure
that without further consideration we may
ail take it for granted that Canada, frorn
ocean ta ocean, is in a terrible condition
financially. There is fia use in wasting aur
time discussing that phase af the situation.
Several of aur provinces are next door ta
bankriaptcy--and it may be only a year or
twa hence when the Dominion itself will he
next door ta bankrupt-cy unless there is a
change in the econamic conditions of the
world.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That being the situation, there is fia question ais ta the need that
naw exists for making some arrangement
whereby the provinces rnay, at least, for the
tirne 'being, be helped out of the financial
hale in which they find tbemselves.
I think the cammittee ta wbich this resolution is to be referred should take the
greatest care not ta commit, the country ta
a permanent arrangement.
This situation
which confronts Canada and the world to-day
is not gaing ta last for ever. It rnay be aver,
or largely over, within a period af five years.
Yet it is propased to make an essential.
amendrnent ta aur Constitution for practically aIl time. That is wrang. I shauld very
much prefer the suggestian made by my right
honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
and by the bonourabie member frorn Winnipeg South Centre (Han. Mr. Haig) that same
ternporary arrangement be made ta dee.l witb
the situation. We ail realize the necessity of
the provinces having greater revenues. But
ta bring this about why at this time change
aur Constitution basically? Is there any real
necessity for doing sa?

359

I arn conv.inced this Hause wilI nat agree
ta the resalution as it stands. I wili neyer
vote for it in its present farrn, for twa reamons.
First, if the resalution beame effective it
would mean the Federal Government wauld
be handing over ta the provinces in perpetuity the power of indirect taxation.
Secondly, so far as I arn aware there is
no clear-cut, de4linite understanding that a
single province has agreed ta this resalution.
If there is such an understanding, where is it?
Have we had it ipresented ta us? Time and
again it bas been stated in this debate that
Canfederation is a pact, an agreement amang
the aid provinces, and, in a sense, virtually
assented ta by the new provinces. Under the
circumstances I daubt very much whether
the Senate will accept this resolution uniess
it is presented with the consent, in black and
white, of every province interested. I submit
that it wiil be the duty of the committee ta
summon representatives of the provinces and
ask týhem. "Where and wben did you give your
consent ta this measure?" It is ail very weii
to say that the Government of Canada discusscd the matter with -the various provincial
governments, and that it is understood those
governrnents gave their consent. It bas nat
been produced bef are us. I ask, Where is it?
We have not seen it. I say that this Senate
wili nat be doing its duty if it passes this
resolution without having bef are it clear evidence th-at the provinces of Canada want it.
This is flot a smaîl matter. We are nat
merely giving te the provinces some.tbing
tbey have had before. By this resolution, if
adapted and made inta law, we are giving the
provinces a treinendous power in the life of
this country frorn ocean ta acean. Will anyone tell me that the province, say, of Ontario, bas given its consent ta a change in
aur Constitution that will permit the province of Quebec te set up a barrier that wiil
prevent the implement dealers of Ontario
from seiiing their products in the province
of Quëbec, and vice versa? I doubt it. As
a matter of fact, on account of wbat bas
transpired in this House since this matter
firet carne before it, I arn of the view that
tihere ia not a province in Canada, and I
doubt very much if there is a governent in
Canada, that understands the passible effects
of the embodiment of this resolution in the
Constitution of this country. Sa I say that
when this matter is deait with by the cammittee ail phases of the question should be
carefully considered. If at all possible, the
assistance necessary to -the provinces of this
country ghould be given ta thern, but this
shauld be done on a temporary, not on a
permanent basis.

SENATE
In the next place the Senate, as was well
pointed out by the honourable senator frorn
Winnipeg Soutli Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig),
lias a special duty to perform in ail matters
of this kind. The Senate is constituted of
96 members, ýrepresenting flot provinces, but
districts, the representation 'being distributed
throughout the country in proportions different fromn those of the memliership of the,
House of Commons. One of our chief functions is to, see that unholy hands are flot laid
upon the Constitution of Canada,Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -that the riglits of
the provinces are maintained and are flot
damaged by any legisiative action which may
be taken by -the other House. So I say it
gliould lie the duty of the committee to see
that representatives of every province appear,
and to ascertain whetlier every province lias
given its assent to this resolution. If the
committec canno-t get evidence of tliat faet,
or if sucli evidence cannot 'le clearly placed
before tliis Hous.e, I tliink tliere is but one
action tliis body can take.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, I rise on this occasion, not for the
purpose of delivering an address, but to ask
a couple of questions. If tlie resolution now
before us is going to a committee, as the
honourable senator f romn Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) indicates, since I may not be a member of tlie committee, I should like to liave
some information so that my mmnd may be
clear witli respect to certain matters.
My flrst question relates te, section 121 of
tlie Britisli North America Act and tlie effeet
it would liave on tlie legisiation tlia,t is being
interpreted to-day as an interference with
trade between provinces. Section 121 practically provides for free trade between tlie
provinces. If tlie legisiation that lias been
passed in New Brunswvick and in Alberta
interferes witli free trade as provided for in
section 121, would tliis rcsoluîtion override
that section, or would tlie section still stand
in tlie way of those provinces putting up
liarriers in respect of trade?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. BUJCHANAN:
I arn aware of
what tlie lionourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Grieshacli) pointed out witli regard
to Alberta, but after listening to wliat tlie
riglit honourable tlie leader of tlie Opposition
(Riglit Hon. Mr. Meiglen) said last niglit in
respect of tlie bv-laws passed liy the cities
of Ottawa and Hull. I understand that if
there is no dliscrimination tlie legýisiation is
Bon.

Mr. CALDER

ail riglit. I doubt if there is actual discrimination under tlie legislation spoken of by
tlie honourable senator from Edmonton this
afternoon.
I iinderstand that tlie Government of Albierta is aiming to tax the goods
of tlie mail order bouses. 1 understand also
tliat it is imposing on goods sold in the business places of Alberta a sales tax similar to,
tliat imposed on goods brouglit in from outside. For example, if I were to send a mail
order to a firm in Toronto for a pair of
slioes, tlie sales tax would 'be imposed on
tliose slioes; but it would be no greater than
tlie sales tax imposed upon a pair of shoes
that 1 :miglit buy in tlie province of Alberta.
So in that respect .the legislation is not discniminating against outside business.
Tlie danger I see in tlie legislation is tliis.
Under it certain articles made in the province of Alberta miglit very readily be
exempted from tlie tax. altliougli articles
coming fromn outside would lie subject to it.
I liave in mind thle beet sugar industry in
Alberta.
In order to prevent competition
witli tliis industry beet sugar could be
exempted fromn taxation, while at tlie sanie
time a tax could be levied on sugar produced
from cane. Yet tliere would lie no discrimination.
There are some features of the legislation
introdiiccd in Alberta tliat give me a good
deal of concerfi. -I have been impressed with
wliat was said by tlie riglit honourable leader
of tlie Opposition. namely, tliat this legislation tends towards interference witli trade
between provinces. But if section 121 of the
British North America Act stili stands, I
cannot see how tliese barriers against trade
can lie raised. or why we- sliould lie concerned about the legislation passed in some
of tlie provinces.
Hon. CHARLES E. TANNER:
Honourabile members. I amn going to take but a
few moments of your time. I arn interested
in tliis matter fromn the point of view of Nova
Scotia, tlie province wliicli I, with otlier members. have tlie lionour of re.pregenting in this
House. That province is not in the precarinus state mentioned by tlie honourable member fromn Saltenats (Hon. Mr. Calder).
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Just now its credit
is good. and witli the assistance of the money
it i, receiving for relief purposes it is paying
its way. Nevertheless it lias a large debt.
and its taxation to-day is quite as lieavy as
the people of the province want it to lie.

MAY 27, 1936
During the past year I have been under
the impression that there was ta be friendly
conference between all the provinces and the
Dominion Government with respect to this
matter. It was pointed out ta us in Nova
Scotia that, because of the political affiliations
of the governments, there was certain to be
harmonious agreement, and that the Federal
Government and the provincial governments
would come to an effective understanding in
regard to all matters of common interest,
particularly in regard to amendments to the
British North America Act. We were given
to understand that there would be nothing
piecemeal about what would be donc. It
might take time, but we were willing to
wait. We realized that everything could not
be accomplished within twelve months. We
understood that the British North America
Act would be dealt with in a businesslike
way, and that all matters requiring amendment would be covered. As that understanding was gathered from the public addressee
of leaders and supporters of the present Government, I am surprised to find that we are
called upon to deal with this little bit. There
is no official record of the debates of the
Nova Scotia Legislature, but I have endeavoured to follow, through the newspapers,
what took place in this connection in the
session of this year. It is my recollection
that after certain conferences were held in
Ottawa with the Attorney-General and others,
the Nova Scotia Legislature was given ta
understand that nothing would be done this
year; that the whole matter was ta be postponed on account of difficulties which naturally arose. I venture ta say it was the understanding throughout Nova Scotia that this
matter of amending the British North America Act would be postponed until there was
opportunity for more exhaustive discussion
and consideration by the provincial governments and the Dominion Government. But
now we are being asked ta deal with this bit
of the subject.
I want ta ask my honourable friend the
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) ta tell us if he can, when he closes
this debate, for I am interested in knowing,
whether or not the Government of Nova
Scotia has invited the Dominion Government
ta provide this legislation in order ta give
the Government of Nova Scotia and the other
provincial governments power ta impose indirect taxation. I should like ta know that,
because I am slow ta believe that the Nova
Scotia Government would now openly ask
for more power ta impose taxation. If it
has donc that, I am very sure the people of

Nova Scotia will be very much surprised ta
learn of it.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: And will deal with
it accordingly.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: While it may be said
that the provincial governments and provincial legislatures represent their respective
provinces, I accept that statement with
reservations.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: One of the fundamental duties of the Senate is ta protect the
interests of the provinces. In my judgment
the Senate would not be discharging that
duty by simply taking the word of a provincial government or even the ipse dixit of
a provincial legislature. I submit that it is
the duty of the Senate ta look beyond those
gentlemen. They may be right or they may
be wrong. We may be right or we may be
wrong. However, I am of the opinion that
we are here not as the mouthpieces of legislatures or provincial governments, but as the
mouthpieces of the people of the provinces,
and that it is our duty, therefore, to' protect
them if we think it necessary to do so.
I have no hesitation in saying that if a
vote were ta be taken in Nova Scotia on this
question to-day there would be an overwhelming majority against any proposal ta endow
the Government of that province with power
ta impose indirect taxation.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is no question about it. As a matter of fact, the only
reason it is in power is that it obtained
a few thousand more votes in the province
than its opponents did.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is sufficient.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Although that province is represented in another place by a
solid contingent of supporters of the Government of the day, those representatives received only six thousand votes more than
their opponents in the election last year.
And even though the twelve Nova Scotia
members of another place are of the same
political party as is the present provincial
Administration, I do not feel that they represent the opinions of all the people in the
province.
I should like my honourable friend ta be
explicit and tell us whether or not the Government of Nova Scotia is supporting this
resolution. As I was saying a few moments

SENATE
ago, there was no indication in the Legislature of such support. In fact I think it is
safe to say that this matter was never mentioned there in the ,ast session. Consequently
I feel that so far as Nova Scotia is concerned
we have no right to take this proposed step
unless we can be satisfied that the people
of the province want us to take it. One thing
they do desire is that there be no further
increase in the public debt and that taxation
be reduced.
Throughout the election campaign of 1935
the people of Nova Scotia were repeatedly
and emphatically assured that taxes would
be decreased. That assurance is a matter of
public record. It was stated on the platform
and in the press over and over again. Believing as I do that the people of the province
took that promise in good faith, I could not
support a proposal, like the one now before
us, to empower the Government to add indirect taxation to direct taxation.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I shall not travel over the whole
ground that has been covered by honourable
members who have spoken before me, because
I intend to address' myself more especially
and as directly as possible to the resolution
itself. I shall try to the best of my humble
capacity to justify the presenting of the resolution to this Chamber.
What was the situation confronting the
Government when it came into office in the
latter part of October last? I shall not dwell
upon the seriousness of the financial position
of the provinces at that time. It is enough
to repeat what I have just heard from across
this Chamber, that several of the provinces
were in dire straits. I would also repeat
what I said when introducing this resolution
in the Senate, that during the last five years
some $115,000,000 was advanced to the Western Provinces.
Now, what is the purpose of this Address?
It is to provide a means of meeting the needs
of those provinces which clearly cannot balance their budgets, of preventing them from
defaulting, and-this being uppermost in the
minds of the federal representatives--of maintaining Canada's credit. I think we are all
eager to do our utmost to protect that credit.
One province bas already defaulted; other
provinces may do the same thing. My bonourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) even mentioned the possibility that
the Dominion Parliament may face a very
difficult situation within twenty-four months.
I have confidence that the Dominion as a
whole can stand the strain. But what would
happen if two, three or four provinces defaulted? That was the main consideration
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

which induced the Government to present
this resolution.
I believe that all Canada applauded-I am
quite sure that my right honourable friend
opposite did-wheu the Minister of Finance
declared it was time to call a halt te the
inroads that were being made by certain provinces upon the federal treasury. The Minister
said that if the Dominion was to become the
guarantor of future loans to the provinces it
would exact security, and also find some
method of ensuring that future borrowings
should be within the capacity of the provinces
to pay. That principle, I believe, bas been
acclaimed by the whole country, and I venture
to say that no honourable member of this
Chamber would raise his voice against it. In
the past the criterion bas been the ability of
the provinces te borrow; henceforth it must
be their ability to pay. All the provinces
are interested in the application of that principle, which no one can deny is fair.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg South
Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) says the Dominion
will not trust the provinces. It will trust the
provinces that trust themselves by making an
effort to maintain their credit. The purpose
of the proposed legislation is the establishment
of an equilibrium in the finances of the provinces through an enlargement of their right of
taxation. That is the sole raison d'être of this
resolution.
What are the objections? My right honourable friend opposite bas asked if the provinces
have given their concurrence; and he says that
if thev have it should be so stated in the
Address. The honourable gentleman from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) bas made the
same point. It is stated that it would be
dangerous te establish the precedent of requesting the British Parliament to amend our
Constitution on the sole authority of an
Address from the Senate and House of Commons. My right honourable friend asked what
protection theré would be for provincial rights
and minority rights in future.
My answer is that this Address would be no
more binding than preceding resolutions which
we have adopted and in response to which the
British North America Act bas been amended
a number of times. My right honourable
friend mentioned some amendments of miner
importance. He failed, though, to refer to a
very important one that was made as the result
of an Address passed when the Government
of which he was a member was in power.
That Address did net contain any signification
of concurrence by the provinces, nor was it
preceded by resolutions from the provincial
legislatures or governments.
My right honourable friend did not mention the British North America Act of 1907.

MAY 27, 1936
That was 7 Edward VII, Chapter 11, "an Act
to make further provision with respect to
the sums to be paid by Canada to the several
provinces of the Dominion," and it wa>s passed
because of an Address that we made to the
Imperial Parliament. That Address, whieh
was considered in this Oha.mber, haed for its
object an alteration in the amount of the
yearly grants to the various provinces. It
requested legisiation providing that future
siibsidies be ibased upon the latest decennial
census instead of upon the census of 1861 as
.provided for in the Constitution. Ail the
grants were increased, and not ail exclusively
in proportion to population. The Address in
that case did not contain a word as to assent
by the provinces or their governrnents. Upon
looking at that Address I recalled that 1
myseif had signed it as Speaker of the Senate,
together with the Hon. Mr. Su~therland. With
respect to that very important amendment,
touching the very basis of the financial
arrangement between the Dominion and the
provinces, it could not have been said tbhat
the provinces were unanimous, for British
Columbia dissented.
And now I corne to an amendmient that was
made in 1915, when I think my right honourable friend was a member of the Government
of the day. That increased the number of
senators for the West to 24, and declared
that notwi.thstanding anything in the British
North America Act a province should always
be entitled to a number of inembers in the
House of Coinmons not less than the number
of senators representing such province. This
again touched one of the vital points in the
agreement between the Dominion and the
provinces, as to -representation in the House
of Commons. We ail know what the original
terms were as to number of representatives,
Quebec being given a permanent representatien of 65 members. Not only was that
arnendment based upon an Address which contained no allusion ta consent of the provincial governments, stili less of the legislatures, but I arn informed that there had
nlot even been a conference of the provinces
nor any suggestion that they should assent
Honourable senators
to the amendment.
will remember that that was the amendment
which ensured that Prince Edward Island
should have no 'fewer than four members in
the Commons. It is true that the number
of representatives directly affected was not
large, but ail the provinces were concerned in
a precedent which could be used in later
years.
My honourable and talented friend from.
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) referred to a
meeting of provincial prime ministers held in

Ottawa in April, 1931. To that meeting,
which was called by the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett, the following question was submitted:
Do the provinces desire to have exemption
from the Colonial Laws Validity Act extend
to provincial laws?
Exemption would mean that hereafter they
could legislate within the sphere of their
jurisdiction, whether or nlot their legisiation
was repugnant to Imperial legisiation. They
agreed that they did desire exemption, and
the Statute of Westminster was extended
accordingly. The Right Hon. Mr. Bennett
did nlot ask the provincial representatives to
consuit their legisiatures; hie was satisfied with
the assent of the governments. When the
conference ended the following communique
was issued:
The conference was calIed to give the provinces an opportunity to express their views
with regard to the Statute of Westminster
and the proposed section, numbered 7, which
wjll be inserted to deal exclusively with the
Canadian position. No objection was made te
the principle of the proposed le slation, and
a proposai that the provisions ofithe Statute
relating to the repeal of the Colonial Laws
Validity Act shou]d extend to the provinces
was approved. The Canadian section (7) was
drafted and found satisfactory by ahl the provinces, though Quebec asked for further time
for consideration. Meanwhile, the approval of
the Quebec Government has been received.
That was as late as 1931. The Government
of the day felt that on a inatter affectîng al
the provinces the provincial governments
could speak for their legislatures.
As it will be seen, the Act of 1907, wbich
altered the whole framework of our financial
relations with the provinces, was based on a
conference hetween the premiers of the vanious provinces, supported by some of their
colleagues, and the Prime Minister of the day,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. No question was raised
that the legisiatures had not been consulted.
No one asserted that there should be unanimity among the provinces. As a matter of fact,
there was not. The legislation was based upon
the assent of that conference. No one, either
in -tbe House of Commons or in this Chamber,
contended that the legisiatures should be
heard in the matter.
To-day, likewise, a conference has been held.
I submit that the provincial governments
represent their legislatures in matters which
do not invade their nights and privileges. Can
we question the authority of the duly
accredited representatives of a province? I
have been asked, "What evidence is there that
the legisiatures were consulted?" My honourable friend from Parry Sound (Hon. Mr.
Arthurs) said yesterday thatthere was nothing
in the agenda of the Dominion-Provincial

364

SENATE

Conference of 1935 with respect to the resolution. Section 6 of the agenda covered financial questions. A sub-conference was appointed
to deal with this section. Hon. Mr. Dunning
and some of bis coileagues represented the
Dominion; Ontario had six representatives,
Quebec one, Nova Scotia three, New Brunswick three. British Columbia six, Prince
Edward Island t.wo, Saskatchewan two, Alberta
three, and Manitoba three. Those gentlemen
explored the wbole field of taxation. Suýbsequently Hon. Mr. Dunning invited the provincial treasurers to attend a further conference. This was precedent to the bringing
down of the resolution. So I submit I amn
justifled in saying that since that group of
representatives agreed to the text of this
Address, which was revised and a.pprovedi in
its very terms by the Attorney-General of each
province. no one in this Chamber can ask,
"What evidence have we that the representatives of the provinces have given their
approval of the resolution?"
Hon. Mr. CALDER: WiIl the honourable
gentleman allow me to interject .lust one
word? This is the first time I have heard it
stated that the actual text of the resolution
was referred to ail the provincial governments
and reviewed and approved by their attorneysgeneral.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAýND:

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I mean,

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I was in this building
during- the sub-conference. I met the Deputy
Attorney-General and, I tbink, the AttorneyGeneral of Nova Scotia while they were
labouring in the committee room on the second
or third floor. I am sure my recollection was
not at fault when I said that afterwards in the
Legislature of Nova Scotia, the Premier
announced the inatter would flot be proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I tbink my
recollection may be as gond as my bonourable
friend's. I read the reports coming from
Halifax, but they bore on the question of a
revision of the Constitution, involving transference of the power from Westminster to
Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The communications from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
were to the effeet stated by my honourable
friend. But as to this resolution, I neyer
beard any statemcnt to disprove Lthat the
provinces bad assentcd to the text.
lion. Mr. TANNER: I ar n ot at ail
questioning the statement, of my bonourable
friend the leader of tbe Huse. I arn very
glad to know that, as be understands, the
Government of Nova Scotia lias given its
approval of this resolution.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, I am
aware that in Nova Scotia, as well as in the
otiier provinces, there are many people fearful
of taxation; but it is not for them to decide
where, in matters of taxation, the dividing line
shall be drawn between the provincial and the
federal authority.
It bas been suggested that the provinces
sbould give unanimous consent to any amendment of the British North America Act. 1
arn not prepared to endorse such a principle.
It would create a precedent with respect to
matters of minor importance. These might
well be submitted to this Chamber witb tbe
consent not of ail the representatives of the
provinces, but of the majority, and it would
then ho for this Chamber to decide wbetber
the position of the majority wns justified. I
bave frequently beard it stated that in
matters of fundamental importance we are
agreed thiat Parliament should ask the unanimous consent not only of the provincial
governments, but of their legisiatures. I
adhere to the principle that Parliarnent should
not require unanimous concurrence except in
such cases. I think we may ail afflrmn the
principle that in aIl matters affecting the

MAY 27, 1936
privileges or rights of the provinces we should
be slow to enact or propose any legislation
which did not carry their assent.
It is often asserted that one of the principal functions of the Senate is to protect the
rights of the provinces as embodied in the
British North America Act. In this case I
have declared that all the provinces have
joined in the Address which is before us.
Thereupon, I suppose, it should receive the
assent of the Senate. However, for important
reasons the Senate might differ, notwithstanding that the provinces had agreed to certain
amendments. I recognize the Senate is fully
entitled to deal with this matter as it may
deem fit.
I think I have now disposed of the objections
with respect to the form of procedure to be
followed in the presentation of this Address.
As I have pointed out, it is the form of procedure which we have followed without exception in dealing with some amendments of
very great importance.
As to the matter and substance of this resolution, let me deal with the provision for the
Dominion guarantee of provincial debts. The
first objection of my right honourable friend
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), and, I
think, also of my honourable friend from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté), and perhaps of
other honourable members, is that this provision is unnecessary, as the Dominion has the
power to guarantee provincial debts and the
provinces have the power to pledge their
assets. My honourable friend from Ottawa
East has added that in his opinion this proposed legislation should not imply that the
right now asked for has not always existed;
therefore the power should be in declatory
form rather than as it appears in the text
of the resolution. True, the Dominion can
guarantee a debt. It has often done so in
respect of railways and other undertakings.
Yet the law officers of the Crown have said it
is doubtful whether the Dominion has the
power to guarantee a provincial debt as such.
I admit the Dominion Government bas done
so lately, but only as an emergency measure.
Certainly it bas been a doubtful expedient.
I question whether the Dominion has power to
tax, borrow or guarantee except for Dominion
would be imprudent and
purposes. It
dangerous to embark upon a program involving Dominion guarantee of tens of
millions of dollars of provincial loans without
this legislation, which, I submit, should be
in a positive rather than a declaratory form.
As to the right of the ,provinces to pledge
their assets, I believe there is still more
reason for obtaining legislative authority in
positive form. The British North America
Act does not authorize the provinces to

365

pledge their assets or their subsidies. A
province is governed by its legislature, which
is not a subordinate body with delegated
powers and capacity to bind successors. An
inherent power to pledge cannot be implied.
The law officers of the Crown have expressed
the opinion that without this proposed
amendment of the Constitution, if a legislature repudiated its pledge the province could
succeed in an action to enforce payment of
its constitutional indemnity.
I come now to the first part of the Address,
the proposed amendment to section 92. My
right honourable friend opposite said this
amendment would enable the provinces to
establish provincial tariff barriers, and he cited
subsection 1 of section 10A of the recent
amendment to the New Brunswick Corporation
Tax Act. With all due respect to my right
honourable friend, it seems to me that he read
this enactment too hurriedly. I will read itRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know it
pretty well.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is subsection 1 of section 10A:
Every company or corporation, the majority
of whose stock issued and outstanding is owned
or held, either directly or indirectly, by companies, corporations, or persons incorporated
or resident without the province, having an
established place or places of business within
the province, and every partnership, firm,
association or person carrying on an established business within the province as a branch
or part of or in connection with an established business carried on without the province
and engaging in the sale of goods, chattels,
wares or merchandise within the province
direct to the consumer, shall pay a tax upon
the amount of its or his gross sales by retail
of goods, chattels, wares or merehandise to be
delivered within the province; provided that
this subsection shall not apply to any company,
corporation, partnership, firm, association or
person whose principal business or occupation
within the province is that of the production
of natural produets or of manufacturing or
both.
I submit that this section does not come
within the provisions of the proposed amendment, because it does not authorize an indirect tax. My right honourable friend has
not noticed subsection 4 of this Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I noticed it
all right.

On account

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. My right
honourable friend's contention is based upon
what I believe to be a misunderstanding of
this legislation, if I may make bold to say so.
He says it is discriminatory. Yes, it is. But
discriminatory against whom? Against outside
traders, such as Eaton's, Simpson's, Dominion
and other chain stores, and in favour of local
traders. There is nothing in the British North
America Act nor in our constitutional law
which prohibits such discrimination. One case
which I have glanced at is based on The
King vs. Marchioness of Donegal, Dominion
Law Reports, 1924, Vol. II, page 1911.
Did the
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
honourable gentleman say page 1911?
I am in error.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is not 1911. but 1191. I simply cite the
judgment, which states that:
A taxation statute is not discriminatory
because it divides taxpayers into classes and
nakes some classes pay a heavier tax than
others.
There are other judgments to the same effect.
There is nothing in this legislation which
has any relation to the import or export of
goods. An outside concern pays a sales tax
upon goods sold in New Brunswick, whether
they are produced within or without the
province. My right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) was under the misapprehension, arising from a summary reading of

Hon. Mr. D'ANDURAND: An inside concern, whether its goods are produced in New

this Act. The proviso excepts concerns whose

products for manufacturing.

The proposed amendment appears to have
no relevancy to the validity of this New
Brunswick legislation. It relates only to the
one point-whether the legislation is invalid
by reason of its imposing indirect taxation.
It would not in any sense validate legislation
which, on a true interpretation, sought to
impose a special tax upon sales of goods
coming from other provinces. This is my
answer to my right honourable friend. Such
discrimination would be ultra vires, and would
contravene section 121 of the British North
America Act.
My right honourable friend suggested that
the province could not prevent goods from
outside being freely admitted, but that once
the goods were admitted the province could
subject them to a sales tax which would not
be applicable to similar goods produced within the province. Such a tax, in my opinion,
would still contravene section 121 of the
British North America Act, because, while
the province would appear to admit the goods
freely, it would penalize them once they were

MAY 27, 1936
inside. Courts have invariably rnjected this
subterfuge and have declared such legisiation
invalid; and any such taxing statute would
be declared ultra vires.
In conclusion I desire ta say that the conference which examined and explored the
whole field of taxation came ta the conclusion
that the extension, of the right of the provinces
ta lcvy taxation should be made in the field of
sales .tax. Many of the provinces were already
imposing taxes on retail sales. This wvas donc
in Montreal, through a power delegated ta
the city, which levied a couple of millions of
dollars last year. Now, what has the conforence donc? It has taken cognizance of
the fa.ct that the provinces had invaded the
field and had found a way of reaching retail
sales and making the retailer the agent of
the government. The Federal Govemment
has de-cided that, sincei the provinces had
invaded that field and were somewhat solidly
entrenchod in it, authority should be given ta
them ta impose indirectly the taxation which
they were lcvying directly.
The Senate may express a preference for
another system of taxation, as has been done
by my rîght honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighcn), my honourable friend fýrom
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) and, I think, niy
honourable fricnd from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien); 'but the initiation of an alternative policy does flot belong ta this Cham-ber.
The !primary rcsponsibility for widening the
field af taxation within the provinces rests
with the Dominion Government after consultation with the provinces. So, although we
xnay have a preference for some other method
of taxation, although we may think we are
nat settling the matter in a very satisfactory
way, such as simpl'ifying the systema by asking the Federal Goverument to withdraw from
the income tax field, we are faced with the
situation that the Government of the day bas
deemcd it proper to accede ta -the suggestion
of the provinces, extend their powcrs and help
them maintain their equilibrium by an indirect tax on sales.
Although it is nat according to tradition, I
have no objection ta this resolution being
submitted ta the Banking and Commerce
Committee in order that the committee may
explore the situation and sec whether the
formidable danger with which we have been
thrcatcned-thc destruction of Confederation
-has any basis in fact. Naturally representations will ho made by traders, mianufacturers and chambers of commerce. I have
receivcd dozens of telegrams froma individuals
and organizations asking ta be heard. I would
draw the attention of honourable memnbers to
the fact that it is only natural that those who

367

fear they mnay bo reached *by sanie new
method of taxation under a new authority
shoul-d be fearful af the dlual power ai the Dominion and the provinces ta raise revenue by
moans af a sales tax. But already they are
being threatened, and -more than threatened,
by the incame tax, which is being levicd by
the Federal Government and also by the
provinces and municîpalities. I quite realize
that the ropresentations made will be thase
aof peaple who shartly will be callcd upon
ta pay taxation under a systeni which is dufferont from that ta whîch they are accustomod; but I can hardly believe that the
final word with regard ta the division ai the
right ta tax, as between the provinces and
the Dominion, should test with the parties
who stand ta pay the tax. Thero is a higher
duty pertaining ta the legislatures, fedoral
and provincial, than that of applying theniselves ta a fair division ai power. Although
wc tnay hear with respect the representations
made, and benefit by them, I would draw the
attention of honourable members to the fact
that this is a matter af higher concern than
the right af the individual, in that it affects
the whole financial fabrie of Canada and the
provinces,-a mattor which in the last analysis
romains with us.
I had thought of suggesting that the provincial governments be heard before the
Banking and Commerce Committee, but I dismissed the thought immediately, because such
a procedure would seem to reflect on the
word af the Dominion and provincial gaverfiments alike, who have given their assent ta
this legîslation. 1 have heard the statement
that they should be asked ta give their views.
To t-hat proposaI I have no objection. They
may express their views and explain their
needs and what they conceive ta be a fair
application af this legislation.
I have covered the ground somewhat extensively, perhaps at too great length, because
I foit that if- the matter which 'had been discussed hefore us were ta go to the Banking
and Commerce Committee it was due ta the
Government that its views under the twa
heads of the present Address should bo laid
before this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
may I take just anc minute ta make an
explanation? I would nover have made the
statement I made thîs afternoon, that the
cammittee should sec that the consent of
the provinces had been given, if I had known
that the text af this resolution had been

and had received the appraval af those gavernments and ai the attorncys-general ai the

provinces. I regret that the debate should
have reached this late stage before that fact
was made known to us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To put myself in order, bonourable members, 1 shall
have to move the adjournment of the Sonate.
I shall not delay the House.
I apologize for rising for the third time to
discuss this topic. I do so because I have
been criticized for not revealing important
sections of the statute wbich I specialiy referred to as vindicating to the full my fears
of what would happen if this resolution were
to pass.
The honourable the leader of the Government is aiw'ays poioted. clear and forceful, and
I think I can pretty well say be is always
reasonaýble when he is speaking freely from
-the resources of bis own mind and is flot
re,,trained by some rather superfinous ineuirandum sucb as officiais persist in .putting into
bis hands. His address up to the time be
reacbed the memoranduim w-as exceedingly

really the wbole question at issue here , on
wvbich lie did not, consider the sibtlety of
bis own mind sufficient, lie appealcd to others
for help. 1 think lie would hav e made a better
success of it himself.
He suggests to the House that the proposed
resolution does flot ratify, nor do anything at
ail ýto affect, this New Brunswick statute, because, lie says. tbe statute docs not involve
indirect taxation. To prove bhis statement lie
refers to subsection 4 of the perilous section 7,
wbicb subsection declares tînt the tax imposed
on tbe sale of certain se]ected goods shall fot
be passed on to tbe customer. I may say
fr.ankly I did not mention this, altbougb I
had intended to do so. I felt my omission
very keenly after I sat down, because notbing
s0 stamps this legisiation as an indirect tax
measure as this very clause. This subsection
is like the declaration of a man return-ing

be as legal at 25 per cent as at 2 per cent.
Let lis assume it wili be 10 per cent. It is
argued that because of the declaration that
the tax is flot to be passed on, under the
decision of the Privy Council it is flot an
indirect tax. The argument is so fallacious
from every standpoint tbat 1 hardly know
bow to approacb to explode it. How can
the tax be levicd if it is flot passed on? I
doubt tbe whoie profit on turnover wouid be
1 per cent. How cou]d a concern pay 10 per
cent out of 1 per cent? How could it pay
2 per cent? I venture ýto say tbat if a concern doing business in New Brunswick makes
1 per cent net on turnover it is doing very
well; yet bere is tbe Legislature saying: "You
are making 1 per cent net; in competition you
cannot make more; but we are going to tax
you 2 per cent and deny you tbe right to
add tbe tax to the price of your goods." The
provision is preposterous to start witb.
Next, it is intended to get around the
Privy Council's decision-which adopted the
doctrine of John Stuart Miii. tint if the
nature of the tax is such that it is expectcd
to ha passed on it is indirect-by saying:
'We neyer intended this to be passed on;
in fact we forbade it." The Privy Counicil, as
always, wiil mix a little common sense with
law and will sqy: "No matter what you state
in your Act, you did intend the tax to be
passed on. Nothing else in tbe world could
be possible."
Next. how are the law officers ever going
to know wbether tbe tax is passed on or not?
How could tiîey ever conviet anybody of
passing it on if hae did pass it on? If the
honourabie leader wiii think over it for one
second be will realize that such a person never
could ba convicted. Suppose the price of a

is 50 obvinus that any court in tha world
wouid say, "This is notbing but the most
manifest of subterfuges." Certainly the tax,ation is indirect, and it would ba ratified by
this Address.
The bonourable senator says there is nothing
in our Constitution to prevent a province from
discriminating in its taxas. In a sense that
is truc. But the general provision of the
Constitution forbidding a province to tax
îndirectlv bas the effeet of prcvanting discrimination. I do not douht that the province

MAY 27, 1936
of New Brunswick could say that anyone
purchasing a necktie at the store of a company, the majority of whose stock is held
outside the province, must pay a tax of two
cents or five cents, as the case might be, on
the necktie. But the legislation would be
impracticable; it could not be enforced. So
long as provinces have the power to tax
directly only, it is practically impossible for
them to discriminate, and that is why in the
wisdom of the Fathers of Confederation the
power of direct tax alone was vested in the
provinces. Give them the right to tax indirectly and they will find it very easy to
discriminate. If this resolution passes, it will
be impossible to attack their discrimination.
The honourable senator says that if they
tax indirectly and thereby restrict or prevent
the importation of goods they will be resisting by subterfuge the application of section
121, and their legislation will be declared
invalid. He is right. But that is not the
way they would go about it. They would
come in under this legislation which we are
asking, and so tax sales as to place inhibitions
upon the free interplay of interprovincial
trade. Of course all sales of goods brought
in would not be taxed. The residents of New
Brunswick, for instance, would be in a preferred position as compared with unannointed
outsiders elsewhere in Canada. The province
could permit its residents to bring in goods
and sell them exempt from the tax, and it
would be claimed that imports were not
prohibited. But there would be interference
with that free exchange of goods which is one
of the fundamental principles of Confederation.
Surely the leader of the Government is not
going to take a leading part in invading the
very citadel of Confederation. If we enable
the provinces to tax sales, I care not by what
method they do it, they will be able to
discriminate in their taxation at will. There
is nothing in the Constitution to prevent their
doing so. What the leader of the Government
says in that respect is right.
Here are we, the special guardians of the
relations of provinces with the Dominion,
being asked to put the seal of our approval
upon legislation which would be a challenge
to the very existence of our country. I appeal
to the honourable senator to think over the
matter and take it up with his colleagues. We
can easily surrender some of the field we now
have. Suppose, for example, we say that we
will divide income taxes fifty-4ifty with any
province which does not impose an income
tax. We could impose such rates as are
necessary to bring in the revenue required,
and make an equal division with the provinces either on the basis of income tax paid

369

by citizens of the respective provinces or on
the basis of population-I am not prepared
to say which would be the fairer or the more
practicable. We could get legislation enabling
the Government to make an arrangement of
that kind, effective for any period of years
desired. If that were done, there would be
brought into the provincial treasuries whatever
amount the Dominion desires to turn over to
them, and in addition all the confusion of
duplication would be avoided. The Dominion
would be free to increase indirect taxes and
add to its revenue in that way, and in the
application of such taxes there would be no
discrimination whatever as between one province and another, and no bolts and chains
fastened on interprovincial trade.
Rather than vote against this resolution
myself, I should much prefer that the honourable member would take it back to his colleagues and consider with them the real essence of what would be accomplished by the
resolution. Let the Government amend the
resolution by leaving out the first part and
bringing the latter part into conformity with
what evidently is intended. Let the attorneysgeneral be communicated with again and their
approval of the amended resolution be obtained. If the honourable senator were to
bring in such an amended resolution he would
have my support. Surely he ought to abandon
the ill and hastily conceived and perilous
resolution which is before us now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This resolution,
which is the result of an agreement between
the provinces and the Dominion, will go to
the Banking and Commerce Committee.
There we shall meet the provincial representatives and hear from them why they desire
the kind of legislation asked for, and how
they intend to apply it. Of course I recognize
that intent does not form part of an Act;
so we shall have to look into the taxation
feature of the proposed amendment. It will
be for the committee to find out what is the
true desire of the provinces, for I am just
now but their mouthpiece. I speak in support
of an agreement arrived at between the provinces and the Federal Government, and arm
precluded from suggesting any amendment tu
that agreement.

One consequence of that system of permits
granted at the instance of influential persons,

charitable arganizations, is ta increase our
population and sa add to the complexity of
our economic situation. So you see that
our law gives or may give rise to abuses, to
the detriment of the welf are of the whole
nation.
Speaking in the other House on May 7,
a member said:
But it is rumoured, as may be seen by
articles in a number of Canadian newspapers,
that people from other countries cross over to
England, become naturalized, and then enter
Canada. 1 do not wish to astracize any race.
All are entitled to a place on this earth. But
each nation is also, entitled to, choose its new
citizens. Let those who are obliged ta resort
to subterfuges to, enter Canada remain in their
own country. We wish to ascertain where we
are at and know somnething about those wbo
wjsh ta settle here.
I commend those vigorous words.
I was strongly impressed by the speech of
the honourable senator for Rigaud. I repeat
the words of the honourable gentleman:
"Canada was too indifferent to hier sons going
away."
Our primary duty is to look after our own
people and to help themn find ways of living
a normal life. In town and country we have
about 200,000 young people ready to set up
on their own account, and condemned to
inaction. Our pressing duty is to exert Ourselves in order to keep them with us, before
seeking immigrants abroad.
Let us make it easier for the sons of the
land ta settle on public lands. Let us apply
to the betterment of their situation the sums
that a flow of foreign immigration would of
necessity cost the country. Nobody with a
beart in lis breast can leave our youths ta
struggle alone. They rightly ask for their
share of the national heritage. It is nat only
a question of sympathy and affection. We
bave ta acknowledge the rights of the young
people and provide them with social legisiation
adapted ta their needs, and give them reasan
to expect that they can prosper in the land
of aur ancestars. Let us hope that the wise
counsels of thaose wbo devote theinselves
entirely ta the solution of the problem of
effective colonization may be heard and given

effect to. Then youth will see the rigbt and
even way ta foliow.
The commendable effort at coloaiization
must be continued and strengthened. Nothing but a strong and joint endeavour can
prevent the exadus of our people ta the
United States. The task is not an eaqy one,
but it is not beyond human power. On many
farms, throughout the country, can. be found
fs.milies with several boys stil at home. It
is obvious that, failing industries and suitable farms ta provide them with employment,
we shail lose that human capital, ta, the benefit
of aur neighbou.rs.
This is no time for the Federal Government ta favour an active immigration policy,
the only result of wbich would be to increase
the number of unemployed in cities and
towns. As long as the depression persists it
would be unwise, at least, ta let fareigners
came in. Shaîl we, by favouring immigration,
make still worse a situation already tao
deplorable, and which thma su-eh financial
burdens upon public authorities? That would
undoubtedly work against aur own interest,
adding ta aur troubles, without any ad-vantage
even ta the immigrants themselves.
Let us be careful not to. endanger the
ecanomie improvement we have naticed these
last montbs. Let us first deal with the pressing
problems; let us set Canada back on bier
way, let us rid ourselves of unemployment,
and then we may favour immigration, taking
great care ta choose the new-camers from
arnong the best, so that they may be trufr

campaign which finds favour with the mast
diversified interests. Special interests, racial
interests, people with wrong or defective
views, combine in support of a policy which,
on the whole, turned out ta be sucb a failure
in the past. It is incumbent on those who,
like myself, want a settlement policy in accordance with the best interests af the country, its permanent and far-reaching interests,
ta arganize and watch, lest they find themselves again overcome.
At the present time immigration has reaohed
the lowest figures sinoe Confederation. In
recent years the emigratian of aur own people
bas been practically nil. We have closed the

been steadily deported. The country's future

swelling flow of a foreigo population, unassimilable, undesirable, and foreign to our
national life, or else the Canadian spirit will
keeep on prevailing and ruling throughout the
country, provided we hold to a policy of
sound, selective, rational and effectively controlled immigration. According to the motion
of the honouraible senator for Rigaud, repatriation of Canadians sh*ould corne first.
In 1931, the Department of Immigration
closed ail its information offices in the United
States. What was the result? On April 2
the Government stated that from March 31,
1930, to March 1, 1936, 11,553 French-speaking people had entered Canada from the
Umnited States.
Under the circumstances, it seems to me
opportune to caîl the attention of honourable
senators to the problem of repatriation.

have established a system of parishes and
national societies, the Franco-Americans are
attached to the soil of the Republic. and
aIl these ties create obstacles to their repatriation.
Besides, I may say without fear of contradiction that mass repatriation of Canadians
from the, United States is Utopian. But I
know large numbers of them would like to
return to Canada.
When economnic conditions permit our resuming an efficient immigration campaign. we
can adopt the necessary methods to favour
repatriation, and it will be easy to find thousands upon thousands of these admirable settlers
who wish to return to Canada.
While busy laying foundations of a nation,
and especially incorporating within our indigenous group masses of foreign populations,
we must use the greatcst caution sO as to
make sure of ohtaining the best elements,
from a moral as wcll as frnm a phvsical or
an intellectual standpoint. To meach that goal
it will he necessary to practiso the strictest
selection.
We must close the doors of our young and
enterprising country to immigrants of unknown
antecedents. Anyone desiring to enter here
should hring a certificate establishing that lie
l'as not been guilty of crimes impl ' ing moral
turpitude. Such certificate might be granted
by a court clerk, a reputed magistrate or a
clergyman.
Qualîty is more important than quantity,
in immigration. and it is the aim towarcls
which ah 7the efforts of the Government should
be bent. Io choosing immigrants we should
take account of the past, of our traditions
and of the teachings; of our history. As Canachaos we are proud of our origin. and our
pride is jiistified. The immigrants to New
France were chosen with minute care. Ouîr
forefathers carried in their v oins the noblest
and most generous blond of France. At the
end of the American War of Independence
the Loyalists came liere in their thousands.
And later. those who came fromn Scotlqnd.
Ireland, England, to colonize Ontario. Quebec
and the Lower Provinces. were assuredly
descended from the best families of those
countries. Those immigrants were the founders
of Canada, nlot only in the material sense,
but i0 every sense, and the history of those
families. of their energy, of their devotion
and their confidence in the future of the

MAY 27, 1936
country, will remain for ever engraved in
every true Canadian heart. Our Government
has therefore the sacred duty of protecting
that lineage in every province, against all
attacks, against all loss of that strength, that
vigour, that vitality which has so far distinguished Canada.
The time has come for submitting to the
most careful consideration the whole question
of immigration, and I state without fear that
the present regime must be changed. Canada
is an immense country where natural wealth
abounds, and the stream of immigration must
turn towards us. The hour has come for us
to show a certain pride, to take precautions
and to act with all the circumspection which
should distinguish our young nation. We
must make sure that only the best elements
will be admitted here, and as the elder sons
of the country, as the descendants of the
pioneers, of the early settlers, we must watch
and see that Canada admits only those who
are truly worthy to collaborate in the upbuilding of a great nation. In the interest of our
civilization, of our country, we beg the
Government to make a judicious choice among
those who wish to enter the Canadian family.
To reach that goal, the State should make
an inquiry on the subjec-t of immigration. In
1907 the American Congress decided on a
thorough inquiry on immigration, immigrants
and the consequences which might accrue
to the United States from the rush of new
citizens into the Republic. The same year
Congress appointed a commission of nine
members: three senators appoin-ted by the
Speaker of the Senate, three Congressmen,
and three other persons, appointed by the
President of the United States. Generally
speaking, the country reaped great benefits
from the work of that commission.
May I make a suggestion? At the beginning of next session the Canadian Senate
might institute an inquiry on immigration and
attendant problems. Everyone admits to-day
that the subject is of vital importance to the
country. We should most ardently wish to
adapt to circumstances and to the new needs
of Canada a sane and enlightened policy.
After a comprehensive study of the situation
the Federal Parliament would be able to
enact the necessary laws to render the new
policy on immigration and colonization more
efficient.
The legislators of the House of Commons
and those of the Senate are all Canadians,
and good Canadians; we are all anxious to
keep our young people in Canada, and all our
citizens on Canadian soil.
To conclude, may I state what T consider to
be the most pressing need for the success of
immigration? There should be the closest

373

collaboration between the federal and provincial governments. To my mind, it would be
the best way to arrive at good, national action.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether any other members of the Senate
would like to bc heard on this question. I
intend to speak upon it. I will move the

BILL-DOMESTIC FINANCE
CORPORATION

PRIVATE

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
presented the report of the committee on
Bill B, an Act to incorporate Domestic
Finance Corporation, and moved concurrence
therein.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
I wonder if the Chairman of the Committee
on Banking and Commerce will give us an
indication as to why this and the two preceding bills are coming to us now apparently
unchanged. Some of us who are not members
of the committee understood the committee
had been earnestly engaged in making a
general résumé of the whole loan situation
with a view to preparing an entirely new bill
or materially changing these measures. Would
the Chairman indicate to us what has been
done?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
in reply to the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) may I say it is
true the committee has been considering a
model bill. The committee has made considerable progress with it; perhaps more progress to-day than at any previous sitting;
but the present session of Parliament is, we
hope, nearing its conclusion, and if these three
measures were delayed until the model bill
is ready it is quite possible, indeed probable,
that they would not be passed this session.
At least one or two of these bills have been
before the House for three months, and the
committee deemed it advisable that they

should not be held .back any longer. If the
model bill is passed it will embrace all small
loan companies in the country, including the
three whose bills for incorporation have been
reported to the House to-day.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I object to

of the other two.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Of course,
is any objection I cannot make the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I
supplement what the Chairman of the Banking and Commerce Committee has stated?
The measure now before that committee is
not merely a model bill; it is a general bill
governing the whole small-loan situation and
embodying a model bill. One of its provisions
is that small loan companies already operating shall hereafter have the charter which that
bill provides, and no other. These three
companies are asking for only what has been
given to existing companies; so the committee deemed it unfair to hold back the bills
and thereby cause them to fall by the wayside in the event that the model bill is not
passed this session. But if the model bill
does go through, then these companies will
come under it, along with all companies at
present existing.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It requires unanimous consent.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Then I move
that the third reading be placed on the Order
Paper for Tuesday next.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, I would ask for the third reading of
Bill B to-day. This particular Bill has been
before the Senate for the last three months,
during whioh time the promoters have been
patiently waiting for general legislation. That
general legislation may or may not pass this
session, but why these people should be penalized in the meantime I am at a loss to know.
As has been explained, if there is general legislation these people will have to submit to it.

that they also be given third reading to-day.

to him as the senator from Winnipeg. I am
proud to be known by that title myself, but
at the same time I do not desire that anyone
should give me credit for the excellent speech
delivered by my colleague.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Nor hold you responsible.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: When be first came
to the House he was referred to as the
senator from Winnipeg South. In discussing
the matter with him I told him that the whole

from Winnipeg; a fact of which he is, no doubt,

is due to the fact that some thirty years agofor five years under a Liberal administration,
and for one year under a Conservative
administration-I was one of the harbour
commissioners of the port of Montreal, filling
the position as well as I could, and later was
Minister of Marine. I think it will be
admitted, therefore, that I should have a very
fair knowledge of both sides of the matter.
I cannot altogether agree with the remarks
that have just fallen from the lips of the
honourable
leader of the Government.
Apparently he has not followed the management of harbours as closely as he might have
done; otherwise his views might have been
expressed a little differently.
First of all, let me say to this House that
the chief port authority since the year 1905
has always been vested in the Minister of
Marine. The first harbour board of three
was appointed in 1905 by the Liberal Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and was under
the very able direction of Hon. L. P. Brodeur,
Minister of Marine at that time. Prior to
1905 most of the ports came under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Public Works.
The leader of the Government has told us
how, prior to 1905, certain very distinguished
citizens had much to do with the port of
Montreal. In that I thoroughly agree with
the leader of the Government, but I would
point out that the results were very disastrous.
Nothing could be said against the personnel
that managed the port of Montreal up to the
end of 1905. The board at that time was
composed of eleven members. Six-one of
whom was president-were appointed by
Order in Council; one was the mayor of
Montreal, ex-officio; one was the representative of the Montreal Board of Trade; one the
representative of the Chambre de Commerce;
one the representative of the Montreal Corn
Exchange, and one the representative of
shipping. Surely the interests represented in
that aggregation were sufficiently diversified.
The trouble was that the gentlemen representing the various interests could not agree
around the harbour board table, there being
nothing but quarrelling day in and day out.
As a consequence the development of the
harbour of Montreal was virtually at a
standstill.
Some four years before, large contracts had
been let. One of these contracts was for
fourteen double-deck steel sheds. of which

377

only five were partially completed when the
new commission of three assumed office on
January 2, 1907. The harbour of Montreal
was in such a chaotic condition that in 1905
the Montreal Board of Trade petitioned the
Government to abolish this board of eleven
and to appoint a board of three.
Again the Minister of the day, the Hon.
Mr. Brodeur, showed his sagacity and wisdom. Before deciding to do what had been
asked he visited Montreal and called upon
and consulted the presidents of both railways,
the president of the Shipping Federation, the
Chambre de Commerce, the Corn Exchange,
and all the other interests, and satisfied himself that they really wanted a change and
were agreed that the number of harbour
commissioners should be reduced to three.
Then he went even further. He said to these
interests: "Not one man who applies for the
position will be appointed to the new board.
It is my desire, and that of the Government,
to free the port of Montreal from political
patronage. I will go outside and try to get
disinterested men.
Furthermore, when I
have decided on the men I will come back
before appointing them and see you again to
find out whether or not you approve."
To my great surprise-I being one of the
men referred to by the leader of the Governmen.t (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) as knowing
nothing about shipping-I was asked to
become a harbour commissioner. Major
George Washington Stephens, a real estate
man, was another; Mr. L. E. Geoffrion, who
was engaged in the wholesale grocery business, was the third. While we appreciated
the honour. none of the three of us wanted
to be a harbour commissioner at all, for the
very good reason that we were busy men.
But under considerable pressure from many
sources we eventually agreed.
Then we came up to Ottawa to see Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and the Minister of Marine.
We said to them: "It is a great responsibility
that you wish to place upon our shoulders.
We are willing to undertake it if you will
give us a free hand to manage the affairs
of the port of Montreal as we would manage
a private business." Both Sir Wilfrid Laurier
and Mr. Brodeur at once said: "Certainly.
You will have full charge of the port of
Montreal. You will have no political interference whatsoever from the Government, the
Minister of Marine, or anybody else." We
then assumed office.
One would have thought there would be
smooth sailing from then on, but quite the
contrary was the case. When we assumed
office we were assailed from every side, every
hour and every minute of the day, by patron-

378

SENATE

age seekers. The chairman of the harbour
commission, Major Stephens, said to these
patronage seekers: "Gentlemen, times have
cbanged. There will be ne polities wbatever
in the management of the port of Montreal
so long as we are the' commissieners." These
office seekers wcre very much annoyed and
said, "Well. if that is your policy. we are
going up to, Ottawa to see the Minister."
They came. not once, not twice, but dozens
of times; but. to the everlasting credit of the
Hon. Mr. Brodeur, hie turned a deaf car to
one and ail of them, and said, "The affairs
of the port of Montreal are in the hands of
the three commissionerý,, and neither the
Government nor myseif will interfere."
Still the battle raged. I will not weary the
Flouse with many of the difficulties that were
encountered. The two railways were using
the harbour and one was blocking the other;
se we decided to organîze a traffie dcpartment.
Wben it was known that wc wanted a traffie
manager the usual swarm of political becs
hi%-ed around the harbour office. Again the
chairman told them that we werc going to get
an experienced traffic man. We stood to our
guns, and the Canadian Pacifie Railway gave
us Mr. Vaughan, one of their best terminal
men, and ever since then the traffie hias been
very efficiently managed, as many as a thousand cars a day being bandled.
In another instance we assigned to a
certain steamship man a shed that did net
please him. He said, "I won't take that shed,"
and uip hoe came to Ottawa. Again the
Minister said hie weuld have to corne te sec
us; and lie had te take the shed wc had
assigned te him.
Just twe more instances and I am througb
witb patronage. When we organized the
traffic department we said: "The charge per
car will be $2. If we find that charge is tee
higb or tee low, we shal1 alter it next year."
The following vear wve :idvancý,d the charge te
S~2.50. The Canadian Pacifie Railway and the
Canadian Nertbern readily agreed. The Grand
Trunk Railway Company, bowevcr, unider
Mr. Fitzhugh, said. "No, we will net pay
$2.50 a car." Negotiations w-cnt on for some
time. Then the late Mr. C. M. Hays came
down and took a hand in thc affair. H1e said:
"I w-ill refer this matter te Ottawa; I will
place it before the Privy Council there." The
cemmissieners said te him, "Mr. Hays, that
is your privilege, but if the Privy Councîl
agrees witbi yeu our resig-nations wvill go te
Ottawa by wirc." He came up and placed
his case before the Privy Council, and the
Prii-.v C(ouiril -.-id, just as the Minister had
said te others. "We will net interfere." One
w-ould bav e tbeught that then the trouble
was ov'er. But ne. He would net pay the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

$2.50. Se w-e put a big locomotive at the foot
of MeGill street and rcfused te take any
further traffie fromn the Grand Trunk. As a
result ships could net get cargees, and relations were very straincd until the Grand
Trunk Railway at last agrced.
On another occasion a very large delegation
waited on us. It was hcaded by an Englishspeaking member of Parliament wbo said:
"Gentlemen, I desîre te introduce te you the
members of the Patronage Committee. No
appointment shaîl ho made by the Harbeur
Commission until our secretary bas been
notified. He will tell you whorn te put in
the varions positions." Again the president
said, "We are net managing the harbour in that
way."
1 cite these cases because I arn leading up
te certain objections which I arn geing te
make te this Bill. I rnay say that 1 am net
opposed te the principle of the Bill, and my
objeet in rising now is net te embarra.s the
Minister or the Geveroment, but simply te
make certain suggeýstions that I hope will
fortify the central board and the Minister
against tlîe enslaughts whicb rage from day te
day in regard te patronage, and which will
get very much worse.
Thîis Bill contemplates placing the important hiarheurs from Vancouver te Halifax
under a central board. My honourable friend
bas referred te tecbinical experts, but I have
neyer met anyene wlio is a tecirnical expert
in cennection witb hacheurs. I should net
know where te, find one. Indeed, I do net
tbink tliere exists anyone w'ho could be called
a teclrnical port expert. My reason for se
stating is that such a man would have te be
a civil engineer. a marine engineera traffie
expert, an acceunitant and an elevator expert,
and weuld also have te understand police
work, ibecause a large police force is maintained at tbe port. Se I de net know what
is meant wvhen the Minister in another place
and the leader of the Government in this
House talk about placing the harbour of
Montreal under tecbnical experts.
Tbe honourable leader said it was a strange
tbing te appoint as harbour commissieners
men wheo knew practically notbing about
hacheurs. I confessed a few moments ago,
and I repeat, that I knew nothing at all
Neithier did
about the port of Montreal.
Major Stephens nor Mr. Geoffrion. It is impossible for any one man or any hiaîf-dozen
mec te possess all the existing diversified
knowledge about ports. Nor is it necessary
tbat a man should bave sueh knowledge. The
qualifications required of commi-ýsioners are
that they ho able, practical anîd lîonest business men. They are surrounded by aIl the
teebuical advisers they need, just as business

MAY 28, 1936
executives are. May I digress for a minute
and make a personal reference? I spent ail
my life in the paint and varnish business, and
was the head of a very large concern. But
I do not know how to, make any kind of paint
or varnish; I ar n ot familia-r with the details
of the manufacturing processes. Nor was I,
as the executive head, supposed to know about
these things. What I was emp!oyed for
was-whether I possessed it or not-the necessary executive ability, and the aibility to
choose as my assistants men who had the
requisite technical skill. Similarly, a port
manager, or a central board, is called upon
to perforrn nothing but executive work.
I regret very much the exaggerated statements that have been made with regard to
former harbour boards. As I have already
stated, the harbour commissioners of the port
of Montreal over a period of 106 years have
been most distinguished men. On the harbour
front of that city thére stands to-day a
monument to the Hon. John Young, who
performed a great service not only to the port
of Montreal, but to the Dominion. Te
people of Montreal have a right to be prou
of the greatest, the most modemn and best
equipped port that can be found in any part
of the world. This Bill will do more than
anything has previously done to destroy the
interest that those citizens have in their port.
I amn not going to advocate a return to
the system of harbour commissioners. However, I will say that, first of ail, the responsibility for whatever action is taken, right or
wrong, resta on the Minister of Marine, the
Deputy Minister and those who look after
the operations of ail the ports. What is the
first thing that members of a harbour board
have to do? They have to make up their
budget in great detaiL So they must corne to
wbom? To the Minister of Marine at Ottawa.
Tbey say to him, "Here are our plans of
development for the next year, or five years,
and we should like to know whether you
approve of tbem or not." Ail detailed
explanation is given to the Minister at the
time, and hie can say yes or no. If bie approves
of the plan, it is the duty of the Deputy
Minister to follow the progress of the work.
And in the Department of Marine there is an
auditor whose special duty it is to watch the
finances of not only the port of Montreai, but
every port in Canada. So it ill becomes
anyone to hurl disrespectful rernarks at harbour
commissioners, and point to allegedly wasteful
expenditures. If there have been wasteful
expenditures, is it not fair to say that half
of the responsibility mnust rest on the various
Ministers of Marine and on the Marine
Department? If some contracts were irregular,
if certain port developments were unnecessary,

379

why did not the Minister of Marine at the
time say to the harbour board or boards
concerned, "You must flot proceed with that
work"? And even after a projeet has received
the Minister's approval it rnust come before
the Governrnent, for there has to be an Order
in Council.
One would take it from the remarks made
by my honourable friend to-day that the
present and past Ministers of Marine have
really had notbing to do with the development of our ports. One would think that this
Bill is introducing a new departure. It would
appear that tbe Government, horrified at
unnecessary expenditures on harbours, is
bringing forward a new plan to centralize
authority here and to require the approval of
the Minister of Marine to various undertakings. Weil, I think I have shown that the
authority has aiways been bere at Ottawa. I
admit that certain harbour commissioners
may have done things that they should not
have done. But was it fair for the Minister
in another place to make such an unwarranted
attack on harbour commissioners and say
nothing about the responsîbility of bimself
and his department?
Let us see what Sir Alexander Gibb has
to say about harbour cornmissions. He says:
There is strong evidence that the Commissions of Montreal and Vancouver played an
important part in this progress.
In the previous paragraph hie referred to
twenty-five years of great progress and port
developrnent.
They provided a type of administration at
least the equal of any that was to be found
elsewhere on the North American continent;
and notwithstanding mistakes, which no syatem
can prevent, the developments under the twa
Harbour CommissionsTbat is, of Montreal and Vancouver.
-have generally been sound and economically
justified.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What is the date
of the report, please?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It is 1932. I
consider that a very fine tribute, coming as
it does from Sir Alexander Gibb, wbo bas a
great knowledge of world ports.
May I make a further reference to the Departrnent, of Marine? The departmnent has
been known to override harbour commissioners, not by letter, but by word of niouth.
I will admit that harbour commissioners
should not have permitted that kind of thing,
but it is well known that they dîd. If many
millions have been spent irregularly, at least
haîf the blarne can be laid at tbe door of
tbe department, at wbose instigation some
large works were carried out.

380

SENATE

While approving of this Bill in prineiple,
I arn really at a loss to know how the port of
Montreal can be efficiently managed under
it. If I have read this Gibb report once
I have read it a dozen times, as I have read
the Bill. The port of Montreal has a staff
of anvwhere frorn one thousand to fifteen
Iîundred employecs.
Problems are arising
there daily.
WNhile I was a comis-ioner
mny colleagues and I were at the port evcry
dlay. We usually took our lunch there. We
discussed curront problems and arrived at
our deciions. Lnder this Bill there will be a
port manager. But let me say hiere that in
Iooking throughl the measure I was amazed to
find it contained nlot a single word about a
port manager. In his report Sir Alexander
Gibb pays very careful attention to the
pos.ition of port manager, and hie expresses
the hope that the person filling- such a positien xwill flot ho an eng-ineer. I say that
%vitl ail due respect to tise onginoors of the
c oun try.
Sir Alexander Gibb says:
Eileu port slîou Id h ave anl excuti vo, of
Suffieeit pernialueluy of tellure to be beyond

If lie lbas sijitalile sbîppiug or raiiway experiece it would lie an advantage, but it slioul1
imot ho mîadle a definite stipulation. Ordinarily.
in nîy opiniionl, an englober, unless of special
expericuce. is not the most suitable man for
suehI a position.
The port manager would ho appointed on a

of the conîditionîs that the central autlîority
sliould have the righit to isiake use of lis
services at lîoadquarters or iii a simil,îr post
at anotlier port.
Perhaps later on the leader of the Government iil tel! us whv the Bill makes no
mention of a port manager and the duties
attaching to suehi an officiai, as outlined in
the GihI report.
The Bill merely prox ides for the appointment of a central board. I understand that
the prcsent board of civil servants is to
hold office only tenîporarily, and I hope that
when tIse Govcrnment decidos to appoint a

I am altogetîser in favour of a central board.
There are two fonctions wliich such a body is
charged to, carry otît. No doubt there xviii ho
difiiculty iîî gotting a t1loroîîglly competent
man as chief engineer; that is, one who understands port develepmont. That was one of
the difficulties 'se liad to contond with in
Montreal in arranging for plans for the buildngof piers and tue carrying eut of developmonts over a long perîod of years te corne.
We found it necessary te bring frorn England
an engineer with groat exporionce in port
developmcnt. But, ne doubt, the central
board will seo to it that it gets a thoroughly
competent rnan, and to hirn will be givon
general supervision ovor aIl the construîction
work of all the ports. I think that is sound
and wi.se. Ho will aIse ho in charge of the
finances, and have available the services of an
auditor. It dees net necessarily follow that
lie shnuld have a large staff. I understand
tîsat in Ottamwa now tliee is a large suite of
cilices and a staff of something liko thirty.
The detailed oerations of oach port must

1

MAY 28, 19-36

part a letter which I have very reoently received from Montreal. The writer says:
Present chaotic conditions are due entirely
to failure of the Mfinisters, Deputy Ministers
and Superviser of Harbour Commissions, al
of whom have responsibility, which they were
paid to bear.
Is remedy to be found in now placing aIl
ports in hands of an officer of a department,
which has deplorably failed in its duties in the
past, and brougbt about the complete demoralization of facilities, in which some $370,000,000
of the people's moneys have been invested, and
in whose development, during the past twýentyfive years, many of the brightest minds in
Canada have been engaged?
At present, not more than $5 can be
expended, without the approval of the centra]
board, for statianery and office supplies.
Otherwise, the acting port manager, the
records show, can purchase general supplies up
to $1,000, but in practice everything is submitted to Ottawa hecause of the fear of
displeasing someone.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Who signs the letter?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I prefer flot
to disclose the writer's naine, for it is a very
caustic letter. He pointe out that the comnmission is required to send to Ottawa a list
af cold storage, grain elevatar, and other employees. Then what happens here? A list of
job-seekers is sent back and the old employees are discharged.
I do not think that is what the Minister
or the Government desires, and I arn quite
sure it is not what Sir Alexander Gibb would
recommend. What I hope the Minister and
the Government are driving at, and what
would certainly carry the judgment of this
House, is a plan to give our national ports
modemn and efficient management, and, go far
as is humanly possible, frce them from the
evils of patronage.
But if it is intended to centralize in Ottawa
contrai of the purchasing of port supplies, if
ail orders are to be placed only with those
on thc patronage liste, and if ail tenders are
to be opened by the central board and then
sent to the Minister, I contend that it would
be unfair to place the central board and the
Minister in such an embarrassing
position.'
Ever since the temporary central board bas
been functioning in Ottawa it hae been besieged night and day by members of Parliament and others seeking positions and favours
for their friends. The other day a member
of Parliament told me that he had sent in
between 500 and 600 names. Later on I
shall have a suggestion to make in reference
ta this condition of affaire.
I come now to the question of grain storing.
The storage capacity at the port of Mantreal
is some 13,000,000 bushels. The port operates
the most modemn elevators that skill and

381

money can provide. The equipment enables
a lake vessel to be unloaded at the rate, for
each marine leg, of 14,000 to 22,000 bushels an
hour. The grain is handled by conveyer belts.
The belts are brought opposite the ship and
the grain is dropped ino spouts, which in turn
pour the grain ino the hold.
Those elevatars were built, not for starage,
but for tran.9hipment only, but during the last
year or two they have been glutted hy
unsalable
grain.
The harbour
commissianers should not have alawed the elevators
ta be used for this purpose. There are to-day
in those elevatars well aver 8,000,000 bushels
of No. 2 Narthern wheat. As a result of this
misuse lake vessels caming dawn ta Mantreal
were sub.jected ta serious delay. For the
latter haîf of August I have these figures: 15
vesspels suffered an average delay af eight
days; 29 vessels. seven days; 34 vessels, eight
and a haîf days; 18 vessels, seven days; 25
vessels, three days. The shipping company
whose lake vessels were sa delayed and were
nat able ta diseharge their grain ino the
harbour elevators sustained an estimated bass
of $142,250, an 'the basis of 569 days, at $250
a day. I hope the new administration will
see that the elevators are reserved for transhipment service, so that when lake vesseis
arrive in the part they will be able ta discharge
their cargo in farty-eight hours and then turn
around.
I regret the building of an elevator at Sorel.

There neyer was any neceszsty i0 the wurld
for a grain elevator there.
Han. Mr. RAIN VILLE: And at Three
Hivers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn coming
ta that. Sorel bas simply chiselled the part
of Montreal out of its grain business, because
it has nat what is called top wharfage, being
a charge for bandling the grain. Sorel said,
"We will have none of that." The storage
of grain in elevatars is cantralled by the
Grain Commission. but it is very daubtful
whether the part of Sorel charged the rates
prescribed by the Grain Act. Anyway, with
ample grain storage facilities in the part of
Montreal it was quite unnecessary ta allow
an elevator ta be built at Sorel, and it bas
made seriaus inraads an the revenue of the
port of Mantreal.
It is praposed now ta build a private
elevatar at Three Hivers.
I advance the
samne reasons against this prajeet that I have

advanced against the elevator at Sorel.
Montreal at its peak handled 211,000,000
bushels of grain in a season. Last seasan
the total dropped ta 60,000,000. It is important
that an acean steamer caming ino the part
of Montreal should be able ta turn around

382

SENATE

as quickly as possible, so that she may take
on her grain at the same time as she takes
on her general cargo. Why a vessel should
have to take on a certain amount of cargo
and then go to Sorel or Three Rivers for
grain is beyond my comprehension.
I have a few suggestions to offer which I
hope will appeal to this House. I think
outside men should be appointed to the
central board. I do not think it is worth

while trying to find the expert man of transcendent abilities. He is to be found only in
the pages of our newspapers.

I would suggest

that for the position of port manager a good,
level-headed man be selected. His duties
should be clearly defined in this Bill. And
I would certainly suggest that the permanent
staff be placed under the Civil Service Commission. I would allow the port manager to
engage his temporary help. If the permanent
staff is to be engaged by the central board in
Ottawa, we can visualize what its personnel
will be. Under that system, we can imagine
the port manager going to, say, the superintendent of an elevator and remarking: "I
don't like the way you are handling this
elevator. You are delaying these ships."
That superintendent would look at him and
probably retort: "Oh, yeah?
You didn't
engage me, and you can't discharge me. You
had better go and take a walk!" Under such
a system port efficiency would be a thousand
times worse than it ever could be under the
old regime. Therefore I would recommend
that all permanent employees drawing a salary
of $1,200 and over be placed under the Civil
Service Commission, and that the temporary
help be under the control of the port manager.
Now I come to the last and most important
of my suggestions.
Under this Bill, when
tenders are called they will be sent to Ottawa
to be opened by the central board and then
handed to the Minister.
Can honourable
members imagine the crowd that would be
sitting outside the Minister's office when
millions of dollars' worth of contracts are to
be let? I ask them to try to imagine the
flood of letters he would receive from every
member of Parliament representing a constituency in which the work would be done;
letters of this type: "I want John Jones to
get this contract. He has always been a fine
party man and has backed me in every election." Why, the Minister would be hamstrung
right at the beginning. Therefore I would
suggest that when the Bill is in committee
it be amended to provide that tenders be
opened publicly in the presence of the tenderers-the practice introduced by the former
Minister of Public Works, Hon. Mr. Stewart.
This Bill is second in importance to the

Railways Bill which is now before the other
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

House, and I submit it is our duty to improve
it in every way possible without affecting its
underlying principle.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Before the honourable gentleman resumes his seat, may I ask
him why, when Minister of Marine, he did
not place the permanent staffs of our national
ports under the Civil Service Commission?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: At that time
the harbour commissions engaged and discharged their men; but the purpose of this
Bill is to centralize in Ottawa authority not
only over the port of Montreal, but also over
the other national ports.
There is one thing I have overlooked. I
paid a tribute to the Hon. Mr. Brodeur. I
desire also to pay a similar tribute to the
Hon. J. D. Hazen. We enjoyed the same
freedom under him as we did under bis
predecessor, the Hon. Mr. Brodeur.
Honourable
Hon. J. H. RAINVILLE:
members, the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has rightly
said that about 99 per cent of the people
in the city of Montreal do not know much
about their own port. While I intend to
deal generally with our seven national ports,
I shall be more specific in my references to
the port of Montreal, so that those 99 per
cent of the citizens may become better informed about that great port and realize
what they will lose if this Bill becomes law.
Admittedly the purpose of this Bill is to
replace the local harbour commissions of our
seven national ports with a central board at
Ottawa. To justify this radical change the
honourable Minister of Railways asserted that
the harbour commissioners had been so unconscionable in their administration that he
dare not publish their misdeeds for fear the
public might lose faith in its leading men.
I shall not attempt to reply to this audacious
blanket accusation against men whose record
as loyal and efficient public servants and highminded and high-principled citizens cannot
be questioned, even by a Minister of the
Crown.
It has been well said by the president of
one of our universities that "Audacity is one
of the choicest fruits of inexperience," and
that the man who is young enough to catch
that disease "will measure everything and
everybody, and in half an hour will pigeonThe great economist
hole the universe."
Aubry was right when he said, "Les grands
hommes seuls comprennent la valeur des
autres."--"Only great men can appreciate the
worth of others."
The men so accused have not been given

the great province of Ontario. Perhaps if
this same spirit had been in evidence at all
Canadian harbours we should not to-day be
fighting to keep the autonomy of our barbours or attempting to prevent various cities
of this Dominion from being robbed-that
word is a proper one, and I shall prove itof the direction of their maritime enterprise.
What is this great institution which we know
as the harbour of Montreal? What are its
problems? It is not a creation of yesterday
or an achievement of last year. Its beginnings can be traced back to the second voyage
of Jacques Cartier. Dr. Atherton. the wellknown historian of Montreal, in bis recently
published summary of the history of the
Montreal waterfront, states that navigation
on the St. Lawrence was opened in 1535 by
the arrival of the first ocean vessel, under
the command of Captain Jacques Cartier.
Unfortunately, there were no commissioners
then to present him with a cane.
As a less fanciful allusion I might mention
the proclamation of the King of France in
the middle of the seventeenth century, which
granted Montreal to the Compagnie de la
Nouvelle-France and reserved to the public
for all time the shore of the St. Lawrence
at Montreal.
But I will not delve too far into ancient
history. The previous speaker bas given
a brief history of the first legislation. Let
me again emphasize, as he did, that during
all the 106 years since 1830, and in all this
continuing legislation, the principle of commission control was never departed from,
and that it was by means of harbour commissioners, local men appointed by and removable by the Government, that the barbour of Montreal was built up from a small
and insignificant backwater anchorage to one
of the most important seaports in the world.
The harbour of Montreal extends about sixteen miles on both the north and south shores
of the St. Lawrence. up to high-water mark.
Nature's kindness and man's ingenuity have
combined in this great enterprise to give the
citizens of this country a magnificent ocean
terminal at a minimum of cost. Centred in
one authority, which makes for efficiency, the
harbour of Montreal to-day comprises a deepwater, tideless and safe harbour, equipped
with ten miles of modern concrete wharves
and piers, two-story transit sheds, and large
and accessible open storage spaces. One hundred large ocean ships can be berthed at the
same time, exclusive of large numbers of
canal and river vessels.
The harbour has constructed and operates
its own terminal railway system, now seventy
miles in length, of which some fifty miles are
lion. Mr. RAINVILLE.

electrified. This railway was the first of its
kind on the continent and bas been a model
for many other progressive ports, such as San
Francisco and New Orleans. Approximately
200,000 railway cars are handled on this railway system each season of navigation.
The harbour bas the most efficient and
modern grain handling system in the world.
There are four large modern fireproof grain
elevators having a combined storage capacity
of 15.000,000 bushels, with connecting conveyor galleries containing seventeen miles of
conveyor belting. Thirty ships can load grain
over this system without moving from their
berths, and twenty-three ocean vessels may
be loaded with grain at the same time. This
grain handling plant bas a capacity of 2,000,000
bushels a day, this figure baving been reached
several times in the busy seasons of 1927 and
1928. In the latter year, during a navigation
season of 200 days, the total grain shipments
from the harbour of Montreal amounted to
211,000,000 bushels, or an average of over
1,000,000 bushels a day.
Montreal harbour bas accomplished the
marvel of bringing ocean vessels from the seven
seas of the world into the very heart of a
continent. This harbour, the second most
important in North America, bas been described by experts of other countries as "a
marvel of modern engineering skill," as "the
best example of a modern seaport organization," and, by one of the greatest newspapers
in New York, as "one of the most daring and
sportsmanlike pieces of commercial enterprise." An efficient and loyal organization bas
been built up by successive harbour commissions.
Honourable senators. let me say a word on
the revenues of the harbour and submit for
your consideration the results achieved under
harbour commissioners selected from among
the public-spirited citizens of Montreal. For
a period of about thirty years, up to 1928,
revenues of the harbour commission of Montreal practically doubled every six years, increasing during the whole period from less than
half a million to over five and a half millions
of dollars. Since 1929, owing to the world
depression, the revenues have been lower, but
they still run about $4,000,000 a year.
The tonnage of merchandise handled through
the harbour bas increased each year for the
past twenty years, amounting in 1935 to more
than 11,000,000 tons, after touching over 124
million tons in 1928. Approximately 1,800
ocean-going ships, having a net registered
tonnage of around 5,000,000 tons, came to the
harbour in 1935. Ships representing fourteen
or fifteen different countries of the world do
business at this great harbour.

MAY 28, 1936
The Governent customs and excise revenue
at the port of Montreal is about 80 million
dollars a year, as shown by the Goverument
bluebook.
The debt of the harbour on the 24th of
March, 1936, as given by the honourable
Minister himseif, was $58,593,000, aIl represented by debentures held by the Government,
and on wbicb, according to the 1935 figures,
the interest amounts to $2,523,954. The rate
of interest averages about four per cent.
The property assets of the harbour are
$63,316,164, the cost being about haîf that in
almost any other barbour.
Any Minister of the Crown who cared to
help the Canadian ports in the years of crisis
could, it is suggested, have written off onethird or one-haîf of the debt of the harbours.
1 will flot go ào far, but I will say the rate
of interest could have been eut from four and
a fraction per cent to three per cent. This
reduction would have lowered the deficit of
many harbours to practically nothing. Otherwise the Government is making money out of
its boans to barbour commissions.
During the years from 1921 to 1928 Montreal
was primarily a grain shipping port.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not a free
port?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: No, flot. a free
port; a grain port. Since 1928 grain shipments
have fallen off enormously, owing to world
conditions. Was Mont.real harbour -to lose the
proud distinction of being the second port of
North Ameriea? It seemed so. Here was a
crucial te.st of the systern of management by
local commissioners. lIa 1921 the tonnage of
commodities handled throughi the harbour of
Montreal, exclusive of grain, amounted to
2,791,671 tons; in 1935, fourteen years later, it.
amounted to 10,478,741 tons. This was an
increase of 363 per cent in fourteen years; an
the Mýontreal harbour still retains its proud
position.
These figures are a tribute to the commissioners. and also serve to indicate the vital
part which this harboiîr plays in the daily
commercial life of the Dominion of Canada.
The harbour bas been rigbtly dcscribed as a
barometor of Canadian trade.
The growtb of a great seaport at Montreal
has not been due to luck, or chance,' or the
vagaries of fate. It bas been due to the
progressive and far-seeing business citizens of
Montreal and to the disinterested and wholehearted efforts of its commissioners, wortby
successors of the Hon. John Young, the father
of the port. One day Mr. Young stood near
Victoria Bridge and in prophetic and memorable words described the vision wbich be saw,

and of business passing over those wharves

known that when the barbour bad been raised
to its present power and importance there

place its destinies in the bhands of mcn in
Ottawa, to wbom, no matter bow capable and
sincere tbey may be, the harbour of Montreal
will bc but one of seven jobs, one of seven
far-removed and sbadowy projccts.
Honourable senators, one of the most serious
problems with wbicb tbe authorities of the
various Canadian ports bave to contcnd is the
constant and energetie competition from the
United States ports. To show tbe Housc how
x ery serious this problcmt is for us, I nccd
only state that in the years 1929, 1930 and
1931, not to mention the record years of
1927 and 1928, shipments of Canadian grain
through United States ports amounted to
208.000,000 bushels.
To empbasize the significance of this Canadian grain diversion, I wish to quote an cxtract
from the Annual Report of the Port of New
York Autbority for the year 1929. It reads:
The investigation of the Port Authority
revealcd that this Canadian grain constituted
twenty per cent of the export tonnage f rom

the port of N~ew York, earned a gross annual

revenue of $9,000,000 for American raibroade
andl barge canal operators serving the North
Atlantic parts, and furnished f rom twenty to
seventy-five per cent of the eastbound carXoes
of steamships operating f rom the port of New
York.
"Grain is a magnet for ships" is the slogan
of the new port of Albany. Our friends ta the

soutb are constantly wide-awakc to the oppartuoity of securing more and more Canadian
business, to the detriment of Canadian ports.
Other commodities than grain arc involved.
bowever. In the five years from 1927 to 1931
the total value of Canadian merchandise exparted through ports of the United States was
$1.247,980.000-one
and a quarter billion
dollars. Tbe additional direct revenue wbich
our Canadian barbours would bave derived
from the bandling of sùcb an enormous quantity of merebandise, or even a fair share of
it, would surely bave added materially to the
financial success of our Canadiean ports.
There is a constant and continuous demand
by the Governmcnt for interest on the capital expenditure at aur Canadian harbours.
The barbour of Montreal bas a splendid

ments, including upper lake bis of lading,
for the carniage of grain fromn the head of the
lakes to Montreal. He was able by this
means to obtain releases fromn carriers and get
delivery fromn Montreal elevators of grain to
which lie was flot entitled. I say this was
done by a broker's agent and flot, as was
said in another place, by an employee of the
harbour. As a resuit of bis operations the
Canada Atlantic Grain Export Company took
action against the Red Barge Line, Limited,
for delivery of grain for which it held bis
of lading, but which had been delivered to this
agent on forged documents. The Canada
At]antic Grain Export Company action was
dismissed under judgmenit rendered by Mr.
Justice Demers. After this judgment was
delivered the New York grain exporters and
banks advancing money against grain documenta feit that the situation with regard to
bis of Iading was not satisfactory. A large
delegation called on the commissioners and
made the statement that unless some nesponsible authority in Montreal would undertake tho responsibility for negotiable bis of
lading on grain, no further financing of grain
moving through Montreal harbour would be
done by United States bankens. An immediate
solution of the question was unged upon the
commissioners. When the conference was over
the commissioners discussed the matter and
called to their assistance members of the
staff who were weIl acquainted with the receipt
and delivery of grain. Then the commissioners,
after careful consideration, decided to accept
the responsibility for upper lake bis of lading
on grain; but in order to .protect themselves
they insisted that canceiled bills of iading
be surrendered to them with the carrier's
release, and aIso that they should retain
cancelled bis of iading on which delivery
of grain was made. They then placed insurance against ioss resulting from altered or
forged bis of lading. As soon as the cornmissionens met the next morning alI interested
parties were notified of the solution, which
was found satisfactory to the United States
financial interests, and the flow of Canadian
grain continued through Montreal harbour.
This, honourable senators, is but one
example of the many important and serious
problems that. arise almost daily.
Would
anyone suggest that a question of this kind
should be referred for immediate decision to
a board of commissioners sitting at Ottawa,
neeessariiy not acquainted with local conditions or local iaw and burdened with the
probiems of six other harbours? I think it
is necessary oniy to state the proposition to
see that it is an impracticable one. I know
of other problems, not more important than
12745--25J

387

the one I have cited, with respect to which we
had to wait a year and haif before we could
get a decision fromn Ottawa.
Let me now nefer briefiy to another pnoblem which affects not only Montreal, but alI
the ports on the St. Lawrence river-the problem of maintaining adequate depth in the
ship channel. This problem seems to unnerve some of our friends in other provinces,
and even some members of Parliament. They
seem scarcely to realize that the St. Lawrence
river is not only one of the wondens of the
world, but our biggest Canadian asset. This
was realized more than one hundred years
ago, when, in 1825, the citizens of Montreai
began their memorable campaîgn to, have the
river dredged fnomn Quobec to Montreal. In
that year the Lachine canal had been cornpleted and vessels were ready to bring traffie
from the Great Lakes to Montreal. The
available depth between Montreal and Quebec was then only 10j feet. After many delays and a false start, the Government had
by 1850 expended $1,000,000 and succeeded
in deepening the ohannel to 14 feet. Disgusted by the slow progress on this imuportant
work, the harbour commissioners of Montreal
took the project, into their own hands, and
by 1888, with their own money, they had succeeded in enlarging and deepening the ship,
channel to, a depth of 27ý feet and a width of
300 feet.
It wiIl be seen that the harbour of Montreal was ibui1t, flot by the Government, but
by the citizens with their own money. When
the undertaking became successful they were
neimnbursed their expenditure, but not until
it had proved to be a gold mine.
Too mucli praise cannot be given to the
men who were responsible for this publicspirited action, and the naines of Muffatt,
John Young, Kennedy, Keefer and others will
be nemembered as long as ships eaul the
St. Lawrence.
In 1888, upon strong representations fromn
Montreal that channel deepening by the hanbour commission was imposing too heavy a
burden on the shipping then trading to the
harbour, as an extra tax was imposed on ail
tonnage using the ship ehannel, the Government was convinced that the ship channel
was an undertaking of permanent chanacter
and national importance, and that its further
deepening and enlargement was a matter
vitally affecting the trade of Canada. Thereupon the work was assumed by the Department of Marine. Introdueing the Bill in the
House of Commons in May of that year,
Sir C2harles Tupper, then Minister of Finance, said:

St.' Lawrence route if greater depth were

H1e stated further that considerable evidence
was produced before him of the loss and inconvenience caused to sbipping by the lack of
additional depth on the St. Lawrence. The
report continues:
'ihere bas, su far as 1 could ascertain, been
no sustained comprehiensive effort to (leal with
wliat 1 consider the most important water
transport question in Canada. Although there
is a considorable aniounot of data available for

The primary service of the St. Lawrence to
the Dominion is as a chanci of comimunication. Its value in tlîis respect is already less
thanl it slîould be. It is moreover defioitely
dccreasing i proportion to its inability to
ieet the increase in the size of shippiag. The
dredging programn whica lias raised 'Montreal
into the category of a first-class port I consider to have been a great conception, well
caried ont.
The bite Govcrnmcnt took a wise and
prudent stop in appointing a commission of
cugineers to study and report on St. Lawrence water levels. Their report should now
hc available, and the Goverroment should take
tlcfioite action on this vital problem.

There bas been a drop of not more than eight

meaning less than three-quarters of an inch
for each foot dredged out, instead of five
inches a foot, as ivas wrongly said in the
Lower 11oue..And this is what the preliminary report of the engineers shows.
The late Thomas C. I(eefer. one of Canada's greatest engineers. spent most of hais life

that even if ail water from the Great Lakes

Honourable senators. the most important
event in the history of Canada has been
Confederation.
And we in Quebec know
that one of the most important factors in
ensuring the successful realization of the aims
and the spirit of Confederation bas been, ini
part, the river St. Lawrence. Confederation
could not have been a success without trade
between the provinces, and that trade could
not have been brought ta its present imposing figures without the existence in this country of our magnificent waterway, the St.
Lawrence. a gift bestowed upon u-s by Providence and developed by our fathers to the
utmost of their ability. It is through the
medium of the St. Lawrence that coal from
Nova Scotia can be sold successfully in Quebec and Ontario, and it is due to the existence of the St. Lawrence that a large part
of the export grain of our Western Provinces
can move out economically to Europe and
find its proper market.
Just one more word.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY:

Go on.

Before concludHon. Mr. RAINVILLE:
ing these remarks about the problems of our
Canadian barbours, in wbich the bandling of
wheat plays such an important part, I should
like to addresq a word to the young people
of the Western Provinces, the sons of the
men who are now engaged in growing and
marketing

The Montreal

that Russia would soon again be a menace ta

should like to refer briefly to a most interesting statement made by Mr. Edouard Herriot,
ex-Premier of France. after bis last visit to
Russia. Speaking before an important meeting in Paris, Mr. Herriot said:
But in regard ta agriculture in the Soviet,
rather than my own experience I prefer to
takze the opinion of a man who bas been our
own Minister of Agriculture and whose
technical competence nobody in this country
denies. Senator Victor Boret recently went

into this question in bis book, "Le Paradis
Infernal."' Here is an interesting fact. He
takes strong issue with the prevalent idea that
Russia would be, like Canada, "a country of
enormous undeveloped spaces, future reservoirs
of fabulous craps."
According to this specialist the Russia of
Soviets, just as the Russia of the tsars,
"suffers f rom an extraordinary shortage of

vated land in the Soviet Union scarcely
amounts ta 140 million hectaresThis is appraximately 345 million acres, one
hectare being equal to 2-47 acres.
-ta which should be added 60 million hectares
of common pasture lands in the steppes.
The term used in French is "terres de parcours," and this is the best translation I could
find.
One hundred and forty million hectares for
127,000,000 pensants, and for a total of
161,000.000 inhabitants, is not munch. Hence
the reeognized difficulties. under the Bolshevist
regime, as under the tsarist regime, of providing adequate food supplies for the people.
According to the same authority, crop yield is
stili ver; low. and, as 1 readily believe, the
standard of life of a Russian, as regards food,
is muchi inferior. for reasons of a technical
nature, ta that of a Frenchman or a German.
Cliniatic uncertainty is very great. Furthermore. the population increases by about
3.000.000 inhabitants each year.
"Ti

Boret,
to-day. without increasing the 'cultivable' area
and without technical pragress in the matter
of increasing crop yield, it is easy ta foresee
certainty the absolute
ývith mathematical
impossibility of feeding the 100 million inhabitants who, thirty years from now, will be
added ta the present population."
Those words of a recognized expert on the
Rusýian wheat situation sbould give cause
for hope ta our young Western Canadians and
encourage them ta continue in the vital work
carried on by their grandfathers and their
fathers before them-a work which bas been
of the most valuable character in advancing
the prosperity and financial stability of Canada.
Now I am coming to the most interesting
part of my speýech. Before concluding I want

ta talk about Sir Alexander Gibb and the
honourable Minister of Marine, but I wisb
ta refer first of aIl to the fourfold purpose of
this Bill, as described by the honourable
Minister. Wbat I have bere is copied practically word for word from what he said wben
he introduced the Bill in the Lower House,
and I tbink you will agree that it is correct.
The abjects of the Bill, as stated by the
Minister, are:1. To bring contraI of expenditures on
these seven barbours under the autbority of
Parliament, and to, make the accouniting at
these ports subject ta the Comptroller of tbe
Treasury and to audit by the Auditor-General.

4. Ta remnove a weak lînk in the system,

The first point is in regard ta accouoting
and contraI cf expenditures. Speaking cf the

there is ne complaint. the sys9tem of aceaunting

of others, it is easy to foresee that in a short

l)ut the passage I had selececd from lus report

MAY 28, 1936
has already been read by my honourable
friend who preceded me (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). The Shipping Register of August 10,
1932, contained the following editorial statement:
The true greatness of the harbour of Montreal lies in the surpassing personnel of our
harbour commissioners over the past 100 years.
They -have been men of vision and courage,
and they have built for the future. The
history of every commission during the past
century tells us of this foresight, of this
determination to keep Montreal in the foreground of world ports.
Let me quote what Sir Alexander Gibb
said in an address before the Canadian Club
of Montreal in April, 1932.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: What is the honourable
senator reading from?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE:
A report in a
newspaper, the Montreal Gazette.
"There is no navigation more remarkable
in the world," are the striking words used by
him to describe the ship channel between
Montreal and Quebec. He goes on to say:
"The success of your engineers and their
predecessors in bringing the ocean to Montreal
bas revolutionized the position of Canada as
a unit in the world markets.
The St.
Lawrence is in fact the vital cord of Canada.
"The running of your ports, the services
that are provided for ships, the aids to navigation, the wireless directional finding stations,
the lighting and buoying of the St. Lawrence
ship channel and many other matters are such
that you need fear no comparison with other
countries of the world.
"Before I left Great Britain to come out
here on this occasion, I took the trouble to
make some inquiries from British shipping
interests, to learn the views they had on the
principal Canadian ports. I am glad to say
that, without exception, and to my surpisefor I am well acquainted with those who go
down to the sea in ships-I received nothing
but
favourable
answers.
If
you
have
succeeded in satisfying the ships that come to
your harbours, you have been more successful
than many other countries."
Well, under what system were all those
great accomplishments brought about? Under
the system that bas prevailed in this country
for more than one hundred years, the system
of local autonomous harbour commissions.
And if such a system has made Canada "more
successful than many other countries," as Sir
Alexander admits, and bas won only favourable comments from the highly critical class
of navigators, as Sir Alexander said he was
surprised to find it had done, why take the
risk of changing it?
After reading Sir Alexander's report, Colonel
W. I. Gear, of Montreal, stated:
It seems that Sir Alexander had to bear
some unknown influence and only repugnantly
accepted the suggestion of substituting centralization for local autonomy. For, whilst he

391

is always clear and firm in his conclusions,
when it comes to centralization he only says:
"I am strongly impressed with the importance
of the suggestion."
And Sir Alexander said that just after having
said, in the same report:
That the development of the harbour commissions has in fact not been handicapped in
the past is due rather to the breadth of vision
that bas characterized the individuals responsible, than the departnent itself.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: And he goes on:
Conditions have now changed, and I am
satisfied that the continuance of strict departmental control would not allow the elasticity
that is above all essential.
The last Montreal harbour commissioners,
Messrs. Trihey and Raymond, stated in a
report, dated February 3, 1933, to the Minister of Marine:
Sir Alexander Gibb, if he was critical of
errors made by individuals, could in no way
attack or depreciate the system itself, to
which Canadian navigation owes its astounding qualities and its commanding place in the
forefront.
In the third place, honourable senators,
it is said that the Bill aims at "preventing
local harbour commissions from forcing unwise expenditures and uneconomie constructions." This statement sounds well, but it
means very little. As far at least as the
harbour of Montreal is concerned, the development of that great port has been notably free from unwise expenditures and uneconomic constructions. The honourable the
Minister of Marine seems to be lamentably
unaware of the workings of what are known
as party politics. If he had had more experience of these things be would realize, as
everyone who has been a harbour commissioner realizes, that most of the lobbying in
connection with harbours is done in Ottawa.
Contractors and lobbyists who have been unable to get satisfaction from Ministers of
Marine have even gone to Prime Ministers.
And how often 'have we not seen honourable
ministers going to Halifax, to Saint John, to
Quebec, to Vancouver, to Montreal, yes, and
to Three Rivers, and at political meetings or
dinners making promises of elaborate programmes of construction and expenditure at
the harbours?
The checking of unwise expenditures and
uneconomie constructions, if any such constructions were advocated by the harbour
commissions, would be a simple matter, and
does not require the complete upsetting of
the present system of port control. Should
the technical officers of the Department of
Marine feel that any proposed works are not

SENATE

392

necessary, the Department can prevent construction by refusing to give its approval.
In my opinion, this third reason put forward
by the honourable the Minister is a mere
beating about the bush in an attempt to
find some excuses for this Bill. The suggestions contained in this third reason are
unwarranted by the facts, and do nothing
to strengthen the arguments advanced by
the honourable the Minister in support of bis
proposed legislation.
Now I come to the most interesting point
of all. The fourth and last purpose of the
Bill is te "remove a weak link in the system
between the local boards and the Minister of
It is perfectly true that there

always Las been a weak link, but through
whose fault? I cannot conceive how the bonourable Minister can have the temerity to
destroy local autonomy and "penalize" regional
boards by annihilation when he himself admits
that the whole guilt is on the Department of
Marine. The honourable Minister, when introdutcing the Bill, stated in, the Lower House
on March 24, as reported in the Commons
Hansard, at page 1525.
Another weak link in the system as found
by experience is that between the local boards
and the Minister of Mai-le, who is supposed
to control expenditure.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Mr. Speaker, I rise
to a point of order. I submit it is against
the rules of the Senate to attack a member
of the other House. I recollect being called
to order for a similar breach.
The bonRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
ourable member attacked the wrong person.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I am referring to
a public document. As I said at the opening
of my remarks. I do net want to attack the
Minister. He continucd:
The total staff at Ottawa which bas had to
act as contact witl the harbour boards bas
been one officer known as the Supervisor of
Harbour Boards, and his entire staff bas consisted of one clerk and two stenographers.
'Tlie result lias been tîat there has been
delay in approving recommendations coming
froin ports.
No wonder!
Thie delay lias not been the fault of the
Minister. but is (lue to the difficulty he
experiencel in getting accurate information
whiri would permit him to decide on questions
submitted to im.
We might paraplrase Pi" reasoning thus:
because the Department of Marine never had
an adequate staff to act as a strong link
between the Minister and the local boards,
the harbour boards must disappe-ar! Since the
honourable gentleman says it has not been the
fault of the Minister if hi- department was
lHon.

Ir.

RAINVILLFE

not organized efficiently to supervise the business of the ports, then it was the fault of the
harbour boards! If the case for centralization
was sound, I am sure there would be no need
to have recourse to such prowess of "logic"
to support it.

This delicious piece of dialectic reminds me
of the "good faith" of the wolf in the famous
fable of LaFontaine. Always ready-to blame
anyone but himself, he turned to the lamb
and said, "If it is not you it must be your
brother."
The Gibb survey should have been focussed
in the Department of Marine, as it was there
that the lack of an adequate organization was
se obvious. The department was without a
chief engineer. Did the honourable gentleman know that? For five years there had
been no Dcputy Minister, and the department
was allowed to go on the rocks-possibly to
justify this proposed legislation.
Although it was not the fault of the harbour
commissions, they were compelled to pay the
cost of this inquiry, as if Sir Alexander Gibb
had been employed by then. When a portion
of the cost of that survey was billed against
the Montreal harbour board, the commissioners, always keenly intent upon the proper
management and control of it, finances asked
the Department of Marine by what authority
they had been prcsented with the bill, and
furthermore, upon what authority they were
empowered to pay it. Accordingly payment
for the survey had to wait until an Order in
Council liad been passed enjoining the various
harbour commissions to pay tbeir share, calculated according to the importance of the
ports. Without considering whether this procedure was absolutely legal, the commissioners
felt much the same sensation as bank cashiers
experience when held up by bandits. Our
feeling was the more acute as we knew, what
all honourable senators must know by now,
that the real trouble was not with the barbours. but with the Department of Marine
itself. I may add that an extra. touch of
piquancy was given to the situation by the
conviction that we were being ordered to pay
for our own abolition.
Honourable senators, those who have had the
experience of port administration have always
felt the need of a permanent "central supervising board." But, instead of replacing the
local boards. it should operate as a body to
advise the Minister with respect to board
problems and demands, and to receive, check
up and promptly deal with communications
from local harbour commissioners. Such a
board, or strong link, has always been an
urgent need net only for the harbour commissions. but also for the Department of Marine.
Now we have that central board, made up of

MAY 28, 1936
most competent men. As Sir George Perley
rightly pointed ont to the honourable Minister
of Marine on the floor of the Lower House:
"You have your central board now. Why this
Bill?"
Sucb a central body, however, can neyer replace the locally interested 'boards, and in
giving life to it there is no need to destroy
completely a system wbich bas produced the
best of resnîts, nor Vo destroy the moet
precions incentive to progress and enterprise:
local interest of men who take pride in their
town"s acbievernents, men who put into their
work brain and experience, enthusiasm and
sentiment.
Civil servants and officers attached to a
port, with only the salary they get from it
to encourage them, will neyer be capable of
the achievements realized up to this day by
local business men.
This Bill is wrong and bad. It is just a

mere mechanisma that can be satisfied by the
simple routine of accountancy. It is above

of business and to find attractions for new
business. As a business enterprise, it has Vo

it bas to, enjoy free initiative. The life of a
port. like that of all business, is a life of
figbting againat keen competitors. That is
why dry bnreaucracy is always so deadly to
sncb activities. We have bad an experience

undertakings wbicb were held in the clutches

leaning on public funds to ýpay for ail political abuses or errors. and deprivied of the
necessary buman incentive.
Tbe experience of Canada and of the world
makes these facts perfectly clear. Local
autonomy is responsible for the growth, success and astounding advaneement of our great
harbours. Bureaucracy tbrougb centralization. wbicb had been tried in other countries,
particularly in France up to 1920, bas been
put aside for ever as a paralysing influence,
and there bas been a return to a system of
local autonomy. wbicb is freer than ever
before. Great Britain, more than ever,
favours local autonomy as a means of progress and success. In Italy, the ]and of
governmental centralization par excellence,
the freedom of action and autonomy of barbours bave becn widened, although there is,

9

as there sbould be here, a central commission
of great efficiency acting as a co-ordinating
link between the minister and the local
boards. I should like some one to point out
one country wbere the system proposed by
this Bill is in operation.
In connection with this proposed legisiation. thinking people are beginning to ask
themselves, "Wbere is this country beading?" As the years go by we in Canada
seem to be witnessing an ever-increasing
tendency on the part of governments to
interfere with local autonomny and private
initiative.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Six o*clock,.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Already we have
the Dominion Government in control of railways. banking, radio, grain trade. etc. The
provinces have faithfully followed suit : they

Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators. when we rose at 6 o'clock 1 had pointed
ont various classes of business over which
the Dominion and the provinces now have
control. Even the cities are w'aking up to
the fact that ap.parently the function of authority-I mean government-is to interfere
as far as humanly possible in legitimate
private and local enterprises. We now have
the sorry spectacle of cities imposing income taxes on their citizens. The latest
and present scbeme is to take the harbours,
the very gateways of our country's trade with
the ouier world. ont of the bands which have
so faithfully and splendidly developed them,
and place them under the direct administration of a centralized btireatcrqcy.

charges. To-day the freight rates on all commodities are twenty per cent higher. I make
that statement not subject to correction, for
I know what I am talking about.
Let me take one commodity with which I
am most farniliar-live stock. This, by the
way, is a very important branch of agriculture.
I do n:>t intend to discuss it now, but some
day fron the floor of this House I shall tell
honourable members about the value throughout Canada of the cow, or to use the French
equivalent, the old vache.
The habitant
owed his success to the old vache and the
taureau. Then I shall tell of the wealth they
have contributed to Canada since the days
of Champlain. Am I not correct?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Très bien!

Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Honourable senators,
I am talking on behalf of the man on the
land. I do not find any fault with the port
of Montreal. God help you. I recall that
when I was a member of the other House a
loan of $15,000,000 was granted to the Harbour
Commissioners of Montreal, but you would
not give us a cent for the Hudson Bay port.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: We paid full interest on that loan.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: You were supposed
to, but I do not know whether you ever did
or not. You got $15,000,000 and you kept
running to the Government for money every
year that I was in the Commons. I never
knew when you in Montreal were not hard up.
You neglected us on the Prairies. We are
still struggling there.
Yes, I remember the port of Montreal in
the days of Joe Beef. I worked very hard
on the water-front with an honourable gentleman who used to do my business, but who has
since passed to the Great Beyond. I refer to
Robert Bickerdike.
The honourable leader
of the House will remember him. He was a
fine man. I saw the port of Montreal develop
in the early days, and I should like to see
it just as active to-day as it was then. What
bas gone wrong with you?
I think the trouble is that between Montreal and Quebec there is a point where the
ship channel is not deep enough. I remember
going down the river in the old Carthagenia,
of the Allan Line, when she bit a boulder and
shipped so much water through the hole in
her side that we bad to transfer our cattle
and other cargo to another boat. I do not
like shipping my cattle from Montreal; I
prefer to do so from Quebec. We have had
more wrecks on the St. Lawrence between
Montreal and Quebec than we have ever had
out of Hudson Bay.
What do you say about the Hudson Bay
and Strait? Some newspapers have said that

395

there is nothing up there but polar bears and
icebergs.
I have a number of newspaper
clippings dealing with the Hudson Bay Railway and the Hudson Bay route. Allow me
to cite this specimen from the Ottawa Journal
of May 8, 1926:
The Journal editorials don't care a tinker's
curse what Col. Harry Mullins, or Mr. Murphy,
of Neepawa, or Hon. Arthur Meighen, either,
thinks about the Hudson Bay Railway. We
may live too far from the Red River to be
navigators, but we also live far enough from
the influences which keep the Free Press from
mutinying, to be captains of our own souls.
Finally, Mr. Meighen has not promised ta
build the Hudson Bay Railway.
In another editorial of that year the Ottawr
Journal said:
Nine million people, with a debt of
$2,300,000,000 plus staggering provincial debtsIt gives us a lot of stuff about debts. It
wanted to stop the building of the Hudson
Bay Railway. The project was blocked and
checked and damned since it was first mooted,
forty-five years ago. Hudson Bay and Strait
are navigable. Those who say they are not
are mistaken. An old friend of mine, the
late Dr. Schaffner, some years ago mailed me
a list of sailings out of Hudson Bay, and these
extended over a period of five or six months.
We have never been given a fair trial in our
efforts to develop shipping out of Hudson Bay.
It has been said that the Bright Fan was
scuttled. I do not know whether it was or
not, but I heard the evidence of the ship's
officers at the inquiry here in Ottawa. One
of the men told me in my room on the other
side of this building that only the third officer,
a young stripling, was on the bridge, and he
hunted all around the bay to find an iceberg
until he bit one.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:

He was supposed to

Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Well, they sank the
Bright Fan and tried to give the Hudson Bay
route a black eye. But they did not succeed.
That route is navigable. Let me say something more to the honourable member from
The
(Hon. Mr. Rainville).
Repentigny
Hudson Bay route is a good route for live
stock from the Prairies of Western Canada.
The rail haul is not as long as to Montreal,
and the live stock do not suffer so much
shrinkage as on the longer route. I know
some honourable senators here will confirm
what I am saying.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable
gentleman state how much mileage is saved
by the Hudson Bay route?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
miles.

Five hundred

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: We save a thousand
miles. Yen mcm bi- rail?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 1 mean if you ship
fromn Saskatcbew 1 n via Hudson Bay.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: It is 400 and some
odd miles to Hudson Day and 1.*4,00 odd
miles to Montreal. I stand tobo corrected on
those fig-ures. For the information of this
Heuse I mav say chat the sbirinkage of cattie
on tbe long baul down fromn Western Canada
ce Montroal represents a considerable financial
loss.
In the thrce great Prairie Provinces ire have
a iast area of 758.0ý00 square miles, a big
portion practically idle, very little of it in
cachi province under cultivation. Much of il
is fertile and capable of developmont. I have
beard th,- que-dion frequontly. "What is the
malter wich youi in tho Wesýt?" I reply, "It
is transportation, and nothiog else." True,
Pros idence bias been against us for thrce
vears. I admit, bonourabl1e mnombers, that last

svnpflprospects. I get letters from ail
os <r the Wcst saying, "Wre shaîl likely takze

I regret tbat sone bonourable mieibrs
make statements about tho Hudson Day route
in an actcmipt to discourage ocir friends in the

Caniada. I say unless you make a man
suice--fnl on tbe land it is impossible to keep
bim thrre. I repeat, tbe transportation
charge-s ho bans to, pay to got bis commodities to
the markets of tbe world are too excessive.
Mai- I remind honourable members that on

would be no difficulty in handling so large a
vessel on the route,-provided it was properly
strengthened and protected in the forward
part. Of course, heretofore only vessels of
smaller size have been used, because ships of
larger capacity have not been required.
You can take any vessel right up to the wharf
in deep water.
The consensus of opinion is that Hudson
Bay remains open all the year through and
that the ice does not extend beyond thirty
or forty miles fron the shore. The strait is
also open for the greater part of the year,
and would probably be open all the time except
for the ice which comes down late in the
autumn from Fox Channel and obstructs
navigation in the strait. It was generally
conceded by the eight witnesses who gave
evidence on this point that the aids to navigation which might he installed along the strait
would greatly facilitate the passage and considerably extend the season of navigability.
While no one was able to speak witlh certainty as to whether the cod-fish were plentiful
in the bay or not, there is no doubt as to the
strait.
Friends of mine who have fished there say
the strait is filled with cod-fish.
All the rivers flowing into the bay teem with
fish, and walrus and seal are also found in
large numbers in the strait. No doubt as
soon as the Hudson Bay route is established a
very large and lucrative fishing industry will
be established there. Recent discoveries have
shown that the country surrounding Hudson
Bay is strongly and richly mineralized, particularly in gold and copper.
Your Committee make the following findings
upon the evidence adduced before them:This is the finding of the committee. I hope
I am not tiring you, honourable members, by
reading it. After I have finished with this I
shall not give you any more quotations. But
this is what the committee of the Senate said
in 1920:
(1) That the Hudson Bay route is feasible
and will probably in time be profitable.
(2) That the season of navigation under
present conditions is at least four months in
length and may by reason of improvements
in aids to navigation be considerably increased.
(3) That in the opinion of this Committee
sufficient care was not taken in the selection
of Nelson as the terminus of the railway, and
that the Government should not make further
important expenditures upon this port without
first making a new and thorough examination
into the relative merits of Churchill and
Nelson as a terminus for the railroad.
(4) That the waters of the strait and rivers
tributary to the bay.teem with fish and valuable marine animals, and we believe that the
bay is equally well stocked, but there has not
yet been sufficient data collected as to the
extent of the fisheries of the bay to enable
an authoritative statement to be made as to
their value.
(à) That the mines already discovered in
the Hudson Bay district are of sufficient
number and richness to indicate the existence
of great potential mineral wealth.

(6) Your Committee feel that they cannot
too strongly endorse the valuable suggestion
of AIr. Stefansson as to the cultivation of the
reindeer and musk ox, and would urge upon
the Government that the Department of the
Interior be empowered to take hold of this
matter, earnestly taking advantage of what has
been done in this regard by the United States
Government.
(7) Your Committee, although it is somewhat outside the scope of their mandate, cannot close this report without making some
reference to the national value of the explorations of Vihljalmur Stefansson. He has completely revolutionized our ideas of the region
within the Polar Circle. He has demonstrated
that it is possible for white men to live and
thrive in that northern region though drawing
from no other resources than those afforded
by the country itself, and lie bas proven that
those lands which were looked upon as barren
and utterly worthless will eventually be a
valuable asset to Canada.
The Committee
ventures the hope that the Canadian Government -will not be unmindful of the great services performed by Mr. Stefansson, whose
reward so far bas not been commensurate with
the national importance of the work he has
accomplished.
(8) Your Committee expresses its thanks to
the gentlemen who have voluntarily come
forward and given valuable evidence upon the
important matters under consideration.
(9) Your Committee submit herewith an
extract in narrative form of the evidence given
before the Committee, and beg to recommend
that 1,000 copies of this report and the
extract of the evidence be printed in pamphlet
form for general distribution.
All which is respectfully submitted.
Geo. W. Fowler,
Chairman.
That is what the Senate committee said
about the Hudson Bay route, but there is not
a word about it in this Bill.
Canada is a wonderful country, bounded
by three oceans. On the east we have the
Atlantic. All the people do not live down
there; there are some of us in the West.
On the north we have the Aretie, and to
the far west the Pacifie. What a wonderful
heritage we have if we treat it right. Yes,
Canada is a wonderful country. But all we
heard in the West was, "Grow wheat! Grow
wheat!" One could not get in a word about
live stock, or talk in a practical way about
mixed farming and the value of putting something back into the land instead of stealing
everything out of it. But, thank God, we are
-coming back and are going to get on our
feet, and I want to live to see the day when
the Prairie Provinces will be what they should
be, and once again will be contributing their
millions to the East.
Let me give you some figures. When I came
over here from the House of Commons my
files were all mixed up, but I have found a

what we contributed at one time. From

the Bill, and to the more lengthy presentation
of the case by the honourable senator who followed him (Hon. Mr. Rainville).
Reference was -made by the honourwble
leader to the 'harbour of Halifax. May I point
out that the work of developing that port was
done -under two administrations, Peter Jàck
being Chairman under the Liberal regirne and
Mr. Hetberington under the Goverament led
by the Right. Hon. R. B. Bennett. The work
carried on by both these commissions was
fairly extenýsive and has been of great value
to the port. In both cases I tbink it was
carried out economically and satisfactorily,
and there was no justification for any honest
criticism for a breatb of suspicion as to the
operation of Halifax harbour under either of
these administrations.
1 bad the good fortune, or at least the
experience, of being a member of the haýrbour commission of the second most important
harbour of Nova Scotia, and that undezr two

dou'bt. Sir Jobn Kennedy practically made
the port of Montreal possible as a rendezvous
of large modern ocean steamers. W-hom, may
I ask, bas the Minister on bis staff to-day that
in any respect eaun measure up -to the capacity
of that great engineer? I sbould like to ask
the honouraible leader if be can answer that
question.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I sbould not like

knew of his work.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Also I woufld aïsk

for them by nature, and expected of tbem. by

To pass tbis Bill, I arn convinced, would be
to take a retrograde step suggested. by
persons wbo bave had no experience in
barbour board necessities or operations, and
whicb. in my judgment would lead to an
expensive experiment and d-isastrous failure.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, tbe honourable gentleman from New
Glasgow (Hon. Mr. Cantiey) bas asked two
or tbree questions beginning witb tbe word
"Why." May I commend to bim an answer
that was given hy a very prominent person
and is to *be found in Hansard of anotber
place, commencing at page 1537?
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to make any extended remarks
on the principle of tbe Bill. because 1 understand the measure will be referred to a
committee for study. There are certain
features in tbe Bill of wbich 1 do not approve.
For instance, I am not at ail convinced that
the port of Montreal would be better administered in future by tbree commissioners
living in Ottawa, wbo would bave eigbt otber
ports to look after, than it bas been in tbe
past by tbree commissioners living in the
city of Montreai. Stili, 1 amn not unwiihing
to vote to bave the Bill referred to a coinmittee. But I wish to bave it clearly understood that in so voting I shall fot bind my..
self as a supporter of tbe principle of tbe
measure, nor sball I be precluded from voting
against the measure if, wben sent back from
the committee, it bas not been acceptably
amended.
There is one otber tbing I want to say,
and it arises out of tbe remarks made by the
bonourabie senator fromn Marquette (Hon.
Mr. Mullins), wbo wants tbe port of Cburchill
inciuded witbîn tbe provisions of the Bill.
He might make a saw-off witb the bonourable senator fromn Repentigny (Hon. Mr.
Rainville) wbereby tbe words "barbour of
Montreai" wouid be strieken out of tbe Bill
and replaced by the words "barbour of
Churchill."
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I bave listened witb much interest
to the remarks of my bonourabie friend from.
Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and tbose of my
honourable friend fromn Repentigny (Hon. Mr.
Rainville). Tbey told a very interesting story
of tbe development and administration of tbe
port of Montreal. I amn quite sure that we are
ail proud of tbe way in wbich the barbour of
Montreai bias developed. But, as my bonourable friend from Repentigny bas recognized,
tbere was a weak link in tbe systemf of ad-

SENATE
ministering the port. inasmuch as, according
to law, the administration came under the
direct authority of the Minister of Marine.
In very many instances when an appeal had
ta be made to the Minister a prompt reply
was not forthcoming and there was dilatoriness
or apparent indifference at Ottawa. I think
that very fact justifies the measure before us.
Why was there that difficulty in administration
between the source of finance, which was in
Ottawa, aid the administration, which was in
Montreal? I believe it was due to the fact
that the sen-e of authority here was net
paralleled by a sense of responsibility. The
Minister of Marine, realizing that the ports
were being adminiteredi by commissions, felt
that the responsibility for administration had
been placed on shouiders other than his; and
ie had not even a staff to attend to the requirements and demands of the ports. I think
that thero was the weak spot. Henceforth that
authority which has hitherto been delegated to
the various ports will remain with the Dominion Government, which will furnish the funds
and cxrcise responsibility through the Minister of Marine.
Why is it that we are to-day discussing this
measure. which the late Prime Minister mdicate he himself would have sponsored three
or four years ago? The Right Hon. Mr.
Bennett declared in express terms that he was
glad the present Government was bringing in
a Bill which he had attempted to have introduced in the last thre.e or four years when he

report thereon. Sir Alexander recommended
centralization. and this Bill might well have
been presented by the late Administration. In
fact the right honourable gentleman bas
stated that he wanted tc act on the report.
I know very well the commendable work
donc by the various harbour commissions that
for a number of years have directed the affairs
of the port of Montreal. In this connection
I commend the record of my honourable
friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and
my .honourable friend froin Repentigny (Hon.
Mr. Rainville). But we are facing a situation which calls for large expenditures on
dredging and harbour developments.
Since
the money must come from the federal
treasury, I believe the ports should be placed
undor the direct control of the federal authority.
It would be interesting to read what bas
been said about the inefficient administration
and extravagant expenditures of some barbour boards. Even in Montreal there have
been large expenditures. If I am not mistaken, my honourable friend from Repentigny
mentioned that $5,000,000 was spent on
electrifying the railway system of the port.
Also a large cold storage plant was erected
at a cost of $2,000.000. I understand it is
about to be closed.

vhat le hiiseif had in mind. I am not sure
that he approved of all the terns of the
mea-ure, but he heartily supported its principle.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I admit that.
Hon. Mr. DANDLRAND: Yes. My honourable friend from Repentigny has criticized
the reasons given by the present Minister
of Marine for the presentation of this Bill,
but lie might have criticized in even stronger
ternms the reasons advanced by the Right
Hon. Mr. Bennett. I will read only the
opening words of his address in the other
House, though in this I may be violating the
rule governing the relations between the two
Houses.
Riglt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, lîcar.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps I had
better not quote the right honourable gentleman' remark-s. It is sufficient to say that the
policy of the present Administration is a
complete endorsation of the Right Hon.
Mr. Bennett's. He appointed Sir Alexander
Gibb to inspect our national liarbours and

this Bill with the approval of the late Administration.
If the Minister of Marine feels it is necessary to appoint advisory committees in the
large ports, perhaps he will do so. There
is nothing in the Bill to prevent him.
I have asked myself if there should not be
some advisory committee for the port of
Montreal, composed of representatives of the
Board of Trade, the Chamber of Commerce,
the Shipping Federation and the Corn Exchange, and perhaps the railways, who have
large interests in the port. Whether this is
feasible the future will show.
The purpose of this Bill is to centralize
control where the responsibility lies, with the
authority that disburses the funds. If I were
to tell honourable
members how many
millions of dollars have been expended on
our national ports, witlh very little return of
interest, J think they would understand why

these ports should be directly under the control of the Federal Government.

tbat I expected this; Bill would reach us tonigbt from tbe Commons.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Can the honourable
gentleman explain why Churchill is flot
hrought witbin the scope of this Bill?

The motion was agreed to, and tbe Bill was
read tbe second time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I believe it is
because Churchill is under the direct control
of the Minister of Marine and the Minister
of Railways.
Reports have been disseminated by part
of the press of my province that althougb
the administration of these seven ports is
being centralized in Ottawva, the Government
would niot dare toucb the port of the holy
city of Toronto. The answer is obvions: that
port is under the direct authority of the city
of Toronto.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
bonourable leader of the House if it is bis

Righit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, in the hope that the bonouiable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) wvill carry the message to his
coileagues with the imipress of bis own authority, I want to cail his attention to the
fact that time is far outstripping the progress of the Admini.stration in putting through
the other bouse its programme of legisiation. We have had a numbor ef measures;

wholly outside the range of prex ious commitmonts. I arn apprehensive there may be stili
more of that character. I amrnfot objiecting,
but I amn ernpbasizing that if there are. we
in tiîis aSsembiy are going to be very crowded.
Thiere are some measures which were referred
to in the Speech fromn the Throne and of
whicb we have heard nothing at ail since. One
I have in mind is very important indeedunless, as I hope, it bas been abandoned.
We in this Housýe are vcry desirous, and I
know the bonourabie leader of tbe Governmient is, tbat we give assiduous, careful and
worth-while attention to ail measures which
corne before us, and we are anxious to avoid
the condition of baste and careiossnes. that
too often is forced upon uis as the session
approaches its close.

JUNE 2,1936
1 hope this opportunity will nlot be missed
of calling to the attention of the Administration the need of getting measures here. There
is one which it seems to me has been before
the other House for an inordinate length of
time; a measure of real consequence. I think
it is better to speak now than to be complaining when it is too late.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I thought
that my right honourable friend would not
be so timid as to stop at naming the bis
that interest him, but would perhaps mention them. I know of two or three bis of
considerabie importance which are now before the House of Gommons. One of them,
a Bill te amend the Bank of Canada Act,
was, I think, adopted yesterday. It may
reach us shortiy. We should make an effort
to dispose of the legisiation which has now
reached us, so as to clear the decks for action
when other bulis arrive. We may be obiiged
henceforth to sit more d.ays in the 'week than
we have been doing when legisiation was not
forthcoming. It may now be crowding upon
US.
I have heard it stated in some quarters
that we inay expect prorogation at an eariy
date. I do not see how we can possibly leave
Ottawa before the middle of July if ail the
legisiation on the Order Paper of the
Gommons is proceeded with.
0f course,
shouid it be sent over to us very late, it will
be for us to de-cide whether we wiil give the
proper time to it by delaying prorogation.
The same question always arises towards the
end of each session.
I have for some weeks been mentioning
to my coileagues the necessity of providing
the Senate with legisiation, because of the
fact that we were marking time. Wc have
a couple of bis before the Banking Coinmittee and the Railway Committee. I hope
we shall be able to make some progrcss with
those this week, and dispose of the bis
which are down to be read a second time
to-morrow, in order that if by the end of
this week or early next week the Gommons
are pleased to send us important legisiation
we may be able to give it ample attention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We can by
the end of this week or eariy next week
deal with ail the legisiation received from
the Commone to-day. I have gone through
the measures and there is no cause for much
delay in any of t.hem.
Rather than be accused of timidity, 1 wili
go so far as to say that the measure which
I referred to as being inordinately delayed in
12745--26 J

403

reaching us is the Bill to amend the Canadian Nationai-Canadian Pacifie Railways Act.
A further measure which. I had specificaliy in
mind, and froin the long deiay of which I
drew the inference and hope of abandonment,
was the contempiated repeal of section 98
of the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The last mentioned piece of legislation, if it comes to us,
should be fairly weil known to this Chamber.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, this Bill is on ail fours with Bill E,
which is down to be read a third time tomorrow, but I desire* to draw the attention
of the Senate to the fact that they are nlot in
absoiuteiy the samne form as Bill Y, which we
have just passed, providing for the payment
by the borrower of a flat rate of interest. I
do not intend to dilate upon the difference
between these bilis, but would say that the
present Bill and the one to come before us
to-morrow are similar to Acts aiready on
the Statute Book with respect to the operation
of small Joan companies. The charges to be
imposcd by these companies are not as ciearly
defincd as those under Bill Y, which wc have
just passed. Because of a desire on the part
of the Departmcnt of Finance and the Department of Insurance te uiake clear the real
charges a borrower would have to pay. the
Banking and Commerce Committee have been
working on a model Bill with respect to such
companics. We are now approaching the end
of the session and, as the model Bill has flot
yet come out of the committee, we are passing these Bis B and E in order that the
promoters may have legislative sanction for
their operations. I desire simpiy to say that
these companies wiil come under the general
Act when passcd, whether it be this session
or next session.

the Dominion and as to the necessity or otherwise of provincial concurrence in amendmnents.
Without expressing any opinion upon that question, the committee feels that in the present
case and at the present time it is advisable
in the interest of harmany and unity that
there should be consultation with the provinces with respect to the adoption of a definite
mode of amendment or the enactment of amending legisiation which migbt seriously alter the
legisiative jurisdiction of the provinces and
the Dominion.
Then came the federal elections of the
l4th of October, 1935, and in December the
conference between the Dominion and the
provinces. This conference lasted four whole
days and was the scene of discussions on a
number of questions, including toýurist traffic,
transportation, mining, agriculture and market
organization,
unemployment
and relief,
finances -and, lastly, constitu-tional matters.
The conclusions upon this last-mnutioned
«item are surprisingly short: they -are ail contained on a single page of the printed report,
from which it appears the conference adopted
the principie 'that Canada, like aIl the other
Dominions, should have power to amend its
own Constitution, provided thýat -a metbod of
pracedure therefor satisfactory to the Dominion Parliýament and the provincial legislatures
be devised. The Minister of Justice was
authorized to convene aýt an early date a
meeting of appropriate officiais of the Dominion and of the provinces to, prepare a draft
of such method of procedure, ta be submitted to a subsequent conference. It was also
decided that a conference should be beld at
an early date after such draft had been prepared. ýto consider such method of procedure.
It is desirable that this consultation take
place at a conference that is serious and
really national, representing ail shades of
opinion, including that of ail parties and
authorities likely to be able ta help in the
solution of the problems. It would be. a pity
if sucb a conference were a mare formality,
under the cloak of which a littie group might
proceed safely and legally ta bring about
amendments they are determined to have
made at ail costs, and irrespective of consequences. Let us proceed in this case at
least as fairly as our forefathers proceeded at
the conferences of Charlottetown and of
Quebec, at wbich were voted the seventy-two
resolutions. -the very basis of aur Constitution
as em-bodied ini the British North Amnerica
Act. Let us take -ah the time necessary for
the efficient organization of this conference
and give -as much publicity as possible to,
the debates. After 'aIl, the matter is not
urgent. And in the last few years we have
had so many conferences of alI descriptions
that one more would not be ton, great a
burden upon our budget.

The province of Quebcc, with respect to
wbich tbe problems of language, education
and religion are so often raised when that
province's relations with Ottawa are involved,
cannot be altogether quiet or indifferent
wben it is proposed ta substitute a new
organie law for our- present Constitution.
It is weIl known tha-t even despite the guarantees given by the British North America
Act with regard to represen-tation, education,
language and religion, Quebec has only tao
often found that the underlying principles of
these matters have been in jeopardy. Sad
experience has often madle Quebec realize
how. vigilant she must be in order that bier
rigbts in our Confederation may be respected.
As Abraham Lincoln said, "Eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty."' I tbink, tbougb, that
I am faithfully representing the feelings of
my people in Quebec when I say that the
systema of government established by the
British North America Act bas beený found
by Quebec an easy systemn u.nder wbicb to
live. On the other hand, I am sure that no
one underrates the value of the contribution madle by Quebec to the working out of
our Constitution and ta our country's progress.

AMERICA ACTTO AMEND
CONTINUED

Hon. Mr. BOURGEOIS: Honourable members, when we adjourned I was just saying
that it would be sheer carelessness not to
notice the contribution made by the people of
Quebec to the working out of our system and
to the country's progress. French Canadians
are worried by the thought of the Constitution of 1867 being changed for a new organie
law the workings of which would depend, in
part, upon a certain element of our population. I refer to the immigrants. I have no
more desire to depreciate these people than
had the honourable member from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Sauvé) w-hen speaking upon his
motion concerning the question of immigration. Nevertheless, this is an element of which
it eau be said, euphemistically, that they have
not the same ideals as ourselves. Neither
have they the ideals of which our fellowcountrymen of English descent are proud. This,
I say, is a real cause of worry to the French
Canadians, who would regard modifications of
the political system affecting their material
welfare as mere trifles in comparison with
changes which affected questions of language,
religion and national traditions, and which,
frankly, would thrcaten their very nationality.
The question before us, honourable senators, is so very important because of its
political consequences, and involves so much
friction on racial grounds, that it has brought
about in certain milieux theories which by
thcir very nature are bound to ruin any confidence my compatriots could have in any
new régime which might be substituted for
the present one. For instance, though it may
be claimed that the British North America
Act, being an Imperial statute or law, is not
technically a contract, it has always been
Ir. DANDURAND.
Hon.

understood in the province of Quebec, and has
always been taught in our schools and universities. that it was the ratification by the
Imperial Parliament of a pact or contract
between the Canadian provinces and that its
basis or origin was a compromise, a treaty;
in other words, to use the expressive language
of the Roman law, that it was a "consensus
ad idem placitum" and therefore could not
be changed or amended without the assent of
all parties to it.
This conception of the British North
America Act was also accepted by the most
distinguished statesmen of both parties, Liberal and Conservative, who have since had the
honour and the burden of governing this
country. It was the conception of the men
who were known, and rightly so, as the
Fathers of Confederation, for in 1865, when
the old Canadian Parliament studied the
schemes for Confederation. Hon. John A.
Macdonald, later the great Sir John A. Macdonald, tabled the following resolution:
That an humble address be presented to
Her Majesty praying that she may be
graciously pleased to cause a measure to be
submitted to the Imperial Parliament for the
purpose of uniting the colonies of Canada,
Nova Scotia. New Brunswick, Newfoundland
and Prince Edward Island in one government
with provisions based on certain resolutions
which were adopted at a conference of delegates for the said colonies. held at the city
of Quebec, on the 10th of October, 1864.
Parliament passed this resolution, and thus
prayed that Her Majesty would enact a law
in accordance with the Quebec resolutions.
During the debate Hon. John A. Macdonald
made some important remarks, which were
quoted by my honourable colleague from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) the other
night. I shall quote them again, because we
can never do it too often. He said:
I trust the scheme will be assented to, as
If any important changes are
a whole....
made, every one will feel itself absolved from
the implied obligation to deal with it as a
treaty, each province will feel itself at liberty
to amend it ad libitum, so as to suit its own
views and interests; in fact, the whole of our
labours will have been for nought and we will
have to renew our negotiations with all the
colonies for the purpose of establishing some
new scheme.
On another occasion he said:
As I stated in a preliminary discussion, we
must consider the seheme in the light of a
treaty.
There are also declarations made by the
Hon. George Brown and the Hon. D'Arcy
McGee. Brown stated very clearly:
We have but made a compact subject to
the approval of Parliament.

JUNE 2, 1936
And D'Arcy McGee said:
The result of our proceedings is the document that bas been submitted to the Imperial
Parliament as well as to this House and which
we speak of as a treaty.... Question it you
may, reject it you may, or accept it you may,
but alter it you may not.
Such public statements, the explicit character of which leaves no doubt regarding their
meaning and far-reaching effects, were then
brought to the attention of the publie by the
Hon. A. A. Dorion, who, on various grounds,
was averse to Confederation as contemplated.
He said:
It is a grave matter, since the scheme is so
objectionable, especially as we are gravely told
that it cannot be amended in the least, but
that it is brought down as a compact made
between the Government of this country and
delegates from the governments of Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince
Edward Island-as a treaty which cannot be
altered or amended in any particular.
When the Confederation Bill came to the
House of Lords in England, Lord Carnarvon,
on the 12th of February, 1867, made the following remarks:
The Quebec resolutions ... with some slight
changes, form the basis of the measure that
I have the honour to submit to Parliament.
To those resolutions, all the British provinces
in North America were, as I have said, consenting parties, and a measure founded upon
them must be accepted as a treaty of union.
And while quoting Lord Carnarvon let me
add another statement, which was made by
the Minister for the Colonies during the same
month. He said:
Lower Canada, too, is jealous, as she is
deservedly proud of ber ancestral customs and
traditions; she is wedded to her peculiar institutions, and will enter this Union only upon
the distinct understanding that she retains
them.... The Coutume de Paris is still the
accepted basis of their Civil Code, and their
national institutions have been alike respected
by their fellow subjects and cherished by themselves. And it is with these feelings and on
these terms that Lower Canada now consents
to enter this Confederation.
And now may I quote Professor Arthur B.
Keith, who, in his most remarkable work
"Responsible
Government and the Dominion," writes as follows:
It was most expressly recognized in 1907The distinguished professor is discussing the
procedure that led to the British North
America Act of 1907.
-- by the Imperial Government that the Federal
Constitution is a compact which cannot be
altered save with the consent both of the
Dominion and the provinecs.
The late Sir George Ross, in his study,
"The Senate of Canada," expresses the same
opinion. He says:

407

It was not until 1907 that the Parliament
of Canada formally admitted the doctrine of
consent. The Subsidy Act of 1907 ... was
based upon the assent of all the provinces by
the Legislature or representatives, and thus
Parliament recognized, for the first time, that
the Union Act was a treaty to be amended
only with the consent of the parties that were
bound by it.
Now may I be permitted, honourable
members, to recall that when the Bill which
was 'to ke the Statute of Westminster was
submitted to the Imperial Parliament the
Hon. G. Howard Ferguson, then Prime
Minister of Ontario, sent a memorandum to
the Right Hon. R. B. Bennett in which he
stated that the Statute of Westminster should
not give power to the Parliament of Canada
to amend its own Constitution unless it contained a clause protecting the rights of -the
provinces. In the same memorandum he said
that the Resolutions of Quebec were of the
nature of a contract, and he added this,
according to the Toronto Globe of September
20, 1930:
No re-statement of the procedure for amending the Constitution of Canada can be accepted
by the province of Ontario that does not fully
and frankly acknowledge the rights of all the
provinces to be consulted and to become parties
to the decision arrived at.
When, in 1930, Mr. Ferguson was protesting
against any modification of the Constitution,
the Imperial Conference, held in London
during October and November, 1930, decided
to give the Canadian Parliament the opportunity of taking all proper measures to enable
the provinces to expose their views concerning the Statute of Westminster as contemplated. The provinces approved of the Statute
of Westminster as
proposed
for their
consideration, but I think it was at the
request of the provinces that article 7 was
adopted, namely:
That nothing in this Act shall be deemed
to apply to the repeal. amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867
to 1930.
At all events, the provinces were consulted
before the adoption of the Statute of Westminster. Professor Keith concludes that because of that interprovincial conference there
now exists a constitutional reason why the
provinces should be consulted before the
Constitution is amended: the consent of the
provinces has been officially requested and
obtained in one case, and in questions of this
kind custom dominates all other considerations.
Some university teachers, as we all know,
have strongly opposed what they call the
"contractual theory."
It must be acknowledged that their views are in perfect accord
with a certain attitude of mind easy to detect
here and there in the political and the official

SENATE
world. There seems to be what I should call
a psychic complex, un état d'âme. When there
is a desire for any modification, whatever it
may be, the contractual theory is felt to be
an obstacle. In an article published in the
Canadian Bar Review of June, 1935, Professor Norman Rogers, the present Minister
of Labour, describes this obstacle as dangerous
and even alarming. Professor Norman A. M.
Mackenzie, of Toronto. does not go so far as
that. As for the views of Professor Kennedy,
as stated before the special committee in
another place last year, they have been already
quoted here by the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
Honourable senators, I have no hesitation
whatever in rejecting the thesis so skilfully
presented by such distinguished professors.
I even go so far as to declare that this thesis
is dangerous. In my opinion it is contrary
to the spirit of Confederation and conflicts
with certain statements of the greatest importance, such as the one I have already
quoted in support of my opinion. It involves
a serious menace to the unity dreamed of by
the Fathers of Confederation. Let me state
my thought more explicity. The Fathers of
Confederation foresaw tiat the federation
could not be realized by legislative union.
and that policy was therefore cast aside. If
I am not mistaken, the Hon. A. A. Dorion,
who strongly opposed the federation as then
contemplated, was under the impression that
the British North America Act would be
the first step towards legislative union. He
said:
The Constitution is in the nature of a
compact, a treaty, an] cannot be changed.
A little later on he added:
So far as Lower Canada is concerned, I
need hardly stop to point out the objections
to the scheme. It is evident, from what bas
transpired, that it is intended, eventually to
form a legislative union of all the provinces.
The local governments. in addition to the
general Government, will be found so burdensome, that a majority of the people will appeal
to the Imperial Governnment for the formation
of a legislative union.
It is very interesting to compare this statement with the remarks made by a number
of witnesses before the special committee of
another place last year, to the effect that
Canada has too many members of Parliament
and that our system of government is too
expensive.
The point I am trying to make is this. At
all costs we must prevent the spirit of our
Confederation pact from being undermined
througb the provinces being robbed of their
right to be consulted and effectively treated
as parties to this pact; and we must be
Hon. Mr. BOURGEOIS.

equally determined to prevent the bringing
about indirectly of the very thing that the
pact forbids to be brought about directly,
namely, a legislative union.
It is argued that Canada is the only
Dominion without the power of aiending her

constitutional organic law-a situation considered
especially
unbearable
since
the
adoption of the Statute of Westminster,
whiclh acknowledges Canada to be a sovereign
nation. But this is by no means the first
time that Canada's position has been considcred. It was considered in the liglt of a
special situation dating froim times prior to
the passing of the Statute of W.esminster,
indeed from the very days of the adoption
of the British North America Act. May I
inake a final quotation?

sion of power of amendment was to be found
no doubt in a realization of the fact that
Canada was a country populated very largely

by two distinct races and considerably divided
upon religions questions. It was for the express

There is a principle, bonourable nembers,
universally acknowledged by all juri-ts and

powers of enacting a law and of amsending or
repealing it are correlative. If you suppose
the Federal Parliament to be granted the

you must of necessity implicitly acknowledge
that the same Parliament has the power of

end could constitute nothing less than a

complete repeal of our Constitution.

JUNE 2. 1936
after a certain time-at present it is impossible to determine how long, but because of
the situation created by the immigra-tion of
foreign elements from Europe, which has
been already mentioned, the time might be
relatively short-all guarantees given by the
Act of 1867 to my countrymen of Quebec in
respect of language, nationality, traditions,
and representation at Ottawa, would be struck
out and the descendants of the pioneers of
this country would become mere Helots,
deprived of all those things they consider
most sacred. That is what is feared. If
modifications to our Constitution are necessary, let them be introduced by the common
consent of all parties interested, through the
medium of the Mother Parliament, the
Parliament of Westminster. which is unprejudiced in this respect and not supposed to side
with one faction or another.
Honourable members, the Constitution of
1867 has sheltered all the provinces of this
our Dominion, and under its shadow they have
grown and prospered. This great tree has
from time to -time been pruned and branches
have been lopped off, but it has victoriously
withstood the tempests. The trunk still
remains robust and upright, pointing towards
the heights of liberty for the exercise of rights
and of faiths. Under this protection our
fathers spent their happy lives. Nothing
prevents us, their descendants, from enjoying
the same peace and the same pleasures that
they enjoyed. All -that we need to do is to
care for one another and understand one
another better. But for our own sakes we
in our turn must protect this great tree against
any parricidal wounds. And by all means let
us not cut it down. lest we be crushed to
death.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honcurable members, the subject under discussion
comes before us not in the shape of a motion
calling for a collective expression of opinion
from this House, but of a notice by the
honourable member from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) that he would draw the
attention of the Senate to, and inquire of the
Government its intentions respecting the question of the Parliament of Canada being given
authority to aýmend the British North America
Act.
I think there is not much prospect of any
authoritative answer coming from the Government, for at the opening of this debate we
were told by the honourable leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that he was not
speaking for the Government, and, moreover,
the Hon. Minister of Justice stated in another
place, some days after this debate began,
that:

409

The matter is still being investigated, and
when the work is completed the result will be
submitted to the various provinces before it is
placed before the House for discussion.
So if the subject is still being investigated we
cannot expect any announcement, at the present time at any rate, of what conclusion the
Government has reached.
The question proposed by the honourable
gentleman from Hamilton has, however, produced already this good result, that it has
afforded an opportunity to honourable senators to express their opinions about it; and
that opportunity I also wish to take for a few
minutes.
The question whether or not this Parliament
ought to have power to amend the Constieution of Canada is not altogether new. I remember hearing it mooted on one or two occasions
in the House of Commons more than thirty
years ago. I think I may say that, as it has
been brought to public notice lately, it is a
comparatively new revival of the old idea,
and that it comes now as a sequel to the
report of a committee of the Imperial Conference held in London a few years ago. That
report is, I suggest, the foundation of the
movement-if it be a movement-which is now
engaging public attention in this country.
The report was quoted to the House by the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain). It appears in the
Senate Hansard of April 30 at page 219.
Speaking of the "self-governing communities
composed of Great Britain and the Dominions," the committee reported:
They are autonomous communities within
the British Empire, equal in status, in no way
subordinate one to another in any aspect of
their domestic or external affairs.
This statement at once invites attention to
what was at that time the status of Great
Britain as a self-governing community. Britain
was then and had for ages been, to the
knowledge of the whole wide world, an independent sovereign state. Was Canada? This
report states that as self-governing Dominions
within the British Empire Canada and the
other Dominions were of equal status with
Great Britain herself.
Without discussing at the moment the
implications of any such statement, let me
say simply that Britain was then, as she is
still, by declaration of the Parliament of
England made more than four hundred years
ago, something more than a kingdom: Britain
was an empire. We occasionally hear statements by public speakers or see in the newspapers remarks to the effect that the term
"British Empire" is meaningless; that there
is no such thing; that the expression is simply

410

SENATE

a 1oose. inaccurate one intended to include
Ai the Dominions over which Great Britain
lias control. I submit that this is a mistaken
idea. and for confirmation of the opinion I
arn expressing I rely upon a recital of status
whichi is now more than four hundred years
old. In 1533 the statute of 24 Henry VIII,
chapter 12, \vas passed by the Parliament, of
England was then alone in its
England.
position as an independent sovereign state.
I mean there had been no union yet with
Scotlaod. Ireland was to some extent. no
doubt, under control of the English King and
the English Parliament. The recital in the
statute. coucbed in the lang-uage of that day.
is as follows:
WVereor, as we should say now, whereasWhere by dyvers sundrie olde autentike
histories
and cronicles
it is manifest]y
deciarcd and expressed that this realme of
Engiand is an impire. and so hath been
aceepted in the wvorl(le, governed by one
suprenue lieede and King hiaving the dignitie

The statute then proceeds to the cnacting
clause which by its express words is made
to apply to ail the described causes

domnîions, or marches of the samie.
The I'iog's dominions at that time, outside
Engiand it-zelf. would be Ireland. the Ile of
Man. and possibly seine litIle setulement, on
this side of the ocean, on the shores, of Newfoundland. Ncwfoundland and Cape Breton

thirty-fivP or forty vears before, and already
there wàs fishing on the shores of N_ýewfoundland,. and Englisli ships were cros,,ing the

in thc pos<'....ion of England for some trwentyfive

passed, and the Channel Islands, a part of
the ancicoýt Duchy of Normnandy, which then
owed, as to-day thcy stili owe, ailegiance to
the IKing of Eogland as Duko of Normandy.
So, though these were the only dominions
of the King outside England itself, there was
in 1533 that statutory declaration by the King,
Lords and Commons of England that this
realm constituted an empire. That was not,

express statement by the Parliament of EngHoui. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

land thatt there was at that day such a thing
in Europe as the Empire of England.
More than one bundred years later, when
the union with the kingdom of Scot]and had
become perfccted, and' when Great Britain
became an international entity. if was no less
an empire than England alone wiýtb its
dominions 'had b>een before. By the Capitulation at Que'bec in 1759, followed by the
treaty of cession i0 1763, Canada entered an
empire, and that empire is an enduring thing
to this day, just as much as, in fact a great
deal more than, it wvas four lhundred years
ago.
Accordingiy there is no propriety in any
suggestion tha t speaking of the British Empire is a loosýe or inaccurate method of describing the domtnions over which the King
rules. 1 should think there wvas a great deal
more of inaccuraey in the effort to substitute
for that grand old phrase any such collection
of words as "the Commonwealth of British
Nations."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: That
new idea is founded, of course, upon Ibis
resclution or report of the Imperial Conferecc to wliich I have alrcady ailuded. Now,
I do not intend to aýttempt any discussion of
what its words, whichi I have already montioned. may or may not mean or imply.
They are not embodied in any statute. They
have nlot the binding force that any parliamentary declaration wvould have.
If the
Parliament of Great Britain had used that
language and declared that the Dominions
were of equal status with Great Britain berself, I cannot, sec any point on whichi such
a declaration u ould have been less than a
declaration of independence.
If the Pachaiment of Carnada biad then declared, or shouid
00W drelare, by aoy legisiative enactmnent, or
by resolution, that Canada had from that; date
forward the saine status that Great Britaiîi
lias, I do net see any respect in which that
wouild faîl short of an absolute declaration
cf Canadian independence. But thiis resolution of delegates ho an Imperial Conference
bas no sucb binding effect. It is a statement
more of law, or of faet, or of mixed law and
fact, than anything else. It is simply an assertion ýby those who make it that Ibis is the
present state of things in regard to the relations between the Dominions and Great
Britain; and any such statement. unlcss followed by legislation, does not make the law
of the land.

JUNE 2, 1936
There has since been legislation which, it is
sometimes said, makes a difference in our constitutional position. I refer to the legislation
known as the Statute of Westminster, 1931.
I have noýt brought into the House any copy
of that statute, but I want to refer very
shortly to what it does or what it does not
do. It is the Act of 22 and 23 George V,
chapter 4, assented to on the 1lth of December,
1931. That statute, in its preamble, uses
the phrase "British Commonwealth of Nations." It uses it in this way. The preamble
states that the Crown is the "symbol of the
free association of the Members of the British
Commonwealth of Nations." The statute
speaks of the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth
in relation to one another, but there is no
enactment of any change in our constitutional
relations. The enactment is simply to widen
and extend the authorrity of the Canadian
Parliament in certain defined respects. We
can now legislate in regard to matters which
we were not free to legislate about before that
statute was passed; but there is no suggestion
other than the words I have read-4here is
certainly no suggestion in any of the enacting
clauses of that statute-that our constitutional
relations with Great Britain have been in
any wise whatever altered by the passing
of that Act.
So, departing from that legislation, let me
refer to what is undoubtedly our Constitution. The British North America Act, of
course, recognizes that Great Britain is an
empire. We all know, I think, as a matter
of historical fact, that the British North
America Act was drafted, or the wording of
it revised and settled, by the great parliamentary counsel who was afterwards Lord
Thring; and to a gentleman so thoroughly
versed in parliamentary law as he was, it
would have been elementary that Great
Britain and its possessions or dominions overseas were in every respect an empire. So,
after stating that the provinces have expressed their desire to be federally united
into one Dominion, the statute opens with
the recital:
And whereas such a union would conduce
to the welfare of the provinces and promote
the interests of the British EmpireAnd later on, in section 132, the statute
deals with the power to enforce treaty obligations, and enacts that:
The Parliament and Government of Canada
shall have all powers necessary or proper for
performing the obligations of Canada or of
any province thereof, as part of the British
Empire, toward foreign countries, arising
under treaties between the Empire and such
foreign countries.

411

Britain, then, by express statutory declara,
tion and recognition, was an empire as lately
as seventy years ago. It has never ceased
to have that status. It is an empire to-day.
Canada is not. Canada has not control over
any dominion or possession outside its own
borders. Britain has. That is the difference.
That is what constitutes Britain an empire.
Think of the scores, I might almost say
hundreds, of Crown colonies, possessions,
protectorates, dependencies and other dominions of the King. The word "Dominion,"
which was allotted to Canada upon the passing of the British North America Act, was
no new word in English legislation. I have
quoted the phrase in the statute of 1533,
where it was intended to apply to any of the
King's dominions; and "the King's dominions"
were, of course. the proper words to describe
possessions or territories under the control of
the King and outside the realm, or kingdom,
or empire, of England itself.
Then, coming to the practical question of
what we are discussing here-whether there
would be any advantage or propriety in the
Canadian Parliament being given, from the
Parliament at Westminster, the power to
amend the present British North America
Act--I suggest that it would be most illogical
to have any such condition of things in
existence. If Canada were an independent
sovereign state, then, of course, everyone
would say no authority except the Parliament of this country had power ,to alter,
amend or in any way change our Constitution; but Canada is not in such a position,
and this Parliament of Canada is not a
Parliament of unlimited authority. Every
Parliament in Canada-not only the Parliament of the Dominion, but also the Legislature in each province-is necessarily of limited authority, because it has not been given
and does not possess the wide, the plenary,
authority over the whole field of legislation
which is possessed by the Parliament of
Great Britain or of an independent sovereign
state. Upon the Union-upon the creation,
not of one Parliament for Canada, but of one
central Parliament and four provincial legislatures, each of them-the central Parlia-ment just as much as the others-had to be
limited in its jurisdiction, by the necessity of
the case. That affords at once a very strong
reason why no one of these parliaments
should have jurisdiction over the Constitution of any other of them. That was, as to
the provincial legislatures, taken care of by
section 92 of the statute, and not without
good reason. Section 92, which assigned to
the provincial legislatures their legislative
jurisdiction provides that:

excluisively make laws in relation ta . the
subjects liercinafter enamerated:

taking this new grant. they were each of

given ta the Dominion Parliament. and far
the best of good reasons.
In 1857, when the agreement for entering
into this Union was under discussion and
being arrivcd at by the provinces, wauld any
anc oi them have listened ta the suggestion
that this new Parliament which they were
then by their agreement creating, or intending ta bring into existence, should do aa it

Cool ederatian? Why, any such idea would
have been fatal ta the wholc projeci ai

they did create by 'their ag-reement. an.d by

which existed in 1867 exisi still. and indeed
have been intensified in the last seventy
years.
I believe I am not going toc) far when 1
express the settled conviction that if Canada
were given power ta amend its own Constitution Coniederation coald nai lasi. I
think of many reasons why, but 1 instance jusi
ane. Every anc of us as a member ai Parliament has a right-inat a privilege, bai a rightta use the French language if hie pleases.
'Would thai lasi if the Canadian Parliament
bad power ta take it away by the stroke ai a
pen, by cancelling that clause in the British
North America Act? Well, I can anly say
that it is within my memory, and I think the
memory ai everyone who listens ta me, that
anly thirty or forty yeara ago there was in the
province af Ontario a very decided, very
strang an.d very dangerous agitation, led by
one ai the most promninent men af the day,
iii which ai numeroas meetings and in many
newspapers it was insisted that Canada neyer
Hon. S~ir ALLEN

AYLESWORTH.

could remain British uniess it had one flag,
one language. and, I believe, one navy-at any
rate, that there must be but one language.
Well, someone may say: "There is no danger.
The Senate would prevent the abolition of
thai right to use eltiier language." But whai
if there were no Senate? And how long
would the Senate last if some of the radicals
in the country wanted to gei rid of it and had
power ta do whai they wanted, as a resait of
being in a maI ority in the House of Commans
after a general election?
Ai ail evenis, apari from these practicai
suggestions of possibilities, the possession of
the power to amend our own Constitution
would at once endanger the peace, the barmony, the order and good governmeni of
Canada. So long as thingas remain as tbey
nowv are. so long, as we can get any amendment we w-ant by uniting upon an address ta
the King, stating that such an amendmeni is
desired, so long shall we be safe enough. But
if amneodmients to the Constitution could be
made with much grcater rapidity, if ail that
wa needed was action by the two buses
boLre-or by one House, if there were only
one-there would be a very different state of
thiing-s in this country.
1 cannot anderstand why anyone should
want the change. The word "subordinate" is
often uscd by those who. are advncating anme
change, as thoughi that word were offensive, as
ihougli we mast flot for one moment admit
tiat we are sabordinate ta anybody else in
the world. Well, 1 can only say that ail my
lufe I have rejoiced in the thoughit that, 1 xas
a British sabjeci, and I see nothing aniy more
humiliating in the word "subordinate" than in
the word "subject." The whole trouble is in
the Latin prefix. IL signifies being under
somebody or other. But we are ail under the
control of legitimate authority. And we
should be none the lesa sa if we declared
ourselves to be equal ta Great Britain or any
other state in the world.
I can only say thai I am unable to see any
possible advantage in making the suggeated
change, and it aeema ta me there are tremendous perils in it.

PRIVATE BILL
THIRD READING

Bill E, an Act to incorporate United Credit
Association.-Hon. Mr. Little.

CUSTOMS BILL (CANADIAN

WATERS)

SECOND READING
Hn.RAOUL DANDURAND moved tise
second reading of Bil 67, an Act to amend the
Custems Act (Canadian waters).
He said: Heneurable senaters, the main
bjeet of this Bil is b amend the Customs
Act se that any maritime belt beyond the
tbree-mile limit in wbich limited pewers of
contrel are to be exercised shah be specifically
defined independentiy of the definition eof
territorial waters, and to provide thsat sueb
definition sîsaîl net purport to give Canada
juriscdictien over foreign vesseis up to a
imit.
addition to this main
purpose otîser provisiîons are proposed ivîiels
viii bave tie effeet of aiding officers in the
prevention of snsuggling by sea.
Thîee wbe baie examined the Bil xili have
ebrŽerved that it is intended te strengthen antismugghing measures. The Act of 1928 extended our riglt of seizure of Canadian ships
te the twelvc-mile limit. In 1931 this provisin
seizuire ias fereign te appiy the the right ef
of made sbips if te owncrs were
demiciled in Canada. This was ebjected te
bv many countries, including Creat Britain.
as it appcarcd te be an extens.ien et our
territorial autberity beyend the threc-mile
limit. The purpose ef this Bill is te reroxe
tie embarrassment causcd by the affirmation
et that principle.
Tir zones are created. Outside tie threcmoile limait Canada will only exercise police
jurisdictien over i essels reg-istered in Canada,
unrcgitercd vessels, such as speef beats, oîned
Canada. and sucb etiser i c-seis as the
Governe in Council mai specify by procamation. The extensio-n -f the jurisdiction
te other vessels, by proclamatien, vould only
foliow consultation witb the interested geveroment. The Unitedi States in 1924 ebtainefi
our agreement te seizure et Canadian ships
heyond the threc-mile limit if they centravcned laîrs et the United States and wcre
irithin one hour's sailing distance ef the shere.
nder this measure ive may ask for reciprocity.

JUNE 3, 1936
I may say that by clause 3 a certain difficulty wilI be obviated. Under the pýresent
legisiation, if a vessel carnies liquor which does
not appear on ber manife.st the master is
penalized for produicing a false manifest, but
if there is no manifest the master is free from
the operation of the Act. Under this Bill ail
ships carrying liquor will be compelled to carry
a manifest.
We may go into committee on this Bill tomorrow. A few amendments will have f0 be
made to some of its clauses.
I now move the .sccond reading of the Bill,
seconded by the honourable senator fromn
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King).
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, I have read this Bill and
have macle an bonest effort to understand it.
I can see notbing in it that is worthy of
objection on the second reading. Therefore,
as far as 1 arn concernied, I consent to the
second reading now.
When* I read the Bill it struck me that the
title surely was wrong. There is a Customs
Act, but there is no "Cu.stomns Act (Canadian
waters) ." Howcver, we can amend that.
Other objections also bave been brougbt to my
attention lately, but tbey refer wbol.ly to,
matters of detail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I intend to morve,
or to bave it moved, that tbe words "Canadian waters" be stricken out. As a matter of
fact we bave no "Customs Act (Canadian
waters>)." It was explained f0 me that the
brackets were the saving feature of tbe title;
tbat tbey bad been employcd before, and were
somefimes used in Britisb legisiation. However, I believe the words "Canadian waters"
may welI be taken out.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move tbat
this Bill be referred to Committee of the
Whole to-miorrow.
The motion was agreed to.
WATER CARRIAGE OF GOODS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second rcading of Bill 68, an Act respecting
the Carniage of Goods by Water.
H1e said: Honouï-able memberis, the puýrpoee
of this Bill is to bring our law into line witb
thec British Act passed in 1924.
Riglit Hon. Mr.
American law too.

MEIGHEN:

And the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the Amenican law recently passed.
There is some background to this legisiation, and I shahl give in a few words what
bas governed these enactmnents. Tbe common law countries willed that carriers transporting goods by water sbould be bound to,
deliver tbcmn in good order and condition at
the point of destination, saving only the act
of -the King's enemies 'and the perils of the
seas. Carriers began to con-tract ouf of the
common law f0 sucli an extent that f heir
own terms, imposed on shippers, appeared ini
the buis *of lading and set aside tbe general
principles dominating this matter umder the
commun law. Wben I speak of tbe'common
law countries I mean not only the United
States and Great Britain, but ail the Dominions and other counfries of the Empire
as welI; for I recognize that there are many
counfries wbich go fo make up the British
Empire, althougli at fimes, more especialhy
at tbe League of Nations, they do not
appear f0 formn part of fthc Empire. Many
statutes were passed in order to curli the
practice of contracting out of the common
law. Our prescrnt Can-adian Acf, and also fthe
English Act, -have tbe effect, of preventing
that practice. The purpose of tbe Brussels
agreement, wbicb carried fthe consent of
twenty states, was to check it. The Brussels
agreement intervened as a sort of arbiter lietween the rigbt of the shippers and the right
of tbe carriers.
Our law disagreed in some slight respects
wif h tbe British enactmnenfs. If is being
reconciled now by the present legisiation. In
fact, the Bill before us is identical wif.h the
Britishi Carniage of Goods hy Sea Act of 1934.
The word "Canadian" bas beýen substituted
for "Great Britain and Nortbern Ireland," and
"waters" bas ben substituted for "sea."
With these few remarks, which may not be
as clear as I intended fhem. to lie, I subrmit
flic Bill for second neading.
Hon. J. J. HUCHES: Honourable members,
I was unavoidablY ouf of tbe House for a few

ivas moved, and I think if is on tha.t Bill I

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Item 703 provides
that a Canadian who takes a trip to the
United States and romains thýere forty-eight
bours may bring in goods up to a value of
$100 free. but such person, will flot be allowed
the same privilege again until after four
montbs have elapsed. It is pointed out that
this favours a persan who goes to the United
States with the definite intention of purcbasing $100 wortb of merchandise, as eompared witb a person whose trips to the United
States are more frequent than once every four
rnonths and who may desire to bring back
with him each time only a few dollars' wortb
of gonds. I do flot kn'ow how the situation
can be deait with. People living along tbe
border point out thore is an element of injustice in this item. They say the law waq
intended to ben-efit Canadians who make
casual visits to the States and bring back a
few articles with them, whereas the fact is
tbat such people would ho penalized if their
trips were not at least four months apart. On
the other band, anyone who sets out with the
purp ose of bringing in $100 worth of goode
every four moniths bas the privilege of doing
so. I do not know wbether any l-aw could
be passod to coven this situation, but perhaps
some d.epatmental regulations could ho issued.
Hoa. Mn. DANDURAND: I do not see how
any injustice would be .done. The item
benefits. tourists who go to the United States
and bring back presents, wearing apparel,
and other goods. Surely in being given that
pnivilege thnee times in the yean Canadian
citizens are being liberally treated. If a
tourist brings back only a f ew dollars' worth of
goods, tbat fact may be an indication of bis
desire or limitations. A lino must ho dýrawn
somewbore, and it seems to me tbat the lino
drawn by this item is judicious.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is not quite
my point. I will illustrate what I mean. Tbe
24th of May wa8 on a MondayHon. Mr. CALDER: Sunday.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The holiday wa.s
obsenved on Monday. It was possible for
people in British Columbia, by motoring to
the Unitod States on Saturday and returning
on Monday, to qualify for the priviiege under
this item. Altbougb tbe customs autborities
bad anticipated wbat would happen and bad
extra officers at Blaine, the port of entry
'betwe .thje etate of Washington and, British
Columbia, the rush of returning tourists was
s0 great that those who finst arrived at the
border on the afternoon of the 25th, after
being away exactly forty-eight hours, did flot
succoed in getting across the border until four
or five o'clock next mnorning. That indicates

the extent to wbicb advantage is being taken
of the privilege, and shows bow our own
merchants are affected in, consoquence. Howevor, the granting of the privilege is part of
the Government's policy, and I am flot dealing
witb it. My point is that the law was designed
to benofit touriste and not people wbo, go
across the border witb the deliberate intention
of bringing back $100 wortb -of goods. The
provision that the exemption shaîl flot ho
granted to anyone twice within a poriod of
four months is likely to work a bardsbip on
persons wbo make more than one trip in four
months and bring back a few articles incidentally.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why cannot such
a person buy a full $100 worth at once?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But the Iaw was
not designed to encourage tbat.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If a person has a
complaint on that score ho can bring in $100
worth at once.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I take it that the
Government, is desirous of getting as mucb
revenue as possible, but this item defeats
that purpose. I arn -told that people on the
frontier are making a practice -of going acroas
to tihe Ugnited States and bringing back gonds
to -the value of $100. Yet the man who bas
no intention of trading with American rather
than Canadian merchante wilI not be permitted to bring back even a few dcillers
worth of gonds if be bas received exemption
under 'this item within a period of four
montbs. My hýonourable friend says that
advantage eau 'ho taken of the privilege
through the purobase of $100 worth of United
States merchandise at one time. That should
not bo the policy of the law, but it is.
Hon. Mr. BEAUIBIEN: Wbat daes my
honounable friend suggest?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The only roason
I am bringing up the matter is to suggest
that. the technical officers -of the Departmen.t
of Customs examine the situation and keep
their eye on it witb a view either to subsequont legislation or to appropria-te regulations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Thon my honourable friend is asking me to draw the attention of the department to, bis -views, nobt o
bring him information on the matter tomorrow?
Hon. Mn. GRIESBACH: It is quite beyond
me to suggest a remedy. I do not imagine

coalition fer the purpoeocf changing the
legislativo union creatod by tho Imponial Parliamont inte a federol union betwoen the two
Canados, and porhaps, under a wider seheme,
wîth theoether British North Ameniran provinces. By a mcst fortunote oincidonce, at
the satemonament Nova Scetia, New Brenswtck and Prince Edward Island were seeking,

JUNE 3, 1936
to arrange a tripartite union in order to
create a stronger, more progressive, and more
efficient government.
They had even convened a conference at Charlottetown.
The
Canadian Coalition Government could not
miss suoh an auspicious opportunity. It
sought admission to the Charlottetown conference.
Such
admission
was willingly
granted. A delegation of the Canadian
Administration went ýto the
capital of
Prince Edward Island. The wider scheme
of a general confederation of the British
provinces
was
advocated
and
virtually
agreed upon, and it was arranged to convene a greater conference at Quebec during
the fall of 1864.
The Quebec conference opened on the
10th of October. It
was composed of
thirty-three members: twelve for the united
province of Upper and Lower Canada; five
for the province of Nova Scotia; seven for
the province of New Brunswick; seven for
the province of Prince Edward Island; two
for the province of Newfoundland.
It was
decided at the outset that in the deliberations each province should have one vote,
and that in voting Canada should be considered as two provinces.
I do not intend, honourable senators, to
enter into a minute review of the proceedings. What I desire to emphasize in connection with the present discussion is the
special and paramount character of the
deliberations and of their outcome.
At the first meeting it was moved by
the Hon. Mr. John A. Macdonald, seconded
by the Hon. Mr. Tilley:
That the best interests and present and
future prosperity of British North America
will be promoted by a federal union under
the Crown of Great Britain, provided such
union can be effected on principles just to the
several provinces.
Let us pause a moment and quietly weigh
these words: "a federal union effected on
principles just to the several provinces." To
my mind, honourable senators, here is to be
found the corner-stone of our Constitution.
The provinces are willing to unite their
destinies in a confederation, but they want to
make sure that their entity, their provincial
rights, shall be safeguarded.
When we study the documents-unfortunately too scarce-relating to the Quebec conference, we find that constant assertion, and
sometimes the clash of these two principles,
of these two minds. It was soon obvious
that a number of delegates were intent on
giving to the Federal Parliament and to the
Federal Governmnenit the utmost plenitude of
powers, leaving to the provinces a somewhat
12745-27J

restricted jurisdiction; and, on the other hand,
that other delegates, wbilst willing to createa strong central government, were firmly decided to maintain the provincial jurisdiction
over a wide range of important matters. In
the first group we could point out especially
Mr. John A. Macdonald, Mr. Charles Tupper,
Mr. Alexander Tilloch Galt and Mr. Henry;
in the second, Mr. Georges Etienne Cartier,
Mr. George Brown, Mr. Thomas D'Arcy McGee, and Mr. Chandler.
It is a well known fact that Mr. John A.
Macdonald would have been favourable to a
legislative instead of a federal union, if a
legislative union had been possible. During
the debates on the proposed confederation he
made this frank statement:
As regards the comparative advantages of
a legislative and a federal union, I have never
hesitated to state my own opinions. I have
again and again stated in the House that, if
practicable, I thought a legislative union would
be preferable. But we found that such a
system was impracticable. In the first place,
it would not meet the assent of the people of
Lower Canada, because they felt that in their
peculiar position-being in a minority, with a
different language, nationality and religion
from the majority-their institutions and their
laws might be assailed.
Mr. John A. Macdonald was not alone in
that opinion. Many delegates made similar
declarations. I do not like to bore this
honourable House with too many quotations,
but may I be allowed to mention what .took
place at perhaps the most important sitting
of the Quebec conference, that of the 24th
October, 1864. The Hon. Mr. Oliver Mowat
is moving a series of resolutions defining the
powers of the local legislatures. A delegate
from New Brunswick, Mr. Chandler, states
energetically his dissent. He says:
I object to the proposed system. You are
adopting

a

legislative

union

instead

of

a

federal. The local legislatures should not have
their powers specified, but should have all the
powers not reserved to the Federal Government, and only the powers to be given to the
Federal Government should be specified. You
are now proceeding to destroy the Constitution

of the local governments.
Mr. Tupper then comes in and takes the
opposite stand. He deems that the Federal
Government should be vested with the widest
powers. According to his view, it is desirable
to have a plan contrary to that adopted by the
United States. Later on Mr. George Brown
declares that he would rather agree with Mr.
Chandler were it not that everything bas been
done to settle the matter in giving sufficient
powers to local legislatures. Evidently 'two
different minds are asserting themselves in the
conference. The discussion goes on. Mr.
Johnson, New Brunswick's Attorney-General,

420

SENATE

wants to sec enumerated flic powers of the
local governments and to give the rest to the
general government, but he is opposed to a
dual enumeration. At that moment, answering evidently to a strong utterance of Mr.
Georges Etienne Cartier on behalf of Lower
Canada, Mr. Henry, Attorney-General of
Nova Scotia, makes this vehement adjuration:
I would ask Lower Canada net to fight for
a shadow. We should not define powers of
the general legislature.
What was that "shadow" so feelingly mentioned by Mr. Henry? Nothing less than provincial autonomy. And at last, after all those
discussions, provincial autonomy wins the day.
The powers of the Federal Parliament are
enumerated in article 29 of the Quebec resolutions, including "all matters of a general
character, not specially and exclusively reserved for the local legislatures." But also the
powers of the local legislatures are enumerated
in article 41, "including all matters of a private
or local nature not assigned to the general
Parliament." And so the two enumerations
are adopted, and the two sets of powers are
defined. The result is the maintenance of the
provincial entity, of the provincial state, vested
with complete political institutions exercising
wide and exclusive jurisdiction: a LieutenantGovernor representing the Crown, a Legislative Assembly (House of Commons), and a
Legislative Council (House of Lords).
Nowadays we hear very interesting and
clever dissertations on the nature of what
was accomplished by the leaders of our people
in 1864-1867. Was the change then cffected
in our political status to be considered as a
confederation, or as a federation. or as a
confederacy? Did it not amount simply to
a new exercise of the Imperial sovereignty
for the purpose of enacting a new kind of
Constitution for the British North American
colonies? Is the British North America Act
anything more than an Imperial statute? And
so on.
I must frankly admit, honourable senators,
that whilst admiring sincerely the erudition,
the power of reasoning, the cleverness of tho-e
elaborate studies, I do not feel that they
should be the only rule, the only beacon,
in our appreciation of the proceedings which
prepared the birth of the Dominion of Canada. To my mind, we are faced not so much
with a question of law as with a question of
fact. Let us ask what actually took place in
1864 and the following years. In plain teris,
five British provinces feeling the convenience,
if not the necessity, of uniting to become
stronger, attempted, in the words of the
Hon. John A. Macdonald, to be found at page
32 of Debates on Confederation:
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS.

To form a Government upon federal principles, which would give to the general government the strength of a legislative and administrative union, whbile at the same time it
preserved that liberty of action for the
different sections which is allowed by a federal
union.
To that end these provinces, through thedir
appointed delegates, held protaeted oonferences to disoues that momentous project, to lay down the basis of the contemplated federal union, to frame the new Constitution, to fix the extent and limits of the
respective federal and provincial jurisdictions.
When all that had been done the same provinces sent their delegates to London in order
to get the Imperial seal affixed to the Constitution which they had freely und deliberately drawn. Having those facts in mind, we
must necessarily admit that our Confederation, our federal union, was born of the
deliberate will of the Canadian provinces, and
that the federal jurisdiotion and the federal
powers are a grant of these provinces.
This grant was allowed only after long
debates and strenuous efforts towards agreement. For this reason the framers of our
Constitution have attributed to it the character of a treaty. To quote again from the
speech of Mr. John A. Macdonald on the
Quebec resolutions:
The sclieme was not framed by the Government of Canada, or by the Government of
Nova Scotia, but was in the nature of a treaty
between the different colonies, each clause of
which had been fully diseussed, and had been
agreed to by a system of mutual compromise.
And again:
We must consider this scheme in the light
of a treaty.
And further:
If any important changes are made, every
one of the colonies will feel itself absolved
from the implied obligation to deal with it as
a treaty.
I should like to quote also the words of
another important member of the Quebec
conference, Mr. Thomas D'Arcy MecGee, the
great orator and publicist, as they appear at
page 135 in the Debates on Confederation.
He said:
All former impediments have been most
fortunately overcome-the treaty was concluded and signed by us all, and there it lies
on your table.
In the same speech, at page 136, will be found
this passage:
The result of our proceedings is the document that bas been submitted to the Imperial
Parliament as well as to this House, and which
we speak of here as a treaty.

JUNE 3,1936
After the review of ail these facts and the
citation of ail these significant declarations,
we cannot but conclude that the British
North Amerioa Act-which is virtually the
enaotmnent of the Quebec resolutions, with a
few modifications assented to by ail the
Canadian delegates-is essentially the ratification of the solemn and definite agreement
arrived at in 1864 by the provinces of Upper
Canada, Lower Canada, Nova ScQ>tia and
New Brunswick.
The preamble of the Act says:
Whereas the provinces of Canada, Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed
their desire to be federally united into one
Dominion under the Crown of the United
Kingdoma of Great Britain and Ireland, with
a constitution similar in principle to that of
the United Kingdom....
Be it therefore enacted and declared..
and so on. In presenting the Bill to the
Huse of Lords, Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial
Secretary, reminds his colleagues that it opens
by rcciting th.e desire of the severai, provinces
to be fedcrally unitcd. And during the ensuing debate Lord Campbell points out the
facet that the Bill is founded on what is termed
"the Quebec scheme of 1864."
To insist further would be on'ly a waste of
time. It is indisputable that our Confederation owes its existence to the initiative, to
the will, to the deliberations, to the agreement
of our provinces. Therefore we must admit
that no important change in our Constitution
should take place without the formai assent
of those provinces.
Would not the amend'ment which has been
spoken of be an important one? Ls not the
power of amcnding at will the British North
America Act a dreadifully serious one, and
before taking a questionable step should, we
not try to find why such right was not conferrcd by the enactment of 1867? This is
something to ponder over. If you scrutinize
the constitutional Act you will be faced, in
this particular connection, with a striking case
of discrimination. Under clause 92, which defines the exclusive powers of provincial legislatures, you will find the following:
The amendment from time to time, notwithstanding anything in this Act, of the Constitution of the province. except as regards the
office of Lieutenant-Governor.
Here is the power of amendnment conferrcd
upon the provincial lcgislatures. Now read
clause 91, whicb defines the exclusive powers
of the Federal Parliament. You will search
it in vain to find a similar power vested in the
central autbority. How shahl we explain the
inclusion of that enactment in one case and
its omission in the other? Shaîl we' say that
this is only a fortuitous lapse? One rannot
even whisper such an absurd assertion. No,

421

the framers of the Constitution abstained from
granting the power of amendment to the
Federal Parliament for the essential reason
that such an enactment woul-d have struck
a deadly blow at their constitution-al structure.
Give this power of amendnient to the Federal
Parlianient and you inevitably sound the
funeral knell of provincial autonomy. With
such a powerful weapon the Federal Parliament could subvert t.he provincial Constitution, encroeh on provincial rights, impair the
whole machinery of Confederation. I do not
mean that this government or that government would do so, but I say that the door
would be wide open to, 6uch a danger.
Obviously it is to avoid those evils, to proteet.
the "provincial state" againfst the possibleinfringement of the central power, that theFathers of Confederation abstained from
giving the right of amendment to the federal
authorities. In other words, although theframers of the Canadian Constitution-that is
to say, the provinces--willingly granted wide
and necessary powers to the central government, they kept for themselves the right toamend their Constitution, and refused, forvery good resns, te invest the central powerwith any such right.
What is spoken of now is nothing but
an attempt to secure from the Imperial
Parliament prccisely that power of amendment which was denied in 1867. In order
that such a move might be justified, the
assent of ail the provinces--I miean the
provinces through their legislatures-should
be previously obtained.
Furthermore, 1
must say that even ini that case I should
deeni it a very unwise and dangerous step.
It may be said that such an amendment
might be needed owing to special circumstances,, to the necessity of solving new
problenis or of curing certain economnic and
social diseases. But could not some other
means be devised? Could not othQr ways be
found to attain the same cnd? Surely the
federal and the provincial authorities could
arrive at a proper understandiug, in order
to reach the desired goal, without impairinq
our Constitution.
I know perfectly well that neither constitutions nor govemnments are endowed with
immortality. When we read the annals of
past centuries we note the fragments of
shattered political institutions Iying, as
dccayed monuments, along the highways of
history. Having in mind that fateful sight,
the protagonists of the proposed change in
our Canadian charter may ask us: "Do you

I would ask Honi. Mr. Ring to move that
these changes be made.
Hon. Mr. KING: I so move.
Righit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is just a
rearrangement?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, and sehedules A,
B and C, as amended, were agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yesterday the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) and the honourable senator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) asked
whether the $100 exemption on goods inchaded
in the bag gage of a Canadian returning from
abroad extended to each member of his
family. The department considers each member of the family is entitled to exemption on
$100 worth of goods purchased abroad, but
that goods purchased or obtained abroad by
one person cannot be included in the exemp-

tion of another. As to whether, for instance,
a man and bis wife and three adult daughters
could import 31,500 worth of goods free of duty
witbin a year, the departmient states th.at each
member could obtain exemption on $100 worth
of goods, provided the goods were brought in
after the expiration of four months from. the
time the last exemption was granted. In
other wordts. they could each obtain tbree
exemptions iýn one year.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do I undierstand
that the purpose of the amendment made to,
subsection 1 of section 6 is to allow the
Minister to fix the value for duty of imported
goods when they are subject to dumping
duty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend did not put bis question to me yesterday, as far as I remember.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No; I ask for bis
indulgence. I want to be quite sure that that
is the purpose of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would leave it
to my honourable friend to obtain the clear
interpretation wbich is generally to be had by
reading the Act.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I would remind
honourable senators that when the previous
Government was in power strong objection
wau taken to the idea of allowing a Minister
on bis own initiative to fix the value for duty
purposes. This amendment continues tbe
practice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn not quite
sure that we are following in the same rut.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It seems s0.
On section 3, French version corrected (reconsidered):
The CHAIRMAN: What is the explanation
of the French word in section 3?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The cxplanation
is very simple. The English word to be translated, crosiers, was rendered "croix." "Crosses"
is the correct translation. Hence the cdrrection. As honourable members are aware, a
crosicr is a bishop's pastoral staff.
The CHAIRMAN: There is to be no
change?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; "crosses" is
correct. 0f course my neighbour to my right
(Right Hon. Mr. Craham), not being a high
churchman, did not understand the word.
Section 3, as am-ended, was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported as amended.

the matter was thus deait with. Can it be
dealt with a second time? According to the
rules of the House, if a matter is once deait
with, it cannot be dealt with a second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The matter was
not deait with finally. The Banking and
Commerce Committee recommended that the
Address be amended by the omission of the
first part. Its recommendation was concurred
in. But the Address remains intact; it bas not
been amended. The Senate may now deal
with the first and the second part. The report
from the Banking and Commerce Committea
does not dispose even of the first part. The
Address is stili before us. The Sanate will
have to decide whether it will amend the
Address by striking out certain words. This
would still leave the other part to ba dealt
with.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I understand that
the report of the committee, striking out the
most important part of the resolution, bas
been accepted by this House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The report of the
committee has been accepted.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I understand ail
my honourable friend wants ýto do to-morrow
is to submit the AddressQ itself to tha House?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
The motion was agraed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may repeat
whiat I have just said in a summary way.
This Add-ress was referred to the Banking and
Commerce Commibtee, which reported, recomnmanding that the first part, ooncerning indirect taxation, be noyt concurred in. The
committee's report was agreed to by the
Senate. I refused to join in the acceptance
of 'the recommandation, because it deleted
haif the Address. I told the Senate the Address was the resuit of a conferance be-tween,
the provincial goveromants and the Faderai
Government, and that I had no mandate to,
accept any amendment.
In order Vhat the Senate may be informed of my intentions, 1 desire, as reprasenting the Govaruýment, to state them now.
The main objection which was brought to
our attention was the danger of each province setting up a tarit! barrier against the
other provinces. My right honourable frieud
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) urged me more
than once to bring the matter before my
colleagues. I bave done so. To guard against

425

that possible danger I ghall have one of my
colleagues move in amendment that clause 2A
be amended so as to read as follows:
(i) retail sales, other than of ail alcoholic
beverages, spirits, malt, tobacco, cigarettes and

cigare whieh are subject to, customa and excise

dtity or tax in Canada or other than of ail
goods and articles
province;

for delivery without the

This is the addition:
provided that such taxation does not favour
or discriminate agaiust the sales of any goods
or articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of eny province or of any country;
Then follows the second part:
(ii) the services of hotels, restaurants and
places of amusement or entertaiumeut; in order
to the raising of a revenue for provincial
purposes.
Truc, -other objections have been advanced.
We may diseuse them to-morrow when this
amendment is moved. 1 simply make this

explanation in order that the Senate may
be seized o>fmy intention when the Address is
taken up again. I have said that I propose
to -have -the amendment moved to-morrow,
but if another day is preferrad 1 shaîl naturally consent to postpouement.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I asic if this
proposai does flot really mean that the particular part of the Address which bas alraady
-been dehated will have to be debated over
again?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There will be another debate on the question we have de-

cided?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I have stated,
the Bankifig. and Commerce Committea made
a recommandation, which was agreed to by
ýthe Senate, but the Addrass itself was not
amendad.
Consequently the Addrass as a
whole still stands before the Senate. 1 have
given notice tihat 1 shaîl have this amendmient

moved, and then it can be discussed, and
accepted or rejected, as the Senate may deem
fit.

Hon,. Mr. CALDER: Honourabia sanators. I
do not think there can ha auy objection at ahl
to the course proposed by the honourable
leader of the Governmeut. As a matter of
faet, when the Seinate, a week ago, adopted
the report of the Bauking aud Commerce
Committiea d-ealing wjth this Address, the
honourabla gentleman might have proceeded
with tha Ad-dress. This was not doue. I am

JUNE 8, 1936
that people are not greatly interested in what
happens to the militia. Furthermore, there
are in the House of Commons a number of
members who are ready to make wild statements and accusations and to ask, "Against
whom are we preparing to make war?"-which
question is always embarrassing to the Government. That is the reason why the Government does not want this matter discussed.
I have asked for the proposal of the
Government not only in my private capacity,
but in my capacity as a senior officer in the
military forces-the second senior officer, as
a matter of fact-and as a senator, and I
have been refused the information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Should not my
I have a
honourable friend qualify that?
vague recollection that my honourable friend
was freely, though not officially, offered the
document in order that his opinion might be
obtained.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have not been
consulted or advised in any shape.or form.
I did ask the department for it, and was
told, first of all, that I might come to the
office and have it explained to me. I refused
that invitation. Then I was told I might
have the document confidentially. I refused
to accept it confidentially, because as a member of Parliament I cannot accept papers
of that sort confidentially until I know what
is in them. I did think that in my capacity
as a senator and in my capacity as a soldier
the Minister might have trusted me with the
document. However, he did not see fit to do
so. I therefore warned him that I would
move for a return.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) merely gives to the House the
language that has been put into his mouth,
and as he himself is the soul of courtesy and
kindness to the members of this House, I
impute no blame to him. He says, however,
the document is incomplete. The incompleteness of the document is this. A scheme was
drawn up which involved the dissolution of
a large number of our militia units, and, as
the people in the localities where these units
were stationed heard about it, they registered
vigorous objection. I suppose the Government is trying to treat with them and quiet
them. To that extent the document is incomplete, but to that extent only. As the
Minister says, it has been communicated to
the military organizations-to several of wbich
I belong-and had I been present at their
meetings I should have heard the details.
There is nothing confidential about this document at all. It is not going to alarm neighbouring states. It is not going to upset the

427

League of Nations or the concert of Europe.
The Government shies at giving out this
information because it wishes to steer clear
of any discussion about our military forces,
for fear someone in the House of Commons
will want to know with whom we are going
to make war.
When it comes to discussing the defence
forces, Canada is a nation of villagers.
Nobody is interested in such matters and
nobody bothers about them. Consequently
we have again and again been pitchforked
into trouble unprepared, unarmed and unequipped, and have paid the price afterwards.
In a few days we shall be discussing the
Pension Bill. I shall then try to explain to
the House what it means, and how it comes
about that one-third of the cost of pensions
is attributable to failure on our part to make
any arrangements or plans for the waging of
war.
To come back to the reorganization of the
defence forces of Canada, I repeat that there
is no other civilized country in the world where
such a reorganization would not first of all
be placed before Parliament. We are undertaking to do it by back-stair methods. I am
told that this document is confidential and
that the scheme is incomplete. The document
is not confidential and the scheme is not incomplete. The only variations in the scheme
have been brought about by the protests of
certain communities.
I make this explanation as the basis of the
statement that I cannot accept the honourable gentleman's contention that this is a confidential document or that it should not be
laid upon the Table of the House. I will
insist as far as I can that the document be
laid on the Table. I draw attention to the
fact that the Minister himself stated that it
had already been laid before a large number
of organizations. Why could it not be laid
on the Table of the Senate? There is no
reason in the world why that should not
be donc. The Minister should be told that
even if I were to accept the statement of
the honourable the leader of the House, I
could, under the procedure of this Chamber,
initiate a full-dress debate on this subjeot.
There is nothing to prevent me from doing
that between now and the end of the
sessionHon. Mr. CALDER:
mittee.

Or having a com-

having a
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -or
committee and giving the matter publicity.
I think that if the Minister is wise he will
consent to the document being laid on the
Table, where, probably, it will be read by

SENATE
nobody but myself. As a member of this
buse, and as a senior officer of our defence
forces, I insist that the document be placed
on the Table. and I intend to exercise every
right I bave to bring that about.
Hon. Mr. HIAIGi:
Have the military
organizations sncb as tbe Great War Veterans
seen it?
Hon. Mr.
military.

GRIESBACH:

They are ex-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbe bonourable senator
has mentioned certain organizations. Wbat
does be mean?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
The Minister
makes a number of statements wbicb show
tbat he d-oes not know very much about this
matter hims-elf. He says:
That recommendation lias been endorsed by
ail the militia organizationsI do not know wbat that means.
-the Defence AssociationI do nlot know wha.t t.bat means.
-the Canadian Infantry AssociationI know what that means.
-the Artillery Association and, I think, every
arm of the service.
H1e apparcntly does not know that the varions
arms of the defence forces have their associations. The artillery, the cavalry, the infantry, the engineers and, I think, the signallers, ail have national organization. This
scheme for reorgan.ization bas been laid
before the national organization and probably a thousand persons have been made
acquainted with it.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
says 'national organization.
Are those people
outside the Goveroment service?
Hon. Mr. GPIESBACH:
officers cf the militia.

No;

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They are officers
cf the Canadian militia. Ycn can say they
are in the serv ice cf Canada or thcy are not,
as von wish. The fact is that thcy are officers
of the Canadian militia.
Hon. Mr. RING: My question was: are
they fflcially emplovcd in the military service
'
and receiv ing pa' ?
Hon.

Mr.

GR1IESBACH,

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does the honourable gentleman mean ýto inquire whether tbey
are permanent empîcyces cf the Goveroment?
Hon. Mr. KING: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. They may
be permanent employees cf varions depantments, in a civil capacity. But they are officers
cf the Canadian nîilitia.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Volunteers.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
if you like.

Volunteer cificers,

Hon. Mr. RING: If that is trne, I shonld
say that military conditions in Canada are
surely in a had way. If persons who are not
emplcyed and paici by the Goveroment in
the military service cao form associations for
the discussicn cf military affairs in the manner
sniggested by my honourable friend, I tbink
the military service is in a bad way.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I amn afraid my
bonourable friend bas not a clear conception
cf our militia service.
Hon. Mr. KING:

I arn trying to get it.

The
defence
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
forces cf Canada consist cf volunteers.
Hon. Mr. RING:

I know that.

Hon. Mn. GRIESBACH: They give their
services to the country. The officers reccîve
pay only when they are in training. They
buiy their uniforms and equipment in every
detail, and the pay they receive does not begin
to cov er this ccst to thcm. They make a
contribution cf their time, their intelligence
and their efforts to the peuple cf Canada,
throughl thcir serv ice in various branches cf
the militia. Seine cf them may be employed
in Gcvernrncnt departments, but I suppose
the v ast mijority cf them are not. The
artillerv officers have an association known
as the Antillery Association, spcnsored, encouragecl and subsidized by the Ccx ernment
cf Canada. The cavalry, the engincers and
the signal serv ice hav e similar associations,
sponscned and subsidized by the Gox crnment.

say, if it can l)e suhrnitted to these organi..
zationo it can surely be laid upon the Table
cf the Senate.
Hcn. Mr. DANJJURAND: I wculd draw
the attention cf mv honourable friend to this
fact. A tentative~ plan or plans nily have
heen circulcated among the varions organizations in the militia for their opinion. My

JUNE 8, 1936
honourable friend asks for a copy of such
plan, or plans. Ris motion is:
That an Order of the House do issue for a
return of the plan, proposai or recommendation for the reorganization of the defence
forces of Canada in general, or the Canadian
militia in particular, which "'is in process of
being effected at the present time."
Well, I can quite uniderstand that the e
sponsible Minister rnight be opposed to presenting to Parliament a piecemeal, half-baked
or tentative plan which may be revised after
divers opinions have been received fromn the
associations. 1 do not belong to the militia.
My incompet-ence in military affairs is coinplete. I remember that around 1922 or 1923
I made an innnovation which created something of a stir. Being in charge of a bil to
amend the Militia Act, I asked my galiant
and honourabie friend if hie would take charge
of it. Re did, and of course hie handled it
wisely and efficiently. He knew the whole
subject from A to Z. 1 was en.tireiy ignorant
in the matter and should have had to read a
memorandum but for my honourable friend's
assistance. 1 have always been of the opinion
that the dividing line which exists between
members of another place should not exiat in
this House, and that ministers should select
as their representatives in thîs Chamber such
honourable members as are in the best position to advance different pieces of legisiation.
It was because I held that opinion that 1
went to my honourable friend at the time.
But I do not believe my honourable friend
has the better of the argument with the depsrtmnent-for it is with the d.epartmnent hie is
arguing the question. The department says,
in effect, "We oannot iay before the House
tentative pro.jects that are being considered,
with respect to which plans or proposais are
being circuiated, becau.9e we have noV yet
reached a conclusion." I am surprised Vo hear
my honourahie friend say that whatever may
be the conclusion it will be arrîved at outside
the purview of Parliament. I shouid be surprised if any reorganization of the militia en,
tailing expenditure of money were Vo, be made
without the approval. of the House of Coinmons. 1 think the Minister was quite logical
when hie suggested that my honourable friend
take cognizance of these documents confidentially, in order, probably, that hie might
give his own opinion upon tbem, but that hie
should not expose before the Senate the
various opinions of the militia associations and
say that hie preferred such-andb-such a plan. I
feel that the proper time for him to express
his views in the Senate wiil be when the plan
is cornpleted. I would suggest that my honourable friend accept the proposal of the Minister, who is ready to put the whoie record

429

before hirn; and later on hie m.ay have a fulldrees debate upon the whoie subject of the
militia if bie so desires.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACR: My honourable
friend suggests that I should sit quietiy bythat we ail shouid sit quietly by-until the
Government is prepared to disciose its plan.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For which the
Government will take responsibility.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACR: Quite so. I arn
in doubt as to, wliether the matter is certain
to corne before us under the head of expenditures of money, hecause the reorganization
does flot necessarily cail for the spending of
any greater amount than is now voted. 0f
course, if thiere is any reai reorganization
some added outîsys wili be entailed.
Let me address myseif to the plan. In
another place a few days ago a member
complained that no steps had been taken to
bring about the reorganization which was long
since overdue. To this the Minister replied:
My honourable friend is scarcely correct in
that. 1Vis in process of being effected at the
present time.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: "In process."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I arn reading
from page 3243 of the House of Commons
Hansard. In my motion I quoted those words,
"is in process of being effected at the present
time." Now, if reorganization is being effected
at the present time, the day wili corne wben
the plan is completed. But it wiil then be an
accomplished fact. When the reorganization
is completed and rails, as it will cail, for tank
battalions, anti-aircraft defence, searchlight
equipment sud so on, then expenditures wili
be necessary. But none are necessary in the
meantime. Ail I arn asking for is that the
recommendation wvhich has been laid before
these military associations be laid on the
Table of the Senate, so that 1 may look at it.
I refuse to accept it confidentially, because in
the event that I found it contained something which in my judgment ought Vo be made
public my banda wouid be tied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURÀND: What recomnmiendation does the honourable senator speak
of?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The reeommendatien whieh the honourable the Minister of
National Defence himself mentioned. Speaking in another place the other day, hie said:
The reorganization of the militia bas been
under consideration for a number of years.
And so on.

The Minister knows quite well what the

friend to tell him that I should like to have
laid on the Table that document which t bas
he
put before a number of other persons, including the militia associations. I want to look
at it in order to satify myself wheier there
is anything in it that calls for n'y intervention
in this Chainber. I think that I. as a inember
of this Iouse, have a right to that document.

members, of course I am net a fighting

branches of the defence services of Canada
into the Department of National Defence,
and was the first Minister of that department. I know something about the difficulties of having suggestions followed by
miitary men, who would obey field orders to
the lot. Honourable members who arc not
familiar with the situation will be surprised
when I say that the Minister of National
Defence is called upon to deal with more
details of a diflicuit character than perbaps
any other minister. Officers of the forces do
not always agree upon what should be done.
When J became Minister I had the difficult
task of getting tlic naval and military men
together; and I am net sure that they ever
did reailly get together.
However, I did
notify all the officers J could get before me
that there vas to be an analgamated department. of which I was 'to be Minister, and that
they could work out certain details or J
would do it for them. They finally agreed
upon a certain basis. While I was in charge
of that department, being a civilian and net
knowing mueh about matters of national
defence. J invariably ascertained the opinions
of men in any organization affected by changes
proposed by the headquarters staff. Tîat
was because J felt the staff migbt not always
be right. That is simply wbat the present
Minister is doing. I would have a man discharged if he gave out information with
respect te official plans still under consideration. If Lieutenant Brown, Captain Smith
and Colonel Jones each urged bis particular
opinion it would be impossible to carry out
any reorganization. There comes a time when
the opinions of the various service organizatiens are submitted to the staff, and the staff
repQrt on them to the Minister. Then responsibility for the decision rests with him.
Hon. Mr. KING.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is exactly
the position we are at now.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
But the
honourable gentleman wants to step over
thtat position. He wants the Minister to give
to him publicly, net privately, whatever docments be may have. The Minister bas offered
to give my honourable friend all the informatien. Officers of the service organizations will

handed to me I should have treated it in
the proper way; but when the Minister tries
to bargain with me. tben as a member of
this House I cannot accept the document
confidentially, because it might disclose semething which it would bc my duty as a senator
to lay before the Senate and the country.
If the Minis t er intends to approach me in my
military capacity, that is another matter.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: As a member
of one of those organizations, is my honourable friend not entitled to see anything that
they have seen?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Exactly.

JUNE 8, 1936
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is not as
a senator or as a private individual, but as
a member of one of those organizations that
ho can see it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Very well.' I was
nlot able to attend either of the conventions.
My right bonourablo friend states the case
clearly.
IRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: W'e shall have
to have another convention. 1 do nlot see
how, if I wcrc the Minister, I couid go any
further without getting the department, and
pcrhaps the service itself, into difficulty.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What does my
right honourable friend say to the other proposition of the Minister, that this reorgani.
zation is being proceeded with to-day,-Hon. Mr. KING: Is being developcd.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:-and that in six
rnonths or- a year from now it will be completed? Then the country will ho confron.ted
with an accomplished fact. Surely wc are
entitlcd to know what this reorganization is.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The plan in question has been submittod to the difforent
organizations confidentially?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yos, to about a
thousand mon. I could have attended the
meetings myseif and go.t the information in
my capacity as a mombor of the organization.
I ask why in the name of common sonso
the information cannot be furnishod to me
now.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I be pardoned for violating the rules? If some othor
departmc'nt wore coneerned, for instance the
Department of Public Worksý-assuming contracts wore not being deait with-it would be
different; but, as my honourablo friond knows,
the Departrnent of National Defenco does not
hand out its proposais until it is roady to do
so. I had charge of the dopartment for some
yoars, and I bad to be careful that inatters
of a defence nature-and this surely is of
sucb a nature-shoýuld not bo made public until
the Governrnont had corne te a decision and
was roady to assume responsibiiity for its
action. I tbink my honourabie friend will
find that any plan of reorganization has to
be passed by Order in Council before it can
ho put into effeot. On motion sucb Order in
Council can be placed on the Table of either
House and discussed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would appeal
to my honourable frioend as a soldier-and
a brilliant one ho bas been-to reflect that
bis superior officer, the Minister of National

Defence. bas undýer consideration a scberne
for the reorganization of the Canadian militia.
It is not complete. and consoquontly it is
most undosirable that details wbich rnay be
subject to change sbould be made public.
That is why the Ministor would be disposed
to hand the document to my bonourable
friend in confidence. If I were -the Minister
I would say, "Not only do I band the document to you privately, but I want your
opinion upon tbe reorganization."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If tbe honourable gentleman wbo leads the Houso or the
right bonourablo gentleman who sits beside
hirn were the Minister cf National Defenco,
the documents would have beon handed to
me the moment I asked for thern.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I should
not be so sure of th-at untiI I bad seen the
documents.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII: It soo,ms to me
there is a lack of courtesy and common sense.
The roorganization is going on now. The
document says: "Wo will reduco the number
of infantry battalions from 135 to 92. Wo
will turn so many rogiments of cavalry into,
tank battalions. We will turn so many
battalions of infantry into anti-aircraf t corps."
That is the seboeme.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I amn afraid
my honoiraihle friend knows wbat -is in the
document.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I tbink I do.
Theco follows from that scherne the actuai
niaming of the units to be disbanded. I arn
not asking for that; I arn asking for the
scherne. I know what is bothering the Ministýer. If tho infantry is to be reduced from
135 to 92 battalions, thon 40 battalions in
40 localities will be disbanded, and officers
from those 40 localities will camp on the
Ministor's door-step witb their complaints.
That is what he is worrying about. I arn
net asking for information on that point
at ail. That is a matter of indifforence to
me. Let him deal with it bimýself. But thero
is a p.ape.r plan for turning su many regimont-s of cavalry into tank battalions, and so
many battalions of înfantry into anti-aircraf t
corps. There is loýt a civilized country in
the world that is nlot doing the same sort of
thing-. The Department of National Defence
is now carrying out this seherne without placing it before Parliament.

by the Government?

of cavalry regiments have heen advised that

Bill 21, an Act to amend the Canadian
National..Canadian Pacifie Act, 1933&-Hon.
Mr. Dandurand.
SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BIL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved. the
second reading of Bill 76, an Act to amend
the Special War Revenue Act.
Ha said: Honourable senators, the main
purp ose of this Bill is to implemexit the budget
resolutions of the lst of May, but, as usual,
some administrative changes have been included.
The chief budget items are the decrease to
2 cents per 100 on cigarette paper tubes, the
increasa in the sales tax from 6 to 8 per cent,
and the exemption from ail excise taxes' of
goods imported by returning travellers under
what is commonly known as the one hundred
dollar exemption.
The principal administrative changes relate
to the definition of the phrase "manufacturer
or producer"; the rewriting, for purposes of
cl.arity and convenience, of Part VII, commonly
known as the stock transfer tax; the increase
in the sacurity to ha given by licen.sed wholesalers hy reason of the increased tax, and the
authorization of certain officars to take
statutory declarations required by the Act.
In addition, it is sought to colleet sales tax
in connection with the assignment of book
dehts, provision is made for the protection of
officers in the exercise of their duties, and
there are one or two other changes of les&er
importance.
I content myself with these few explanatory
ramarks, and move the -second reading of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Although, I presume, tiiere is very little to be said on a
measure of this nature, which is essentially
a money matter, I trust that in the absence of
the right honourable leader of this side of the
House the honourable the leader of the other

Bill until to-morrow or the next day.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN moved:
That in the opinion of the Senate, a judgment of the Suprema Court of the Dominion
of Canada, when unanimous, should be final
except in constitutional cases.
He said: Honourable senators, I must
confess that I rise with a great deal of diffidence to speak on this question, which has
bean before Parliament so long that it has
heen worn threadhare. T'wenty years ago,
when I made the sama motion, the question
was forty-rme years old. It has now grown
to the age of sixty-one years, and I think it
is time that it should be settled one way
or anothar. I feel aIl the more diffident about
speaking on this motion because I am not a
lawyer a.nd the question is one which lawyers
regard as thair exelustive hunting ground.
Perhaps I should flot say any-thing on the
subjeeL.
My sole object is to protect, if possible, the
righ'ts of 'the poor man and to take away
from. wealthy corporations and very rich
persons the means of wearing out opponents
who are not rich enough ýto follow themn to
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I may say at once that twenty ye.ars
ago, when I 'brought up this inatter, I heard
of a very sad case in Montreal, of which I
was told hy Alexander Chase Casgrain, who
was thýen a comparatively young lawyer and
is now the Hon. Alexander Chase Casgrain, a
Judge of the Superior Court. A man working
for a company 'had been killed, leaving hahind hima in an ahsolutely penniless condition. a widow and a number of children.

fees could be paid by the widow, her case

closely the lines of Sir John A. Macdonald's
draft. Mr. Fournier had succeeded the late
Sir Antoine Aimé Dorion, who had been Minister of Justice in the Mackenzie Admninistration for only a few months and had become
Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals in
Quebec. When introducing the measure, Mr.
Fournier made a short speech in which hie
admitted having used a great deal of the draft
Bill that had býeen prepared by Sir John A.
Macdonald, and he contended that the matter
was flot a party question. Sir John A. Macdonald, as Leader of the Opposition, coinmendcd the Minister of Justice for the introduction of this mcasure and said hie was very
glad that some of the labour hie had put upon
the Bill was being made effective. H1e urged
every member of the House to try to make
the measure as nearly perfect as possible.
Everything went on harmoniously until the
second reading, when there were heard a great
many objections, coming mostly from the
province of Quebec. The member for Montmagny, Mr. Taschereau, who was afterwards
C,_hief Justice Sir Hlenri Taschereau of the
Court of Appeals of Quebec, took strong exception to the measure on the ground that cases
of civil rights, tenure of land, servitude, and
so on, sbould not be placed under the jurisdiction of this Court of Appeal. H1e feared
some of the judges might not be familiar with
the law of Quebec relatin g to these particular
matters. The Hon. David Milis, who was
known as the Sage of Bothwell, and who is
remembered by many honouraýble senators-hie introduced me to the Speaker when I first
came to this House--opposed the measure on
constitutional grounds. It is remarkable what
can be said on constitutional grounds! Several
other gentlemen spoke against giving this
court jurisdiction in matters arising under local
laws.
However, the Ministier of Justice thought
that before long no appeal would lie from the
courts of Canada to the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Cnuneil. The measure, wbich
was entitled, "The Supreme and Exchequer
Court Act," was assented to on the Sth of
April, 187,5.
Article 101 of the British North America
Act, to whicb I have referred, reads:
The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding any thing in this Act, from time to
time provide for the constitution, maintenance
and organization of a general court of ajipeal
for Canada, and for the establishment of any
additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.
This wording gave to the able lawyers who
were then in Parliament no end of ground for
argument. It was held by many that "for
12745-28J

435

the better administration of the laws of Canada" meant the laws of Canada only-federal
statutes. Otb*ers, with equal force, among
them the Minister of Justice at the time,
argued that the words "notwitbstanding anything in this Act"' overrode everytbing, and
that this court of appeal ahould be competent
to hear cases from aI the provinces. The
Ministe-r of Justice said that whi.le there
were very strong reasons for maintaining the
appeal to the Privy Council, there were
stronger reasons for doing away witb it.
It should be borne in mnd. that appeal to,
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
bas nothing whatever to do with the inherent
and absolute rigbt of any British subject to,
lay bis complýaint, bis grievance, or bis petition, at the foot of the Throne. I myseif
at one time exercised the privilege of the
rîght of appeal at thbe foot of the Throne.
It was a case in which foreign bondhiolders
were interested. They were of opinion that
they were being mulcted by the Government
of Quebec. The Hon. Mr. Duffy wa-s Provinci-al Treasurer and the Hon. Maurice
Archambault, Attorney-General. The Hon.
T. Chase Casg.rain thought the bondholders
had a case. H1e 'had made application to
the Quebec Governiment for a petition of
rigbt, but the Government refused, and persisted in its refusaI. As I believed there
could be no wrong without redress, 1 comnmunirqted with tbe then iÀeutenant-Governor
of the province. Sir Louis Jetýté. I asked
him for an interview. which hie very graciously
granted me. I said to hlm: "I understand
it is the inalie-nable right of a British subject
to lay bis petition at the foot of the Throne.
I do flot ask you for a reply, but I do ask
you to listen to me-to hear my petition."
11e did; and notwithstanding that the Prime
Minister. bis Treasurer and bis AttorneyGeneral had refused to act, my petition of
rigbt was granted withiýn forty-eight hours.
I may add that it did not do the bondholders
,any good, for after spending a good deal of
money they lost their case; but they had thc
satisfaction of trying their best to, win.
The Judicial Committee of the Pxviy
Council is a committee or brancb of the
House of Lords. In olden times the flouse
of Lords made it a separat-e committee
with jurisdiction over questions arising in
Normandy and Brittany-those parts of
France then under the control of England.
It was a sort of court to accommodate wbat
was then a dominion, not over the sea, but
over the cbannel. Later on the Judicial
Committee beard cases from. the plantations.
because it was held that, there being ne good
local judges, it was onîy right that the people

435
SENATE

436

interested should be allowed to appeal freim
the local judgments. Afterwards the riglit
of appeal wvas allowed to the Channel Islands,
and, fin.ally to the colonies.
The Hon. Mr. Lafiamme, the member for
Jacques Cartier in the Huse, succeeded the
[Ion. Telesphore Fournier as Minister of JusTho Hon. Mr. Laflamme was of
tice.
Dpinion. that our own courts were miich
better qualified to administer justice to the
people of this country than was the Privy
11e held that the Lords of the
Council.
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had
net only to know French law, but also
Spanish, Dutch, and Hindoo law, and so
could not be as vwell qualified as our .iudges,
ivho were well versed. in the laws of Canada
alone.
But there wvas an objection, bascd on the
sentiment of loyalty. We were told that if
wc did flot allow appeals te England the
tie with the Mother Country wvould he weakened. But I dlaim that the tie is just as
etrong to-day a.s it was at thiat time; iu fact
stronger. We ail remember that when England was figh'-ting Egypt, and the British
Oovcrnment wanted to rais.c a corps of
Canadian river men to operate the Nule boats,
Sir John A. Macdonald said, "Not a dollar,
flot a man."
1 challenge any houcurableý
senator to contradiet that staternent.
Ls it
conceivahle that any Prime Minister of
Canada would say that to-day? I recaîl the
memorable occasion wlien the right hionourable gentleman who leads the Oppos~ition in
this Hlouse (Righit Hon. Mr. Meighien) said
that te any requeMz from the British Governmient for military assistance Canadi's aunwer
should be "Ready, aye ready." He did flot,
say, "Not a dollar, flot a man."
Iliglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
hionourable gentleman the context?

Has

the

Heu. Mr. CASCRAIN: I think I have
pros en te the sati-sfaction of this House that
wO are jtist as loyal now as we liave always
been.
Whcen wc appeal as colonies, we appear not
before tie iloue of Lords, but before the
Judicial Coîumittee, a branch of the bouse of
Lords.
As 1 bave said. wvewere told that if we did
flot allow appeals to England the tic with
the Mother Country would be weakened. It
is a queer thing thaýt the tie which binds us
to the Mother Country sbould be a question
of money. In Ontario you have limited the
riglit of appeal to the Privy Council to cases
mnvolving $4.000. 1 arn told that the minimum
is now $5.000. In the province of Quebec for
manv ye'irs the amouint was limited te s2.u00;
now it is $12,000. There is one gond thing
Flon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

I did: I raiscd the ante that much. Why
should a man in Quebec be threatened by a
wealthy corporation or a ricli man with an
appeal to the Privy Council if the amount is
.iust over $12000Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
for that matter.

Or in Ontario

Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Yes, -wben the
same corporation or ricli man could net take
a similar case from the Ontario or Quebec
courts to the Privy Council unlees the amount
involved cxceeded $5,000? 1 ask honourable
senaters how it happens that such an injustice
was allowed to go on from year -te year for
I do not kuow how long. If I receive a
satisfactory explanation cf that I shiaîl be
content.
I under.stand perfectly that iu order to
make our Supreme Court a court cf last
rcsort the consenct of the provinces would have
te bc ebtained. 0f course, a suitor in a
prov incial court is net obliged te go to the
Supreme Court of Canadla a:t aIl; he ýcan appeal
diretly te the Privy Council. But if the
Supremie Court wverc made a court of la.st
rcscrt, it would be up te the provinces te
accept tlie jurisdiction cf tbiat court as final.
I ain mecly gix ing the opinion of eminent
lawyers who have looked inte the question
whenc I say that the provinces would have te
consent before tlie righit cf appeal te the
Jud icial Commniltee cf the Privy Couincil
could be touchcd.
I haive said lest now that the inalienable
riglht of auv British subjcct te lay bis cernplaint at the foot cf the Tfirone is eue whicli
can net be affccted by the abelitien ef the
right cf appeal te the Judicial Cemmittee cf
the Privy Couincil. I bave given an instance
cf what teck place wlien I made my appeal
Henourable
at the foot cf the Thrcue.
senators will sec -that there is ne analegy
between that and an appeal te the Judicial
Committee cf the Privy Council. Te say,
therefore, that making the judgment cf our
Supreme Court final would tend te weaken
the tie betweeu ýtbis country and the Metlherland, is te put it ildly, abselutely incorrect.
I finâ also that there i. eue wav by which
could
con.siderably restrict
the provi~nce
appeals. Duriug the twenty-five years prior
te 1875, wlben the Supreme Court was crcatcd,
thcre wcre, accerding te the information
available te me, net more than eight or ten
cases taken frorn Ontario and Quebec te the
Judicial Cemrnittee cf t-he Privy Ceuncil.
Duriug the same period there were scarcely
any appeals from New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia.
0f course, the courts cf the provinces might
restrict appeals in a very simple way-by

JNE 8, 1936
raising the limit required for appeal to the
Privy Council. The Hon. Edward Blake
said the province could increase the limit
to $20,000 or $100,000.
1 arn afraid, honourable senators, that this
is a rather long dissertation on a, very threadbare subject. Nevertheless I think it is my
duty to demonstrate to you that the Supreme
Court of Canada was to bie a court of last
resort. In order to show the intention of those
who passed the Supreme Court Act, may I
refer to the motion of the Hon. Rudolph
Lafiamme, who afterwards became Minister of
Justice? This motion, which was carried, read
in part :
As the Supreme Court of Canada was intended to serve as a substituteMark that, word. When you adopt a substitute you have no more use for the original.
-as a substitute for the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council, appeals should flot lie
for less than $2,000 in the province of Quebec.
As I rnay have said, I arn proud of the fact
that twenty years ago, after I had brought
this matter before the House and had drawn
attention to the disproportion between the
amount sued for and the cost of securing it in
the courts, the Quebec Legisiature at its very
next session raised the figure fromn $2,000 to
$12,000--an increase of 600 per cent; and, as
lawyers.know, an accident suit rarely involves
a larger sum.
My object in. raîsing this discussion was to
try to protect the poor, because-I want to
repeat it--even though. the widow and
children of a poor man who had been killed
had found somne charitable lawyer to carry
their case throug-h the courts of our own
country, they encountered insurmountable
difficulty in having it carried any further. It
is said that corporations have no soul. Perhaps that is right. Yet we must remember
that corporations have to protect their shareholders, and they would be blamed if they paid
out money too read.ily, without going to the
lust court available to them.
Now, I have an opinion of Mr. Eugène
Lafieur. He says, first, that there is no right
of appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada.
You can appeal only by grace. That is to
say, the Supreme Court gives way and allows
you to go te the Privy Council; if it did not
there wouid be no redress. Furthermore, as
Mr. Lafieur points out, it takes on an average
two or three years to secure a judgment, during
which time the money involved is held up
and nobody can get any interest on it. As
someone has said, this is very good for the
rich, but not for the poor.
Strong objections were raised against the
establishment of the Supreme Court. The

437

Hon. David Milîs9, "the Sage of Bothwell,"'
who was supposed to be a great constitutionar
authority, went so far as to say that if our
local laws were to corne under the jurisdictioni
of the Supreme Court we should have in this
country net a federation, but a legisiative
union. He spoke very strongly against the
creation of the court.
Another man who opposed the establishment
of the court was Mr. Henri Taschereau, later
Sir Henri Taschereau, who at that time was
the member for the county of Montmagny.
H1e afterwards became a Judge of the Superior
Court, and still later Chief Justice. Mr.
Taschereau was strongly opposed to the establishment of the Supreme Court because hie
thought it could not poasibly master the laws
of aIl the different provinces-and there were
not so many then as there are now-and
because hae believed that every province
should have a court of final resert in which
litigants could secure satisfaction.
I have hitre a long essay read 'before the
Royal Society this year by the honourable
ex-Judge Mignault, who in 1932 had read an
essay on the samne subject. In the document
before me, consisting of thirty-seven closely
typewritten pages, ail of which I have waded
through, lie says hae is ahsolutely opposed to
Canadian cases being decided in a country far
distant from us.
Most of us are familiar with Bryoe's Amenican Commonwealth. We know that in the
United States every one of the states is
supreme and that they delegated certain
powers to the Federal Governmcnt. That is
Just the reverse of wha*t was done in Canada.
Here the provinces gave the bulk of the
powers to the central government, as will lie
-*,en from sections 91 and 92 of the British
North America Act. So there is no analogy
betwcen what took place in the United States
and what tooak place here.
Another ve.ry strong objection was raised
hy one who took a prominent part in the
deha te: Mr. Irving-Mr. Henry Irving, if I
remember ightly-who was for a long time
Attorney-General of the province of Quebec.
11e did not want litigants to be free ta go
to either the Supreme Court or the Privy
Council; hie thought they ehould eleet to go
to one court or the other. H1e wen-t on to
say that a suitor sh.ould not be able ta keep
the opposite side in a state of unoertainty,
and ùhat the right of appeal to the P.rivy
Council might bie used as a kind of blackmail against a man who could flot afford the
enormous cost of sending his lawyer across
the ocean. The Hon. Alderie Ouimet, afterwards Minister of Public Works in the Conservative Govern'ment, said hie would bie very

SENATE

if appeals to the Privy Council were
abolished.
I have here a letter from a gentleman who

glad

was considered one of the best lawyers in the

country. Not only had he no superior in
Canada, so far as I know, but his reputation
was well known in other countries. That is
evidenced by the fact that just before the
war in Mexico lie was selected, as a jurist
of repute, to define the international boundary
between tihe United States and Mexico. This
work had just started when the disturbed
state of Mexico interfered with the operations of the commission. I refer to the laie
Eugène Lafleur, K.C. The letter which I
have here was addressed by him to J. E.
Martin, K.C., who was tien the Bâtonnierwhich means the President-of the Bar of
Montreal. Before he died lie became Chief
Justice of the Court of Appeals in Quebec.
The letter is long and I do not want to weary
the House with it at this late hour, but I ask
permission to place it upon Hansard so that
honoura,ble members who have a legal training may read the exact words.
Mr. Martin had written Mr. Lafleur, asking a series of questions, among which was
this one:
Should His Majesty's Privy Council be invited to limit leave to appeal from judgments
of tic Suprene Court of Canada to constitutional questions, the validity of federal
statutes, and references made by Order in
Council or by either branch of Parlianent?
I read that part of the letter simply to draw
the attention of the House to this constitutional question. I always have believed and
I always shall believe tiat for deciding constitutional questions, vhich very often affect
matters of race and religion, it is better to
have an umpire who does not live in this
country, who does not breathe our atmosphere. Of course we can always have as
many debates as we want on constitutional
questions here. I am afraid that if it were
not for constitutional questions the lawyers
would not be able to make as long speeches
as they sometimes do.
Now, with the permission of the House, I
will place upon Hansard the letter to which
I have referred.
Montreal, April 14, 1914.
J. E. Martin, Esq., K.C.
Bâtonnier,
Montreal.
My Dear Bâtonnier:
J duly received your letter of the 26th
March requesting ny views upon tie following
questions:
1. Should the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of Canada be altered:
(a) as regards the validity of any Acts of
the legislature of the province;
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

(b) as regards municipal by-laws or other
proceedings and as regards civil and commercial matters other than that arising from
a federal statute?
2. Should the amount in dispute to permit
the appeal be increased, and, if so, to what
anount; and should it be made applicable to
sums of money payable to His Majesty, to title
to lands or tenements and to servitude and
other real rights?
3. Should His Majesty's Privy Council be
invited to limit leave to appeal from judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada to
constitutional questions, the validity of federal
statutes, and references made by Order in
Council or by either branch of Parliament?
J beg to submnit my answers to the above
questions in the order in which they are
propounded in your letter:
1. (a) It appears to me to be impossible
to restrict the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of Canada as regards the validity of
any acts of the legislature of the province
without introducing hopeless confusion in
appeals on constitutional questions. In most
cases in which these questions are submitted
the constitutionality of federal enactments is
inseparably bound up with the constitutionality
of provincial enactments, and the construction
of section 91 of the British North America
Act nearly alvays involves a consideration and
determination of the meaning of section 92 of
the saine Act. To limit the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court in this respect would mean in
most constitutional cases that a judgment
could be obtained only on a part of thle case,
and that recourse mnust be had to another
tribunal for the complete disposition of the
whole question at issue.
1. (b) As regards municipal by-laws I am
disposed to think that the preseut jurisdiction
night be made clearer by re-enactment of the
sections dealing with this subject-matter.
It
may be desirable that ini most municipal cases
multiplicity of appeals should be discouraged
and that the decision of our Court of Appeal
should be final, but there may be cases in which
power should be given to the Supreme Court
to give special leave to appeal.
As regards civil and commercial matters
other than those arising froin a federal statute
the same difficulty presents itself as in the case
of restricting the jurisdiction to the constitutionality of federal laws. Such a distinction
will necessarily involve an incomplete decision
in
nany instances where questions arising
under federal statute are intermingled with
questions arising under the civil law. More-

over, if sens undesirable on principle to limit
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of
Canada as a general court of appeal in civil
as well as in federal inatters. in view of the
long course of decisions which have been
rendered by that court and of the conspicuous
services whici
such a general court of appeal
renders to tie jurisprudence of tic country.
The inconveniences arising from a restricted
jurisdiction in this regard have been felt in
the United States and I have not leard any
sound or serions objections advanced to the
which was evidently contemplated by
systen
the framers of tle British North America Act.
2. Now that most of the provinces of the
Dominion have Courts of Appeal it seems
desirable that the amount in dispute required
to permit tic appeal should be made more
I am
uniform throughout the Dominion. ad
disposed to think that the present amount of

JUNE 8,1936
two thousand dollars in the province of Quebec
might possibly be increased, inasmuch as there
should always be a certain proportion between
the amount involved and the possible costs
incurred.
In this connection I am also of
opinion that instead of adopting the arbitrary
rule of looking at the amount which is claimed
in the action it would be preferable to have
regard to the actual amount in controversy
in so far as it affects the party appealing.
With respect to sums of money payable to
His Majesty, to title to lands or tenements and
to servitude and other real rights, I see no
reason to distinguisli these from ordinary cases
where a certain amount is required to give the
court jurisdiction.
3. The question as to the advisability of
restricting the appeal to the Judicial Committee is more fundamental. Without in the
least overlooking the great services which that
board has rendered to our jurisprudence, it is
necessary at the outset to consider whether, in
view of the progressive development of the
autonomy of the Dominion such an institution
is destined to be permanent or whether it is
merely transitory. While it is normal in the
case of a Crown colony, its persistence seems
scarcely compatible with the legitimate evolution of a self-governing dominion. Although
theoretically the Imperial Parliament still possesses supreme legislative authority over Canada,
in practice it is quite unthinkable that any legislation affecting us should be passed by the
Imperial Parliament against our wishes. This
being so, it must be regarded as an anomaly
that Canada should enjoy the most complete
independence in making its laws but that it
should not have the same unrestricted freedom
to interpret those laws. In other words, the
suggestion is that while Canadian statesmen
and legislators can be trusted to enact the laws
Canadian judges cannot be relied upon to interpret or apply them.
The reason usually advanced in favour of
maintaining the appeal to the Privy Council
is that it secures a decision from a tribunal
which is free from local prepossessions and
from political, religious or racial prejudices.
Such a humiliating confession has never been
made, so far as I am aware, by any autonomous
colony or state and implies less confidence in
the judiciary than in the legislatures. It is no
answer to say that our Government have too
often made appointments to the bench on the
ground of political services rendered, rather
than on that of professional merit. This does
not prove that competent men cannot be produced or secured to satisfy our requirements,
but merely that proper means must be taken
to attain this end instead of solving the difficulty by an admission of inferiority and an
appeal for external assistance. And I venture
to think that our governments will not feel
their full responsibility in this respect until
our courts are as supreme in their sphere as
our legislatures are in theirs. Australia has
carried the doctrine of autonomy to its legitimate conclusion in obtaining a restriction of
the prerogative in regard to appeals to the
Privy Council and limiting them to cases in
which leave is given by its own Supreme Court,
and this Supreme Court is admittedly at the
present day a very strong one.
From the point of view of the private
litigant the appeal to the Privy Council is an
expensive remedy-all the more because there
are few cases in which Canadian counsel are
not sent over to London even on applications
for special leave. This means that from $2,500

43

to $3,000 of expenses may be incurred on a
petition for leave, and from $4,000 to $5,000
for the hearing on the merits. In a case from
the province of Quebec there may already have
been an appeal to the Court of Review, another to the Court of Appeal, and still another
to the Supreme Court, before special leave
has been applied for.
For these reasons I am disposed to think
that the time has probably corne when a limitation of the prerogative right should be seriously
considered. Whether we should go in this
direction so far as Australia has gone is a
matter for discussion, but I feel very strongly
that the authority and usefulness of our own
Supreme Court would be enormously enhanced
if it were in reality what it was intended to
become-a final Court of Appeal for Canada.
Yours truly,
(Signed) E. Lafleur.
That is the opinion of Mr. Eugène Lafleur.
I am sure that those who knew him will
admit that though as an authority he may
have had some equals, he certainly had no
superior in this country.
May I now refer to what Australia has
done? Honourable members will recall that
in 1900 Australia was made a commonwealth.
In one respect that country's Constitution
followed the lines of the American Constitution and went in the opposite direction from
ours, for the varions states delegated certain
powers to the central government. The right
to appeal from the High Court of the Commonwealth of Australia, which corresponds
to our Supreme Court of Canada, is regulated
by section 74 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act, passed by the Imperial Parliament,
63 and 74 Victoria, Chapter 12, which is as
follows:
No appealMark you, honourable senators, "no appeal."
-shall be permitted to the Queen in CouncilThat means the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council.
-from a decision of the High Court upon any
question, however arising, as to the limits inter
se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any state or states, or as
to the limits inter se of the constitutional
powers of any two or more states, unless the
High Court shall certify that the question is
one which ought to be determined by Her
Majesty in Council.
The High Court may so certify if satisfied
that for any special reason the certificate
should be granted. and thereupon an appeal
shall lie to Her Majesty in Council on the
question without further leave.
Honourable members will see that the people
of Australia do not wish the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to interfere with
special constitutional cases. The Australians
want to make their own interpretation of
their own Constitution. As far as constitutional cases in this country are concerned, we

440

SENATE

knoxv that a privato bill presented in the
Hbuse of Commons or the Sonate may ho
referred to the Supreme Court of Canada
for a finding as te whether it is constitutiona]
or net. I dIo net think such references are
often made, but we possess the rigbt to make
them. In sucbi cases the finding of the
Supreme Court is considercd simply as a
mattor of adv-ice anti is not binding in any
way. \Veli, if it is enly a bit of information,
an opinion, that we get fromi the Supremo
Court. I do net sec why, especially wben xve
are net satisfied with that opinion, xve should
net get the view of some body across the
water. The question of cost dees net arise,
for in constitutional cases thoro is always

whien 1 closed the debate, and many able
speeches were made for and against my
motion. After my first speech I xvas sent for
hy the thon Chiief Justice, Sir Charles
Fitzpatr'ck, who said lie thought I had been
hielped in the preparation of my material by
two of Lîis colleagues. He said, "Anglin and
Duif hav e assited you." I thought thiat was
a compliment, and I was mnuch pleased; but
I asurod hlin that thoughi I miglit have hiad

North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) to
tliem andI tellI hîm that hoe may have possession of thiem bofore ho answers me.
Because of my having studied theso documents it may ho of interest to the House to
listen to the few additional remarks I have
to make as to the xisdom of rostricting, if
îlot aholishing entirely, further appeals te,
the Jîîdieial Committece of the Privy Council.
It may not ho genecrally known to ail
honoîtrablo mombers that the passage by the
Hoîîsa of Commons. in 1875, of the Supreme
and Exchequer Court Act created a groat
deal of discussion. The Earl of Duffeitin, the
then Governor General I believe we nover
had a botter one-actually referred the Bill
to the homo atîthorities to inquire whether
Her Majesty would be advised to disallow it
famous
on account of the
entirely-all
clause No. 47. croating a gen-eral court of
appeal for Canada whose judgments should
ho final. It is that correspondence between
FarI Dufferin and the Earl of Carnarvon,.
xvho xva7 thon Colonial Secretary, and the
Hon. dward Blakc. then Minister of Justice,
xxhiehi I have bren fortunate enough to read.
I should like to ho permitted to give a few
extracts to show ýhow clearly it was the intention of the Goverement that, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada should
ho final. This court was established primarily
in ord-er to tender perfect justice to suitors in
Canada. and tyhus save them the very heavy
expenso of sending counsel aeress the water to
plead before a court whose members, while
mon of undoubted juridical ability, were not
,alxvays familiar with thse conditions in this
country.
Honourable senators will observe the words
"1when unanimeus" in my motion. As you

JUNE 8, 1936
are probably aware, judgments of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council are dec'1ared
to be unanimous, when as a matter of fact
ail the law lords may flot be of the same
opinion. This quality of u.nanimity enhances
the authority of their decisions. The same
practice, I may say, has been followed Vo a
considerable extent in our Supreme Court.
Later on I shall refer to a letter from a
very di"tinguished lawyer of Montreal, Mr.
C. S. Campbell, K.C., son of the laVe Sir
Alexander Campbell, at one time leader of
the Senate, and ask permission to place it
on Hansard. It shows very clearly what he
thinks of the matter and also of the position
I have taken.
My motion is qualified by the words, "except
in constitutional cases." I may say that when
I first presented a similar motion I amended
it in order to placate the people of my own
province, because then-I am speaking of
twenty years ago-the great majority of cases
going te the Privy Council in the previous
year had been from Quebec.
When the
Supreme Court was established the best
lawyers of the province of Quebec had no
confidence in the court. 1 know of one
famous lawyer, Mr. Bossé-af terwards a
judge-who when taking a hrief in a very
important case, said: "Well, I will tiake Youir
case, but, remember, if we lose in appeal,
or if it bas Vo go beyond the Court of Appeal
of the province of Quebec, I shall nut take
it Vo the Supreme Court of Canada; I shail
take it Vo the Privy Council. I am willing
to accept the brief on this condition, but flot
otherwise."
I happened Vo be in Philadeiphia in 1876
when the judges of the Supreme Court of
the United States hcld that Hayes had been
elected Vo the presidency. In those days the
court dividcd on party lines, and I think it
is generally admitted to-day that the decision
should have been in favour of Tilden.
Hon. Mr. Mignault, a former men-iber of
our Sujlrenae Court, who, had týo retire for
ne reasen except that he had attained the
age of seventy-five years, told me that when
a judgment was not really unanimous it
appeared te be so, for it would be delivered
by one of the judges who favoured it, while
those who disagreed would remain sulent.
This apparent unanimity gave a certain degree
of finahity, whereas if one or twe judges had
expressed their dissent a dissatisfied appellant
might be encouraged te carry his appeal to
the Privy Council. Therefore I strongly
helieve that the judgments of our court of
hast resort shouhd be unanimous.
When, twenty years age, I first deait with
this subject the Speaker of this House was

441

the Hon, Philippe Landry. He had once
propesed in the Commons that the court
shouhd he abolished entirehy.
At the same session of Parliament, Mr.
Girouard, then member for Jacques Cartier,
and afterwards a judge of the Supreme Court,
prasented iii the Commons a bill providing
that in ail cases which were of an absolutely
provincial character, that is, between two
persens of the same province, the judgment
of the Court of Appeal of the province should
be final; but, of course, a case between a
suitor in one province and another suitor in
another province,

or

between

one

province

and the central government, might go Vo the
Supreme Court. A similar practice prevails
in the United States.
If we have been foiind worthy of seats in
tliis Huse. we have been feund worthy of
discussing the varieus questions that ceme
before us. There are many reasns why
lawyers de net like te discuss these questions.

The vast majority of lawyers have never had
any case before the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council. They have neyer been asked
te ge acress the water, and consequently they
do net like te speak on this matter for fear
perhaps of heing told: "What do you know
about it? You have neyer pheaded hefore
the Committee of the Privy Ceuncil." Then
there are hawyers who have net heen fortunate
before the Privy Council. They have lest
their cases, and they say, "If wc speak about
restricting appeals people will think it is on
account of spite or resentment, because we
have net been well treated." Stili other lawyers
have been befere the Privy Ceuncil often, and
as they have received handsome fees, people
May Say te them: "0f course you are in faveur
of keeping up the system. It is a goed system;
iV brings yeu in money." However, Mr. Aimé
Geeffrien, a very able and distinguished lawyer,
has said that it dees noV pay him te appear
hefore the Privy Council; that he can make
more money riglit here in our own courts.
He is in faveur of abolishing appeals te the
Privy Council.
I have read only one letter with regard Vo
restricting the appeals. That hetter was frem
the laVe Eugène Lafleur, K.C., of Montreal,
who was certaînhy one of our best lawyers.
He went to England very often Vo plead before
the Privy Council. He was in faveur of the
proposition. Before I am Vhrough I shahl read
letters from Mr. Campbell and Mr. Geoffrion.
They have both had large experience before
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
and are aIse in faveur of restricting appeals.
I have before me a memorandum from the
Hon. Edward Blake, dated 6t *h October, 1875.
I have aIse taken communication of Mr.

442

SENATE

Blake's speech in Commons Hansard on the
Bill to establish a Supreme and an Exchequer
Court. He delivered in the British House of
Commons a remarkable speech-I commend it
to honourable members-on the Australian
Court Bill. It will he found in the British
Commons Hansard of May 21, 1900. On that
occasion Mr. Blake drew a parallel between
the Constitution of this country and the Constiitution of Austa'alia, adopted thirty-three
.years after our Confederation. After all, that
is only a small space of time in the life of
a nation. The Australian legislation shows the
wonderful strides that democracy had made
from 1867 to 1900. The Australian Commionwealth Bill is much broader and grants a fuller
measure of autonomy than the Constitution
that now governs this country. Of course,
since the Statute of Westminster we are almost
independent. The various states of the Auistralian confederacy have reserved all their
powers except those dclegated specially by
them to the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. That Constitution had
been prepared by the Australian people themselves. and when it came before the Imperia]
Parliament the very clause which is the burden
of my present remarks, on the question whether
there should be an appeal from the Supreme
Court of Australia to the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council. was in dispute. The
Bill was about to be withdrawn when a compromise was effected and the measure became
law. Mr. Blake in speaking on this subject
on that occasion used these words in order
to depict the nature of the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Australia:
This
creature
(the
Commonwealth
of
Australia) lias not been conceived in the
womb of the Mother of Parliaments.
It was the fruit of free mon in another confederation, giving them much larger autononry
than had been granted to Canada.
Now, Mr. Blake, in the memorandum which
was communicated to the Home Government
in 1875. said:
Sir, you inform me that some difficulty is
felt by the Colonial Secretary with reference
to the constitutional right of Parliament to
pass the 47th clause of the Act to establish
the Supreme Court of Canada. and that he is
about to submit tle questions to the law
officers of the Crown with a view to considering whether the Act should be disallowed, and
you request me to report to you confidentially
upon the subject.
That memorandum was addressed to the then
Governor Lord Dufferin, and I quote only a
few passages here and there. After arguing
that the Bill was within the rights of Canada
Mr. Blake said something which I wish to
draw to the special attention of the disHon. Nr. CASGRAIN.

tinguished senator from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth). Probably he will get
I may say that
the whole memorandum.
when Mr. Blake pleaded a case he covered the
whole ground. It is said that he was not very
poprular in the British House of Commons,
because he was prone to explain at length
every detail of the question to which he was
addressing himself. This is the passage:
It is therefore abundantly manifest that for
a great number of years the provincial legislatures have, without remonstrance, exercised
the power of determining that the judgment of
the provincial courts shall be final in all those
cases (comprising the large majority of the
whole number of cases tried) in which they
thought it was for the publie advantage that
there should be no appeal beyond the provincial courts.
Mr. Blake adds:
If the law. as expounded by any court,
however hiigh, did not meet the public exigencies, the provincial legislature altered the law
in order to reiedy the defect, and what the
provincial legislature could itself legislatively
expound without appeal, it had the right to
declare should be by its own courts judicially
expounded without appeal.
I give as evidence of that the famous case of
Canadian Pacific Railway vs. Roy. Roy, a
fariner, had his barns burned by a spark from
a locomotive of the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
The case was won by the farmer in Canada,
but lost in the Privy Council in England.
What was the consequence? At the very next
session of the Quebec Legislature the law was
amended in order to provide that in future
decisions of that nature should not be reversed by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I suggest that the
honourable gentleman adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps if my
hionourable friend is not tired he might prefer
to continue. He may not have another
chance to finish his speech.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Why should the
honourable leader of the Government say that
the honourable senator from De Lanaudière
may never get another opportunity to complete his speech? Tere may be a long debate,
for several honourable members would like
to discuss the subject-matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That may be, but
honourable members may be very happy to
have the speech in Hansard so that they may
have ample opportunity to peruse it before
they take part in the debate.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable members, I move the adjournment of the House.

JUNE 8, 1936
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend has no right to s.top a speaker
while lie has the floor.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am at the disposal of the House. I have a great deal
more to say on this subject. As you know,
this may be my swan song. However, I am
quite willingHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest to my honourable friend that when he
comes to citations he give us the purport of
them and place them on Hansard without
reading.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not think
anybody knows better than our honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) how much longer
he intends to entertain the House on this
subject. The subject is a very important
one, but to keep us here for an hour or so
and then begin a discussion would not advance
it very much. Probably it would be better
for him to adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is Monday. I
move that the debate be adjourned till
Wednesday next.
The debate was adjourned.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE

BILL

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 76, an
Act to amend -the Special War Revenue Act.
Hon. Mr. Murdock in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
that Mr. Sim, Commissioner of Excise, and
his assistant, Mr. Nauman, corne to the floor.
Section 1 was agreed to.

On section 2-stock transfer tax:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Chairman, in this section, which is the important
one, Part VII of the Act is repealed and there
is substituted what appears on page 2 of
the Bill. I call attention to the fact that
this change brings about, among other things,
a higher tax on the transfer of stock, and by
a subsequent section-I can hardly put my
finger on it at the moment, but the clerks in
front of the Minister will have it at oncethe increased assessment on transfers is made
retroactive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told it is
retroactive only to the date of the budget.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; I
know. But that is very serious. There is
no difficulty about making a sales tax retroactive, for impositions are made as soon
as it is announced; but with a transfer tax
the case is different. The trust companies up
to now have been imposing the transfer tax
in accordance with the existiing law. What
position are they going to be in if for the
period from May 2 to now, after they have
delivered their new certificates, they are to
be liable, under this retroactive provision, for
further sums in respect of transfers which
they were not licensed to tax? I think the
Bill w.ill have to be so worded that the
retroactive feature will not apply to stock
transfers. With respect to customs duty and
sales tax there is. I presume, a general law
governing the date when they shall take
effect. but it is pointed out to me that, as
I have said, stock transfer taxes are in a
different category. Up to the present time
companies have had no power to alter
transfer taxes, and now, the certificates being
out of their hands, they are in no position
to charge more. The amount involved would
be very small, and it is not worth while to
complicate the whole position of the trust
companies in order to try to make this
feature retroactive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
but very few cases would be affected by
this retroactive clauseRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -and the Commissioner of Excise thinks the difficuilty could
be adjusted by administrative regulation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If an
arrangement can be made in that way it
will be al] right.
I have just received a letter from thE
Dominion Mortgage Investment Association.

444

SENATE

se which they express serions alarm as to the
effect this clause would have. They say:
On page 19, by section 18 of the Bill, you
will see that section 2 of the Bill comes into
effect on May 2, 1936. Therefore, strictly
speaking, on all transfers of shares selling
over $160 per share, the full tax has not been
paid, because of the retroactive effect of this
section, and transferors are liable for the
mncrease.
I am concerned on belsalf of the position of
trust companies acting as stock transfer agents,
and not objecting to the increase in the tax
per se, but I do not think it is proper to give
a retroactive effect to such a change without
tiere having been some public announcenent
or notification- to interested persons.
It seems to me that the intention of the
Government in inserting section 18 was
primarily for the purpose of applying the
change in sales tax as of May 2. so as to
prevent transactions whieh would otherwise be
entered into for the purpose of evading the
tax. 'lihe sarne reasoning does not apply to
this change in stock transfer tax, and it looks
to me like an oversight in the drafting of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have asked
the Commisisoner if there was any statement
made or any inkling given in the budget
speech which would be a warning to the parties affected.
He says the fact was mentioned, but so indefinitely that he quite
appreciates the point raised.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It could not
be done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He says the
matter will be attended to administra.tively.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

All right.

Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3 to 7, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 8-regulations; oatis and declarations:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is a
rather new principle, is it not? This would
permit the Minister to authorize an office boy,
nessenger. or anyone else to administer oaths.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The explanation
I can give my right honourable friend is that
certain declarations are required in connection
with refund claims and the like, as well as
on returns made by taxpayers. It has been
held that the authority given in the Act was
not broad enough to cover the different
declarations required; consequently taxpayers
have been put to the expense and inconvenience of having to make declarations before
notaries public, commissioners of oaths, and
so on. This subsection would enable departmental officers to administer such oaths and
declarations where necessary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection to the Minister being empowered
to designate his departmental officers, but the
section goes farther. It says:
Any person designated by the Minister may
receive or adnsisîster ansy oath or declaration
required by this Act, or by any regulation
made thereunder.
Thsat is, any person at all could be designated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am told that
in practice the Minister wili naine officers.
Right Hon. M\r. MEIGHEN: Sbould not
the clause be changed to read, "Any officer of
the department designated by the Minister,"
instead of "Any person designated by the
Minister"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I ans informed
there is no special objection to altering the
clause to that effeet, but the uniform practice
is to designate an officer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Tien provision shsould be made accordingly. The Minister could name a miner or a charwoman
under this section.
The
carry?

CHAIRMAN:

Shall

the subsection

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I am
looking to sec if I can find the word "officer"
used elsewlhere, so that the wording may be
kept uniform.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
"Any officer"
would mean an officer of the departiment.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
word "oflicer" should be ubstituted for the
word "person" in line 20, and I would move
to have that change made.
Hon. Mr. HARMER:
Unless the word
"officer" is defined, how could you distinguish
between an officer and any other employee?
Riglht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The word
"officer" is used elsewbere, but I cannot put
my hand on it at the moment.
The CHAIRMAN: Would it also be necessary to change the word "person" in line 23
to read "officer"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The subsection should read:
Any officer designated by the Minister may
receive

or administer any oath or declaration

required by thsis Actand so on.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is this
objection to the change, as my right honourable friend will apprecia:te. In outlying parts

JUNE 9,1936
where there is no customs officer the postmaster is appointed to receive these declaratians. Therefore it would perhaps be better
to leave the subsection as it is. The practice
of the department is to designate officers
wherever possible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We could
change it to read "Any officer as described
in section 116 of this Act." In that section,
which appears on page 7 of the Bill, will be
found a list of officers:
The Commissioner of Excise, the Assistant
Commissioner of Excise, the Superintendent of
Excise Tax Collections, the Chief Excise Tax
Auditor, any Special Excise Tax Auditor, any
Assistant Special Excise Tax Auditor, a
Departmental Solicitor, or any other officer
authorized by the Minister from time to time
in that behalf.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That
mean an officer in the department.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

would

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think it is
better to leave to the department's discretion
the designating of an outsider in an outlying
district where there is no officer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a pretty
serious thing to enable a Minister to select
anyone at all. That method simply prostitutes
the whole duty of administering oaths. I take
it that under this section the Minister could
appoint a minor or child,.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: I submit that the
provision in the subsection is more reasonable
than tha.t proposed by my right honourable
friend. In remote places there may be instances where considerable expense would be
saved because it would be unnecessary to
send an officer ta receive an oath. I do not
believe there is any reason to feel that a
Minister would select an office boy, or any
person of that description. He would choose
some person in the locality who was capable
of administering an oath.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend thought that this subsection
provided for a new practice, but it does not.
He will observe that section 106 of the Act
reads as follows:
Every person liable for taxes under Parts
XI, XII and XIII of this Act and every manufacturer or producer licensed under section
ninety-five thereof, and every wholesaler or
jobber licensed under section ninety-six thereof,
shall file each month a true return of his
taxable sales for the last preceding month in
accordance with regulations made by the
Minister. The said return shall be verified by
statutory declaration made by the person

44.'

liable to pay the tax, his attorney or agent.
The declaration required under this section
may be made before any person designated
by the Minister to receive the same and every
such person shall, for the purposes of this
section, have the powers of a commissioner for
taking affidavits.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, that
appears to have been the practice already.
It seems to me to be a pretty loose practice,
though.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think a hardship would be created in some cases if only
an officer could be designated. We bad better
leave the word "person" in.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: May I suggest that
the word "fit" be inserted, so that it would
read "Any fit person."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
will have the responsibility.

The Minister

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That the
thing may be made to look right, we are told
in the explanatory note that the Minister
designates officers.
Section 8 was agreed to.
On section 9--monthly returns of taxable
sales:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No change.

Section 9 was agreed to.
Sections 10 and 11 were agreed to.

Sometimes I wonder if this is flot one of the
phases that should be explored in connection
wit'h the study of our present economic situation. It may be answered that though, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars have

steadily increasing volume.

people have drawn for that stupendous invest ment in motor--cars.
An Hon. SENATOIt: Some people have
mortgaged their fairms.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We hear it
said that many persons run motor-cars when
they really cannoýt afford the expense. But
there is another side to lihe subject. The
eh.cap motor-car bhas added more to the education of our people than any otheýr factor
I can think of. In the old days in our small
towns and villages you would sce the father
and mother and their little children out for

even of their locality. The cheap motor-car

flot only with their own -township, but with
their oounity end their province, and in
fact with other provinces. Thjs was impossible
before. It has led to Veachers stimulating the
interest of their pupils in local gcography.
Pardon me: I have heen a school teacher and
know this from experience. T-he young foýlks
are asked by t.heir teacher to give a short
description of their motor trips throughout
thie neighbourhood. I repeat, these motorcars have been one of the greatest ediicational
factors in the Dominion.

JUNE 9, 1936
theless I believe it is possible to live up to
the standard set by the Duff Commission.
The trustees are splendid men, and, from
all reports, good and truc men, but they had
only slight experience in such railway administration. And I wish te emphasize that they
did not succeed in working together harmoniously.
Although they numbered only
three, they were divided and very seldom if
ever sat together. The board appointed a
chief operating officer, with the 'titular rank
of President, but they limited his jurisdiction
considerably.
Among other duties he was
given that of fixing the time-tables, and
the engaging and continuing in and discharging from employment, the personnel
required for such purposes, or any of them,
and the fixing of the terms and conditions of
such employment, all salaries to be approved
by the chairman of the trustees. This authority,
however, is not to cover the appointment of
vice-presidents, general managers, secretary,
treasurer, European agent, European secretarytreasurer, or heads of departments.
It will be seen quite clearly that this chief
operating officer was shorn of authority which
he should have had to reward the men under
him by way of salary and promotion, and that
his position as President was thus considerably weakened. He became an adviser to the
Chairman, who was the real operating head
of the railway. Functions and authority were
apportioned between the President and the
Chairman of the Board, whereby the supposed
operating head became shorn of powers over
what constitutes "the entire working of the
railway in detail"-to borrow a phase from
the Duff Report.
The present Bill does not change the object
and purpose of the 1933 measure, except by
increasing
the executive from three to
seven directors. The Drayton-Acworth Report
recommended five directors. The Canadian
National Railway Act provided for fifteen,
which number was later increased to seventeen. But such a scattered directorate was
so unwieldy that in 1927 it was judged necessary to appoint an executive of six members,
which number was increased to eight in 1931.
In that year three members chosen from
the executive board were appointed a finance
committee.
Under the present measure the Governor
in Council will appoint directors and a chairman, and the majority will rule. The Governmenit is willing to be judged by its
appointments. Organized labour will be represented. It is the desire and intention of
the Administration that the chairman shall
be a trained and experienced railway man.
So that the board may function quite independently of the Government, the Deputy
Minister of Railways will not be a director,
as he has been in the past. The Minister
12745-29J

451

of Railways will keep in close contact with
the chairman on problems affecting the Government and railway policy. There is no use
in denying the fact that the Canadian National is a state-owned railway, in connection
with which the Government must apply to
Parliament for a money vote, and, therefore,
must accept responsibility.
As to the tenure of office, the Duff Commission suggested seven years. The Act of
1933 fixed the term at ire years for the Chairman, four for the second member and three
for the third. The present Bill provides for
the appointment of three directors for three
years, two for two years, and two for one
year. Thus continuity and annual rotation
will be secured.
The Bill removes the disability which prevented any employee of the Canadian National Railways from becoming a chief executive.
There is provision for approval by the
Governor in Council of by-laws which under
the existing law would need to be approved
by shareholders, inasmuch as the Executive
of Parliament represents directly-shall I say?
-the
shareholders of the state-owned railway, the people of Canada.
The Act of 1933 is in four parts. Part I
deals with the trustees, and is the part mainly
affected by this Bill. Part 2, which enjoine
co-operation between the two railways, remains intact. Part 3 imposes compulsory cooperation and arbitration on the two railways. This is left intact; as is also Part 4,
whioh prohibits amalgamation.
With the former board of directors contact
was not continuous. It will now be closer
and uninterrupted, as the new directors will
take an active and more effective part in the
administration of the railway system.
There will be no double or multiple
salaries, as obtained under the old Canadian
National Act prior to the appointment of the
present trustee board.
The Government is .responsible for the
administration of the system, and, needless
to add, it bas a mandate from the people. I
suggest, therefore, that it should not be
hampered in its administration of the railways. The Government will be judged by
the results under the new system. The railway situation is the biggest problem which
confronte the people of Canada. It has been
said we have two problems of equal importance: unemployment, which is but a
temporary problem; the railway problem,
which also may be but temporary, but seems
likely to be with us for some time yet.
The men needed to carry out the policy of

ing. In short, the organization of our railway management must start from the top.
A question may be raised-I have heard
it already-as to the vested rights of the
chairman of the present trustee board. The
term of office of the other trustees is about to
expire. On this question I may be permitted
to cite the words of the honourable Minister

former judge, claimed compensation and
carried his case to the Privy Council. The
Privy Council disallowed the appeal. I may
say that before the late Government went out
of office it provided compensation for the
judges, members of that tribunal, whose terms
Lad still some years to run. They were
voted a certain solatium. In the present
instance there is net likely to be any litigation. I think the statement of the Lonourable Minister should reassure the friends of
the chairman of the present board of trustees that le will be dealt with equitably.
With these remarks I move, seconded by
the Right Hon. Mr. Graham, the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Before
making any remarks, may I ask whether it
is the intention of the honourable leader of
the Government te refer the Bill te the
Raiway Committee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
examined the Bill with that idea in mind. As
I have just stated, the main change to be
effected is in Part 1 of the 1933 Act. Unless my right honourable friend insists upon
the Bill being referred to the Railway Committee, I should feel inclined. in order to
expedite our business, to have it dealt wiýth in
Committee of the Whole. But on that score
I am at the disposal of my right honourable
frienq
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Riiglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am grateful to the lonourable leader of the Government for agreeing, because, so far as I have
any right to do se, I would insist on the Bill
Leing referred te the Railway Committee.
With this understanding, I shall net offer opposition to the measure at the present stage.
I think the Bill is eminently one which should
go to the committee, because we should be
certain of our facts-facts stated by the
leader of the Governnent as the reasons for
the ineasure. We should verify then before
we legislate on the faith of them, and it is
only before the Railway Committee that we
can achiecve any certainty of, or direct contact with, facts.
The measure, broadly speaking, has two
purposes. One is to get rid of the present
board of trustees and in their place to appoint
a board of seven directors. Its importance
lies net in the designation "directors" as against
the

difference. The importance of
lies in the principle of changing
of this great system because of
government.

Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND: If that were
the only reason it would be a poor one.
RigLt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is for us
to inquire whether there is another reason.
The other great purpose apparently is, in
the words of the Lonourable leader opposite,
to leave the Government, which is ultimately
responsible, unhampered in its administration
of the system. These are undoubtedlv important purposes. As te their Leing legitimate
and wise, I postpone my remarks until the
facts have been illuminated.
First, the
What are the facts alleged?
present system has failed. Second, the main
reason for the failure is that the Chairman
of the Board of Trustees is net a man familiar
with and accustomed to railway affairs-is
not a railway man. The third fact as implied,
if net indeed specifically stated by the leader
of the Government, is that the Chairman of
the Board of Trustees assumed to himself
functions which under the terms of the legislation it was net contemplated Le should
assume. These are all questions of fact.
First, has the administration been a failure?
If se, is it mainly because the head of the
trustee board is not a practical railway manor was not prier to his appointment. Third,
is it a fact that Le usurped functions net
intended by the legislation? In order to verify
these facts it is advisable to refer the Bill to
the Railway Committee.

JUNE 9, 1936
I want for a moment to comment on the
second puirpose -of the Bill. 'This purpose is, in
the words of the honourable leader, to see
to it that the Government is no longer hampered in administering the property. If in
virgin simplicity one came to consider the
public affairs of Canada and listened to my
honourable friend in bis very plausible presentation of the Government's case, one might
be disposed to think it quite logical that the
Government, being ultimately responsible to
the people for the proper discharge of its
obligations as trustee for the nation of this
great national railway system, should not be
hampered in determining its policies and the
general conditions under which it operates.
That perhaps sounds convincing.
But the
problem is much bigger, much older, and the
background much vaster than is indicated
by the remarks of the honourable leader of
the Government. In very recent years there
have been long periods when there was no
hampering, no restraint, when, as very definitely stated by the honourable leader this
afternoon, the Government of the day was free
to choose men in whom it had confidence to
administer the property. Then that condition
prevailed in all its fullness and amplitude.
But we did not get just the results the people
of Canada expected. I am afraid that if I
went to the extent of my own convictions I
should say we got most disastrous results,
and the fearful burden under which we labour
now and the great difficulties we are called
upon to surmount are due simply to the results of that full and ample sway of the Administration in directing the policy of -the road
and determining that those in charge should
be men who had its confidence.
My honourable friend opposite puts forward, in a manner which undoubtedly is best
designed to fal soothingly on the car of
honourable senators, the claim of the Administration that it should have the right to
ch}oose men in whom it bas confidence to
run the system. But when that statement
is analysed and, is oairried to its inevitable
result it means that our great national railway
system, involving a capital investment by
this country of something in the neighbourhood of two billions and a half of money,
must necessarily have a change of operating
officials and of direction with every change
of government; that we must no longer have
anything in the way of continuity in the
management and direction of the system. If
such is the principle we are to follow, it
behooves us to inquire whether we can ever
expect to have this road handled in a businesslike manner. to the advantage of the people
of this country, or to have it anything but an

453

incubus of appalling blackness and terror,
such as it rapidly became over many years
of its history.
The honourable leader opposite says that
the Government bas a mandate. If it can be
shown that under the present head the
administmtion of the road is a failure-if the
fact can be disclosed, supported and proved,
then undoubtedly there is implied in the very
return of the Government a mandate to
change the administration of the railway.
But may I ask him if he feels there is any
mandate aside from the establishment of that
fact as a proved case? Did the members of
the Government now in office say to the
electors of Canada that they had no faith in
the present board of trustees, that in their
judgment the trustees were a failure, and
that they intended to oust them? If they
did, I did not hear them. If any such statement of intention was made to the Canadian
people, I never read it. I do not know where
it appears or where it can be found. In fact,
I know of no specific mandate, or anything
approaching one, being given in this matter;
and it is a specific mandate that we are now
called upon · o ratify.
t
I hear threatenings and fulminations as to
what will happen this body if we do not do
what we are told. I am not particularly
concerned personally as to what happens
this body, but I am particularly concerned
about this body doing its duty under all
circumstances and in spite of al threats.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would
rather see this House abolished because it did
its duty than sec it despised because it failed
to do its duty.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We should
act in respect of this measure with a single
regard to the ultimate good of this great
system.
We should not refuse to take a
proper step merely because, by giving the
Administmtion an opportunity to blare aomeone else for failure, it wou'ld possibly react to
the disadvantage of a party seeking office;
and we certainly shoud'dl not refrain from
action because we a-re told in thunder language
;that we have no rights at all in the premises,
that we are not elected by the people, and
that our only business is to get out of the path
and let those who were elected have their way.
The Fathers of Confederation were, I think,
as stmrong and devoted friends of a democratic system of government as ever founded
a nation.
They built their faith on the
history and tradition of Britain.
Taking
lessons from that great nation, they decided

form an integral, pivotal, and indeed mementous part. It is our duty to live up to
our part. I should be the last te advise any
Sonate, after a reasonable check had been
applied for a just purpose, to refuse to heed
the public will, which, right or wrong, must
ultimately prevail. But certainly it is our
profound and lasting duty, whenever we deem
it right and proper, to provide a check for the
purpose of affording the public opportunity
and time to think a matter over, and of
bringing the intelligence of the nation close
to the real problem and the possible consequences of a false move in its solution.
I have made these remarks with no special
reference to this measure. They apply equally
to all measures. We must have deference to
mandates. This does net mean that every
mandate in every election can be read as
approval of every single sentence uttered by

did, nearly everything in the world could be
justified. A mandate which results from a
definite or repeated pýronouncement of policy,
se openly made that the whole nation understands, and so advanced as to be one of the
things voted upon, must always have the very
great respect of this Sonate. This Sonate
cannot cast aside a mandate even less definite
and pronounced; but the regard which we
bave for it must depend upon how clearly
the whole problem was presented to the nation
when it made its choice. We must net lose
sight of what we believe to be the permanent
good if there is reason to hope that a wiser
judgnent will be secured when time bas been
allowed and probably more is known of the
subject to be ultimately decided.
I am glad, indeed, and grateful, that the
honourable leader of the Government lias
agreed to allow this Bill to go te committee.
I hope the committee will see to it that
nothing is placed in the way of bringing out
real facts pertaining to this matter. I can
coneive of a mistake being made-a mistake of a tremendous character, with farWe
reacbing and disastrous consequences.

must have that proof. Then, in the light of
exvidence, we must carefully examine the
principles that should be applied, or continued, in the administration of this great
systen.

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable members, I am not afraid that

BALLANTYNE:

You

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I still have
faith in the future, although most of my
life is behind me.
The condition outlined by my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
relates not merely to one railway in Canada,
but to more than one; in fact, it applies to
almost every railway on the continent of
North America. So the suggestion that financial difficulties came to but one railway in
this country, or were attributable to one
system, or one board of directors, is net well
founded. Before the depression came-and
this is the only reference I am going to
make to it-the Canadian National had
sufficient at the end of the year to pay its
overbead and what it owed the public, and
a little balance besides.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
pay a balance; it earned it.

It

did not

R.ight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It had money
to pay the interest on its indebtedness; so
the Government did net have to pay that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The system
earned a little more than enough to pay
the interest due to the public, but when that
was paid the balance was not applied on
interest due the Government. It was kept in
the treasury.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I know that.
I do not want to spend much time discussing this matter. He is a very optimistic
man who would imagine that under all conditions and circumstances our conglomeration of systems could pay interest on the
money borrowed from the Government without swamping the people with increased rates.
I never baid any such idea in my mind.
However. that is not what I wish to discuss.
Being Chairman of the Railway Committee,
I may not have much opportunity of strongly
expres.ing my views in the committee; se,
as one who under the rules of debate in
the Senate bas the right to speak, I desire
to express myself now. When the previous
legislation was put through I voted with the
majority. Every member of the House who
was a member of the Railway Committee
will recall that in spite of great criticism
from many quarters, including both railways,
I stood by every detail of the Bill presented

JUNE 9, 1936
by the Government at that time, believing,
in the light of the Duff Report, that it would
be wise to try the experiment of trustees.
While I possibly would do the same thing
again in the same circumstances, I have no
hesitation in saying that I am not at all
satisfied with the management of the Canadian National under the board of trustees.
It is idle to imagine for a moment that
harmony has prevailed. I know that harmony
has not prevailed between the trustees and
the late Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
a good sign.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You may say,
"Prove it"; but honoumble gentlemen would
not like to, be asked to prove many of the
things they have heard from friends. The
fact remains, and it is known to everybody,
that very strong differences of opinion existed
between the late Government and the board
of trustees. Without going further, I may
say that I am informed that there were
even very strong differences of opinion
among the trustees themselves. I will not
say that was fatal, but it shows that the
scheme did not work out as we all thought it
would.
There is another point to which I would
refer, and I call the Chairman of the Board
of Trustees as my witness. There was included in the Act which we passed a section
providing for the establishment of a board
to settle differences between the two railways and to bring about co-operation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Arbitration.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Some of us call
it arbitration. Its purpose was to settle any
differences between the two railways. The
other day, when asked why greater co-operation did not take place, the Chairman of the
Board himself said it was because some of the
parties were not in favour of it. If that
board had been brought into operation, or
part of the statute carried into effect, some
of the difficulties might have been settled.
But they were not settled. I maintain, therefore, as a member of the Senate who took a
prominent part in putting through the Bill,
that the Government in not putting that
particular provision into effect failed to keep
faith with us. I think that in failing to enforce it the Government made a great mistake
and did a great injustice to those of us in the
Senate who fought for days to have the provision adopted. Co-operation might have
saved the situation.
Now let me speak of a subject which I am
sure no person in the Senate, not even my

455

right honourable friend, is acquainted with at
all. I refer to political interference. Considerable of a myth has grown up with respect to this subject. We are all human, notwithstanding the fact that some of us are
more angelic than others. The public do not
believe a word we say when we insinuate that,
other things being equal, we do not do anything for our friends. Any statement to that
effeot is all nonsense. Let us avoid that sort
of statement. Nobody believes it. We de
not believe it ourselves.
Someone may ask, "What did you do on the
Intercolonial?" The Intercolonial was in a
different position fron the Canadian National.
It was built for the purpose, to put it mildly,
of aiding the Maritime Provinces. At the
same time it aided other parts of Canada.
The Maritimes had a right to think they ought
to have something to say about how the Intercolonial should be managed in order to bring
about the results intended by the Fathers of
Confederation. When I as Minister was head
of the Intercolonial Railway the members from
the Maritime Provinces and Quebec did not
hound me to death. On behalf of the people
of those provinces they came to me as representatives having a perfect right to discuss a
situation in which they were interested.
Hon. Mr. ARTHURS: What is the difference?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: One can be a
straight partisan, you know, or one can listen
to a man and then do what one thinks is
right.
Now I come to Ontario, blessed Ontario,
where I live. The men elected in Ontario are
supposed to represent the people in their constituencies, and when I was Minister of
Railways I had as many complaints from
Ontario members as from members representing any other pa.rt of the Dominion. If
a station was closed, or was made a flag
station when a fast train was put on, I was
appealed to. and rightly so. When the people
wish to appeal to the Government, through
whom should they appeal if not the member
elected to represent them? I think, therefore,
political partisanship may be regarded as
largely a name given to the right of elected
membes, when in need of assistance of any
kind, no matter what their party may be, to
appeal to those in power. I never was troubled
very much by political pressure. I am looking
now at some gentlemen who used to come tO
see me quite frequently. If I could not meet
their wishes when they had stated their case, I
said so. I think we overdo this "political
partisanship" business. Our affairs are run

JUNE 9,1936
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -my right honourable friend facing me (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen). I think it can be said that during
the many years I have filled the position of
leader of this Chamber I have constantly upheld the right of the Senate to express itself
on publie legislation. On more than one occasion I have quoted the view of Sir John A.
Macdonald that the Senate should lean rather
sympathetically towards the Administration
of the day, since it represents the will of the
people; but my long experience in this House
has led me to feel sometimes that Sir John A.
Macdonald did not take sufficient account of
the human element. I think that an ideal
Senate would be rather inclined to criticize,
in a good spirit, measures coming from the
other House. I have not often observed a
keen desire for improving legislation when the
majority has been seated behind the Minister
in this Chamber. There was too strong an
inclination then to agree with measures coming from the other House. Though such has
been my view on this point, I desire to say
to my right honourable friend that with respect
to matters that are not essential, not of considerable importance, I think the Senate should
follow the line suggested by Sir John A.
Macdonald and show some sympathy towards
Government legislation.
I make these remarks because I have read
in the newspapers that there are to be clashes
between the two Chambers.
Now, coming to this Bill, I find that at
present there is a board of three trustees
administering that immense business known
as the Canadian National Railways. Two of
the trustees are about to terminate their
period of office, and one may have some two
or three years more to serve. The Government, faced with the great responsibility of
administering that railway system, which has
an annual deficit of around fifty million dollars, says it believes another board should be
appointed, composed not of three, but of
seven members. This seems to me of so little
consequence that I believe that even if honourable members doubt the wisdom of increasing membership of the board from three
to seven, the Senate would not take the
responsibility of insisting upon its own views
in this case as against the policy formulated
by the present Government, which bas just
been elected by the people and will be responsible for the administration of the railway during the next four years. We are, of
course, free to discuss any measure here, but
I fear my right honourable friend is perhaps
following a doubtful course when he says
that in committee he will test the reasons

of the Government for the proposed small
change as to personnel of the board.
On examining this Bill we observe that it
contemplates but a slight change in the featurcs of the existing legislation. Surely we
should select some different occasion for insisting upon our right to amend a measure
coming from the House of Commons. I mention this point simply by way of suggesting
that my right honourable friend and other
honourable members might examine the present situation calmly to see if there is any
cause for the Senate to assert its right to
reject a piece of legislation which is deemed
by the Minister of Railways to be allimportant.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To be unimportant or all-important?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

All-important.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thought the
honourable leader's reason for urging us not
to oppose it was that it was unimportant.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, it is unimportant in the matter of principle.
It
simply establishes a new organization and
places the administration of the railway in
the hands of seven directors. I wonder how
anyone can get very much excited over this
proposed change, in view of the recommended
and actual changes in the size of the board,
to which I have already referred. The late
Government decided upon a board of three
members, and the present Administration
wishes to increase the number to seven. There
is but little importance in the proposed change
in the machinery for administering this great
railway. If honourable members dislike the
Bill only because of the number of members
it contemplates for the board, I would ask
them to think twice before locking horns with
the other Chamber on this matter. Of course,
we can always fully exercise our discretion
on an important question of principle. I shall
not go to the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours with the belief that this
proposal to increase the board from three to
seven members presents a very important
question for our consideration.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I think on this question I am perhaps in a
different position from many of my colleagues. As I remember, when I sat on the
other side I spoke and voted against the
trustee board arrangement incorporated in
the Act of 1933. I stated that in my judgment the then Bill was ineffective-would not

way problem. I think it is fortunate that
this Bill is to be referred to the Railway
Committee, if for no ether reason than to
permit us to inquire why the Act of 1933 did
not work out satisfactorily. It is very clear
in my mind why that legislation did not work
out as was generally expected.
But, that
method having proved to be a failure, the best
step to take next is to try another method.
I have not read my speech of 1933, but as
I recall, I predicted that within five years,
or the ordinary life of a Parliament, there
would be a railway loss of $250,000,000. The
five years have not yet elapsed, but I think
I am safe in saying that se far the loss to the

treasury is probably $150,000,000.
But that is not the worst. We are lulling
ourselves into a sense of false security. We
are fooling ourselves if we think our railway system has cost us only $150,000,000 in
the last three years. Anyone who trmvels
over our ailvays and secs the deterioration which is taking place must realize that
the day is not far distant when we shall be
called upon to spend millions of dollars to
rehabilitiate the system and bring the lines
and equipment up to date. On some of the
American lines the so-called zephyr trains are
running seienty miles an hour. Diesel engines
proide the motive power, and the fuel cost is
but a tenth of the cost of operating coalburning engines. Those trains run from
Chicago te Minneapolis, four hundred miles,
with not a stop for fuel or water. We musf
realize that we are in a new era of transportation by rail, road and air. Our railways are rapidly losing their business. Many
people in the city in which I live motor down
to the American side and travel on Ameirican
railways. That transportation is superior, but
the cost is the same. Anynone who thinks we
shall exven retain our present irailway travel, to
say nothing of attiracting t.ouirist traffic, must
realize the vast amount of further capital
expenditure that is necessary in order te
modernize our railways and rolling stock. I
fear that with the replacements in the next
few years our annual railway deficit is likely
to be $100,000,00
n
f $50000000.
We all know business is improving. but if
we are relying on business improvement alone
we are building on a false foundation. One of
its corner-stoenes is ouir railway situation. Like
everyv other structure built on a faNe basis,
our business structure is domed to fall unless
we repair its crumbling foundation.
I regret that the Goverement finds it necessary to revert to the old system which obtained
prier to 1933. It will throw us back to whbere
we were formerly. I am ready to support this
or any other Government prepared te tackle
HoUn. Mr. McRAE.

the railhay problem in a m.a'nner that gives
promise of a solution. It may be that the
Government in bringing down this Bill has
a solution in mind. I feel that the Government regards the railway situation as one of
the major problems of Canada, and desires
to have this Bill enacted. I ani ready to vote
for it; but, I desire t-o point out to the Government, I shall support it not in order that
we may return to the conditions which formerly prevailed, but in order that the Government may have a free hand, and the full
respon-ibility whi-ch goes with that freedom.
Mav I caution the Government on one
point?
There are many inquiries now by
men who make money on the stock market
with respect to wihat wil-1 be the probable
solution of our railway problem. Any solution which might result in wild speculation in
railway securities of one kind or another
will be harmful net only to the public, but
to the treasury as well. The Government
bas a very serious responsibility in seeing to
it that any attempted solution shall net have
the effect of creating speculation in railway
stocks on a scale such as we have known in
the past.
I do net believe it is in the realm of
possibilitv for a board of directors te remedy
the present railway situation. In my judgment the solution of our railway problem
is either unification or increased railway
rates. The Government may just as well face
the facts. As I have said. I am perfectly
willing to support the Bill, but I should
not care to do so without impressing on the
Government its grave responsibility. I know
there is strong objection to unification, but
I suggest that the Government might well
consider a plan, to be spread over ten years,
which would take cire of every man now
working on the railways and so avoid any displacement of labour. I have it on the best
of authority that the eredit of this country,
particularly in England, is involved in the
proper zzettlement of our railway problem.
W'e should ain at something that promises
to place our roads on a sound basis within
the next ten years. Had we done this four
or five years ago, we should now be half
One of the main
way towards our goal.
objections to unification is that it involves
the discharge of many employecs, but I
believe it would be practicable to work out,
over a period of years. a plan which would
enable those men to be taken care of.
Even under unification, in view of the
tremelndous additional capital expenditure
which will hiaie to be provided for. I do net
think it will be possible for many years

JUNE 9, 1936
to come to improve railway earnings to such
a degree as to show a net surplus.
One point connected with the Bill I do not
like. We have heard a great deal about the
sanctity of contracts. Well, I think sanctity
of contracts. like charity, should begin at
home. In 1933 Parliament, rightly or wrongly,
passed
the
Canadian
National-Canadian
Pacifie Act, under which we incurred certain
contractual obligations. If by further legislation we wipe all that out, are we not doing
exactly what many people in this country
want sto do-axe we not diisregarding the
obligations we entered into with the board
of trustees? I hold no brief for the trustees,
but when I make a contract with a man I
like to live up to it. I do not think Parliament should set an exampile in disregarding
contracts.
The railway problem is a very serious one.
The financial soundness of Canada is wrapped
up in it. In concluding my remarks I must
express my regret that the Government has
not put forward something that in my judgment promises a solution. I shall be greatly
disappointed, and so will the people, if we
continue much longer wi.th annual deficits
of $50,000.000-deficits which would be still
further increased if the railway system were
kept up to the proper standard of maintenance.

GOVERNMENT

ANNUITIES

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report of
the special committee appointed to consider
and report upon the operation of the Government Annuities Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the special
committee appointed to -consider and report
upon the operation of the Government
Annuities Act begs leave to make its second
report as follows:
In the investigation of the annuities question your committee had in mind obtaining
evidence to show:
(1) If the mortality tables used by the
Annuities Branch were accurate and up-to-date;
(2) If the interest rate upon which anuities were based was a reasonable and proper
one;
(3) If the Annuities Branch might be better
placed or amalgamated with some other department than that under which it is now placed.
On the first two points, there seemed to be
unanimity of opinion from those giving evidence
and from the department in charge of annuities.
Those who gave evidence before the committee were Mr. A. D. Watson, Chief Actuary
of the Department of Insurance; Mr. E. G.
Blackadar, Superintendent of Annuities; Professor M. A. MacKenzie, of the University of
Toronto, President of the Teachers' Insurance
and Annuity Association of America.
This
association is probably selling more annuities
than any other one in North America.
In addition to all verbal evidence, there was
a considerable amount submitted in writing.
The evidence showed that the mortality
tables now used were obsolete, and while
insurance companies and other companies
granting annuities had changed their mortality
tables from time to time in recent years the
table used by the Annuities Branch remained
unchanged, with the result that the public
treasury is losing a very large amount of
money annually.
The Annuities Branch estimates this loss to
he about $400.000 for the past year. The
evidence submitted by others, however, indicates that the loss was probably greatly in
excess of this amount.
Professor MacKenzie suggests that the present
mortality table used in Great Britain is the
better one to adopt. He further states that
it is about the same as the latest mortality
table used in the United States.
The evidence shows that under the present
rates charged by the Canada Life an annuity
for a man aged 50 is computed at 16-93 times
the revenue, that is to say, an annuity of
$1.000 a year would cost $16,930, whereas at
the present rate of Government annuities it
would cost him only $13,970. This one annuity
would show a loss under our present plan, to
the Government, of $3,000, or a loss rate of
about 22 per cent. In other words, the
mortality table used by Canada plus the interest rate is 22 per cent out of line with the
present rates in use elsewhere.
The interest rate upon which the annuities
were based by the Government, namely 4 per
cent, was, at the time the measure was
enacted, a reasonable rate, but since then
changes in money rates have made it necessary

JUNE 10, 1936
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Do you not
think there will be an unpreedented rush
to buy annuities, on account of the publicity
given to the present rates?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I would suggest that
it be put over until the next sitting, at
least, so that honourable members may have
a chance of studying it.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
In the
first place I wish to express thanks to the
honourable gentleman who brought this
matter to the attention of the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Black), and who with his colleagues on
the committee pursued the question diligently
and compiled a report. I have had some
inkling of the dangerous working of the Act.
I am now fortified in my opinion by the
report of the committee.
I shall bring the report to the attention of
the Government and ask the Minister of
Labour whether he cannot at this session
bring down a short Bill to implement the
recommendations of the committee, or at
least exercise his diseretion by suspending the
granting of further annuities until such legislation is enacted.
I shall emphasize this
view to him and to the honourable Minister
of Finance.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: I fancy the
conclusion arrived at by the committee is
largely based upon the fact that to-day the
rate of interest is very low. Some years ago
a committee of the Senate took evidence on
the working of the Annuities Branch, and at
that time we were told the Government had
for the past twenty years borrowed money
at the rate of 4-60 per cent and annuities
were costing 4-10 per cent; so the Government was making a profit of one-half of one
per cent. Since then the rate of interest has
tumbled to three per cent, and on this basis
of course the annuity business is being carried
on at a loss.
But the Government must take the long
view of the matter. It would be unwise
to interrupt the business suddenly without
sound reason. I would suggest that before
the Government takes action it satisfy itself
that it must change the rate of interest on
annuities because of the declining rate of
interest on mSoney. If it decided to make a
change and then, because of the external
situation, the rate of interest should rise to
five or six per cent, the Government would
have interrupted a really worthwhile business on grounds that had proved to be unsound. I suggest to the honourable leader
of the House that he draw the attention of the

Minister to the question whether or not the
rate of interest is likely to remain at a certain figure.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That point is covered
in the report. We recommend that the same
system be adopted here as obtains in Great
Britain. There the rate of interest on Government annuities is based on the selling
price of British consols, and it may vary from
day to day. I am told, however, that as a
rule the Annuities Branch revises the interest
rate once a year. I may add that it does not
put the proceeds frorn the sales of annuities
into the Consolidated Revenue or other
Government funds. It at once invests the
money in British consols, and the fund is
kept entirely free from Government control.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Mr. Black, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Smith, that this report be taken into consideration at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Now.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I would ask that consideration of
this report go over to the next sitting of the
House. I think the discussion we have had
is somewhat out of order, but in my judgment it presents another side of the picture.
I have nothing but compliments to pay to
the chairman of the committee, and I am
not in mueh disagreement with what is contained in the report, though I think some
of its implications are to a certain extent onesided. However, I was very much surprised
as a member of the committee to find the
report was to be presented to-day. The chairman has given a satisfactory explanation,
that he bas to go away next week, and there
was not time to have another meeting of
the eommittee. I think the .recommendations
might in some respects -have been different if
the committee could have got together finally
to analyse the report and determine on its
for.m. That being the case, why hurry this
matter by disposing of it to-day?
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
It will stand
as a notice of motion for the next sitting
of the House.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: My original motion
was for the next sitting of the House.

MOTION NEGATIVED

The Senate resumed fron May 27 the
adjourned debate on teic motion of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand:
Thtat the Senate do unite with the Ilouse of
('ommons in an Address to lis Most Excellent
Majesty the King, praying that he may
gracionsly be pleased to give his consent to
subnitting a measure to the Parliament of the

United Kingdon of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland to amend the Britisi North America
Acts. 1867 to 1930, and the British North
America Act, 1907, and that the Senate do
insert in the blank space therein the words
"Senate and."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On Monday
last I gave notice that it was the intention
of the Government te amend tc first part
of the Address. One of my colleagues will
now move the amendment.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
when this Address came before the House for
discussion soue time ago tc arguments of
the right honouratle lcader of the Opposition
(Rigtt Hon. Mr. Meigten) and the subsequent inquiries I made convinced me that I
could net support the resolution as it then
stood. I based my conclusion largely, if net
entirely, on the ground that it might set up
means by whiieh one province could discriminate against another by way of indirect
tariffs.
I considered that a very serions
matter.

I want now to move the following amendmient:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

That the said Address be amended by add-

ing at the end of paragraph 1 of clause 2A
the following:
provided that such taxation does not favour
or discriminate against the sales of any goods
or articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any province or of any country.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, on Monday evening I stated that
I had consulted my colleagues. This it was
naturally my duty to do, but doubly so in
this case, because I had been urged in a very
friendly and sympathetic manner by tc right
tonourable leader on tte other side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) to draw the attention of
the Cabinet to an aspect of tc matter which
in his opinion calleti for considerable

cogita-

tion. The result of my conference is te be
found in the amendment now moved.
I stated te my colleagues that I knew there
had been some other objections, which might
still be raised or considered by tiis Ctamber.
I intend to address myself for a moment to
one of those objections, which tas been very
forcibly advanced in committee and in the
Senate, namely. that it is inopportune to open
the field of indirect taxation to tc provinces,
inasmuch as it would enable them to tax the
consumer without bis knowledge and would
lead to continued inflation of the provincial
budgets, when in reality every effort should
be made to compress them.
I desire te point out te honourable members
that the field within which the provinces
can find ways and means of meeting their expenditures is net very extensive. They have
g.one about trying to find avenues or sources
from which, under the British North America
Act, they could raise income, and they have
inevitably been drawn to the sales tax. It
would now be very difficult to get them to
retire from that field. I cannot say on the
spur of the moment just what Ontario, for
instance, collects by way of tax -on gasoline,
but I know ttat this year Quebec will collect
$5.000.000 or 86,000,000-a substantial item in
its budget. The provinces are reaching out in
the field of the sales tax by making the retailers their agents for the direct collection of
the tax from tc consumer. It bas been said
that this form of levy would deter them from
proceeding in a more noticeable way, whereby
the people would more keenly feel the charge
collected from them. If one looks at the income the provinces derive from this source, it
becomes evident that they will not withdraw
from the sales tax field, as in it they have
found an effective method of reaching the
taxpayer.
It bas been stated more than once that the
provinces should not be allowed to tax indirectly; that under such a method the people
who would be forced to pay increased taxes

JUNE 10, 1936
in the provinces would net realize that they
were being taxed te such an extent. Well, I
venture te say that argument covers the whole
of the taxing activities of the Dominion. If it
is bad te allow the provinces to collect by
means of indirect taxes what they are at present collecting dýirectly, could net the same
condemnation apply te the Dominion Government, which derives its revenues largely
from indirect taxation? The principle of a
single tax has been enunciated, proclaimed and
advanced by men versed in economics, yet
we have so far found no other means of levying
taxation on the people than the direct and the
indirect methods.
I desire now te stress one point. The provinces are in dire straits. Net only have they
been obliged in recent years to raise large
amounts of money for the maintenance of the
unemployed, but in the days of prosperity
they were constantly urged by the people te
extend their activities in the field of social
legislation. They have had to provide and
care for the widow and the orphan, and te pay
their share towards old age pensions. They
have spent large sums of money in the promotion of hygiene and for educational purposes. In view of the gradual growth of their
expenditures year by year since 1867, it must
be realized that they have been pressed by
their people te enter upon fields of activity
unheard of, and unthought of, in the days of
Confederation. What is their situation now?
Their budgets are unbalanced; in certain parts
of the Dominion their credit is exhausted.
The conference held here in December, January and February came te the conclusion that
we should recognize and sanction what the
provinces have been doing in the field of the
retail sales tax, and that the provinces on their
part should give te the Dominion Government
a certain control over their expenditures if
and when they came te the Dominion for
help. These two features stand together. The
Minister of Finance believes that if greater
freedom is granted te the provinces in the
field of taxation they may be able te balance
their budgets, and that if they are able te
balance their budgets their credit will be enhanced and the demands on the Dominion for
the endorsation of provincial obligations will
be reduced.
I have deemed the amendment of my
honourablie friend (Hon. Mr. Hardy) sufficient
to appease the alarm of the right honourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and
other members of the Senate who feel as Le
does with regard te indirect taxation. If it
should appear that this amendment does net
completely cover and safeguard the point the
right honourable gentleman had in mind,

463

which he explained fully when answering my
motion for the adoption of the Address, I
shall be absolutely at the disposal of himself
and his colleagues in the matter of considering any modification they may propose.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I desire te address myself
immediately and briefly to the amendment
moved by the honourable senator from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Have you a
copy of it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, but I
know the effect of it.
It is truc that in the first opposition I
offered to the motion that the Senate unite
with the Commons in this Address I particularly emphasized the very feature which it
is now sought to remedy by this amendment,
namely, that each of the provinces, under
the British North America Act, if modified
in pursuance of the proposed Address, would
have an opportunity to discriminate in favour
of its own citizens and its own productions
as against those of the other provinces of
Canada. Frankly, I emphasized this feature
for two reasons: first, because I thought it
was the principal objection which could be
raised-the most fatal of all; and, secondly,
because in some way it had escaped the
review of the measure in the other House.
As a result of my observations and those of
a similar character, the Address was referred
to the Banking and Commerce Committee,
and there, as is usually donc, the Senate gave
to the people generally an opportunity to
make their representations.
Those who had the privilege of being on
the committee, or who were in attendance at
its meetings, will remember that the representations, though brief, were comprehensive
and covered a very wide field. They were
presented chiefly by Mr. Morgan, who spoke
for the Canadian Chambers of Commerce.
One of the factors of their opposition to the
Address was the feature I had emphasized
in this House. They took the ground that
the proposal was objectionable in that respect,
and seriously se; and they presented other
arguments against it, including one that had
net occurred te me at all, and those which
had been pressed in the other House.
I shall speak first of the amendment, the
purpose of which is to meet the situation in
a most important regard. Afterwards I shall
say just a few words on the general issue,
for I am thoroughly persuaded that in dealing
with it we are at the root of the gravest
problem Canada has ever faced, and that
instead of standing right up te it and meeting

it with a a iew to saving this nation. we are
ex ading it, fleeing froro it, seeking in some
way to circunx'cnt it. trying to posîpone the
exil day insîead of taking steps to prevent its

As to the amiendment of the honourable
senator froin Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), xvhich
1 knoiv is offered in good faith, I want to
say that it does flot wholly meet the objection. The amiendment states that a province,
in execî-ng power to impose a tax on retail
sales~, shial flot (Io it mn sucbi a way as to
discrinîîniate between goods which are the
production of 0ne province and those whieh
are the production of anothier province or
country. That would prevent discrimination
on the basis of the place of production. If
the ground or principle of discrimination were
mnly' the localitv of production the amendmciint
xvouid ho sufficient; but 1 call attention again
to the enactmnenl already passed bv the province of New Brunswick. wbere the discriminnatien i, flot b,îsed on tuat ground at ail. It

gooîl, or Qtiechcc gonds, they shial ho taxed

is the principle of discrimination adoptcd in

Brunswick and disecriminate against goods
produced in Quebec or Nova Scotia. The
principle of the discrimination. the rock upon
which ut rcoîs, is nlot the locus of the production, but the ownership of the company.
1 think I need not express an apprchcension,
cert.ainly not to the honourable senator froma
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). that in this Doinnion ive are goiog to permit, if ave can avoid
it, discrimination by any province against

Discrimination of that character coulsi go on

by the honourable senator from Leeds. Discrimination of that very character is n0w in
effeet. if legal. in the province of New Brunswick. 1 know, as I have already said, thait

This proposed change avould multiply duiplication of taxation in the samne fields ýon the
part of the Dominion and the provinces.
Duplication does not bring in a avhit more

and aiso the cost. of doing busines;s. Already
thle existing nacasure of duplication is so
burdensome
and annoying that business
Ca erywhuere is discouraged and is labouring
under an unnecessary and extravagant handiclap xvhich is to almost ail of it a subject
of despair. Whole sections of business are
taken up avith answering demands of various
governinents avit.hi a viewx to taxation. Tlîe
remedy is a division of the sphmeres of taxaîtion, not an increase in the duplication.
I
do not avant, to dwell too long upon ainy
single phase.
Here is something else. brought, ont before
the commnitlee bv Mr. Morgan, the representative of the Canadian Chamber of Coinmerce. He said it ivas important that with
respect to any method of taxation the public
should know xvhat it is paying. The hionourable senator xxho leads the Government
remarked, "If it is w'rong to tax in such a

JUNE 10, 1936
way that the public does not know specifically
what it is paying in respect of each assessment, we are doing wrong all the time, for
that is the kind of taxation the Dominion
Government imposes." That is true. The
federal sales tax is of that character. It is
levied at the source and is passed on to the
people, who for the most part do not know
in a specific way that they are paying it.
It would be far better to levy our sales tax
so as to make the taxpayer tax-conscious. I
wish that were done, though I do not know
how it could be done. In the present instance
we are invited to extend the principle of concealing taxes. Why should we do so? Mr.
Morgan pointed out that retail stores in
Montreal had been subjected to a provincial
sales tax, which was paid by the consumers.
Under our present Constitution that is the
only method by which the province can tax
these particular consumers. Mr. Morgan's
firm, like every other retail establishment in
Quebec. has to show the specific tax on the
customer's bill. The customer is told, "You
are paying so much to the province of
Quebec."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Or to the city
of Montreal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. As a
consequence the consumer becomes, as Mr.
Morgan put it, tax-conscious, and he realizes
the value of economical administration in
government. If there is anything that we
really need in Canada it is a tax-conscious
electorate.
The trouble in this Dominion is that our
treasuries are under control of the tax receiver -rather than of the taxpayer. We have
a vast army of tax receivers, in every field,
wherever the eye turns-all voters, all militant
-and they are virtually in control. It is
really because of the control they are exercising that we have this Address.
The Minister of Finance is driven to his
wits' end. I know he is acting in absolutely
good faith. He has the problem of dealing
with provinces who are defaulting or threatening to default, and who, when he invites them
into a Loan Council, say they will not come
in unless they are given the right to impose
taxes which the public will pay without knowing it is paying them. What is the Min,
ister of Finance to do? He takes hold of the
first plan that promises a means of postponing
the evil day. But if we adopt the plan proposed here we shall in a very short time be
in a worse position than ever.
We must bring about in this country a
condition wherein business, especially the
great construction enterprises, will have free
play to operate. By doing so we shall make

465

it possible to employ many men who are now
unemployed. In every one of our provinces
social services are taking care of idle people
and looking after a great variety of what are
called needs, to such a degree that the old
element of self-reliance, which is the basis
of civilization, is almost extinct. Provincial
representatives come to the Minister of
Finance and say: "We cannot carry on these
social services unless we get this means of
taxation. If we do not carry them on, we
shall be beaten by the electors." They are
probably telling the truth. But must we not
face the fact that they and their successors
in time will be rejected by the electors?
What we should really be concerned with is
giving the nation a chance to survive and to
maintain its integrity. We must take a grip
on the existing situation. We ought to have
social services which we can honestly afford,
and no more. The provinces have to be told
that. The adoption of any amendment such
as is proposed here would only mean postponing the day when they must be told.
I know that to defeat this resolution will
be -an unpopular move. The provinces will
be opposed to such a step. But would it
not be a service to the Government? It
could then say to the provinces: "This thing
cannot go through. The public is against
it. Taxpayers are opposed to it. And, after
all, Canada is dependent upon taxpayers
rather than tax receivers." Surely it would
be an assistance to the Minister of Finance
to arm him with a straight negative, by means
of which he could tell the truth to the
provinces.
The hour has come when we must look
facts in the face, when we must realize that
if we continue to go on in the direction of
increased taxation we shall have more and
more unemployment, with greater power in
the hands of the unemployed. The situation
is such to-day that in many lines of activity
people cannot be obtained to do necessary
work. There is a dearth of real service and
workers where service and workers are needed.
Not only are great masses being rendered
incapable of employment, but they are determined they shall not be employed. Ask some
people who advertise in vain for help when
lists of persons unemployed and on relief
contain narnes of thousands of the very type
of workers desired.
For these reasons, which I think are more
powerful than any others that could be
advanced in the premises, I am opposed to the
amendment and to the Address.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Needless to say, I am
much impressed by what the right honourable
leader on the other side has said as to the

probability of taxes being imposed by any
province upon persons or companies domiciled
in another province. To the amendment that
I have already moved I would suggest an
addition, worded somewhat like this:
or in favour of or against any person,
partnership or coipany domiciiled in another
province or eountry.

I would move that addition te my amendment,
unless something better can be suggested.
If notwithHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
standing the proposed amendment which is
now before this Chamber my right honourable
friend opposite speaks to-day for those who
voted in favour of the adoption of the committee's report, it is useless to prolong the
debate.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For my right
bonourable friend says he is opposed net only
te the original Address, but also to the Address
at it would be changed by the amendment of
the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy). Under these circumstances, in order
that the country may be apprised of the
position the Senate takes, I ask for a division.
Hon. L. COTE: May I ask the honourable
leader of the Government whether the consent of the provinces to these various amendments has been obtained anew?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I expected some
honourable member would put the question.
I was informed by the honourable Minister
of Finance, and I agreed with him, that there
was no necessity to consult the provinces on
an amendment which simply carried out the
understanding between them and the Dominion
Government.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Of course, the honourable leader will realize that my question was
based on complete ignorance of the exact
terms of the understanding with the provinces. We have never seen it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The understanding is embodied in the Address itself.
Hon. Mr. COTE: We have never seen the
understanding.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend lias the Address before him.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I understood the honourable leader to say the other day that a draft
of the resolution as a whole had been submitted to the provinces, and that they had

(Hon. Mr. Hardy) or other amendments.

without in any wise touching the underlying
principle. We are dealing with the first part

has been alleged that if the provinces knew
of the possibility of interprovincial tariff walls
being raised they probably would not insist
upon their decision to join with the Dominion
in suggesting that the British North America
Act be changed. The amendment now before
us would have the effect of protecting each
province against the others without preventing them from entering the field of indirect
taxation.
Hon. JAMES A. CALDER: Honourable
senators, during the course of the next few
years we are likely to have before us for
decision a question somewhat similar to this
-the question of amendments to the British
North America Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: More especially
if the Supreme Court decides certain Acts
to be unconstitutional.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think it is very
important that on such an occasion as this we
should have very clear evidence of the assent
of the provinces. Personally I look upon
Confederation as a pact or agreement. The
opinion is held almost universally that Parliament should not undertake to change the
Constitution without the consent of the provinces. We have no clear, definite evidence of
the assent of any province to this Address.
True, we have the word of the honourable
leader that the premiers of the provinces, in
a conference with the Dominion Government,
did reach an agreement. For whom did they
agree? Where is the agreement? I have net
scen it, and no other member of this Chamber
lias een it. I say Parliament is on very
dangerous ground when it undertakes to amend
the British North America Act without having
clear, specific, definite evidence of the consent
of the provinces. I would suggest that when
wve come again to deal with any question of
this kind the Government should sec to it that
thit evidence is placed before both Houses of
Parliament.
I understand the honourable leader of the
House has clearly and definitely disclosed, and
we ail admit. that a dangerous situation has
arisen. Ail the provinces, without exception,
are in difficul'ties. The honourable Minister of
Finance is grcatly perplexed as to how the

JUNE 10, 1936
situation shall be met. Hle has by every conceivable means endeavoured to meet it. This
condition is not new. It has existed during
the past three years, and probably all do not
agree with the manner in which the late
Administration dealt with it.
I think the proposed amendment to a large
extent meets the situation, but only in one
aspect. However, if this resolution does not
pass--make no mistake-the question will
arise again. It will probably come up in some
way that we do not like; nevertheless the
problem will have to be met. I have no doubt
that this House would be well advised not to
proceed with this Address, nor do I think it
would be wise for Parliament to proceed with
it, at the present time. Before next session
let the Dominion and the provincial governments have another conference, and let there
be a clear, distinct understanding with the
provinces as to what is required in regard to
changing the fields of taxation as between the
Dominion and the provinces.
At the present time we have a federal sales
tax and a provincial sales tax, and in the city
of Montreal, there is a municipal sales tax.
If we are to have a continuation of the sales
tax let there be but one collection, so that
every business establishment will have to keep

but one set of tax accounts instead of two or
three. Business men tell me that the keeping
of multiple sales tax accounts is very burdensome, especially in Montreal, where the merchants have to maintain separate accounts for
municipal and federal purposes, and probably
for the province. Merchants say it is a
terrible handicap on business. Let us have
one sales tax and distribute it, if necessary,
among the municipalities, the provinces, and
the Dominion. Let it be levied by one
authority, as is done now in Ontario with
respect to provincial and federal income taxes.
I repeat, the Government itself and Parliament would be well advised to let this matter
rest for one year in order to give the provinces
and the Dominion an opportunity of getting
together and coming to a definite, clear-cut
agreement, so that we may know exactly what
the provinces desire.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I should like to add
to my amendment the following words:
or in favour of or against any person,
partnership or company domiciled in another
province or country.

Honourable senators, I am here as one of the representatives

and I do not want to vote until I know the
views of my province. If the Legislature of
Manitoba desired this proposed legislation,
that fact would be known to the members
of this Chamber, particularly to members who
represent the province of Manitoba. Without
knowing the views of the Provincial Legislature, I cannot take the responsibility of
voting for this motion.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, may I answer my honourable friend,?
The Dominion Government in presenting this
Address to Parliament has declared that it
is the result of a conference in which Manitoba and the other provinces participated.
The Address has been passed by the House
of Commons, in which Chamber Manitoba
has representatives, as have the other provinces, and at this date, two or three months
after its introduction in the other House, not
one province has, through its government,
suggested, directly or indirectly, that the

Address is not the embodiment of the will
of all the provinces. Surely at this stage
we cannot question the authority of the
honourable Minister of Finance to speak for
that conference. I admit there is some force
in the statement of my honourable friend from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) that at future
conferences a statement should be issued
under the signatures of all the provincial
representatives: but I suggest that at this late
stage we cannot doubt the assertion that this

Address is the child of the Dominion-Provincial Conference.
Surely there is sufficient
security in the loyalty of the public men of
this country to justify us in accepting the
statement of the Government that in this
instance it speaks for all the provinces.
Honourable senHon. C. E. TANNER:
ators, notwithstanding what my honourable
friend the leader of the House bas said, I
am not at all convinced that the Government
of Nova Scotia would take the responsibility
of asking for this legislation. If there is
anything printed or written indicating that
that government has so committed itself, I
should like to see it; indeed, I think we have
a right to demand its production. If there
is nothing written or printed showing that
the provinces are asking for this legislation,
then I feel myself just as free to believe that
they will repudiate it as my honourable friend
is at liberty to believe they will not.
I am bound to say that. speaking for Nova
Scotia, I am still against this Address. I was
against it as originally presented to this House,
and I am against it now in its amended form;
lock. stock and barrel.
If the Government of Nova Scotia wants
to impose more taxes, it has all the power

468

SENATE

it needs. It can impose direct taxes. Then
the taxpay'ers will know they are being taxed.
Under this system tc Provincial Government
can impose taxes and the people will only
know that they are paying indirectly. The
Government now in office in Nova Scotia
distinctly assured the people of the province
in 1933 that their taxes would be reduced.
I cannot believe that a Government witt
such pledges hanging over its head would
ask my honourable friend opposite to give it
power to impose additional burdens in the
form of indirect taxes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: lias the Nova
Scotia Government balanced its budget?
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: It promised to do so.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It bas not done so
yet. There are two ways of balancing a
budget: one is by imposing more taxes, the
other by reducing expenditures. The Government of Nova Scotia bas net given the
slightest indication that it intends to reduce
expenditures. Never for one moment, apparently, lias it considered the question.
My honourable friend opposite, with a
smiling countenance, asks us to give the provincial governments power to impose more
taxes on an already over-taxed people. Today cities and towns in Nova Scotia report
appalling arrears of taxes. I know little towns
in the province with an assessment of about
$40,000 a year which bave outstanding 810,000
or $12,000 of taxes. They simply cannot be
collected.
How in Heaven's name can the
taxpayers of the province be expected to
pay more taxes if the Provincial Government
is given power to impose further taxation?
Most assuredlv thev cannot pay additional
taxes. There is only one course open to our
provincial governments: they must eut down
expenditures and live within their means. It
is futile for them to ende-avour to wrest more
dollars out of the almost empty pockets of the
taxpayers.
Yesterday I neceixed anotier of the very
interesting paimphlets, issued every now and
fien, containing a series of Front Page
Editorials by Frank Carrel, editor of the
Chronicle-Telegraph, Quebec. Let me quote
one of these editorials under the title of,
"How It Works out":

oni. Mnr TANNER.

Scores of companies in Nova Scotia and
other provinces are paying in taxes as much
as 30 and 40 per cent of their income, and
their shareholders are net getting a five-cent
piece. If the provinces are invested with
power to levy indirect taxes, individuals and
companies will suffer. To-day they are regarded by all goveruments, provincial as well
as Dominion, as easy targets. The maxim
appears to be: tax the corporations, whether
the investor is getting a dividend or not.
I repeat, I am against this proposal. I
believe the people of Nova Sceotia are against
it, and, as I said on a previous occasion, I
am confident that, given an opportunity, they
would vote against my honourable friend's
motion as amended. Wly? Because they

remedy they are looking for is a reduction of
debts and a reduction of taxes. Therefore
I am not going to vote for this motion, no
matter how it is amended.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable members, so
that there may be no misunderstanding, I
wishs te add just a word which tas been suggested to nie by the question asked of the
honourabe leader of the Goverument a moment
ago. I acccpt his word, of course, that the
consent of the ministers of the provinces was
obtaintd by the Government before the resolution was introduced. Naturally my question
went only to the amendment. Personally I
feel that I should v-ote-and I will voteagainst the resolution as a whole. I will vote
against the first part of it for the reasons given
by the right honourable the leader of this side
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meiglhen), and
I will vote against the second part for reasons
that I gave the other day, whict I do not
need to repeat at this time.
There is one point, however, that I wish to
emphasize. It is my conviction that, unless
a resolution of the Legislatures is produced
before us, J as a mnember of this House should
not lend my support te any amendment to the
Constitution which would result in an imposition of taxes by a local legislature in
pursuance of a power wxhici it does net now
posess. I subit that the execuitive in any
province, the Cabinet, has no authority to rewrit.e the constitution of a legislature in such
a wa '- as to mîodify its power. I submit that
procedure similar to that adopted by this
Government in presenting this very resolutien to both Houses of Parliament-in otter
words, coming to the legislature of the
Domieion--with a petition to the Mother
Ceunti-y for power to amiend the Constitution,
should in all propriety have been followed by
the provinces in order to safegucard their

JUNE 10, 1936
rights and give a sense of security as Vo the
future.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTAUTHORITY TO AMEND
DISCUSSION CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from June 3 the
adjourned debate on the question, proposed
by Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunt on:
That hie will draw the attention of the
Senate to, and inquire of the Government,
whether it is the intention of the Government
to take stepa to have legislation passed by
the Imperial Parliament to the end that the
Parliament of Canada shahl have the authority
to from time to time amend the British North
America Act as it may deem proper.
Hon. ONESIPHORE TURGEON: Honourable senators, in rising to speak on this
question I can only repeat what I said on many
previous occasions, more particularly in 1925.

SENATE
that a change in our Constitution can be
effected only by the unanimous consent of the
provinces, as expressed by their respective
legislatures. The motion to that effect which
I moved in this Chamber in 1925 was approved
by every honourable member present at the
time. The generous appreciation then expressed for that motion still finds a response
in my ieart. On that occasion I disclosed my
correspondence and understanding with Sir
Wilfrid Laurier in 1906, and in conclusion I
urged that no change be made in our Constitution without the unanimous consent of
the provinces, as in the case of the British
North America Act of 1907.
Whcn the Confederation of Canada was first
propoSed two types of union were considered:
a legislative union vested with supreme power
over all niatters of government through a
central legislature; and a federal union. Sir
John A. Macdonald at first favoured a legislative union. But lie soon changed his mind,
and lie devoted lis activity towards the
achievement of a federal union, plans for
which were carried unanimotisly at the Quebec
Conference and later adopted in the form in
which they appear in the London resolutions.
Our Constitution is a sacred contract between
the provinces. This contract was to be pliaced
in the custody of an authority that at all times
would be invulnerable, and in this respect the
Imperial Parliament was considered to provide
the mnost reliable security.
In 1869, dealing with the question of better
terms for Nova Sceotia, Sir Albert Smith, of
New Brunswick. said:
No change of the Constitution ean be
effected except by the Imperial Parliamnent on
an Address from the local legislatures of all
the provinces.
Speaking in 1872 on the school question of
New Brunswick, with respect to whicl I was
taking an active part, the Hon. Edward Blake,
of Ontario, said:
The lImîperial Parliaient will never amend
the British North America Act in the
particular

in whi'ch the miotion asks, without

the assent of the prouincc affected.

Hon. Mr. HARMER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I now wish to quote
statements made by some of the most respected authorities of the day in this country.
The Dominion-Provincial conference announced
in the Speech froin the Throne of 1925 was
postponed until November 27, 1927. As soon
as the date was made public the premiers of
the four eastern provinces made a solemn
declaration that "no change in the Constitution shall be made without the unanimous
consent of the provinces." They were Hon.
Edgar N. Rhodes, then Premier of Nova

authority; and Hon. G. Howard Ferguson,
then Premier of Ontario and afterwards, until
lately, Canadian High Commissioner in Great
Britain. The opinion of such legal authorities

This is quite opposite to the views of authorities I have quoted. I am opposed to this
proposition, for if a suggested change is not
important all provinces will readily consent.
If they do not consent it means that the
requmested change is against their interests.
Now, the main suggestion elaborated in the
of representatives of
conference coimmittec
provinces was the transfer of the safeall the
gutard of our Constitution from the Imperial
Parliament to the Parliament of Canada, whicli
would be given full power to make amendments. This will net, according to my mnformation, receive the unanimous consent of
the provinces. My belief is that it will not
bc concurred in by the Legislature of the
province of New Brunswick, and most likely
not by the province of Nova Scotia either.
And without these two provinces there w ould
have been no Confederation. Prince Edward
Island will probably take the same stand that
they do. They have suffered incessantly by
reason of the attitude of large interests in the
Western Provinces. Our eastern ports and
harbours have been neglected, and products
of the West have been shipped abroad througlh
American ports on the Atlantic coast. The
Maritimes are now under the unshakable impression that their position would become
still worse if they were left under the exclusive control of the Parliament of Canada.
My chief purpose in desiring that our Constitution be kept under the guardianship of the
Imperial Parliament is to see it preserved
from the multiple jealousies of various political
parties seeking to bring about a variety of
reforms. I am afraid that in some circumstances they would show very little consider-

JUNE 10, 1936
ation for the terms of the contract. We have
heard men asking that the House of Commons should be authorized to make changes
in the Constitution without consulting the
provinces! Others say that the Canadian Constitution has never had any merit, that it
was net framed in the interests of the country,
that it is old and useless, and that therefore
we should have another one. Some of these
people have very little respect for the
Fathers of Confederation. If their proposals
were adopted we should hear talk of "secession"
at every corner, just as we already hear and
read of appeals for provincial autonomy, and
in place of our Dominion we should perhaps
have a union with the American States.
I am heartily in favour of the independence
that has been extended, to Canada by the
Government of Great Britain with respect to
all commercial relations with other countries.
We can make treaties without receiving
approval by the Government of Great Britain.
I admire the noble and patriotic accomplishments of our Canadian Ministers who have
pleaded for such a state of independence, as
well as the Government of Great Britain which
has conceded it. We have every reason to
feel proud of the Statute of Westminster.
The Parliament of Great Britain does not
on its own initiative make any change in our
Constitution. It grants changes only as requested unanimously by the provinces; never
otherwise. I consider that if we leave our
Constitution in the custody of Great Britain,
but only on that condition, our provinces will
be protected for many years to come. The
larger our population becomes, the more necessary will it be to maintain the separate identity
of each province. Otherwise 'difficulties will
arise. The Dominion is net placed in a position of subserviency or subordination because
it is not the guardian of our Constitution and
is unable to amend it at will.
The stand taken by the New Brunswick
representatives at the last conference has often
been misrepresented in the press. I wish to
declare that that province will accept no
changes which are not agreed to by all the
provinces. The Attorney-General of New
Brunswick, Hon. J. B. MeNair, se declared
at the conference, acoording to his published
statement. I will take the liberty of reading
part of what he said, as reported in the press
at that time.
In 1867 New Brunswick, then a self-governing province of Great Britain, agreed to unite
with Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada
(Ontario and Quebec) in a confederation with
a central government and parliament entrusted
by those provinces with certain powers in order
to carry out certain purposes and achieve
certain
objects.
While
New
Brunswick
surrendered some of her governmental fune-

471

tions and powers, she retained her full independence and autonomy in respect of all
those other functions and powers which go
with and are the indicia of self-government.
She remained as before, a province of Great
Britain, sovereign within her own sphere.
This agreement was sanctioned and ratified
by the British Parliament and incorporated
in the British North America Act of 1867.
It is to be noted that because of conditions
peculiar to themselves the provinces left the

power to change the Confederation agreement

in the custody and control of Westminster.
The real purpose of the new movement is
to set up a new constitution in the form of
a statute of the Canadian Parliament, which
would entail very serious and far-reaching consequences. Under the new scheme New Brunswick would lose her status, enjoyed since her
foundation in 1784, as a province of Great
Britain and would become sinply a territorial
division of Canada.
Her sovereignty would
disappear. The intention to give to the Parliament of the Dominion power to invade the
legislative field of the provincial legislature
provided two-thirds of the provinces agree,
can mean nothing less. By no stretch of the
imagination could the Legislature of New
Brunswick be held to enjoy sovereign rights
when it might be shorn of its power without
its consent. The Confederation established by
the provinces in 1867 would cease to exist.
The Prime Minister of New Brunswick
made a similar statement before prorogation
of the Legislature, and no one attempted to
contradiet him.
It is thought in some quarters that all the
provinces agreed at one stage to the present

proposals. This is not correct, I am informed
on reliable authority.

It

was clearly under-

stood at the time of the Dominion-Provincial
Conference last December that any participation in the consideration of such problems
was not binding, and no conclusions would
be considered binding until Parliament and

the various legislatures had passed upon them.
It would be the view of the present Government of New Brunswick that no amendments to the British North America Act
should be made until the legislatures of alI
the provinces had considered them.
In conclusion I take the liberty of suggest-

ing that the present generation should make
all possible effort to safeguard the destiny of
Canada for future generations. In addition to
those wrong aspirations which I have mentioned
as existing in some corners of Canada, there
are aspirations on the part of some Americans

for a union with Canada. There is a growing
sentiment in the United States towards bringing Canada within the Republic, in the belief
that the union would promote the safety and
happiness of all North America and of other
nations. To people who hold such a view
I make this reply. Two strong neighbourly
nations covering the one continent, united
in sentiment, are more powerful than only

one, with the same total population, would

SENATE

472

be. And the two are of more beneficial
assistance to Great Britain, whose Government
is now seeking more intimate relations with
France as well as with the United States.
Canada, with her dual races, French and
English, could be a strong instrument in
making possible the establishment of such
intimate relations on a permanent basis. I
therefore submit, honourable senators, that
we should preserve our existing associations
with Great Britain as well as with the United
States.
I hope my remarks may meet with the
approval of many honourable members. And
in closing I desire to thank the House for
the courteous manner in which it has listened
to me.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Marcotte, the
debate was adjourned.

adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Casgrain:
That in the opinion of the Senate, a judgnient of the Supreme Court of the Dominion
of Canada, when nnanimîous, should he final

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: This letter was

Mr. Beaubien) knew him very well. Mr.

dowed Montreal with playgrounds for the

doubtful legality they hesitate to put them into
language w hich may be attacked by other members of the court.
As the appeal to the Judicial Committee
exists by the decision of the committee, so I
have alvays thought that it would ultimately
disappear not by legislation, but by the decision of another court, i.e., the Supreme Court.
I ask honourable senators to pay particular
attention to the next paragraph:
Suppose for instance that an appeal is instituted from a decision of the Supreme Court
dismissing a claim for the payment of a sum
of money and that the Judicial Committee
reverses the Supreme Court and condemns the
defendant to pay the sum of money and that
the defendant makes opposition to the execution of the judgment on the grounds that no
such appeal ever existed. and that this opposition is carried through the courts until it
reaches the Supreme Court and that th.e
Supreme Court decides that it never did exist,
-what then?
I am quite willing to refer that to the honourable senator from Montarville to decide:
what then?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend allow me? Any objection to the
jurisdiction of the Privy Council would be
raised before the Privy Council, and the
decision would be final.
of

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The decision
the Privy Council would be final?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

and the case goes back to the Supreme Court.

that he might not be taken unawares. It

from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council
as of right; it is an appeal of grace.

That is a

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The wife may be
the proprietor and may win her case. If the
amount is sufficient, there is no reason why
the judgment should not be appealed to the
last tribunal. The case is just as important
as the first case, which gave birth to the
judgment upon which the opposition is based.
Apart from the specific reasons for which a
judgment can be opposed there can be no
opposition at all: the judgment must be
executed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I hope all honourable members are satisfied with the answer.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
all yu paid for it.

It

is worth

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The letter continues:
Except for the fact that, after the Supreme
Court was instituted, warring politicians rather
revelled in the superfluity of appeals, the appeal
to the Judicial Committee might never have
existed. So far from there being any appeal
to the foot of the Throne as represented by
the Judicial Committee, the British North
America Act contains nothing that gives colour
to such a theory and a great deal that does
not. For instance by section 9 the Executive
Government of Canada is declared to be in the
Queen; not at all in the Queen and the British
Privy Council. By section Il there is to be a
Canadian Privy Couneil. By section 17 again
a Parliament for Canada consists of the Queen
and two Houses. As far as the use of statutory
language is concerned, that is just as broad a
statement as it would be to say that the Parliament of Great Britain consists of the Queen
and two Houses. You will note also certain
reservations and incidental matters that tend
the same way. For instance by section 55 the
Queen's pleasure need not be exercised by the
Governor General. He might reserve the Bill
for the signification of her actual pleasure,
thus showing that she was an integral part of
the Government of Canada.
Again, under
section 9, supposing that the King was actually
in Canada, would not the functions be exercised by himself and not by any Governor
General? Under 56 the old colonial status was
broken up and instead of providing that correspondence is to be with the Colonial Secretary
it is provided that it is to be with one of Her
Majesty's principal secretaries of state. In other
words. Canada could correspond with the Foreign
Secretary or the Secretary of State if it were
convenient to her to do su. There is also in
section 132 a provision giving the Parliament
of Canada the power to perform obligations
of Canada, as a part of the British Empire,
towards~foreign countries arising under treaties
between the Empire and such foreign countries.
This evidently contemplated treaties of an
entirely different nature from treaties between
foreign countries and the United Kingdom.
The use of the words "Empire" and "British
Empire" instead of the "United Kingdom" is
very suggestive.
Whilst writing in this connection, you may
notice that in section 1025 of the Criminal
Code the Parliament of Canada assumes, and
I think rightly, that. if it be necessary tu deal
with the Royal prerogative, it is the Parliament of Canada that can do it. and it does by
this section do it in the sense of removing any

doubts as to whether criminal appeals can be
made tu the Judicial Committee, a view that
is quite inconsistent with the view of the
Judicial Committee that its board is the foot
of the Throne for Canadian purposes. If, in
view of the British North America Act and
of the statement that there may be a general
court of Appeal for Canada there could be
any argument that an appeal still lay tu the
foot of the Throne, it would seem to me to be
a consequence that such appeal would lie tu
the King, tu be referred by him not to the
Judicial Committee, but to His Privy Council
for Canada.

However. su far as I could ever see, the
words in the British North America Act "a
general Court of Appeal for Canada" really
mean what they say. It would not be a Court
of Appeal strictly speaking if it is only an
intermediate Court. You will notice that it is
never siggested in England that there is an
appeal to the foot of the Throne from the
decisions of the House of Lords, although if
the reasoning of the Judicial Committee about
the prerogative and the "foot of the Throne"
be correct it would apply just as well and just
as much to the House of Lords as to our
Supreme Court.
Excuse my troubling you with this long
screed. When I began it I did nut think tu
get su far as I have.
Yours sincerely,
C. S. Campbell.
Mr. Campbell is in favour of a unanimous
judgment rendered by the courts here, claiming that it would carry greater weight and be
better accepted than a judgment given by a
majority of the appeal judges. That is why
I use the word "unanimous" in my motion.
I have put before this House letters from
three outstanding legal gentlemen of the city
of Montreal. Can anyone suggest a stronger
trinity of lawyers than Eugène Lafleur-since
deceased-Aimé Geoffrion and C. S. Campbell? I leave that question with the lawyermembers of this House from Montreal. I
do not think any lawyers stand higher in our
province than those three, and they are
unanimous that appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should be
restricted.
In this connection I may as well put on
Hansard this letter from Mr. Aimé Geoffrion:
My Dear Senator,-I have read with much
interest what you said in the Senate on the
advisability of restricting the appeals tu the
Privy Council.
Of course, you could deal only with the
appeals from the Supreme Court, as the question of the appeals from the provincial courts
is a provincial matter.Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I am afraid the
honourable gentleman is mistaken. I speak
subject to correction, but I think it is a
question of leave to appeal from a provincial
court direct to the Privy Council. It is not
a provincial. matter at all.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg is perfectly right:

SENATE

In this connection, I would draw the special
attention of the honourable gentleman from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) to
the statement of Lord Brougham, who died
in 1868, when eighty years of age. He was
famous when he was only twenty. For sixty
years he was one of the most important and
great lawyers of England. He was also a
most distinguished member of Parliament.
Speaking of the judges of the Privy Council,
he said that he knew of no more inadequate
court te decide any case.
Those are the
words of Lord Brougham. He must have
been a very popular man, and a man of
fashion, for we all know that he was the first
to use a certain kind of carriage, which is
now called a brougham, and everybody
wanted to have one of these most convenient
and stately carriages.
What does Lord
Brougham say? He says:
You cannot find two colonies that have the
sanie laws. the same customs and the same
habits, and these judges sitting in the Privy
Council know only what the lawyers before
then tell themn about those things.
Custom often supersedes the actual law.
How can these judges decide as te custom?
I admit that they are very clever mon: they
can deliver a judgment upholding one side
of a question and give reasons in support of
it; then they can reverse that judgment and
give just as good reasons for their judgment
the other way.
They did that in the
Labrador case.

the Supreme Court of Canada has been unanimously in favour of protecting such rights.
For instance, on the Manitoba School Question
the Privy Council reversed the Supreme Court
and gave a judgment that was absolutely useless to the minority in Manitoba. Mr.
Justice Mignault does not believe that more
protection will be granted te the minority
in future than has been granted in the past.
In fact he is inclined te the opinion that the
Privy Council will more and more tend te side
with the majority.
As I have already pointed out, the costs of
an appeal te the Privy Council are very heavy.
Twenty years ago Mr. Eugène Lafleur told me
that a litigant te whom our Court grants
leave te appeal must send a lawyer across the
ocean to see whether the Judicial Committee
will decide to hear the appeal. A lawyer's
foc for such a mission in those days was estimated to be about $2,500 or $3,000. If the
Judicial Committee decides te hear the case,
then a year or se later the appeal comes on
and the litigant must again send his lawyer
across the ocean. The legail fees in connection
with the actual appeal were estimated by Mr.
Lafleur at from $4,000 te $5,000. But undoubtedly they have risen considerably in
twenty years. It is said to be possible for a
litigant to appear before the Judicial Committee in forma paperis, but I do not know
of any appeal that bas been made on this
basis.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: All right. I am

A few moments ago I was referring te the
Hon. Edward Blake.
He was not very
popular in the House of Commons, because
he made suclh thoroughs explanations. Justin
MeCartlhy, whlo wrote "A History of Our Own
Times," said that on one occasion he walked
out of the House of Commons te have a
smoke while Mr. BlIke was uttering a phrase,
and after having finished his smoke he
returned te find Mr. Blake still on the same
phrase.
Here is a very important point. If Parliament or the legislatures can abolish appeals in
criminal cases-and such appeals have been
abolished, for in the past year the Privy
Council refused on that ground te hear a caseit follows that they can abolish appeals in
civil cases. I do not think there is any doubt
about that.
In many cases the Privy Council has not protected the rights of minorities in respect te
matters of language or religion, even when
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

conceive of a lawyer going from Canada te
England without charging something for his

Mr. Justice Mignault says that the Privy
Council perforns a very good service for the
rich. Threat of appeal can be held up as a
kind of blackmail over the head of a litigant
who has been successful before our Supreme
Court.

the Governor in Council organizes and classifies ai] the services in the dcpartment. That
function itself is of the very essence of the
Civil Service Commissioners' work. Theirs
is the duty of classification and organization.
They classify the various posts, and when the
Governor in Council takes it upon himself to
do so he is just taking away that function.
Next he makes appointmcnts to posts under
the directors, and fixes the salaries. What is
left for the Civil Service Commission?
One would think from reading another section the Civil Service Commissioners really
had somctbing to do, but this work is so
ingeniously taken from them under section
7 that in respect of this new department
they will not have much to do but draw their
salaries.
It is said that the appointments
will be made from employees now in the

in the creation of new bodies it was allowed
to exercise its full functions; for example, in

479

the Unemploymcnt Commission Bill. But
here, in respect of departments that have
been under tbe Civil Service Commission for
ycars, it is told, "Kindly stcp aside until we
get ail the reorganization done."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would remind
my right honourable friend of the statement
we heard from the Chairman of the Civil
Service Commission as to the procedure
foiiowcd in the filling of vacancies or the
making of new appointments.
It wiil be
remembered that he said the relations between
the department and the Civil Service Commission were very close and the work was
generally donc in harmony.
The exception taken in this case to the
absence of jurisdiction on the part of the
commission bears mainly on the question of
reorganization.
My rigbt honourable friend
says, and truly, that reorganization is one of
the functions of the commission. Here are
four departments which, are, and will be,
under the direction of one Minister. I have
given the number of empioyees in each.
The Minister who will have to consolidate
these departments, choose a Deputy Minister
and select the directors or cbiefs of branches
bas declarcd-and I echo bis statement, wbich
was acceptcd by everyonc in the other
Chamnber-that
in the consolidation
and
reorganization of these departmcnts he will
take only men who are now in the Service.
These men are already under the Civil
Service Commission.
I ask honourabie members to try to visualize
wbat wiil be the obligation and function of
the Minister, witb ail the materiai available
from four fully manned staffs, when it cornes
to placing the men who are to form thc ncw
Department of Mines and Resources. His
situation wiil not be an enviable one. I can
sec him at the head of tbat large family,
saddlcd with the responsibility of deciding
wbo is to be prcferred, who is to be utilized
and who is to be superannuated. I arn sure
he will proceed slowiy.
One of the difficuities of classification and
reorganization is that it cannot be donc in a
moment. Thc Minister must proceed slowiy
in converting those four departrnents into
one functioning mechanism.
It is obvinus
that the Civil Service Commission is not in
a position to foliow up that graduai work of
clirnination and absorption, and that in
deviding as to the distribution of the material
at hand it would have to reiy largely, if not
entirely, upon the men surrounding the
Minister. I think that if there ever is a
time when an exception can be made, it is
now. As I bave indicated. the work to be

lion. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Paragraph 1 of section
7 says:
7. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the
Civil Service Act with respect to the organization of a departiment, the Governor in
Couneil may make snob orders and regulations
as he may consider necessary for the immediate organization of the department; and
notw-itistanding the provisions of subsection
three of section four of this Act the Governor
in Couneil may, in the first instance, fill the
positions in the department by the appointment thereto of any or all of the persons w-ho
immisnediately before the coming in force of this
Act were officers. clerks and employees of the
l)epantment of the Interior, the Department
of Immigration and Colonization, the Departnient of Mines and the Department of Indian
Affairs and sucih persons so appointed shall
iold office during pleasure.
Does that mean that these men or women
are for ever out from under the Civil Service
Commission and can be discharged at will?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They can be
now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They can be suspended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I think this is

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I must say frankly that I do not like
the provisions of this Bill. I can appreciate
the situation that exists. We have had a
gond many reorganizations in the public
service during the last ten years, but, if I
am not mistaken, this is the first time such
a proposal as this has been made.
The proposition, as I see it, is not nearly
as formidable as the honourable gentleman
who leads the House intimates. The Minister will have something to do with this,
but very little. When one thinks of all the
other work that is throwan upon his shoulders
by tiis Bill, one wonders whetiher he will
have time for anything else at all. He bas a
tremendous job, and if it does net kill him
before he is through with it, I shall e very
much .surprised. We have bad departments
under the Minister of Mines, the Minister of
the Interior, the Superintendent of Indian
Affairs, and the Minister of Colonization, and
a certain amount of slackness in these departments may have been the reason for the
suggested consolidation. As I say, it is my
opinion that the Minister personally will not
be closely concerned with the actual reorganHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

ization and the selection of employees. He
could not be, for the task would be too big
for one man. He will be in charge of a personnel running into the thousands. The reorganization and the selection of employees
will be done by his chief officials. If it were
done by the Civil Service Commission it
would be dono in exactly the same way, but
the commission, being here
all the time,
would assist these chief officials to perform the
task in the best interests of the department.
Let me make this quite clear. The Minister
will personally never get near this job.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend will allow me, may I say I have
seen a statement by the Minister to the
effect that the Civil Service Commission would
have been required to do nothing more than
detail a member of its staff to work in the
department upon the matter of reorganization,
and it was his view that on his own staff he
had men far more familiar with departiental details, whom he could assign to
this work.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If the Minister bas
a certain object in viewihe should state what
it is.
The Parliament of Canada, in its
wisdom or lack of wisdom, bas adopted the
policy that employees should be selected on
the basis of merit. and that organization of
departments should be under the control and
supervision of the Civil Service Commission.
I say quite frankly there are instances when
it is necessary to take the selection of cmployees for certain positions out of the hands
of the commission. But bere are four departments to be reorganized. They will not be
scrapped. Take, for instance, the Department
of Immigration, with which I am familiar.
I know its organization. its offieers and the
work they do. No reorganization is necessary
there. Truc, certain men may be in line for
retirement, and if so they should be retired.
Then take the Mines Branch, under Dr.
Camsell. Will any honourable senator tell
me that the Mines Branch is not properly
organized, after having been in charge of an
experienced man all these years? Certainly
it is. Then take the Geodetic Survey. L it
organized? There is one departimpropeil
ment, the Department of the Interior. which
bas been deprived of many of its former
activities, and wxich probably has some
hundreds of employees who are not required
at the prescnt time. Sonme of thaem will be
retained. but who is te make the choice?
Hon. Mr. KING:
really.

The Deputy Minister.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: The Minister. That
is, choices will be made on a political basis-

JUNE 11, 1936
Hon. -Mr. KING: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -not necessarily on
a basis of merit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows that the power to dismiss--if
there are tu ha dismissals and not retirements
only-rests with the Minister, flot wjth the
Civil Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
This Bill clearly
states that selections among ail these arnployees wilI be made by-whom? Some employees will be retainad when the reorganization is complated, and some will have to go.
It is quite true that the Minister has power
to dismiss. If the Civil Service Commission
had charge of the reorganization it would flot
ignore the wishas of the Minister, the Deputy
and othar chief officials. On the contrary, it
would consuit them. If directors are appointed
the commission would go into the whole question of reerganization with them. The comnmission would datail o>ne man, or perhaps
two or thraa or more men, teo work continuously in co-operation with the Minister
and bis chiaf officars.
The point I am trying to make is tbat tbere
is hare a clear departura fromn the policy
that has bean laid down. This Bill hýands over
to the Minister the reorganization of his staff,
the classification of them. the fixing of thair
salaries and evarything else along that lina.
Well. as my right honourable leader has said,
let us do one of two things: let us follow
the policy that bas heen laid down, or let
us dispense witb it. As ha pointed out, if
we are to do wbat is proposad hare we may
as well wipe out tbe Civil Service Commission.
If that is the will of Parliament and of the
public, let us do it. But, in ail conscience,
while the Civil Service Commission remarns
in operation why sbould thara be the very
material departure thýat is proposed in this
instance?

Hon. Mm. MURDOCK: 1 say tiha.t in my

because the Civil Service Commission is not
being dýeprived of any of its functions, and
the employees of the merged departiments
will be subject to dismissal by their Minister
just as they always have been, just as they
would be if there were no merger at aIl.
Hoa. Mr. DANDURAND: May I ndd a
few words? It was my duty to read ail that
was said in another place with respect to
these two Bis, Nos. 79 and 80. Though at
times I would -rather do somethioig else than
read suoh material, I must try to do my duty.
However, it was pleasant to go through te
discussion on these two measures, for in it
there was nlot the slightest indication ibhat
any part of them was considered from a
political point of view. When I finished tihe
perusal, aiter midnight, I felt that the Cammons had treated these Buis ns independently
of political consideration as we in the Senate
treat most buis.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the House permit
me to speak again? I arn afraid the Bill has
not been read by my honourable fýriend who
is inclined to talk a little loudly at times.
He refers to my criticis.m of the measure as a
tempeagt in a teapot. He says the Civil

In other words, the Minister, not the
Civil Service Commission, may classify al
the employees in this reorganized departrnent
and set their salaries. True, these employees
are in the Civil Servicoe and were classifled by
the Civil Service Com-mission; but under the

There are no

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If so, my
honourable friend will have to retract some
things he bas said.
We want to get at what will be the effect
of the proposal on the Public Service. I
may say that the late Sydney Fisher and
myself were the twin fathers of the Civil
Service Commission. Its first chairman was
the late Adam Shortt. I have always stood
by the commission, although at times 1 was
annoyed by some of its members. In this
case, whatever we do the result will be
practically the same. If the reclassification
is referred to the Civil Service Coimission
its officer will have to get his information
from the Deputy, who knows the salaries of
and women in the department,
all mnc
and their duties. The Governor in Council
fixes the salaries on the recommendation of
someone. If it is made by the Civil Service
Commission it is based on information secured
from the officials of the departinent. The
salaries must be fixed by Order in Council, or
the employees concerned would net be civil
servants on a permanent basis. Permanent
appointments are made by Order in Council,
and the appointees cannot be dismissed except
by Order in Council. The Civil Service Commission has nothing watever to do with
dismissals. I cannot help thinking we both
have the same object in view. Under clause
7 tbe official.s of the several departments to
be merged in tho new department, knowing
all thev do know about the present staffs,
and being men of good judgment, will make
certain recommendations as to reclassification
to the Minister, and if approved by him the
reclassification will be confirmed by Order in
Council. If the work were done b' the Civil
Service Commission its reclassification would
aloe o confirmed by Order in Council.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If a case
could be male out for the total dismissal of
the

commission

from

the

sphere,

not

of

appointment, but of organization and classification, the right honourable gentleman's
argument would apply to every branch of the
service. It would not, I admit, apply to the
matter of appointment. But the commission
is just as necessary and vital in the sphere
of classification as of appointment; for if
somebody else bas control of classification,
appointments have no longer the same significance. Then the Government can do just
about as it likes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I say the result
will be the same whatever you do.
Right Hon. Mi. GRtHAM.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If that were
the case the Civil Service Commission would
be a mere automaton in the sphere of classification. But it is not. Truc, the commission
consults departmental officials, but its presence

is
jealousies, prejudices and rivalries shall not

I am not saying that those factors will prevail in the present instance. But the principle
of the Civil Service Act should be upheld;
otherwise those things might govern.
I am confident that if Dr. Camsell is to be
the Deputy of the new department he will do
the work well, but if we take the course
proposed in the present case how can we argue
in another case in favour of the principle of
the Civil Service Act? We shall have abandoned the principle; we shall have lost ground.
I am glad to hear what my right honourable
friend says about Dr. Camsell. I brought him
from British ColumbiaRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He bas lived
that down.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -and recommended him as Deputy Minister of Mines.
But I have known Deputy Ministers appointed
by our own side, as well as some appointed
by the other side, whose recommendations
I should have to look into very carefully:
their ideas of the organization of a department
were not governed solely by consideration
for the public service. So in a vital sphere
of operation of the Civil Service Act we have
either to apply its principle to this new department or admit we have no valid argument
for retaining it in any department. For myself, I would rather vote for a Bill to abolish
the commission and return to where we were
than be a consenting party to this process
of relegating it to oblivion.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am not
criticizing the Civil Service Commission in
any way. I am pointing out that it does not
make much difference how the result for which
ve are fighting is accomplished. As every
person who has been in charge of a department will admit, 90 per cent of the work will
be done by trusted departmental officials,
under a he-ad, and the Civil Service Commission will probably approve of everything
those officials recommend.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It does not have to.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It does not
have to. But we are arguing about something
that will not very much affect the final result.

Right H-on. Mr. GRAHAM: I sbould not

I want to give the House an example of the
foolishness of ail this talle about political influence in the matter of appointments. When
I accepted the Deputy of my predecessor many
of my Liberal friends wrote me saying, "You
must get rid oif that man." When I asked
why, they said, "Well, ha is a Tory." I than
inquired why they thought ha was a Tory; to
which they replied, "Oh, ha is the nephew
of John Haggart." But that did not make
hlm a Tory. As a matter of fact, bis father
was a Liberal candidate et one time and ran
against John Haggart. My Onit friends
thougbt that because ha was a relative of, and
bad been appointed hy John Haggart, there
must ha something wrong witb him. On the
,ontrary, ha was one of the ablest men who
aven entered the Public Service of Canada.
1 refer to the late Graham Bell. I mention
this just to show that mucb of this talk about
political influence concerns something whicb
neyer existed. It is a myth conjured up by
people who are disappointed when they do not
get what they want from a Minister.
I do not think it will make a bit of difference
in the final result whether or not this work is
done by the Civil Service Commission or with
their approval. I do flot veny strongly favour
aither way of doing it. bacause, as one wbo
bas been concerned witb government departmants for many ye-ars, I beliave the results
w;11 be the sae.
Since hearing Mn. Bland,
Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, 1
arn more than aven convinced of this.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If that is the case,
why the change?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I did not make
the change. You will have to ask the Minister.
It may ha that ha can give soma reasons
why it is battar to do this, or say how it will
ovarcome some of the difficulties of organizing
the different staffs undar one ad.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I may not be here
during the eerly part of next week. There
is just one thing I should like to say. I egree
that the chan-ces ara that in the end this will
flot make very mucb difference. The political

aspect of the situation does not bother me in
the slightest degrae. That is flot the point.
But let me make it quite clear that undar
the Bill as it stands the Governor in Council
bas the rigbt to reorganize and classify ai
thesa various staffs, end, more than that, be
bas the right to fix the salaTy of every penson
w-ho comnes under that reonganization. That
is not the case at presant. That sort of tbing
is donc on the recommandation of the Civil
Service Commission. The Governor in Council does not teke the initiative with regard
to any department.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But the
Council has to pass the Order in Council.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It bas to pass an
Order in C'ouncil, but it doas so on the recommandation of the Civil Service Commission.
From my experience I should say that so far
as thet feature is concarned the Government
very sald-om, if aver, refuses to accept the
recommendation of the Civil Service Commission.
Under this Bill the GovernoT in Council, is
laf t free to do as ha pleases, through the Minister, negarding this wbole question of the
classification of wbat previously were four
departments. Funtharmore, lie is lef t f ree
to fix the salarias of eny and ail concerned,
wîtbout any recommandation from the Civil
Service Commission. T-hat is a radical departure. If you ware to provide that the
Minister, wben lie -bas the recommendations
of the directors and bis Deputy before bim
and bas finishad with the classification, should
refer it to the Civil Service Commission for
final review, in order to ensuna that it. did not
clash with the classification in the other departments of the service, sucb a provision
would ha ail right. But let me give you an
example of wbat mey happen. The man in
charge of the Mines Brencb mey sey, "I
went these twelve men." Suppose he recommends to Dr. Cemsell that A should get $3,000,
B $2,500, and some othaer fellow $4,000. Then,
Dr. Camsell, wbo perhaps is not ecquainted
with that end of tbe business, may say, "Very
good, if you recommend it." The mattar goes
Vo, the Minister, who lias to rely upon the
recommandation. Than Council will, epprova,
aven thougb the classification is out of lina
witb the classification througbout the rast of
the service. Unless the Civil Service Commission can sea to it that the new classification and the salarias flxed are in lina witb
thosa in the rest of the service, we are going
to -have more then a tempest in a teepot in
the city of Ottawe: it will ha a real tempest.
So I say th-at if the Civil Service Commission

The motion was agreed to.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act respecting
the Department of Transport.
He said: The purpose of this Bill is the
consolidating of the Department of Railways
and Canais, the Department of Marine, and
the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department
of National Defence. This consolidation is
being effected in the interests of economy and
efficiency, and for the better regulation and
control of transportation activities generally.
Transportation, whieh has always been a
major public problem in Canada, and no doubt
will always be, bas undergone great changes
in recent years. The most important change
bas been the development of highway transport, the competition of which bas been so
seriously felt by the railways. The latter are
subject also, during the season of navigation,
to intense competition by the waterways, while
in the air, more particularly over the vast
and as yet undeveloped interior of the Dominion, a network of airways is rapidly emerging,
the proper extension and control of which
will play an important part in Canada's general transportation scheme.
In view of these developments, the Government is of opinion that the public interest requires a co-ordinated consideration of
the problem of transportation in all its
aspects, having in mind the general interrelation of modern transport activities and the
fact that the economic life and commercial
well-being of the nation depend upon the
maintenance of effective means of transport.
The development of a satisfactory transportation policy must have regard to the newer
agencies and their idaptation to modern reHon. Mr. CAI

t'/Y

quirements, together with reasonable uniformity in the regulation and control of all
common carriers.
For the more effective handling of these
problems, the Department of Railways and
Canais and the Department of Marine are
being merged. Civil aviation is also brought
in. In the separate administration of canais
and marine services generally there bas been
considerable duplication, more especially of
engineering activities. Increased efficiency and
economy are expected to result from unification. It is intended to bring civil aviation
under the Minister of Transport in order that
this rapidly developing mode of transport may
be properly co-ordinated with the older services
and given a more effective opportunity to
develop. The effect will be to bring under
common direction and control, in so far as
Dominion jurisdiction extends, all activities
connected with railways, waterways, highways
and airways. The new Department of Transport will thus be able to deal in a very comprehensive fashion with transportation in all
its forms. It is confidently expected that this
will result in more uniform measures of regulation and control, much more effective and
efficient transportation services, and a considerable reduction in costs and charges connected with departmental administration.
The Bill creates a Department of Transport
and gives the Minister of Transport ail the
powers, duties and functions of the Minister
of Railways and Canais and the Minister of
Marine. The Bill provides also for the transfer of the duties, powers and functions now
pertaining to the officers of the present
departments to the officers of the new department.
It confers authority on the Governor in
Council to organize the new department by
transfer thereto of the staffs of the two
former departments and of the Civil Aviation
Branch of the Department
of National
Defence. To prevent any break in the continuity of the services of the continuing
officers, clerks and employees, the consolidated
organization will be established and classified prior to the proclamation of the Act,
and will become effective immediately on
proclamation.
The Bill provides for the necessary amendment of the Department of Railways and
Canais Act, and the repeal of the Department
of Marine Act.
The amendments to the
former Act, as provided by the present Bill,
make provision for widening the powers of
the Minister in accordance with the necessitics arising out of the absorption of the
Department of Marine and the Civil Aviation

Defence.
I suppose the objection taken to clause 7
of the Bill we have just discussed. May he
taken to apply in this case, and that the
discussion on that Bill will cover this one.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
It
is true that the ouly difference between this
Bill and the previous one, an far as they
conceru the practical dismissal of the Civil
Service Commission, is that in this Bill the
section in question is No. 8 and in the other
it is No. 7. They read in exactly the same
way.
I do not asic that this Bill be now referred
to, committee, but I suggest thiat after the
second reading it should be left in abeyance
until we receive the committeee's report on
the other Bill. Then, as suggested by the
honourable senator to my right (Hon. Mr.
Calder), we shaIl have the advantage of
having heard the Minister's reasous, and shahl
be likely to make progress.
While I have uothiug in the world to Say
against these Bis in general, I warn the
Goverument that economy is a matter, not
of legisiation, but of administration, and of
good faith and will-power on the part of the
Minister in charge; and the Government wilh
be judged by the results. We shahl know
perhaps in two or three years from now just
what, if anything, bas been saved. If it
would not be venturing into the realm of
propbecy, I would say that two years from
nnw we are goiug to have a larger Civil
Service list and a greater cnst than we
have to-day. For four or five years we had
a very great reduction, sud that is one thing
for which I give the former Prime Minister
credit.
He had a practical command of
administrative affaira, aud the will and
determination to see that tremendous reductions were made.
Without insisting on
comparisons, I leave the House to draw the
infereuce that there are not going to be
reductions in the next two or three years.
Right Hou. Mr. GRAHAM: It may be
that expenses wiIl be much higher during
the next couple of years because of improved
conditions.
What I rose to say wvas this. I shaîl be
excused, I hope, for not always beiug
enamoured of departmental amalgamations.
The honourable member from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder), wbo has hiad a great deal of
experience, touched on the limitations of a
man's ability and strength. The point is not
a trifling one. The Minister of Railiways is a
young man, as I ivas once. I went into a
department thinkiug I could reorganize the
world, and worked long hours in my office

487

and in my home, trying to briug about things
that I thought should be brougbt about.
The administration of one department is
about alh that any man ean live through for
many years. No man who has not had the
burdeus of a department upon bis shoulders
ean understaud the detail sud the worry
involved in such a position.
The meinhers of a goverument in the
Dominion of Canada, whatever government it
may be, have a more trying time t-han the
membera of any other administrative body of
which I know.
Hou. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Right Hou. Mr. GRAHAM: Iu the Old
Land the members of the Cabinet do not
come into the Huse at ail, except for the
purpose of auswering certain questions. When
they have doue that t'hey retire to their
departments and proceed about their business,
and their under-secre taries represent them in
the House. In the United States the members
of the Cabinet are flot even members of
Congress. They neyer have to answer questions or meet criticisms face to face. Even
while the mnst heated deba-tes are taking place
in Congress they remain in their offices
carryiug ou their work. Iu Canada the
Ministers are supposed tu be in their offices
or in their seats in Parhiament at aîl times,
aud to stand the brunt of any criticism that
may be levelled against them.
One of the fears I have with respect tn these
amalgamnations is that young men, or men in
iidle life, ambitious to mak-e some real
aecomphishment, will, if tbey are not careful,
take on a load that is ton heavy for themn tn
carry.
Hon. Mr. CALDER- Hear, bear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Iu Canada the
resonsibility for ne department is ail that
ne man can really stand. If hie bas also to
be the spokesman for hi.s departmen-t in the
Senate or~ House of Commons, bis burden is
greater than ne man ought to be expected to
bear.
The motion was agreed to, and, the Bill was
read the second time.

AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that a message had been received from
the House of Commons returning Bill H, an
Act respecting The Trust and Loan Company
of Canada, with sorne amendments.
Hon. Mr. COTE moved, with the leave of
the Senate, that these amendments be concurred in now.
He said: Honourable senators, two amendments, which are not important, were made to
this Bill in another place, and I am informed
by the promoters of the Bill that they are
quite willing to accept them. As a matter of
fact, 'the emendments were put through a committee of the otheT House with the approvai
of the promoters. The first arnendment is
simply to cover a grammatical point, to substitute "paid" for the words "paid up," with
reference to stock. The second amendment is
merely a redraft of a section which we put
through, and on reading the redraft one cornes
to the conclusion that it is quite an improvement. It will be seen, therefore, that the
arnendments are of no great importance.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Did we not send
three similar bills over to another place? I
understood all three of them were rejected
there.
Hon. Mr. COTE: No. This is a measure to

NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
MISLEADING NEWSPAPER REPORT
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called I desire to direct attention to this short
article in to-day's issue of one of the Montreal papers:
Port Personnel Jobs Endangered-Senate action
would throw positions open to competition.
Ottawa, June 15.-(Star Special by Staff
Correspondent.)-Harbour officials and other
employees of long standing in the different
ports throughout the country have been thrown
into a state of alarm by the Senate amendment to the Harbours Board Bill. What may
have been designed for their protection is
claimed actually to mean that they will either
lose their jobs or take chances of retaining
them hy competitive examinations under the
Civil Service Commission. There is legal advice
to this effeet.
Large staffs of superintendents, engineers,
technical officers and clerks are affected. The
Senate conimittee was told the other day that
these officers are seldom interfered with on a
change of government. As originally drafted,
the Bill provided for the new central harbour
authority making or confirming the staff
appointments. By an amendment made by the
Senate committee it is provided that the Civil
Service Commission shall make all these
appoinitments. The amendment, however, contains nothing to protect the present staffs.
This, the legal authorities say, means that all
the present positions will be thrown open to
general competitive examination, and the
restrictions of the Civil Service Act as to the
age of those writing the examination will
apply. The present officers would have to compete to retain their jobs. It is understood that
the Government will refuse to agree to this
amendnment if the Senate insists on it.
Hon. Mr. COTE.

I am sure that all honourable senators are
quite familiar with the facts and will agree
with me that this is an incorrect and misleading report.
If the national harbours
are placed under the Civil Service Act, its
provisions as to competitive examinations
will apply only to new employees, and the
members of the present staffs will not be
disturbed, though they may of course be
classified. I repeat, this is a most erroneous
report.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Will the honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) kindly give the name of the newspaper
in which the article appeared?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The Montreal
Star. The article is inspired from Ottawa,
and I do not attach any blame to that wellknown paper.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Am I right in
understanding that if the Bill becomes law
all the employees of the varions harbour
commissions will have no jobs at all, as every
Act under which they now operate will be
repealed?
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

ANONYMOUS

PAMPHLET

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I wish to call attention to a
pamphlet which, I understand, bas been
distributed to members of the Senate and the
other House.
It is headed, "Bill 55A, an
Act to Amend the Decalogue." I shall not
read the text. At the end there is typewritten: "('Anonymous.' Yes, but he calls a
spade a spade!)"
The purpose of the
pamphlet is to ridicule parliamentary institutions generally, and to attack Bill 55, which,
I think, is now before the other House. I
draw attention to this scurrilous screed in
order to give notice to its authors that they
will gain nothing by their folly.
I may add that I have studied the Bill
referred to. It deals with radio broadcasting,
among other matters, and contains nothing
to warrant this scurrilous pamphlet.
CUSTOMS BILL (CANADIAN

WATERS)

THIRD READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 67, an Act to amend
the Customs Act (Canadian Waters), as
amended.

JUNE 15, 1936
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
the Bill before the House for third. reading
will, when it becomes law, give the Preventive
Service much greater power than it bas now.
In fact, so much is its power to be enlarged
that some members of the Banking and Commerce Committee feared that if ail these
powers were exercised they would hamper
the legitimate trade and commerce of the
country. The Preventive Service asked for
these new powers so that it could cope with
the evil of smuggling and illicit home-brewing of malt and spirituous liquors. This evil
is flot indigenous to our country., for did we
have it with us in its present intensity for
many years before the War. As it stands
now, it was caused hy an Act of Parliament
passed, with the best of intentions, during
the late War, which raised the customs and
excise duties on malt and spirituous liquors
to unprccedented heights. If we once realized the extent of the evil and the difflculty of
coping with it, the propc.r or best cure wouid
aimost suggest itself, namely, repeal of the
laws which caused it.
The cvii has taken on almost the proportions of a small civil war, employing some
of the modern weapons of war, on land, on
sea and in the air. It has divided the people
into two camps, one camp trying to suppress it, the other cither actively engaged in
it or sympathizing with it. It bas given rise
to anger, hatred, ill-will, strife, perjury and
other evils-aIl contrary to peace, order and
gond government. It is an unmitigated evil.
Smuggling is found to a great extent on the
coasts because of natural conditions, while
home-brewing is more extensively followed in
the interior.
Gencral MacBrien told us, at the hcaring
before the Banking and Commerce Committee, that the effort to cape with the evil
was costing the country a direct outlay of
more than a million dollars a year, and that
to meet the situation eifectiveiy would require
an additional expenditure of at least $250,000
or $300.000. I amn sure that I arn weii within
the mark when I say that the indirect cost
to the country is more than the direct costperhaps twice as much; but, great as the
cost is, it is in my opinion nothing to the
demoralizing affect the illicit traffic has on
the character of many of our people. That,
as I see it, cannot be caiculated in terms of
money; and I greatly fear that whiie s0 large
a proportion of our people sympathize with
the traffic and either activeiy or passiveiy
support it, it cannot he suppressed hy force.
Even Caneral MacBrien's hopes are limitad,
for he told us before the Banking and Commerce Committea that while he expected to

curtail the smuggiing end of the business ha
feared -that the curtailment itself wouid
increase the home-brewing.
Some people think the revenue of the
country wouid suifer if duties wera reduced
to a figure that would take away the incantive
to smuggle and home-brew. I doubt that the
revenue wouid suifer by such a reduction. I
feal that I should be quite safe in saying
that two-thirds of the liquors consumed now
pay no duty. But even if the revenue would
suifer to some extent, surely no Governmen-t
would think of raising revenue by methods
that wouid damoraliza the character of its
citizens.
I feel it to ha my duty to make these
observations at this stage, because I fear this
evil wili flot be cured by the methods wa are
adopting. and I really balieve that if the
members would take the time to consider the
business thoroughly other methods would be
adopted.
Some aight years ago, when we enlarged
the powcrs of the Preventive Service, Mr.
Breadner, who was then Commissionar of
Customs, and Mr. Cowan, an officiai of the
Preventive Service, told us they feit sure they
could stop smuggling and illicit home-hrewing
if they got the iaw they were asking for. Two
years later Mr. Breadner toid me they had
been defcated; that the only way to stop the
business was to make a drastie reduction of
the dutias. GaneraI MacBrien says virtuaily
the same thing now. Under thase circumstances the only thing we can do now is to
watch this lagisiation and its affects. If it
faiis-I hope it wili not-parhaps -the Government of the day wiil appiy the remedy that
should have bean applied some years ago.
The motion was agread to, and the Bill was
rcad the third tima, and passed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have been
so closely engaged with legislation coming
from the other House that I have not been
able to foilow what occurred in committee
regarding this Bill. The cmendments are
the result of the committee's work, and I
think some member of the committee should
give us a general idea of the opinions expressed by the persons appearing before the
committee. and of the proposed amendments
to the Bill. The Bill deals with a subject
that is new, and I confess that I am not
disposed to vote for it until I have some
further information as to the result of the
lmquiry.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable senators, I regret that, because of meetings of
other committees, I was not able to attend
all the meetings of the committee on this
Bill; nevertLheless, I am very strongly of the
opinion that no very grave amendments were
made. Tlhey were rather, as the honourable
senator from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has said, for the purpose off meeting
the views of certain officials of the Government. Under the circumstances I think the
suggestion that the third reading be taken
to-morrow is a good one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The motion is
for the adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
I am quite
willing to withdraw my suggestion that the
Bill be referred to the Committee on Railways, Telegraplhs and Harbours, provided the
suggestion of the leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is agreed to, and the
mover and the seconder give us some further
explanation of the Bill to-morrow.

only fair to honourable members that we

The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
MOTION

FOR

THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 17, an Act respecting the National Harbours Board.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable members, when the report of the committee on this
Bill was submitted to the Senate I intimated
that I wished to reserve the right to make a
few observations. I desire now to enter my
protest and express my disapproval of this
Bill. I believe that I represent the views of
the people of my constituency of Halifax when
I say that the majority of the business men,
merchants, and people generally, and more
especially
the longshoremen
and freight
handlers in the port, are opposed to this Bill
because it tends to interfere with their means
of making a liveliiood. I have represented the
constituency of Halifax in this Parliament
since the year 1925, and have noted with a
great deal of pleasure the gradual increase
in the facilities and development of the port,
generally, and in the trade and commerce of
the port, especially under the supervision of
the Harbour Commission. I would particularly
draw the attention of honourable members to
the fact that in ev'ery month of the last three
years there was an improvement over the
corresponding month of the previous year.
But the improvement ceased with the first
month of the present year. I might suggest
to this House that the decrease in trade in the
port of Halifax has been coincidental with the
coming into effect of the Canada-United States
Trade Agreement and with the change from
harbour commissions to centralization of ports.
You can draw your own inference, honourable
membcrs. For the present I will not place
the responsibility.
I was asked to look up the April, 1936,
number of a Government publication known
as The National Revenue Review, issued by
authority of the Minister of National Revenue.
In the first column on page 12 of that number
there is an article headed "Shipping at Halifax." I will not trespass upon the time of the
House to read the whole article, but I desire
to quote this one sentence:
Cargo tonnage handled inward amounted to
67,324.

outward

88,683,

as

against

131,178

handled inward in February, 1935, and 138,593
handled outward.

493

JUNE 15, 1936
That refers ta the manth af February of
this year.
The decrease for that month, as compared
with the samne month last year, is 113,764 tons.
Do honourable members realize what that
means? Parliament bas been asked ta approve
af many thousands and tens of thousands ai
dollars for unempl.oyment relief, while the
port of Halifax has been suffering a decrease
in trade that represents a loss for that one
month of approximately $100,000 in wages ta
the freight handiers ai that port. I tbink
that is. a pretty sale estimate ai the loss ta
those men.
0f course the freigbt bandiers are flot the
only persons affected.
Canadian trade in
general feels the loss. The revenue of the
Canadian National Railways is less than it
otherwise would be, and in consequence a
number of railway employees have had fewcr
hours and days af work. I say ta the Government that this legisiation bas not been considered as it should have been.
We have listened ta glorification of the
Canada-United States Trade Agreement, but
I tell yau, Mr. Minister, and your Government through you, that the Agreement bas
militated against tbe interests oi the port ai
.Halifax. You have done away with the ten
per cent preference ta British imports and
Canadian exporta througb our own ports and
allowed themn ta be shipped through American
ports. Our chief cansideration should be for
aur Canadian ports and traffic. As Sir Wilfrid
Laurier said, let us farce the trade of Canada
east and west; let us give a preference ta the
railways and the workingmen ai Canada.
But what bas this treaty donc for us? It
has had just the opposite effect. As a result,
many workiagmen of Halifax are looking for
relief instead af enjoying the legitimate employment ta which they are justly entitled.
My principal abject in rising ta speak,
honourable members, is to register the abjection of the workingmen oi Halifax ta this
measure. I have received a letter, accompanied
by a memorandum, iram the Halifax Longshoremen's Association, the largest organized
body ai workingmen in the Maritime Provinces. With the permission ai the House I
shall read the document, s0 that it may
appear on aur records:

Re Centralized Contra! ai Dominion Ports
It is impossible te predict at this time j!ust
hiow the new centralized plan ai centralling
the important harbours af the Dominion is
gaing ta wark eut se f ar as Halifax is concerned. There is reasan, however, te fear that
it wiIl be ta the detriment oi the p rt. This
apprehension is sbared in common by diversifiad groups oi people representing the variaus
part interests. Halifax, by reasan ai its geagraphical position, bas ta bear the handicap of
longer railroad hauls irom the point ai production and a natural tandency for aversea
experters and importers ta have their goods
transported by the shortest route.
For a great many years the port ai Halifax
only abtained a modicum ai the import and
export trade ai Canada, but when the systema
ai barbour commissions was adopted and began
ta operate in Halifax, then a very noties ble
increase in imports and exparts ai ireight
bappened. We believe this was due mainly ta
the local interests, which under the circum-

SENATE
stances were centred directly on the welfare
of the port.
The greatest danger in centralized control,
so far as it affects the port of Halifax, is that
the local interest is not present.
I want to impress that 'point particularly
upon the House.
The board of control operating from a point
greatly distant from the port cannot be
expected to have the same enthusiasm and
interest that a local commission would have.
The appointment of a port manager does not
evercome this handicap, no matter how efficient he may be; he has to be subject entirely
to directions from the centralized body and is,
as termed, only a manager and not an admin.strator.
No greater proof could be obtained of the
advisability of a local harbour commission
from a Halifax viewpoint than the tremendous
increase of waterborne traffic in the port during the time such form of control was in effect.
The new scheme is also untried, and while it
may appear from a business point of view,
and from the point of view of the whole
Dominion, to be sound, one cannot help thinking that any benefit that will be derived from
such scheme to the Dominion will be to the
disadvantage of the port of Halifax.
It is our firm belief that the port of Halifax
as one of the major ports of the Dominion is
entitled to every help, and, even if the scheme
would be successful in other ports, Halifax
should not be included until the handicaps due
to geographical and other conditions are
removed. We are sure that these handicaps
have not been removed at the present time,
although some arrangements were made in the
past to overcome some of the handicaps of the
port by reason of its geographical position.
We believe we are right in insisting that
Halifax, as one of the major ports of the
Dominion, is entitled to every consideration,
and that the thousands of men who earn a
livelihood in the port should not be deprived
of that livelihood merely because it is considered advisable to adopt what has been called
a sound business system for Canada. This
appears to us to be a rather selfish way of
looking upon the problem, because if the future
of the port of Halifax is to be jeopardized
merely because it is considered good business
to control it from a distance, then Halifax
is not getting its just rights.
It should never be forgotten that the port
of Halifax is one of the major ports of the
Dominion and nothing should be done to
weaken its position so far as having a reasonable share of the import and export trade of
Canada is concerned.

Honourable members, having read that
document and, registered the opinion of my
constituents in Halifax, I consider that I
have done my duty. As I have already indicated, this measure has been of inestimable
harm to our port. I warn the Government
that its policy is contrary to the interests of
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

the working men of Canada. The Government may go ahead and force its legislation
through Parliament, but I tell the Minister,
and ask him to repeat to his colleagues what
I say, that the Government is flying in the
face of the interests of the people who elected
it, a.nd doing a great injustice to them, and
particularly to all who are in any way connected with the port of Halifax. The Government, through the present policy, is doing
a harm which it will be impossible to remedy.
Hon. J. H. RAINVILLE:
Honourable
senators, it is with considerable hesitancy that
I rise again to speak on this Bill. for I fear
I have already taken too much of your time.
On the motion for second reading I stated
the case for the harbour of Montreal.
I
dealt with its early history, its progressive
development, its financing during the first
fifty-eight years, its present physical aspect
and financial structure, its expanding business
and steadily increasing revenue, and I pointed
out that it bas become one of the great ports
of the New World, ranking second only to
the port of New York. I detailed further the
pressing problems of the port, particularly
the urgent problem of meeting the increasingly
deadly competition of American ports, and
the vital necessity of deepening the St. Lawrence channel, even at the risk of incurring
the displeasure of dam contractors.
I discussed also the four reasons cited in
support of the Bill, and I quoted the words
of Sir Alexander Gibb and of the honourable
Minister himself in condemnation of the socalled fundamental reasons. As yet, my arguments have not been answered.
After listening to the debate and again
reading very carefully the Gibb report, I
think the matter may be summed up in this
sentence. The Government was worried over
capital expenditure by various harbour commissions, and Sir Alexander Gibb was instructed to find a way to curb such expenditure.
In paragraph 30 of his report Sir Alexander
deals with the situation in these terms:
It is quite clear, moreover, that the ports
have been seriously handicapped, particularly
wlhen new works have been under construction,
by the delay in getting the approval of Government to important matters. By reason too of
the cumulative delays due to the number of
officials and departments involved, to the pressure of more important business in Council, to
absences of Ministers, and other causes,
harbour commissions have generally to finance
new works for several months, and at times
for considerably longer periods. As a natural
reaction they have been rather inclined to
exploit the unsatisfactory position and to
undertake work without authorization, financed
by bank loans which they have no power to
raise and for which the banks apparently
desired no security. So far as these unauthorized loans are concerned, the state of affairs

JUNE 15, 1936
had just corne to a head when I was in
Canada, and I understand the deatenbs
since taken drastic measures to elear the position.
It may well be asked, why did nlot the
Minister clear up the position before. I wish
to state that in the harbours of Montreal,
Saint John, Halifax, Quebec, Týhree Rivers
and Chicoutimni no important construction
work was ever started without the plans and
specifications having been deposited with the
Department of Marine for approval, or without written or verbal authorization from the
Minister himself. I arn personally aware that
in most instances the commissioners went to
the Minister's office tbree or four tirnes, and
occasionally oftener, for authority to proceed.
Only in very few cases were the works started
before written approval was given, and then
only when the Minister had told the cornmissioners: "~Go on with the work. I will
see that the necessary Order in Council is
passed later on." I rnay say that in the Iast
five years the Montreal Harbour Commissioners have always received f ormal approval
of their undertakings.
It will not surprise honourable members to
learn that such delays certainly did not help
The honourable
forward port development.
Minister himself may flot have been directly
responsible for this condition of affairs, but
undoubtedly it was brought about by the
inadequacy of the staff in the departrnent.
This is admitted in paragraphs 21, 23, 25, 30,
105 and in other parts of the Gibb report.*
Indeed. the present honourabie Minister of
Marine, speaking in the House of Commons,
stated:
The total staff at Ottawa whicb bas had to
act as contact with the barbour boards bas
bcn one officer known as the Supervisor of
Harbour B3oards, and bis entire staff bas consisted of one clerk and two stenographers. The
resuit bas been tbat tbere has been delay in
approving recommendations coming froin ports.
In the Gibb report, hýonourable senators, we

two or t-hree alternative solutions of our harbour problern. With respect to the proposai
to establish a central 'board he says tihat he
"9was impressed by the importance of the
suggestion." As to its autihor he is silent.
However, in paragraph 22 he inakes this
important etatement:
A very large number of sehernes were laid
before rne, some involving the rnost revolutionary changes. I do not concur in the latter
attitude, but I arn of the opinion tbat tbe
administration needs to be considerably modified.
I asic honourable members wbat can be more
rev.olutionary than this Bill to provide for
direct administration from Ottawa of ail our

national ports. I contenèd that if the present
Bill were subrnitted to Sir Alexander hie
would most assuredly disclaimi any responsibility for it, for by its terrns it wholly ignores
autonomy and brushes aside local initiative.
Yet these are acknowledged to be the most
important factors in national port deveiopment.
The situation tbroughout the world to-day
is a challenge to the principle of centralizatien embodied in th-is Bill. It is significant
th-at ail coun.tries which bave appliýed the principle have founid it fail in practice and
have ultimately reWeted it.
Sir Alexander emphasizes the conditions
f-avourable to port progress. In paragrapb 83
hiestates:
It is essential to avoid emasculating tbe local
administration since no centralized control can
replace an eflcient and active local administration, or tbe special .knowledge
and
initiative of tbe local business community,
botb of whicb are vital to a port's prosperity.
In paragraph 87 he develops the saine
theme:
Wben we turn to tbe question of the f orm
of central administration, we are faced by tbe
alrnost uniform experience tbat while departmental control bas many advantages in tbe
early stages of a country's deveioprnent, it is
nlot suited to tbe complexities of a live business such as a modern port. It is tbe babit
and virtue of a department to be cautious, te
follow precedent, to standardize practice, and
to escbew entbusiasrn. That tbe developrnent
of the Harbour Commissions bas in f act not
heen bandicapped in tbe past is due ratber to
the breadth of vision tbat bas cbaracterized
tbe individuals responsible, tban tbe departmental systern itself.
He expresses the saine opinion forcibly and
definitely in paragraphs 84 and 85, which the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) quoted be.fore the standing committee.
1 contend thýat nowbere in the Bill is there
the slightest recognition of the spirit of
initiative.
We have, bonourable .senators, studied the
report of one man. Earlier reports bad heen

Andirew Rae DYuncan was selected by the then
Liberal Administration to head a royal coýmmission to study transportation in this country, with a view to reýcomrnending the best
means of directing our trade through Canadian territory towarde our national ports.
Se! Andrew is a very distinguished Englishman, probably of even greatier repute than
Sir Alexander Gibb. Sir Andrew was assisted
in bis survey by Professor Macmnillan, of
MeGili University, and Mr. Justice Wallace,
of Halifax.
The royal commission recommended that the only way to develop

496

SENATE

successfully our national harbours was to
create local harbour commissions with wide
powers., in order to overcome government
indifference or erratic judgment in port
development.
Sir Andrew Rae Duncan had this to say
on the harbours of Halifax and Saint John:
We recommend that in respect of each of
these two harbours the Federal Government
should establish a statutory Harbour Commission whose business it would be to sec that the
port facilities are developed on such a scale as
will gradually, but by no means slowly, create
channels through which trade can expand.
It will be readily seen that the present Bill
fails to meet any of the requirements laid
down by that royal commission. The fundamental principle which governed the findings
of the Royal Commission on Maritime Claims
was the concept of Canadian interests. Surely
the saime principle applies to our national
harbours.
I submit that Sir Alexander Gibb's recommendations were based, not on national grievances, but mainly .on the grievan.ces of the
As incorporated in the
late Government.
Bill. those recommendations are the nullification of progressive port administration and
a distinct slowing down of the sound policy
of fighting for trade supremacy.
In my opinion-and J think honourable
menbers generally will endorse it-to imagine
that the new system will involve less political
interference is simply childish. In the book
which I have in my hand, dealing with
Montreal harbour, will be found a complete
li-t of the staff during my term of office.
Many of its members have been in the
service of the board for thirty years, and
none of them for less than six or seven
years. I want to give credit to the present
chairman of the Montreal harbour commissioners and to bis predecessor; I want a.lso
to give credit to all the boards, whether
under the Liberal or the Conservative
regime, and to assure this House that polities
has never entered into the administration of
the port. Business does not admit of politics. There is always political pressure, but
the conmmissioners have always acted in a
purely business way, and have tolerated no
political interference. I challenge anyone to
state that the Montreal harbour commissioners ever played politics.
Now. honourable senators, there is one
question which I did nt mention on the
second reading, and with regard to which I
said just a few words in committee. I refer
to the question of the legality of this Bill.
I speak particularly of the harbour of Montreal, because of its peculiar charter. In all
early legislation the Government took good
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE.

care not to involve the Legislature financially
in the Montreal harbour venture. This was
particularly evident at the time of Union, in
1840, when certain ordinances were passed
permitting the harbour of Montreal to borrow
money. Every time the Government passed
a law conferring rights on the harbour it was
careful to guard against the possibility of
becoming involved in any deficit which might
accrue. I have here a summary of these early
laws, all of which are the same in principle.
I shall read only section 33 of Chapter 143
of 18 Victoria. It says:
The Corporation shall keep separate accounts
of all moneys borrowed, received and expended
by it, and shall account for the same annually
to the Governor; but the provincial guarantee
shall not be given for the payment of either
principal or interest of any sum borrowed
under this Act, nor shall the province be in
any way responsible therefor.
We find this principle continued througb all
the legislation, even after Confederation.
While the harbour authorities borrowed money
in England, in the United States, or in Montreal, the Government guaranteed nothing. It
was only after the harbour became a financial
success that the Government stepped in and
made loans, loans on which the interest bas
always been paid out of the revenues of the
port. This pessimistic atmosphere and unsympathetic attitude continued until at least
1888, and even to-day it is difficult at times
to convince ourselves that it does not still
exist.
Let me quote again from the report of Sir
Alexander Gibb, at paragraph 131, where he
refers to this very question of legality. He
says:
There is considerable doubt as to whether
the harbour commissions are:
(a) branches of the Federal Government;
(b) agents; or
(c) separate corporate bodies.
Rulings and decisions appear to be contradictory. The Department of Justice recently
expressed the view that so long as a Harbour
Conmission makes contracts in its own name
it is not acting as an agent of the Crown.
On the other hand all Harbour Commission
contracts are held to be Government contracts,
in such a matter as the Fair Wages Act.
A distinguished Minister of Marine stated
ii the House some years ago that "Harbour
Commissions are practically branches of the
Department of Marine and Fisheries." More
recently. it has been equally authoritatively
stated that "a Board of Harbour Commissioners is an independent body over which the
Government of the day exercises no jurisdiction, except as to the auditing of the accounts."
And then-mark these words:
After the closest perusal of the various incorporating Acts, J am left in some doubt as
to how far the commissions can be said to be
agents of the Crown at all. In many ways
they have the appearance rather of practically

JUNE 15, 1936
independent statutory bodies, subject to a
limnited government control in certain directions only. This was, I was informed, at one
time the officiai view of the Montreal Harbour
Commission, supported by the opinion of its
lega] advisers.
In thle paragraph immediately following,
Sir Alexander Gibb expiains that the harbour
properties were transferred te the Crown for
the sole purpose of avoiding municipal taxation. He says:
One of the many questions învolved in the
nature of Hlarbour Commissions is their
liability to local taxation. The barbours as
Crown property are generaiiy heid exempt
fromn taxation, althougbi the properties have
been definitely vested by the Crown to the
varieus commissions. In various cases I balieve there have been disputes in regard te
properties acquired by the commissions after
incorporation, or owned by Harbour Commissions and ieased to private interests, or rented
by Harbour Commissions f romn private interests. Apart f rom the legal aspect, some of
the commissions have heid the view that an
"equitable adjustment" should be made between
the Crown and the municipal authorities, to
compensate the latter for the ioss of rateabie
property, and for the cost of public services
from wbicb the Crown benefits. At Vancouver
a settiement bas, I understand, been made witb
one of the municipalities on these lines.
It appears to me tbat there is another
aspect that is being lest sigbt of, and that is
that the city or town in question and its
citizens depend for their existence to a great
extent on tbe port's progress and development,
to tbe cost of wbich they make no contribution
whatever except by such generai services.
Whiie therefore there may be occasionai cases
wbere special concessions are justified, I consider that as a regular mile ail property used
for port purposes sbould enjey exemption fromn
taxation.
The tranafer of property mentioned bas not
in any way changed the legal status of the
autonomcus trust given by early legisiation to
the harbour of Montreal. The Govemnment
lias become one of its creditors, it is true, but
it lias thereby acquired no right of spoliation.
The financial position of the liarbour of
Mont-real was once weii illustrated by an excommisioner of that harbour, Mr. Robert
Bickerdike. who was then a memiber of Parliament and a very prominent business man of
Montreal. Here is what lie said in the House
of Commons; on April 17, 1901, wlien ha was
asking for tlie production of certain papera:
The papers wbich I ask for (from tbe Minister of Pubic Works) wiii prove that the port
of M-%ontreai bas neyer had a single dollar of
Government money spent upon it. Tbey will

Claire. and f romn Hali fax to Caugbnawaga, bas

improvements, both fromn former governments
and fromn tliis government. But up to the
present time-and I challenge successful contradiction to this statement flot a single dollar
bas been spent by governments on the harbour
proper of Ilie city of Montreai.
It is true,

the Government in the past bas guaranteed
the bonds of the Harbour Commission of Montreai, on wbicb we pay interest, and the Auditor
Generai's report wiil prove that every time
that interest becomes due the Harbour Commisioners of Montreal pay reguiariy and te
the date.
These words are a substantiation of my statement tliat Montreal harbour lias always been,
and atili is, a seif-supporting trust, autonemous
by iaw, and, as sucli, ad'miniatering the
barbour in trust for the citizens and publie
bodies of Montreal under certain regulations
made by the Goverrnment.

of tlie federai autliority our Constitutien permits of tlie legisiation. Tliis is ne answer;
it is neot even an excuse. The Constitution
grants exclusive riglits te the federal power

For these reasons, honourable senators, I
cannot support this Bill. To pass it would
mean. nobhing ie.ss than plundering the shippers and business men of this country and
making a political football of one of our
greatest national interests.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 should like
to put a question to my honourable friend.
Hie speaks of spoliation, and argues that if
the Government takes over the control of
the harbour of Montreal, which is the creature
of the Government, it might as wel'l take
control of the banks. My honourabie fýriend
bas just made a comparison. I should like
to ask hini who are the shareholders of the
port of Montreal. What are the private interests that are being spoliated? The harbour
commis,,ioners -of Montreal have administered
the port for the Dominion of Canada. I
should like te, know liow my honourable
fricnd can justify bis remark as to spoliation.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Let me tell rny
honourable friend I eall it spoliation because in all the legisiation having to do with
the port at the beginning, only citizens of
Montreal were appointed on the harbour
board, and the same policy wa.s followed al
the time. This port was built with the money
of Montreal and by the citizens of Montreal.
The people of Montreal bave an immediate
interest in the port. They ýowe $58,000,000
on it. and pay interest on this sum, but if the
Government had not been willing to advance
the money, the people could bave borrowed

States. And had that been done, our port
would to-day be in the hands of the citizens
of Montreal-. I arn complaining because this
lýegislation destroys local auton'omy in the
port and transfers the immediate administration of the port to a department at Ottawa.
The system of centralization, which bas been
tried in France and abandoned, has not succeeded ýanywhere in the world. Let *me tell
my honourable frîond that within two years
the Governiment will corne back with a new
policy, that of restoring the harbour of Montreal te local administration.
That is rny
hope. and I feol sire it will be realized.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows that the provinces transferred
owvnership in the ports to the Dominion Governiment in 1867.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: 0f course they
did. And the last legisiation, in 1894. stated
that though the Dominion had lent money,
nothing would be done to disturb the character and organization of the Harbour Comnmission. The systema has neyer been changed
su far. Sir Alexander Gibb, xvhomi I have
previously quoted, stated that the commissioners were flot agents of the Dominion Government; :but sections 3 and 13 of this presenit

HenourHon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE:
able senators. the discussion on this question,
which has been adjourned many times, may
appear pu-rely academie. but whonever there
is the least mention of the subjeet of amendmonts to our Constitution the minorities are
alert.. They naturally are taking a deep interest in the view-s expressed in ýthis Chamber,
because. after ail, it is here that the decision
will eventually be made on the advisability
of chingýing the mode ef amending our Constitution.

JUNE 15, 1936
So far in the discussion references have
been made principally to the views expressed
by the Fathers of Confederation. But time
has done with our Constitution what it does
with almost everything. With the passing
of years there has been a certain evolution
in ideas and views as to what the British
North America Act is. If I may have the
indulgence of the House I shall quote what
present-day judges, writers, professors and
parliamentarians say about our Constitution.
At the outset of my remarks I want to
refer to an interesting fact. In the resolution
of last year appointing a special committee
to study and report on the best method by
which the British North America Act mnight
be amended. the House of Commons made
clear its desire to safeguard the rights of
minorities. All the expert witnesses who gave
evidence before and prepared memoranda for
the committee also pointed out that they
wanted to prcserve the rights of minorities,
and the committee itself stated in its report
that it was "definitely of the opinion that
minority rights agreed upon and granted
under the provisions of the British North
Ame.rica Act should not be interfered with."
These sentiments are very pleasing to representativies of minorities everywhere, especially
in this House.
Now, lot us consider what our Constitution
is. If you peruse the memoranda presented
by expert witnesses before the special committee to which I have .referred, you will
notice differences of opinion as to the character of the British North America Act. Is
it a contrant, a compromise, an entente, a
compact, a treaty, or simply a statute? Did
it really create a federation or not? I shall
take a few minutes to discuss this matter
and review the opinions of judges, writers
and professors on constitutional law, and of
parliamentarians.
I shall not include the
views of the makers of Confederation. We
know what they wanted to do, and what they
did.
In order to keep to my subject and make
my remarks as short as possible, I shal, with
permission, follow some notes that I have
here.
In his "Responsible Government and the
Dominions," Professor Arthur B. Keith says,
at page 586:
It was most expressly recognized in 1907 by
the Imperial Government that the federal constitution is a compact which cannot be altered
save with the assent both of the Dominion and
the provinces.
Lord Sankey, Lord Chancellor, in the Aeronautics case, 1932, says as follows:
12745--32

Inasmuch as the Act embodies a compromise
under which the original provinces agreed to
federate, it is important to keep in mind that
the preservation of the rights of minorities
was a condition on which such minorities
entered into the federation, and the foundation
upon which the whole structure was subsequently erected. The process of interpretation
as the years go on ought nat to be allowed ta
dim or to whittle down the provisions of the
original contract upon which the federation
was founded, nor is it legitimate that any
judicial construction of the provisions of sections 91 and 92 should impose a new and
different contract upon the federating bodies.
In the report of the special committee of the
House of Commons this dictum by Hon.
Mr. Veniot is quoted:
Further than that, it must be understood
I maintain that it was a strict agreement
between the provinces.
That was part of a question put to Mr. Edwards, Deputy Minister of Justice, whose
reply is also quoted:
I agree with you, that it was an agreement.
At page 54 of the report of the committee
appears this reference to a statement by the
right honourable leader of this side of the
Senate (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen):
In February, 1925, however, Mr. Meighen
said: "Undoubtedly, the pact of confederation
is a contract and there are rights involved
therein not represented by the Parliament of
Canada."
Let us now quote a few opinions to the
effect that the British North America Act u
not a contract. Professor Kennedy said:
I approach this problem as a practical
problem, and I think we have got to get away
from the idea that the B.N.A. Act is a "contract" or "treaty." I do not want to go into
that, but it is truc neither in history nor in
law. The B.N.A. Act is a statute, and has
always been interpreted as a statute. It is
perfectly truc that if you read cases on the
B.N.A. Act-we hear very frequently of the
Quebec resolutions and such like--but the courts
have interpreted the B.N.A. Act unitormly as
a statute. There is one case where, as you
know, the Judicial Committee did refer very
strongly to the Quebec resolutions and ta outside matters; but Lord Sankey apologized for
the reference, and he was careful ta make it
clear that he was interpreting a statute. In
all the cases which I have read the statutory
idea has governed.
I will now quote from the memorandum presented to the committee by Dr. Ollivier, Law
Clerk of the House of Commons. While I
am mentioning the name of Dr. Ollivier, I
would recommend ta your attention his two
books on our Constitution: "Canada-Pays
Souverain," and "L'Avenir Constitutionnel du
Canada." You may not agree with every
conclusion at which the author arrives, but
you will find his books well written, and full

500

SENATE

of information and references covering the en-

tire field of constitutional law affecting
Canada. Dr. Ollivier says our Constitution is
not a contract and that we are not a confederation or a federation. He states:
To revert to the statement that Confederation is a contract, this proposition contains a
number of fallacies: first, Confederation so
called is not a confederation; second, it is not
a contract.
On the first point, a confederation is a union
of independent and sovereign states bound together by a pact or a treaty for the observance
of certain conditions dependent upon the
unanimous consent of the contracting parties,
who remain free to withdraw froua th e union.
The states forming part of the confederation
retain tleir political independence and are,
from the point of view of international law,
still recognized as sovereign states. The best
example of suci a confederation is the Confederation of the Rhine created by Napoleon
in 1805.
It is therefore easy to sec why Canada is
not a confederation, for the provinces have been
merged or federated s as to fori a judicial
state enjoying ail the privileges and rights
belonging to a sovereign and autonomous conmunity. It bas been aptly said that "the bond
whici unites the states in a federation is a
treaty, a pact, or a contract. in the strict
sense; tise priiciple of coliesion of our provinces
is the constitution, which is its judicial source
and the limitation of iLs power."
This is the second proposition. The first
condition of a contract is that there should be
persons or states having the capacity to contract
and to give force of law to their own agreement. Were the representatives of the provinces clothed with sufficient authority to draft
a new constitution and to bring it thenselves

into force?
He says they were not. And he goes on:
The desires and wishes of the colonies do not
Uke away fron an Imperial Act its formal
Laracter of law of an indisputable authenticity,
ni England aras froc to agree te the resolutions
r to disregard then entirely.
But Dr. Ollivier is flatly contradicted by
Hon. Mr. Veniot, who states that at the
London Conference the provinces of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick presented resolutions passed by their legislatures giving them
the right to enter into such a treaty or contract.
Now may I quote the opinion of Mr.
Woodsworth. He is the leader of a parliamentary party, and it is important that we
have his view. I am reading from the special
committee's report:
Mr. Woodsworth: May I ask Mr. Edwards
how he would answer this question: he suggests
that essentially the B.N.A. Act is an agreement
between the provinces, but it was between
certain of the provinces, the older provinces.
Sonie of us corne from the West, froua provinces
whicli were nt original provinces, but we think
that we have as îmuch part in the Deminion
to-day as anyone. Because of the provisions
in the Acts constituting each of the new provinces we eau no longer say that the B.N.A.
Act is an agreement between the provinces.
loin. Mr. MARCOTTE

On the question whether Canada is a
federation, I wish to refer again to the views
expressed by Lord Sankey in the Aeronautics
case:
Great care must therefore be taken to consider each decision in the light of the circumstances

of the case

in

view of which it

was

pronounced, especially in the interpretation of
an Act such the The British North America
Act, which was a great constitutional charter,
and not to allow general phrases to obscure
the underlying object of the Act, which was
to establish a system nf government upon
essentially federal principles. Useful as decided
cases are, it is always advisable to get back
to the words of the Act itself and to remember
the object with which it was passed.
In the Maritime Bank case, 1892 Appeal
Cases, Lord Watson said, at page 441:
The object of the Act was neither to weld
the provinces into one, nor to subordinate
provincial governnents to a central authority,
but te create a federal government in which
they should ail be represented, entrusted with
the exclusive administration of affairs in which
they had a common interest, each province
retaining ius independence and autonomy.
And Professer Kennedy, when before the
special committee, said:
Now, the first point I want to make is this:
We must keep strictly to the idea that we are
a federation; that is fundamental.
That we are a confederation is stated in
"Clements on the Canadian Constitution."
I have here a rather long passage, and to save
time I ask permission to place it upon Hansard:
Whether the tern "federal union" sh.ould, as
a matter of scientific aceuracy, be applied to
the Canadian Constitution is a question for
constitutional philoiogistS. It is a tern in fact
ced in our Act, as well as in the Australian

(oummonwealth Act, 1900(Whereas the people of New South Wales,

Queensland, and
Victoria, South Australia,
Tasninia, ium'lny relying on the blessing of
uniite in one
Ainîighty God. have agreed t
undissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the
Crown of the United Kingilin of Great Britain
the Constitution hereby
and ireland .and indei
established: . . . Be it therefore enacted... )--- to designate a union whicl, at all events,
w'as not to be a legislative union; not, in other
nords, a merger for ail purposes of government

as a legislative union nust be in any land under
the rule of law. Apart fron detail, the term
federaI union in these moden timnes implies an
agrernent between two or more comiuinities
which, as between thenselvos, are independent
and autonomous. Having arrived at a point
nwhere eommiunity of interest in certain matters
is recognized, they agree to commit all their
people to the control of one common government in relation to such iatters as are agreed
uipon as of common conceru, leaving each local
governmnit still independent and autononous
in all other matters. Moreover, and this is
ti point of difference most plainly discernible
between ancient and modern forms of federalisim, the contral or coiimion goverinment, upon
its establishment, is itsef independent and

JUNE 15, 1936
autonomous; it operates, as does each local government, upon the individual directly and not
through the medium of any other government.
See "The Federa-list," Nos. 15 and 16 (written
by Hamiton), in which it is shown how the
absence of this principle dn the "Articles of
Confederation" which preceded the present Constitution of the United States threatened a
dissolution of that conîfederacy. And, finally,
and as a necessary corollary in any land
governed by law, the whole arrangement constitutes a fundamental Jaw to be recognized in
and enforced through the agency of the courts.
The exact position of the line which is to
divide matters of common concern to the whole
federration from matters of local concern in
each unit is not of the essence of federalism.
Where it is to be drawn in any proposed
scheme depends upon the v.iew adopted by the
federating communities as to what, in their
actual circumstances, geographical, commercial,
racial, or otherwise, are really matters of conmon concern and as such proper to be assigned
to a common government.

But the maintenance

of the line, as fixed by the federating agreement, is of the essence of modern federalism;
at .east, as exhibited in the three great AngloSaxon federations of to-day, the United States
of America, the Commonvealth of Australia,
and the Dominion of Canada. Hence the Importance and gravity of the duty thrown upon
the courts as the only constitutional interpreters
of the organie instrument which contains the
fundamental law of the land. The line is descri'bed by metes and bounds, stated in very
genieral terms; and upon a broad, Jiberal, and
statesman-like interpretation of those terms,
clearly defining and yet reconcildng themn, the
stability of our institutions largely depends.
The aibove brief statement of general principles would seem to indicate as proper for
treatment in this chapter the following topies:
(1) the position of the courts in reference to
questions of legislative competency; (2) the
independence of each government, federal or
provincial, both as to degislative and executive
action and as to proprietary rights; (3) the
necessity in some cases for conjoint action to
effect desired resul-ts; and (4) the aid, if any,
to be obtained from United States and Australian deciaions.
One could quote indefinitely from judgments and writings, but these quotations are
sufficient to give an idea of the diversity of
opinions on the nature of our Constitution.
May 1, in great humility, give you now my
own views?
The British North America Act is more than
a contract or a treaty, more than a compromise
or an entente. It contains all the requisites
of these definitions, with something more.
There was in 1867 only one power great
enough to create this Confederation, to give
the different units the capacity to enter into
such a centract, te confirm that compromise,
to consecrate that entente, to ratify that
treaty. That power was the Imperial Government. After years of preparation, months of
discussion and some conferences, the provinces
brought to the Imperial Government the result of their deliberations in the form of reso-

501

lutions, and after further discussions and
amendments the Imperial Government enacted
the statute oalled the British North America
Act. It created a Constitution similar in
principle to the English Constitution, which
still is the model constitution for democracies.
Because it is similar in principle to the
Constitution of the United Kingdom, our Constitution is flexible and can be amended as the
need for change occurs. It has been amended
in the past and will be amended in the
future, but always with this reservation, unanimously assented to, that the rights of minoritics shall be protected. Without that protection Confederation would not have been
possible and could not be continued. The defence and protection of minorities' rights is
fundamental to the whole scheme of Confederation. In his memorandum to the conmittee Professor Scott, of McGill University,
defined these rights as legal, moral and
natural. It is a sane view. It is also
essential that the provinces give their consent
when the amendments concern them in any
way.
But if the Constitution needs amendment,
are we to continue to use the saie channel
as in the past-a joint Address by the Senate
and the Commons to the Crown for legislation
by the British Parliament? Or are we to
insist on making our own amendments?
Since the enactment of the Statute of Westminster we have controlling power over our
Constitution. We did not then secure the
right to amend it ourselves without the aid
of the Imperial Government. ln fact our
representatives requested that the status quo
be preserved. I quote from the report certain questions and the answers given by Mr.

Edwards:

By Mr. Bourassa:
Q. As a matter of fact, that reservation in
the Statute of Westminster referrin to Canada
was put there at the request of
nada?-A.
Yes.
Q. It is Canada which asks to be limited in ita
Constitution?-A. Yes.
Mr. Cowan: You mean the exception in regard
to amending the British North America Act?
Mr. Bourassa: Yes.
But is is claimed that this places Canada
mn a status of inferiority inconsistent with its
sovereignty. Dr. Ollivier states:
By the Statute of Westminster, passed on
the eleventh of December, 1931, Canada has
achieved its sovereignty. It would therefore
appear to every one supremely absurd and
inconsistent with our statua of equality with
other nations if we have not the right to amend
our constitution.
The Statute of Westminster, the Magna
Charta of our independence, has not granted
us that right. On the contrary it has enacted
that nothing therein contained "shall be deemed
to -apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration

SENATE

502

of the British North America Acts, 1867 to
1930. . . ." Section 7.
"Those who claim autonomy for Canada," says
Professor Keith, "naturally cannot acquiesce
in a position under which the supremacy of
the Imuperial Parliament is insistent and undeniable. A sovereign state whose constitution
can only be altered by another power is a
contradiction in adjecto."
(The Sovereignty of the British Dominions,
1929, p. 201.)
But he makes this admission:
The Witness: On the other hand, Canada
cannot at present directly amiend its own Constitution, but this fact, although inconsistent
with our present status, is not a demal of our
sovereignty, as this restriction exists by our
own will, and further because the power still
remains in the Federal Parliament of sayi
what amendments this country desires should
be made to the Constitution.
This bas been made amply clear by section
four of the Statute of Westminster, which
reads as follows:
"No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this
Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a
Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion,
unless it is expressly declared in that Act that
that Dominion lias requested and consented to
the enactiiient thiereof."
Later in his memorandum he states:
Then the other objection to allowing the
Constitution to remain as it is is that it lias
been said that that would bc inconsistent with
the sovereign status which Canada now enjoys
as a nation. On that point I am inclined to
agree with the suggestion made by Mr. Lapointe
in the House of Commons in 1931, in which he
suggested that there was nothing inconsistent
with out sovereignty in allowing the Imperial
Parliament to be the instrument of amending
the British North America Act in the future as
in the past.
By Hon. Mr. Mackenzie:
Q. Was that during the debate on the Statute
of Westminster?-A. Yes. If the legislation
is enacted at Westminster upon the request of
the Dominion authorities, then it is passed
because of the sovereign status of the Canadian
people. It is passed because of the recognition
of our status, and not in spite of it.
We are able to conclude from the foregoing that our presen:t position is satisfactory, and inconsistent neither with our
sovereignty nor with our freedom. We are
not placed in a state of inferiority. On the
contrary, we are the masters of our destiny.
The Statute of Westminster bas so provided.
Even if it should appear inconsistent with
our sovereign status as created by the Statute
of Westminster that we have to apply to the
Imperial authorities for necessary amendments instead of exerc'ising the power ourselves. is it advisable to make the change?
On this point let me quote from the
memorandum of Dr. Scott:
South Africa is a particularly interesting
example to us, I think, because that dominion
bas a racial problen and a minority problem
comparable or analogous to that in Canada;
and yet, after beginning with an Imperial

statute in 1909 as the basis of their constitution,
which contained special guarantees for minorities, special entrenched clauses, they have now
re-enacted that statute as their own constitutional Act, as a statute of their own parliamentI draw the attention of honourable members to this passage:
-and have thus destroyed the legal basis of
the safeguards for minorities which were found
in the earlier Act. The South Africans now
admit that the adoption by them, by their own
parliament, of their own constitution, puts it
into the category of an ordinary Act of Parliament in so far that in future it could be
changed legally by the procedure of an ordinary
Act. But they have stated in the debates and
discussions of that change that, where minorities
are protected, they will continue to respect that
protection, relying in future not on legal protection, but simply on one another. I feel that
if we ean aarree. at this juneture, to choose
flexibility, reasonable flexibility, rather than
rigidity. we shall, besides greatly simplifying
the whole process uf government, be stimulating
still further the development in Canada of that
spirit of trust and tolerance without which even
legal safeguards are of little value.

in stating that 85 per cent of the people in
every province of Canada have said: "To Hwith the British North America Act?" Is it
advisable to make the change in these days
of unrest, of distrust, of rising bad temper
in our population, to reopen the discussion
on old controversies, some of them mentioned
the other day by the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)
in his remnrkable address? Is it advisable
to make the change when we have the unfortunate evidence that the separate school
issue is not dead yet, and more troubles
are coming?
I claim that the time bas not come yet to
make the change. We are not hampered
in any way in securing needed amendments.

of life that has been vouchsafed to him. It
gives him a feeling of inspiration when he
thinks there has at least resulted a fair
measure of goodwill on the part of those
who know him. There was a great Englishman, never known as a philosopher, whose
one doctrine of life was that all living was of
value to the human being himself to the
degree to which be succeeded in bringing all his
work to bear to the advantage of his fellows;
in a word, that all that really mattered were
his relations with his fellow men. This also
was the doctrine, in relation to this life, of
the Founder of Christianity, and it is really
the essence of all sane philosophy.
When Samuel Johnson was asked what he
thought of Gray's Elegy, he answered that
there were only two stanzas worthy of attention. He quoted one, which expresses ny
feeling toward life:
For who. to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?
And then he said, "I forget the other."
This one verse, if it is really the expression of feeling of a man as he advances toward the evening, means that his life has
been and is worth while. Though Samuel
Johnson could remember only one verse, the
author spanned four ycars in writing the
poem. I will say that if I could have attained the sarne achievement in forty years,
I should have thought my life a success.
I thank the honourable leader of the Government and all who have joined in the
tribute of to-day. I only wish I were more
worthy of it.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN moved the third

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, as a result of conversations I
have had with a number of my colleagues, I
feel that there is not in this Chamber a
unanimous opinion in favour of the adoption of this measure at the present time, the
reason being that it concerns a matter which
is new to Parliament and new to public
opinion in this country. As I think I said
before, I know of countries that have had
free zones or free ports and seemed to be
satisfied with the manner in which they
I should have preferred, however,
worked.
that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) had raised this question in the form
of a motion instead of a Bill, se that the
matter could 'have been brought to the
attention of the countAry at large without the
necessity of the Senate expressing an opinion
upon it. But we must face tihe situation as
it is.
I know that what my honourable friend
had in ,mind was the education of the public with regard to the establishment of free
ports on the St. Lawrence, the Atlantic or

object, and as we are now faced with a
motion for the third reading of the Bill, I
think we should allow it to go to the House
of Commons as an expression of desire on
the part of this Chamber that the matter
be further studied, so that in a session to
come we may be able to deal with it with
some knowledge that an educational campaign has been carried on, and with the
feeling that there is a general consensus in

on the

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I
appreciate correctly, I hope, the stand taken
by the leader of the Government. While he
does not wish to commit himself definitely to
the practical embodiment of this Bill in the
Statutes, he is prepared to allow it to pass
this House so that the subject of it may be
discussed in the House of Commons. I do
not think the promoters of the measure
anticipate that it can possibly get through
the House of Commons this session. Under
these circumstances I am prepared to concur
in the motion for the third reading.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, in my judgment we shall be making
a mistake if, in connection with this Bill, we
do not take into consideration the advice
given to us from the experience of a distinguished Canadian. When the measure was
introduced in the House I could not see
any logic or consistency in it. I thought it
proposed an improper encroachment upon the
customs facilities of the Dominion of
Canada. However, after offering several
obstreperous suggestions, as I may call them,
I became one of the members of the committee on the Bill. There appeared before
the committee a distinguished gentleman, in
the person of Major George Washington
Stephens, who, in respect of this matter, converted me to the belief that there might be
something of importance and benefit to the
Dominion of Canada in what was proposed,
and I want to place before the House a very
brief extract of his remarks which brought
about this conversion. He said:
A free port area affords concentrated timesaving facilities for loading, unloading, ware-

housing, manufacturing, sorting, storing of
merchandise, processing from the raw material
to the finished product, with a minimum of
formality and restriction, which popularizes
the port in the hearts of ship captains and
enhances its prestige among ship owners and
traders. It relieves traders from the application of eustoms formalities and payment of
duties until the goods pass out of the free
zone for consumption within the country itself. It enables goods to be re-exported to
foreign markets without the payment of any
customs duties whatever. It has the additional advantage of attracting large masses of
cargo for storage, awaiting re-export and
redistribution as market conditions warrant.
It permits the arrival of bulk cargoes for
sorting, grading and reshipment in part lots
to different markets at different times, duty
being paid only on each of the lots as it
de parts.
The assembly of mass cargoes in one place
makes for sure return cargoes for ship and
rail, and makes possible lower transportation
rates.
By increasing the volume of the port's business a free port area increases the customs
revenue of the country.

Free port areas are not experiments.

They

have been established to capture trade, and
are nothing more than huge bonded ware-

housing districts, relieved of customs restrictions and formality, strategically planned to

save time, reduce handling costs and supply
cargoes.
The proof of their value is to be found in
the range of their existence, their periodic
extension, their popularity, the prosperity of
the ports where tbey exist, their dividendpaying qualities, and their permanency once

adopted.

They are to be found as going con-

cerns of long standing in Germany, Denmark,
Sweden, Spain, Italy.
It seems to me that Major George Washington Stephens sized up the situation and
expressed in comparatively few words the
advantages that might be derived from the
adoption of free zones, and I think that any
discussion of this subject should contain an
expression of his views.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

HARBOURS

BOARD

BILL

THIRD READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the motion for the third
reading of Bill 17, an Act respecting the Na-

tional Harbours Board.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, as I intimated on a previous
occasion,

described,

before this Bill receives its third
should like to put myself on record
to its principle. As we al know,
terminal harbours, if they may be so
have been under the control of local

harbour boards subject to the supervisionary
check of the Department of Marine. The purpose of this measure is to establish at Ottawa
a single harbour board which shall have supervision over a specific number of the harbours
of our country-by no means all-and shall
undertake to operate them from this central
point, using merely as local agents men to
be appointed and known as port managers. I
incidentally mention that harbours heretofore
known as "Dominion harbours," under the
control of the Marine Department-notably
the harbour of Sorel-are not included in the
measure. Other than the fact that the Public
Works Department bas administered the barbour of Sorel, whereas the Marine Department bas had charge of the others, there is no
distinction that I know of between Sorel and
the harbours coming within the ambit of the
Bill.
Some two or three years ago the late Gov-

ernment asked Sir Alexander Gibb to investigate the whole problem of the management of our harbours. Though a distinguished
engineer, he was not experienced as a harbour
manager. In his very extensive report, while

there Nsa sort of oblique recommandation of
seine organization like this central management, there is ne dafinite and understandab]e
recommandation: tha statement as ta what
lie fait was best for this country is more or
less ainhiguons.
Nevertbelass, taking the
terras ut the Gibb report, one can justify
sometbingý je the nature of the present
measure. The Bill now before us passed the
Hoiî;c of Commons aiter some criticism, but
without any vary definite objection. Under
these cirrcumitances, even tbougb mv opinion
migbt be more antagonistie than it is, I sbould
net feel tbat tbis House was justified ie
defeating tbe measure.
In tbe Sonate. and more particularly je
aur committee, a very important discussion
lias takcen place on tbe wbale principle of
tbe rncasure. That discussion, from tbe critical
standpoiut, bias been led by tbe bonourable
senator, framn Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Raieville), wbo enjoys the advantage of baving

required ta take examination. _Now, at eacb

JUNE 16, 1936
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps some
honourable member can answer the question
asked by my honourable friend from Parkdale.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, in my opinion the amendment to this
Bill will prove contrary to the interests of
the ports. Every one of the ports has in its
employ somne men of very specialized training.
1 will give you one instance. At the Montreal
elevators tbere is a Mr. Peterson, who is the
chief specialist on grain, and though he is
seventy-five years of age he cannot be replaced. For some years an effort has been
made in vain to find a younger man who
would in time become a qualified successor
of Mr. Peterson. I believe that the Civil
Service amendment ivili not benefit the port
of Montreal nor any other port.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 was opposed
to this amendment to the Bill, but a majority
of the committee decided in favour of it.
The committee's report having been brought
in, I allowed it to pass on division, and now
we are at the third reading. It will be for the
House to decide as to the value of the argument that has been made at the last bour.
At thjs stage 1 desire only lx> say a few
words as to. the merits of the Bill. An honourable member of the committee asked what was
the und'erlyinýg principle of the measure. I
answered that it was based on these facts:
the ports of Canada are the property of the
Dominion; they are largely financed by the
Dominion; they form part of the wh'ole system of transportation in Canada, and it is
in the interest of the general policy of transportation that authority should be centralized.
We have been told that there was rivalry between ports, resulting in rate cutting which
affected the returns of ail the ports, and that
unified direction is necessary in the general
interest of commerce all over Canada. I
believe this principle has been. accepted almost
unanimously in another place. Sir Alexander
Gibb expreased an opinion to the saine effect,
and indicated various formnulae for the carrying out of this ýprin-ciple. What we are now
dealing with is a plan for centralized administration by the authority which owns the
ports and is seeking to develop them, and
it is the same authority that is entrusted with
control over trade and commerce throughout
the country.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: May I make a
correction? Any cutting of rates by ports
was done by the acting Minister of Marine
at -Ottawa. According to the by-laws, approved by the Governinent, no commission
could have reduced rates except by authority
of Ottawa.

507

Right Hon. M.r. MEIGHEN: Hoanourable
me.mbers, I do not want to allow the case
for the amendinent made by the committee
to go by default. I thoroughly approved of
that amendment and 1 want to give the
reasons why. It merely states fVhat in respect
of permanent employees of harbours the Civil
Service Commission shahl have the saine jurisdiction as it has in every other branch of
the Public Service, no more and no less. It
bas no authority in respect of labour or
t-emporary employees. I have yet to hear
a reason suggested why the Civil Service
Commission should be ousted from such jurisdiction in respect of the operation of harbours
any more than in respect of many of the
other activities carried on by the numerous
departments of Goveroment. The committee
took the saine attitude.
In view of the evidence given before the
committee by Mr. Bland, Chairman of the
Civil Service Commission, I amn unable to
see how anyone ca.n have premonitions or
fears as to how the Civil Service Commission
wil actuallly supervise. He stated dellnitely
that in the dischairge of the obligation imposed upon it the commission would endeavour first of ail Vo provide against any
interruption of the public service, and to that
end would confer with the new National Harbours Board at Ottawa and take account of
the va-rions officiais now performinýg duties
of more or less importance at the nrespective
harbours. He went on to say the commission
would give consideration to the experience
of and work done by thýose officials, as well as
ahl the recommendations in their favour, and
that there was no systein of cut and dried
examinationi that had to be applýied. In
short, he assured the committee that experience and qualifiation-merit, andh nothing
else-would be taken inito account. In these
circuinstances why should we have fears?
As to the dispatceh that went from Ottawa
to a newspaper, anyone who bas been in
public life as long as I have been knows what
significance attaches to such statements. They
are simply part of a propaganda. I particuharly remember certain dispatches which
passed to a certain Montreal newspaper in
the late days of 1921, and whose falsehood"
were as bhlack and filthy as any that ever
went from one spot on earth to another, over
wire or clothes-line. I do not ascribe to thîs
recent dispatch anything of the abhorrent
character of the others, which I mention
simply as an illustration. Do not think because some newspaper considers it worth while
to cast suspicions abroad for its own end
that the systein devis-ed by Parliament after

SENATE
long years of debate and trial is necessarily
wrong.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman this question?
Does he hold that if the Bill as now amended
passes, all the employees of the Montreal
and other harbour commissions will be confirmed in their positions, and that the Civil
Service Commission will fill only such vacancies as may occur from time to time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Civil
Service Commissioners take the job in hand,
and on the information they get from the
harbour commission and its superior officers,
if they find a man's job is necessary and he
is competent, they approve of his staying
there. If they find bis job is not necessary,
or he is not a good man, they let him out.
But in letting anybody out they are careful
to avoid any disturbance of the publie service.
Therefore the men now employed wilî be
retained, if fitted for their jobs, and presumably most of them, if not all, will be retained
until unfitness is proved and better men are
found to ýtake their places. I am giving in
my cwn words what I understood to be the
purport of Mr. Blands evidence before the
Senate committee. I think the honourable
senator from Parkdale was present and, heard
the evidence.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think I have misinterpreted Mr. Bland's evidence at all.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, if I understand the Civil Service regulations with regard to dismissal, I think it is
the prerogative of the department concerned.
I think that was the rule when, some years
ago, the Civil Service Commission was first
placed in control of the Civil Service. The
employees then engaged were blanketed in,
and the commission was only to carry on
from that date, under the rules of the Civil
Service Act. But in this case, if I understand aright, the effect of the amendment
we have made to the Bill will be to throw
out of employment all those now employed,
and if they are reinstated they will have to
corne under the regulations of the Civil
Service Commission. I think my .right honourable friend will not contend that that
was the rule followed for the Service generally when the Civil Service Commission was
first established. It is hardly fair to apply
a different rule now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill
does not throw anybody out of employment,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

but it does place the positions in the hands of
the Civil Service Commission, and the commission acts on the principles defined by the
chairman, Mr. Bland.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The positions, but
not the disposition of the employees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. In the
disposition of the employees the Civil Service
Commission acts on the principles which Mr.
Bland explained before -the committee. and
which I have sought to restate to the House.
When the present appointments are confirmed,
or any changes are made which. after consultation with the Minister, the Civil Service
Commission thinks fit, then the power of dismissal is solely with the commission which
the Government will' appoint. It is not with
the Civil Service Commission at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The port manager.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; under
the Bill it is with the Harbours Board
entirely. It was intended to define certain
powers of the port manager, but, as the honourable member will recall, the committee decided after debate not to define the duties.
So the power of dismissal will be entirely with
the Harbours Board.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I desire to put
a question which I had intended to put in
the committee. IUnfortunately I was unable
to be present when the Bill was under discussion there. I am not clear as to what
authority the port manager will have.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nobody is.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: But that is
important. The port is to be managed by
the port manager. What will be bis authority over the employees?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bill is
silent on that. The amendment defining bis
authority was either defeated or abandoned
-I forget which-but word was brought to
us from the Minister that he would tolerate
no such definition.

for a measure with but one purpose.' It governs the taking of the vote et Dominion
by-elections, and is in conformity with the
recommendations of the special committee of
the House of Commons.
It was deemed
opportune to set up some machinery fo.r byelections. Such elections within the coming
year could have been held on the basis of the
old lists, but it wes suggested in the flouse
of Commons thet legisiation sbould be passed

Bill as a consequence of which we might well
amcnd this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
reed the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand. the
Senat.e went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Murdock in the Chair.
On section 2-amendments to appby in the
case of by-elcctions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
This is a
most extraordinary clause. I neyer before
saw a hill conteinîng e clause w.hich stated
wbat the bill did not do. Bills are usualby
confined to stating what they shahl do. Why
such a clause as this?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, this
is an extraordinary piece of begisbation. In
order not to disturb in the beast the Dominion
Ebections Act of 1934, it bas apparcntly been
deemcd opportune to, put in tbis clause.

On section 3-by-elections:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It seems to

The words "shall apply as if further amended

are not usual.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not like

Ho.
Me. DANDURAND:
There is an
anendm-ent which will have to be moved to
this fm. air. in the sane words, to forms
Nos. 42 and 43. I would ask my right honuanlhe friend to my right (Right Hon. Mr.
Grahtuan) to mioe that in form No. 19, after
the words "that you have continued to be
resident in tiis electoral district since the
said date," the following be inserted:
until (naming the date of the issue of the
writ of election).
Righ: Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
word "an'd should b inserted before "until."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I doubt it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The meaning
wouild b the sane with or wiýthout "and,"
but it awould be a little clearer with that
word.
The CHAIRMAN: Since this Bill deals
with by-elections, should not the prefix "by-"
be inserted in the amendment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I sec the
bonourable senator's point. But in the case
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of a by-election one always speaks of a "writ
of election" and not of a "writ of by-election."
So I think the proposed amendment would
be all right.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: By adding the suggested words should we not be shortening
the period of residence? If I understand it
correctly, as the form reads now the voter
must necessarily be resident in the district
on the day of polling, when he presents himself to vote. That is, he must have been
resident there from three months before the
issue of the writ and unitil the polling day.
But that would not be necessary under this
amendment, for he would be able to qualify
if he had been resident there merely for three
months prior to the date of the issue of
the writ.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman may be more familiar with
the situation than I am. Does he say that to
qualify under the Dominion Elections Act a
voter must have been a resident of the district at least from three months before the
issue of the writ until the very day of the
election?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Until polling day.
That is the wav the form would read without the proposed amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not
sufficient if he has been a resident from three
months before the issue of the writ up ta the
date of the issue of the writ?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Well, that would be
sufficient under this amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would it not
be suilicient under the present law?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I thought a voter
had to be a resident on the day of polling.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should not like
to make any change in this amendment, because we shall bave the same amendment to
the Franchise Bill, which is to come up later.
The chairman of the special comnmittee
appointed to deal with this matter made
that statement to the Law Clerk of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Can the honourable
leader tell me whether the view I have stated
of the present Act is correct?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might pass
this amendment now, and when the Bill
comes up for third reading to-morrow we
shall have the FranchiSe Bill before us.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I move the

The proposed amendment was agreed to,
and Form No. 43 as amended was agreed to.
Form 44 was agreed to.
The preamble was agreed to.
On the title-An Act to amend The
Dominion Elections Act, 1934 (Dominion Byelections):
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My attention
has been called to the fact that there is no
such Act as "The Dominion Elections Act,
1934 (Dominion By-elections)."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The titie is
wrông. As the honourable leader has pointed
out, there is nosuch Act as "The Dominion
Elections Act, 1934 (Dominion By-elections) ."
So, there is no. such Act to be amended. There
is a Dominion Elections Act, 1934, and if the
purpose of this Bi-ll were te amfend that Act
the- titie should stop with "1934V But that
is noV the purpose at ail, for that Act will
remain juat asit is af.ter this Bill passes.
Thia Bill k.lVo provide for by-elections, and

it does so by saying that in the case of a
by-election the Dominion Elections Act shahl
apply, subject to certain changes. I cannot
understand how this titie got through the
House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What title would
you suggest?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would suggest "An Act to provide for Dominion Byelections."' The first clause of the Bill, the
short titie, will not have to be changed. I
move that the titie be changed accordingly.
The proposed amcndment was agreed to,
and the title as amended was agreed to.
The Bihl was reported, as amended.
CANADA

SHIPPING BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 53, an Act to amend the
Canada Shippîng Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable members, I need not
give any lengthy explanation of the reasons
for these amendmrents to the Canada Shipping
Act. I wouhd simply ask that the Bill he
read a second time and refcrred to the Bank-.
ing and Commerce Commîttee, where the
various amending clauses may be considered
in detail.
]Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I have examin-ed the Bill, and
certainly feel it should be referred Vo the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. There
are many details, but in the main the Bill
empowers the Minister to include under the
expression "miner waters of Canada" such
waters on the sea coa.sts of Canada as he may
consider comparable with the miner waters
described in the Shipping Act, and thus to
permit masters holding certificates for miner
waters to navigate ships in certain sheltered
waters on the sea coasts. Those of us who
live inland will not know much about the
merits of the B-ih until it is explained by
maritime members -of the eommittee.
The motion was àgreed Vo, and the Bill was
read the second time.

sion nlot only for the purpose of making an
exhaustive study of the problemns of unemployed returned soldiers, but also for the
purpose of trying to find thema employment.
To this end local voluntary co-operative coinmittees are to be formed. The commission is
to co-ordinate and co-operate with the
National Employment Commission, which is
unemployment
throughout
now studying
Canada. The termi of the commissioners is to
be one year, but this may be extended for six
months.
The sum of $500,000 bas been set aside to
enable the commission to carry on its activities.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One's heart
sinks at the sight of bis to establisýh new
commissions coming before us wieek after
week. I wonder wherein the probiem of
finding employment for a returned man differs
from the probiem of finding employment for
anyone else. Is flot the very samne problema
now before the National Employment Commission? I complimented the Government
on the man it had seiected to be the hcad of
that commission te, study the whole question
of unemployment in Canada. If he cannot
make a success of the work, I do not know
anybody in the Dominion who can. At the
samne time I am not very hopeful that even
hie will get very far, practicaliy speaking.
In the National Employment Commission
Bill there is aIl manner of provision-utterly
unnecessary, I know-for the appointment.
first, of an advisory committee to advise the
main commission, and then of sub-committees
of the advisory committee.
One sub-committee is to study and report on the question
of women's employment. as if this could not
be done just as well without statutory provision. Another sub-comniittee is to study and
report with recommendations about youth
employment. But by some mysterious lapse
the Government forgot all about veterans'
employment, and so it bas to present this
Bill.
Does it not give one a headache?
Nobody can be more keenly interested than
honourable senators in getting veterans and
everyone else employed. But why have this
and that commission studying and reporting
on what fundamcntaily is the samne question?
There mnay be some littie difference in dealing
with disabled men, but that is the only
difference.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Bill embodies the
recommendations of the royal commission
appointed two years ago.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I know. But
we could have placed the whole subj ect
under one commission. Here we have a Bill
to establish another commission. We shahl

commissions, sub-divisions

Well, I suppose we are reaching the stage
where debt does not have to be paid anyway.
So what is the difference?

to, and -the Bill

Right Hon. MT,. MEIGHEN: Is this really
the right titie? As the honourable Minister
told us, the purpose of the Bill is to establish a commission. I suppose the Prime Minister b-ename rather ashamed of the terni
"commission" amd decided to, omit it from
the cover of this Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not follow the work of the committee in the other
Huse, but I -have been advised of the representations made there. The condition of
thousands of veterans is really pitiable.

We

know what they did for Canada across the
seas. They were deemed entitled te special
treatment, -and under this Bill their needs wilh
be given careful study.
MOTION FOR CONSIDERATION IN COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING moved that the Senate go
into Committee on this Bill.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHF.N: Let us think
over this Bill' intil to-mo>rrow. I have not
had time to read what was said about it in
the other bouse. Really it is awful to think
we are to keep on e.nacting this kind of legislation.
The Bill is entitled, "An Act to, assist
towards the Employment of former Members
of the Forces." It is nothing -of the sort;
it is Teally a Bill to appoint a commission

to study the subjeot of providing work for
unemployed veterans, although already we
have established a gigantic commission to
obtain employment for everybody, incltiding
the unemployed veteran.
The Bill provides that the commission
s-hahl consist of thýree commissioners, who. shal
hold office for one year, and this termi may be
extended for another six months. There is
to be a chairman. There will be remuneration: that could have gone without saying.
The head office will be here, the cost to be
provîded by t.he country.
The duties of the commission are set out in
clause 6. Will honourable mem-bers kindly
keep their mindýs attuned to the provisions of
the other Em.ployment Commission Bill,
which we had bef ore us in the early part of

JIJNE 16, 1936
the session, and see if they can nlot detect its
very tone and tenor in ithis Bill? I do flot
think there is a change of a, word.
The Commission shall,
(a) carry out as soon as possible an investigation to ascertain the extent of unemployment among veterans in Canada, and
classify those who, are unemployed according
to physical and mental capacity or incapacity

to undertake gainful employment in restricted

and unrestricted occupations, and in any other
categories, which, after the investigation, the
Commission may consider applicable(b) investigate and report upon mnethods at
present utilized for the purpose of prvdin
employment for veterans, particularly hvand'icapped and disabled veterans;
(c) investigate and report upon proposals
leading to the development of further agencies
and schemes to provide for a speedy absorption
of as înany veterans as possible into employment.
It is wonderful how many different ways
there are of saying the saine thiag.
(d) investigate and report on the possibility
of re-establishing in gainful occupations handicapped and disabled veterans who are inc1apable of being absorbed into industrial employment, by the development of small holdings,
community centres, and by such other methods
as may be deemed practicable.
Ah -of which. could -be done unde- the Bill
passed somne time ago.
(e) investigate into existing facilities for
the care and maintenance of veterans while
unemployed and report thereon with such
suggestions or recommendations as may be
deemed advisable.
Now, will hionourable members please listen
to this?
(f) co-ordinate and co-operate with the
National Employment Commission in efforts
towards the registration, classification and
employment of veterans.
So endeth that apecific lEt of duties---ll a
repetition of the Bill we paased about four
months ago.

Now I come to the honorary local committee in clause 7:
The Commission, with the approval of the

Minister, may appoint honorary local committees composed of persona resident in any
locality willing(a) to assist the Commission in obtainjng
information relating to veterans which may be
required for the classfication of unemployed
veterans.

I venture to say that the chwsiication under
the different d-epartments which have been
supervising this work for the hast fifteen years
is complete in every particular. Ail you
bave te do je go to the recorder and get the
iiifortnation.

.(b) to investigate and report to the Commission Upo measures and means in respect
te the e p oynmet oif veterans.

515

There muet have been a struggle te draw
out the Bill to this hength.
(c) to assist the Commission in enlistinq
the co-operation of employers' and employees
associations as well as of sucli other public
and private agencies as may be in a position
to provide employment for veterans;
(d) to aid the Commission in any other way
in carrying ont the provisions of this Act.
Then in clause 9 there are two suggestions
for co-operation:
(1) The Commission shail investigate and
report to the Minister upon ways and means
of co-operation between the Commission and
(a) any other commission or departmnent of
the Government,
(b) any provincial government or agency
thereof,
(c) any veterans' association
(d) any commercial, agricuitural or industrial group or organization.
In subsection 2 it je told again to co-operate:
The Commission shaîl, subject to the approval
of the Minister, co-operate with any commission, departmnent, government agency, association, gronp or organization referred to in subsection one of this section.
Such je this Bill t-hat we are to pass with
serions mien.

Hon. Mr. RING:

The Bill came fromn a

special committee of the House of Commons,
andi no donbt it was drafted under the direction of that committee. In regard te my
right 'hononrable friend's suggestion that the
work of the proposed commission miglit be
done by the larger commission that lias recently been appointed, we have since the

Great War alwaye made an exception for oui'
returned- soIdiere. This bas been the under..
lying principle of our legislation. For instance,
to facilitate their entry into the Civil Service
exceptions are made eil along the line.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

make exceptions?

Hon. Mr. RING: The Hyndman report
very definitely recommends that a commission of ths character should be set up.

Hon. Mr. KING: No; but there would
have been sharp criticism if the Government

PENSION BILL
SECOND

Act.

He said: This is another Bill from a special
committee of the House of Commons which
made inquirios into suggested amendmonts to
the Pension Aet. One of the arnendmoents will
increaso the pension bonofits that may be
recoiv cd, but another amendment bas a lirniting cffoct. I arn informed by the officers of

increase in the expcnditure. The Bill is of
the character that from time to time we receivo from special committees which have
heard evidence and madle carefu] inquiry of
returned soldiers' organizations and other persons who may sec fit to appear. The Bill, I

Last year we paid ont
$850,000 in retroactive pensions, and I fancy
that was not by .any means the largest sum
paid out in any one year. I tbiink the bouse
may anticipate somo saving frein this clause
of the Bill alone.
Now I pass to sectinn il of the Bill, wbich
wihh be found un page 6. This section imposes
a limitation as to dates of application. In
the past a man could. apply for pension at
any time-anti men bave been applying since
dernobilization in 1919. ln addition to limiting
the date of application this section divides
n wbo did
ex-service, mon into two classes:
not serve in a thoatre of war, and mon wbo
did. A man wbo did not serve in a theatre
of wvar cannot apply for a pension after tbe
Ist of July, 1936. A man who did serve in a
thopatre of war bas until the lst of January,
1940; but it is provided that a man who
served in a tleatreo f war may, hy consent
of the commission, hav e bis claim admitted
for consideration after tbat date. This clause
is a salient feature of the Bill, and it is a
now feature of our pension law, in that it
fixes a date after wbîcb application shahl net
ho reeived.
Then at pages il and 12 of the Bill there

is provision fer limiting tbe enumeration of
disabilities on tbe- second hearing, and for
the consolidiatio.n of all dlaims, whicb therealter he-come bi.nding on -the. applicant. A
mian is prevented from apfflying for pension
with respect to a disability for wbicb a pension
bais been refused, and ho makes a fresbi application respecting ýanothor disability, witb fresb
e vide nce.
Another ýinteresting feature is t, ho fou.nd
in section 14 of the Bill, on page 7, which
deals with the question of commuted pensions.
About 1922 or 1923 provision was

macle for the commutation of pensions with.in
a certain range-to 15 per cent, I Vhink-and
a man oiouhd taice a fixed sum of money and
retire from pension. Ahthough that legishatien was asked for by the men themsehves,
I thoug'ht it very unwise, and it was not
long before it was proved to ho. The questien aroee whet4'er the disability: had in-

JUNE 16, 1936
creased- in thie meanwhile. It was finally
enacted that a man wbho had commuted bis
pension might corne baek later and be placed
upon pension as of the date of commutation,
provided that his disability had not grown
less, and that he repaid to the Government
the amount of the commutation wvhich he
had received. He paid 'bis commutation out
of t.he accumulated pension. If a man took
bis comimutation, say, in 1925, and carne back
in 1935 and was reinstated, his disability havî.ng inareased in the meantime, hie accuinulated pension from thie date of commutation
would be greater than the amount of the
commutation itself. Consequenltly ie would
stili have a substantial sum coming to him.
By section 14 of tlhe Bill the provision for
tihe restioration .of pension is continued, but
it is provided that. upon the pension bei-ng
restored, its recommencement shall be limited t.o a period of six mont-hs from the date
of the application. Under tii requirement
the amou2t, paid by way of commutation
is wiped out. During the blard times many
men applied for restoration, especialIy those
whose disabil'it;ies had increased; and it ia
estimated tihat this provision wil1 effect a
substantial saving.
Wi.thin the next year or so honourable
membera may hope to see the fruits of the
sections to whic'h I have reiferred, in the
form of a redueed exponditure wtb respect
to these particular items.
The rest of the Bill consista of a clarification of the la'w, and a simplification and
speeding up of the procedure, which, it is
hopcd, will resuit in a reduction of the
cost of administration.
I do not think I can add anything.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

father played an outstanding part at the time
of Confederation. I wish ta offer my sincere
personal tbanks flot only ta bim, but also ta
the honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), and the bonourable senator from Gloucester (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon), who, if I may say so, bave brought
ta us the wisdom of the past. I wish ýta
acknowledge also my obligation ta my bonourable friend from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr.
Bourgeois) and] my honourable iriend fromn
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) for their splendid survey af modern interpretations of aur
Constitution. If anytbing bas been established
by the arguments of ýthese bonourable gentlemen and the numerous and weighty authorities
they have eited, it is that, first of ail,
Coniederation is a contract, and, secandly,
that it cannat be amende'] witbaut the consent
of all the legislatures. The statement of a
fundamental principle of that kind would
almost appear supcî'fluous in this Hotse.
Considerable reference lias been made ta the
report of the special commit.tee name'] in
another place last year ta inquire ino the
best metho'] of amending aur Constitution.
I mu.st admit that when I read statements
made before that committee by men ai learnmng. bigh intellectual attainments and great
ability, that Confederation was flot a cantract,
1 was very much astonishie'.
Some of tbem
went sa far as ta say that bath from bistorical
and constiltutional standipoints the British
North Amorica Act must be considere'] fot as
a cantract. but as a statute.
Honourable
senators will immediately realize how fundamentally es- ential it is ta determine whetber
that is true or flot. If the British North
America Act is nothing but a statute, it mnay
be amended like any other statute. witbout
the partie; thereto baving much or anytbing
to say. If it is a contract, the situation is
altogetber different, for under common law it
cannot be amende'] unless the parties thereto
are agreeable.
Now, honourable senators, is it not, a fact
that the British North America Act is bath a
statute and a contract?
0f course it is a
staýtute.
But why was it passe']?
It was
passed purely and simply ta give constitutional
effect ta the compact that ha'] been agreed
upon by the provinces at the time of Confedieration.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

May I cite by way of analogy something
that is a commonplace occurrence in the
province af Quebec?
If a persan in my
province wants ta make a donation the law
imposes upon bim the obligation of daing
sa by notarial deed, and sbould. he attempt
ta do it other-wise there would be no legal
contract. If bath the donator and the beneficiary are in agreement, the one ta give and
the ather ta receive, tlhey appeýar before a
notary, wba registers their consent and expresses it in legal phraseology. There would
be no donation if there were nat an the
ana side tbe consent ta give and an the
ather side the consent ta receive. Transactions ai that kind are taking place every
day in my province. For instance, a farmer
who has grown aId transfers everything he
owns ta bis eldest son, subject ta specifie
conditions, tbe son agreeinig ta serve bis
father in certain respects. There yau have
ail the elements required for a contract, an']
the only tbing necessary ta give it legal
effect is a notarial dca'].
At the time of Confederation the variaus
sections ai the country wbicb desired ta enter
ino union appeale'] ta tbe Imperial Parliament for a statute. Tbey ail ha'] agreed ta
a compact and signe'] it, but that compact
ha'] no constitutional existence until the
British North America Act was passed. Therefore it seems ta me tbat aur Constitution
is no lass, a contract than it is a statute.
AIl those wbo participate'] in the bringing
about ai Confederatian stata'] time an'] time
again that it was a cantract, a compact, the
result af agreement nmang nîl parties. That
bas been made clear by the aider members
who bave spoken in this debate. And ever
since 1867 the same x iew lias generally been
taken in Parliament by bath palitical parties.
There was a further recognition ai it in the
last Dominion-Provincial Conference, wben it
was acknowledgad that aIl the provinces bave
n rigbt ta be consulted in any propose'] amendment ta tba Act.
And bere may I say that I suppose as a
result ai the recent Dominion -Provincial Confer-ence there are at present in every provincial Attorney-General's Department specialists working on a formula ai amendmant. If
I arn rigbt, we may expect next sessionand tbat is not very far away-a maya on
the part ai the Government ta submait the
formula wbicb is now in tbe making. Therafore this question, wbich appeared at flrst ta ha

Hlouse who thinc, as I do, that Canada sliould
flot have power to amend its own Constitution, I Say the hour is close at hand when
thle battie will have to he faught-in our own
Parliament, first of ail-to determine whether
we shall maintain things as they have been
since Confederation or enter into a new era.
which, as I see it, would be full of anxiety,
trouble and danger.
Let us make no mistake: the gentlemen
behind the new idea now being fostered
througliout the country and prepared for suhmission to Parliament are no ordinary men.
They are politically men ofoutstanding position. Why, honourable senators, the Prime
Minister is one of them; lie has 80 declared in
the House of Commons. The Minister of
Justice is one of them; he has time and again
acknowledged. himslf in favour of such a
change in respect of our Constitution. There
are other gentlemen-indeed I might venture
to state there are other Ministers, and perhaps there are even very eminent gentlemen
within sound of my voice, converteil to this
id-ea.
Tliey are men absoluteiy above
reproacli and animated, no doulit, by patriotic
sentiments.
It is only fair to add that these gentlemen
cannot be suspected of any desire whatsoever
of liaving this country secede from. the British
Empire. There are two very cllear and
forcible reasons for this. First, if tliey did
accomplish their purpose the situation in this
country would flot lie changed. If Canada
should obtain the riglit to mould lier Constitution with lier own hands, there would flot
lie a cubit added to the stature of lier
sovereignty. She would remain wliat she is.
She would flot be, any freer than she is
to-day. Everybody knows that we can use
the very samne power witli respect to the
British North America Act by applying to
the British Parliament. Therefore, I repeat,
nothing would lie changed. If by acquiring
this power ourseives we should weaken the
Britishi Empire, then it must. lie concluded
that the Empire is in a very serious pliglit.
Every Dominion except Canada lias the
power to amend its own Constitution; therefore, if the effort to obtain sucli power is a
step towards secession from the British
Empire, the British Empire must surely lie
liastening to disslution.
The eminent men to whom I have referred
are to be f ound not only in politics, but at
the liead of our universities. The investigation made hy the special committee lias revealed a surprising unanimity of opinion in
respect to the proposition submitted to the
Dominion-Provincial Conference a f ew montlis
ago. May I mention partioulariy Dr. Skel-

619

ton, a very able man, -of broad culture and
unquestioniable patriotismn. Therefore let us
not. minimize the power and influence of
those who wouid. like to mee these ideas
adopted first of ail, I suppose, by Parliament,
and then by the provincial legislatures.
The best way to ineet the situation, in my
opinion, is to see whether their reasons justîfy
their stand. How do. they expect to obtain,
and by what formula do they expeet to use,
the power of amendment whieh they seek?
Honourable members, the first reason given
by the men of high standing whom I have
mentioned to justify Canada acquiring that
power is that our Constitution is inflexibl'e,
rigid, petrified--ossified, if you like. I dispute
tliat assertion. True, our Constitution cannot be changed without the consent of the
contracting parties. But between that condition and the assertion that our Constitution
is inflexible there is the widest difference in
the world. The Constitution is so made as
to be adaptable to new conditions. It
expands, so to speak, as conditions expand
throughout the country. Our Constitution
lias been framed with sueli wisdom that in
it there is a balance wheei, and when a need
which is peculiar to a province expands and
becomes national, then the power to meet
that need passes from the province to the
May I quote on this very
Dominion.
important point the testimony given by a
very capable public servant., Mr. Edwards,
the Deputy Minister of Justice? Wlien
before tlie special committee of the House
of Commons lie said:
A good deal lias been said about the failure
of the Fathers of Confederation to anticipate
the necessity whicli miglit arise for the amendment of the Constitution. Personally I do
not think that they failed to anticipate such
necessity; but I think they deliberately framed
the Constitution so as to make it subject to
expansion by its own ternis as the needs and
as the problems of the country develop. In
Borne of the self-governing Dominions and in
other countries where a federal system prevails, there are fixed provisions for the amendment of their Constitution; but in most, if
flot all, of those countries tlieir constitutions
are not similar to ours in this respect, that
the residuary powers rest with the states and
flot with the central authority as it does in
Canada. Therefore I think that the Fathers
of Confederation deliberately provided a
scheme wliereby ahl matters that are essentially national in their scope would be within
the exclusive competence of Parliament. They
did that by vesting in the Dominion Parliament tlie residuary power and in giving to
the provinces tlieir legisfative powers they
were very careful to make it clear that the
legislative jurisdiction of the provinces was
not, in any case, to extend beyond matters
and rights situate in the province itself,
matters of purely provincial or local concern.
Now, 1 need not go through ail the enumerated heads of jurisdiction, but if you glane.

520

SENATE

down to what is the main item of provincial
jurisdiction, property and civil rights, you
will find that while the expression "property
and civil rights" is one of very, very particular designation, they were very, very careful to say it was property and civil rights
in the province. Therefore if at any time in
the development of Canada a matter ceases
to be a matter of property and civil rights
in the province, it clearly belongs to the
Dominion under the residuary power for the
good government of Canada, which is found in
section 91. I suggest therefore that the committee might well consider allowing the matter
of the amendment of the British North
America Act to proceed as it has proceeded
in the past, and leave the effect of what has
been done to the determination of the courts,
thereby avoiding all the difficulties and differences which might arise if any effort were
made to fix a precise method of amending
the Constitution so as to reopen that balance
of power which was so carefully provided at
the time, and which has worked, in my judgment, very satisfactorily up to the present
time.
Another gentleman, Mr. Ollivier, a legal
official attached to the House of Commons,
said:
In his statement before your special committee the Deputy Minister of Justice indicated that the object of the resolution now
before the committee was to enable Parliament to deal effectively with urgent economic
problems which are essentially national in
their scope, and that in his view problems of
that kind are now within the competence of
Parliament under the British North America
Act as it stands, because the Fathers of
Confederation by vesting in the Dominion
Parliament the residuary power had provided
a scheme whereby all matters that are essentially national in their scope would be within
the exclusive competence of Parliament.
I
have no doubt that this statement respecting
the powers of the Federal Parliament is
correct, especially in view of the trend of the
judicial decisions of the Privy Council respecting constitutional questions, and more particularly in view of the decision in the Aerial
Navigation case, where Lord Sankey said that
tlie British North America Act was a great
constitutional charter. the underlying object
of which "was to establish a system of government upon essentially federal principles," adding a little later that "the real object of the
Act was to give the Central Government those
high funetions and almost sovereign powers by
whiih uniformity of legislation might be
secured on all questions which were of common
concern to all the provinces as members of a
constituent whole."
Therefore, honourable senators, my first
point is that the British North America Act
cannot be altered any more than any other
contract. Has anyone ever seen a contract
that could be armended without the consent
of the contracting parties?
Why, mutual
consent is the very essence of a contract.
When agreeing to confederate the contracting parties did just what parties to any
ordinary agreement would do: they laid down
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

certain conditions and expressed by their
signatures their undertaking te fulfil these
conditions. Some people may contend that,
envisaged from this point of view, the British
North America Act is essentially rigid, but
I say that every ordinary contract must be
so considered.
On the other hand, I am
absolutely opposed to the opinion that our
Confederation agreement is not adaptable to
changing conditions in this country.
Now, honourable senators, what was the
second reason alleged as requiring that
Canada should be empowered to amend ber
own Constitution? The second reason was
that the Dominion must help the provinces
to find additional revenue, which they require.
I can deal with that point briefly. The
provinces already have the power to tax
directly, and a few days ago this House
decided it would be unwise to enable then
to impose indirect taxes. During the last
twenty years governmental expenditares in
this country have run riot in all fields,
municipal, provincial and federal, the largest
increases having been made by the provinces.
Over the period from 1914 to 1934 governmental expenditures in Canada grew to the
extent of these alarming percentages: municipal, 207 per cent; federal, 276 per cent,
and provincial, 381 per cent.
Honourable senators, I did not realize I had
spoken beyond six o'clock. In view of the
lateness of the hour, I beg to move the
adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon.

PENSION BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading
of Bill 26, an Act to amend the Pension Act.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE- Honourable members
of the Senate, I move that this Bill be not
now read a third time, but be amended as
follows:
Page 5, lines 32 and 40, by striking out the
word "seconded" and substituting therefor the
word "transferred."

Hon. Mr. KING: I may say, honourable
senators, that this amendment is suggested by
the Law Clerk. Hie advises me that the word
"seconded" applies to military and flot to
ordinary operations, and that the word "transferred" is preferable. The officers on the
staff are not particularly desirous of having
the change made, but, as I say, the Law Clerk
recommends it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not understand the amendment yet. Does it refer to

that is net the

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then I do flot
know what it is about.
Hon. Mr. KING. I will send the written
amendment. over to the bonourable gentleman.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHE.N: Honcurable members, I do not feel prepared to
discuss the Bill as fully as I. sbould like to
diseuss it. Yesterday 1 did not have accurate
information as to the technical, and particularly the legal, sanctions of this measure. I
understood that t'hroughout it bad the approval of Mr. Justice Taylor. If it hadi, I
should not feel ýthat I ought to examine it as
carefuliy as if it had only the approval of
others, whom I do flot know se well. But
I cannet help being disturbed as to the pension situation and some phases of this measure.
We are many years past the War, yet our
bill for pensions shows hardly any signs of
diminution.
It appea-rs that the weakness of the position may bo stateci in this way. The power
of the Crown to appeal was abolisheci long
ago. The applicant bas full right of appeal
from the decisio>n rendered by the Pension
Commission. If bis application is net granted
hoe cao go to a quorum, from there to a
reviewing officer, and, finally, to the Pension
Appeal Court. It is only rigbt that if an
error is made against an applicant there sheulci
be some means of remedying it. That means
does exist, and it is se full that nothing
coulci be added to it. But if an error is made
in the otýher direction there is virtually ne

way by which it can be corrected.
The Pensýion Commission bas consisted, I
understand, -cf twelve members, of whom six
are miedical men, one is a lawyer, one a jucige,
and four are laymen. Unless a person makes
some study of the subject he is likely to think
that doctors are by their training better fitted
for this class cf mwork than any other men. Nu
Joubt much medical testimeny is given before
the Commission. Medical testimony, th-ougb, requires for its weig-hing in a court of law just
the samne legal acumen as any other testimony
does. The fact i.s that the questions te be
decideci are not, in the main, medical ques-

tions at ail.

When an applicant presents bis

case medical testimcny is given as to bis
condition and what he suffers from. No doubt
that is quite easily establisheci in mest cases,
andi probably there is not much difference of
HIoa. Mr. cGRIEsIACH.

opinion on the point.

If tbat were tbe subject

for determination, medical men weuid probablY

mnake better commissioners than even judges,
or at least they would be as gooci. But that
is net the real point to bo decided at ail.
What the commissioners bave te determine is
the question of attrxbutability, and that depends upon the rightness or wrongness of a
serias of alleged facts brougbt out in evidence.
On the commission- there are a number
of medical men determining questions that
have E'ttle or nothing to do with medicine.
Even if medical peints were involveci, there
still would be necessity fer applying at least
certain broaci and understandable judicial
principles that bave come down tbreugh the
years. My information is that the commission
itself bas cerrecteci in a ye.ar ne fewer than 550
ef it.s ewn mitakes which bad been disclesed
te it.
In addition, of course, there were
decisiens correcteci on appeal taken hy applicants. This dees net seem te me a bealthy
state cf affairs, and it wiIl be even werse if
the Bill gees through in its present form.
I am merely indicating miow what a brief
examination cf the measure bas suggested te
my minci, because I intend. te asic for a pestpenement cf the third reading until I cao
study the Bill more fully. In, tbe meantime
those who arc prcmoting it threugh the flouse
may be in a position te, give a complete anb-wer
te what I say.
1 understand that if tbe measure passes as
it n'ow is, crrors that heretofore have heen
correctable will ho perpetuated and plaeed
beyond the pale cf correction. Is that really
sound legislation? It seems te me legislation
cf a most dangerous kind,, particularly wben
it is recalleci that, as I mentieneci before,
the right cf appeal on bebiaîf of the Crown
ivas long age abelishe.d.
I will net proceeci with a more dýetaileci
eritici,,m now. Everyone is reluctant te say
anything that might appear as impcsing the
slig-htcsýt obstacle in the way cf pensions. Cortainly no one wants te impede the granting
of pensions in ail deserving cases. But we
knoýw that in this fielc, cf buman appeal the
opportunities for imposition are multitudinous,
and there is just as much inclination te avail
oneself of thc'm as in cny other fieldi. Unless
we in this flouse maintain as close supervision
cf this pension subjeet as we concientiousiy
can, the situation will net improve. I would
suggest te the mover that until more detailed
attention can be given te the measure-say, temorrow-the motion for tbird reading bo net
prc'ssed.

my right honourable friend's suggestion that
the third reading ho postponed.

better to have them considered now. I understand the intention is to add stili another
member to the Pension Appeal Court, and

a doctor. With al respect to the medical
profession, I think it would be just as well to
appoint a doctor to the Supreme Court.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Little was

I move the following amendment to clause il:
Section 12A. Delete the words in line 27
and substitute therefor the f ollowing: "In
respect of military service rendered during

Hon. Mr. KING: The reason for this
amendment is that as the Bill now stands
it would exclude active militia men, and that
la not the intention. The defeet would be
cured by the proposed amendment.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Horsey was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING- In deference to the wish

evidence before the commission. The Chief
Commissioner of the Dominion Trade and

the Combines Investigation Act, has in a
letter to the Prime Minister drawn attention
to the danger of retaining the word "documents." The letter explains the reason for
t-his Bill, and I shaîl therefore read it:
Dominion Trade and Industry Commission
Canada
Ottawa, May 6, 1936.
Rieht Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, P.C.,
Prime Minister,
Ottawa.
My Dear Prime Minister:I have observed that in your statement to
the House of the business ta come before it this
session you mientioned a possible amendment
to the Combines Investigation Act. I have
f requently discussed the maitter of amendments
with Mr. MeGregor and there are a number
of amendments which, in our opinion, would
be advisable, but we feel that there is one
whieh is a necessity if any investigations are
to be made under the Combines Investigation
Act. In my opinion it would be absolutely
unsafe to go on wî.th an investigation-at
least an investigation which might be expected
to resuit in a criminal prosectton-ýtithout an
amendment to section 24 of the Act. This
section was amended in the dying days of the
hast session in the Senate, and the House of
Comnions concurred in the amendment, very
possibly without havint had any, real opportuni-ty to consider it. na te resu t, documents
wbich the investigator, under the Combines
Investigation Act, might require to bave produced to him in bis investigation would be

c. 26, s. 24; 1935, c. 54, s. 17."
if your memory will carry you back to the
Combines Investigation Act when it was introduced in 1923, you will perhaps recall that
the corresponding section as the Act was
drafted was in substantially the form of section
24 as it now exists, but as the Bill was going
through the House you had the section amended
ta strike ont the words "or documents," as
it appears now in line six of section 24, and
inserted the word "oral" before "evidence,"
which latter word is now the first word in the
sixth line.
I am quite satisfied in ny own mind that
the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission
-of which I am Chief Commisisoner-would
not risk having an investigator require the
production of any documents until this Act is
amended.
I hope it may not be considered presumption
on my part to say the amendment suggested is
indispensable to a proper administration of the
Combines Investigation Act.
Yours faithfully,
George H. Sedgewick,
Chief Commissioner.
The proposed amendment will restore the
clause ta its original forin.
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: I believe there
is another amendnent to thi Bill, reducing
the penalty which can be imposed for an
offence under the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend indicate the clause to which lie
refers?
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: Section 34.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think tiis
second amendment is to correct a clerical
error. I will read onlv a portion of the clause:
If any person, who bas been duly served with
an order . . . fails to attend . . . be shall . . .
be guilty of an offence and liable upon summary
conviction to imprisonment for a tern nat
exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding
ane thousand dollars, or to both such fine and
imprisonment.
As it stands at present, it reads:
-be
guilty of an offence and liable upon
summary conviction to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding six months and a fine not
exceeding one thousand dollars, or to both such
fine and imprisonment.
The error is manifest.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Honourable members, I want to make a brief
comment on the letter of Mr. Justice Sedgewick, just read by the leader of the Government. The intimation of the letter is that the
amendment made in this House, and accepted
by the other House, was merely in the nature
of a last gasping spasm while we were in the
midst of death. As far as this House is concerned, it was nothing of the kind. It was a
carefully considered amendment, its object
being nothing more nor less than to accord
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

to business men engaged in legitimate enterprise and employing large numbers of people,
in respect of offences alleged under the Combines Investigation Act, the same liberties
and the same rights as are accorded to persons
accused of banditry and crime. The feeling
of the committee was that all the extraordinary powers incident to investigation
should not be made an instrument to place
a business man charged with an offence under
the Combines Investigation Act in a worse
position, as respects his diefence, than a bank
bandit accused -of robbery.
We have to kcep in mind that on this subject of combines and offences against the
Combines Investigation Act there is about
as much inconsistency and utter, malodorous
nonsense talked as on anything in the world
to-day. In one-half of our activities we are
seeking combination; seeking to eliminate the
expense and destructive extravagance of competition. We are struggling to do so to-day,
for example, in the production of paper. One
consequence of unlimited competition, competition as free as it was in the days of Noah,
has been that this Dominion has been denuded
of one of our greatest, most priceless and
irreplaceable assets as quickly as the axe
could do it. The result is that governments,
in their effort to eliminate anarchy from the
paper industry and bring that industry under
sone neasure of control, are now permitting
practically all the things prohibited under the
Combines Investigation Act. A similar change
bas occurred in the United States over the
whole field. In fact, ane of the main features
of their New Deal legislation is the effort to
compel the adoption of principles denounced
and punished as criminal under their Combines
Act. Yet here, if a man who does not happen
to be in an industry in respect of which it is
sought to restora order is accused of a contravention of the law, he is not to he allowed
the rights of a bank bandit in respect of his
defence.
The amendment made last session may have
been wrong. If so, there may be some way
of correcting it. In fact, I think I can see in
it a feature which is difficult to defend. At
the same time the major feature of it is
absolutely right.
I rose only to say, though, that the amendment was not made in the act of dying, as
indicated in the letter. We do not do things
that way hereRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Unless we are
crowded.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -and
not think the Commons accepted it

castigated as it is in the language ai that
letter.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Last session a legal
gentleman who is now, I believe, the Law
Clerk oi the Senate, prepared a BiRi from
whieh it seemed that the Combines Investigation Act, as it was in tihe Statutes, was ai
wrong. At the same time, on top oi that,
we f ound this Pa.rliarnent passing an Act called
the Marketing Act, by which farmers in a
certain region, say, in New Brunswick, hoped
ta hold Up the price ai potatoes. Would
that be a com~bine or would it not?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable mesuber will be glad ta knýow that in the
Suprêrne Court this afternoon, sa I arn informed, that Act was declared invalid.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Thank God!1
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN We struggled
sa much ta .legitimize combines that we exceeded the Constitution.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: I amn glad- ai that.
The farmers got together and withheld the
product from which the staff af 111e is made.
The Wheat Pool defied creation. Was that
a combine or was it not?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Sure!
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Did that question
also go bel are the Supreme Court?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: That was a
Pool.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: A pool is a combine. If anybody can show me the difference
between a pool and a combine, I will sit down
and let him proceed. A pool and a combine
are the same thing.
The farmers of the Northwest had a pool,
and it went against them. I have here m.rny
desk figures showing what happened. Befoare that pool was established there was no
carry-over. In the year 1917, when there was
no pool, the farmers of the Noirthwest re..
ceived for every acre they culti.vated $21.-enough ta give them a good profit and enable
them ta pay for their land in .twelve months.
They were not satisfied with that. I should
be, very glad to lay tjhese figures an the
Table af the House. As soon as the Wheat
Pool was established the farmers weuld flot
sell. at the market price. They oould have
got $1.40 or $1.50 for part ai their eropI If
that was -not -the warst combine that ever
wias organized, I do flot know what was.
Iiid anybody rise up.against those fsirrers?
No. They had votes and everybody was
afraid ta go against thein.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Were the people not
entitled to do just a.a they feit disposed to
do. for theiT own good, no matter what the
commodity might be? Had they no right ta
take steps ta increase profitas? Had they no
right ta get together and dispose of their
commodity?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How much did the
country lose on that combine?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Nothing.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman cornes from the West and he ought
ta know to a dollar what was loat, and why.
It was because they heki the staff of life.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The count-ry d-id not
lose anything. The fact that the counitry is
prod.ucing is ta the advantage of the whole
Dominion of Canada.

Rfight Hon. Mr. MEIGHýEN: I strongly
recommend t1hat the finourable senator from
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) read what, I said
yesterday.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I did-.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A bad influence.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do flot
object to the Bill going to committee if any
member of the Senate lias in mind amending
it. As far as I eau' sec, the Bill is along
precisel'y the same lines as the National
Employment Commission Bill, passed carlier
in the session. It foldows that Bill step by
step; it is equally vague, equally aimicas,
and equally worthless. I do not see any nced
of going into com.mittee.
To be just to the Bill, 1 should say there
is a distinction betwecn it and the carhier
statute: the title is different. The previous
Bill was entitled. "an Act respecting the
establishment of a National Employmcnt
Commission."
The Government evidently
was asha'med to have it go out to the country that it was erecting
another commission; so it called Vhis "an Aot to assist
towards the employ.ment of former Members of the Forces." Why dep.art from. the
precedent set carlier in the session? Is t.he
reason I give the riglit one or the wrong
one? If the Government intends ýto give the
Bill its truc title, there is some reason for
going into committee; otherwisc I do flot
sec any object in doing so.

Hon. Mr. KING: The Bihi cornes from a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We do noV
change the Bill by giving it a proper titie.
Hon. Mr. RING: Inasmucli as the Bill

on the advice of, and the evidence seeured
by, tihe Hyndman Commission, whidh was
appointed by the late Government, and
whicýh recommended that there should lie a
committec or commission of this kind set
up, I should hesitate to change the title.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The very
optimistie and fanciful may think the measure
will ultimately reach a stage where it will
realhy assist. But at the present time it is
merely a Bill for the appointment of a commission which will act under it and make
reports.
Hon. Mr. RING: More than that.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think the committee was responsible for this

to me privately I perhaps could tell him
who is.
Hon. Mr. KING. I understood it came
from. the committcc in that form. Perbaps
my right honourable f rîud. has information
from a private source?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. 1 arn
merely drawing an inference from long
experience.
Hon. Mr. KING: I move that the order
for reference to the Committee of the Whole
be discharged.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading
of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In so far as
this Bill has any interest for returned menand I have no doubt that many of them at
least think it has--why are former members
of any of the Allied forces placed in exactly
the samne position as former members of the
Canadian forces?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I was going to ask
exactly the samne question.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
that saine of the Allies reciprocate in respect
of former members of our forces, but I should
not think that there are now Canadian veterans in any Allied country other than the
United States.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that question
was fully discussed by the special committee
of another place. The Votes and Proceedings
of the H-ouse of Commons for June 10 contain the committee's report on this Bill. A
part of that report reads:
Your committee was also of the opinion that
such a survey should not be confined to former
members of the Canadian forces in the Great
War.
4ccordingly, your commjittee recommends
that the detinition of veteran in Bill 28 be
amended to include a veteran of "any other
of His Majesty's Forces or of any of the
Forces of Hie Majesty's Allies during the
Great War" and that the firet duty of the
commission under section 6 of the Bill be to
"1carry out as soon as possible an investigation
to ascertain the extent of unemployment
imong veterans in Canada"...
and s0 on.
Apparently the point was discussed and the
-ommittee thought it wise to include veterane
of Allied forces.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAIUM: Who live in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. KING- Who live in Canada.
Lt is true we have Italian, French and British
veterans among us, but not ini great nuxubers.
In the matter of pen;sins, I think that veterans of Allied forçes, çome uuder, our control.
I believe there is a reciprocal arrangemeut
between the governments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN - But we do
flot pay such penisions.

527

Hon. Mr. KING: No. There is simply a
reciprocity in administration.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Buthere we
treat ail veterans exuctly alike.
Hon. Mr. KING: I merely wish to eay
that the special committee of the ilouse of
Commons thought it wise to include veterans
of the Allied armies.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The coinmittee did not thînk it wîse to give rea;sons
for the inclusion.
Hon. Mr. KING: At first I was dou.btful
about the thing myself.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: In this country, we proïbably have veterans of the forces
of ahl the Allies-Hon. Mr. KING: Not a great many.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, but
some. Yet there pyrobably are no Canadian
v'eterans in any Allied country except the
United States. A considerable burd-en is cast
upon us in our having to look after these
former mem)bers of Allied forces. We have
some Italian veterans here. I refer to tbem
only by way of illustration. No one knows
whether somie day they may not be hack in
Italy, fightung us. We ahl pray that niay not
happen, and at present we have no reason
to think it will. But we do not Icnow what
may occur with regard to the veterans of
Italy or any other country. Is it our business
to devote special attention to these men in
an effort to get them work, perhaps at the
expense of unemployed Canadians?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think that
would 'happen. One of the prime purposes
of the commission will be to make a survey
and ascertaîn the extent of unemployment
among veterans in Canada. It is just as
well, probably, that the survey should cover
aIl veterans, including those of Allied forces.
The commission will als.o seek to obtain employment for ex-soldiers, but I should think
it.natural that Canadian veterans would ordiaarily get a preference. Aeide from. Jormer
members of tbe forces of Great Britain there
are not many Allied veterans in Cenada. Af ter
îl1,it is the hape of the Government that by
investigation a means will be f ound of assisting in solving, the unemployment problem
oe veteranS, and I cannot see rnuch objection
to the Bill as it in. My sugestion is that
we aecept the committee'e recommendation
that the measure a.pply to former memibers
of Hia Majesty's forces or of the forces of
Hie Majesty's Allies during the Great War.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 56, an Act to amend the Dairy
Industry Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
makes but two small amendments to the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
ments are of no importance.

The amend-

Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
The
first
section repeals paragraph (a) of subsection
3 of section 6 of the Act. The only change
resulting from the substituted clause as
appearing in the Bill is that instead of the
size of prints being confined to quarter
pound, half pound, one pound and two
pounds, they may be made in any multiple
of a pound. The chief reason for -the change
is that it is customary in British Columbia
and .other places to sell butter in three-pound
prints, and under the present law that is
not legal.
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND:
Honourable
senators, the explanatory note opposite section 2 says:
The proposed subsection is designed to
standardize the weights of the contents of
packages containing cheese as has been the
case for many years in connection with the
sale of butter.
Is there any regular or standing definition of
"cheese"? There are many factories in Canada turning out processed products that are
sold under the name of cheese, and no doubt
many people buy these products without
knowing what they ,really contain. I think
the word "cheese" should be dlearly defined.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not
the Act before me, and I fail to recollect
whether it contains a definition of "cheese."
I know that in this Chamber we have often
discussed the marketing of cheese on the
Liverpool and other overseas markets.
I
wiIl draw the attention of the Minister of
Agrioulittre to the question rarised by my
honourable friend. Section 2 of the Bill' is
explained as follows:
This is a new subsection designed to prevent
the sale of package cheese in weights other
than those specified in the proposed subsection.
At the present tine there is great variation in
the net weights of cheese in packages of various
sizes. The packages bear notations or statements of the net weights of the contents, but
very often the net weight is slightly under onequarter pound, one-half pound or one pound,
etc. The proposed subsection is designed to
standardize the weights of the contents of
packages containing cheese as has been the
Hon. Mr. KING.

case for many years in connection with the
sale of butter.

INCOME WAR

TAX BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 75, an Act to amend
the Income War Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I believe
that this Bii implements part of the Budget
Speech. It is 'highly technical.
I intend
to move, after the second reading, that it
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, where we shall be
sitting this evening to hear officers oif the
Finance and National Revenue departments,
fron whom we can obtain necessary explanations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am quite
in favour of sending the Bill to the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Yesterdav I
received a memorandum from the Law Clerk
stating that for lack of time be had not been
able to inake the necessary examination of
this lengthy and intricate measure. It may
be that he will not have completed bis
examination by this evening.
Possibly it
would be better to have the reference before
the committee to-morrow morning, though I
am quite prepared to come back to work
to-night.
lHon. Mr. DANDURAND: We shall have at

to-night Dr. Clark, Deputy Minister of the

DOMINION BY-ELECTIONS FRANCHISE
BILL .
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 81, an Act to amend The,
Dominion Franchise Act (Dominion ByElections).

JUNE 17, 1936
He baid: Honourable senators, this is the
measure which was mentioned yesterday when
we were dealing with the Dominion By-Elections Bill. The measures are twin brothers.
The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the
enumeration and the preparation of lists of
electors for by-elections, exclusively.
The
Bill conforms with recommendations made by
a special oommittee of the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
objection to second reading. But the measure
ehould be sent to Committee of the Whole,
because, I feel sure, the titie at least is wrong.
However, I should like to see the committee
stage postponed
until the Pýarliamentary
Counsel bas had an opportunity of going
through the measure. Although the Bill is
very large, hie will not have to spend a long
time in studying it. for hie has had a great de-al
to do with suoh measures.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 83, an Act to amend the Judges
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the explanatory note to this Bill reads as follows:
This aniendmnent to the Judges Act is made
necessary by reason of the amendments to the
Ontario Judicature Act, passed at the sessions
of 1931 and 1936 of the Ontario Legisiature,
which provide that the Court of Appeal for
Ontario shall consist of a Chief Justice, who
shall be the President thereof and shall be
called the Chief Justice of Ontario; a Chief
Justice who shall be called the Chief Justice
in Appeal, and six other judges to be called
Justices of Appeal.
Lt is further provided that when a vacancy
occurs in the office o f Chje f Justice in Appeal,
the office shall be abolished and that there-

after the Court shall consist of a Chief Justice,
who shaîl be called the Chief Justice of
Ontario, and seven other Justices of Appeal.
The said amendment to the Judicature Act

?urther provides that the High Court of
Justice for Ontario shall consist of a Chief
Justice of the High Court and twelve other
judges. This is an increase in the membership
of the said Court of two judges.
Right Hoa. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume ail
this Bill does is to f.x salaries for two additional judges whom the Federal Goverament
in-tends to appoint te the Supreme Court of
Ontario. The province does net have to pay
the salaries. It crea)tes the vacancies. Anyone who is close to the administration of
justice in Toronto knows why these vacancies
have to be created--cre-ated by adding to the
personnel of a court already constituted. That
such a step should be considered necessary
does nlot, I fear, refleet the high sense of

5Z~

duty which certainly would be appropriate
on the part of present members of the Benoh.

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

the explanatory notes accompanying this Bill,
but I deem it advisahle to give the statement

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bill

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTAUTHORITY TO AMEND
DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the question proposed
by Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton:
That he will draw the attention of the
Senate to. and inquire of the Government,
whether it is the intention of the Government
to tale steps to have legislation passed by the
Imperial Parliament to the end that the
Parlianent of Canada shall have the authority
to from time to time amend the British North
America Act as it may deem proper.
Hon. Mr DANDURAND.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I am somewhat
diffident about inflicting myself a second time
on honourable senators in resuming my discussion of what is generally regarded as purely
and simply a matter of principle. On the
contrary, I conceive it to be a matter with
respect to which the Government will next
session take action for the purpose of implementing that formula of amendment of the
Constitution which has for several years been
supported by some of the excellent friends
of the honourable leader of this House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), and particularly by the
right honourable Prime Minister and the
honourable Minister of Justice. In confirmation of my statement I may read to the
House this dispatch from Ottawa which appeared in to-day's issue of the Montreal
Gazette:
to the
June 16.-Amendments
Ottawa,
British North Anerica Act to provide a
method by which Canada may amend its own
Constitution will have to await another
session of Parliament, Hon. Ernest Lapointe,
Minister of Justice, told the House of
Commons to-day in answer to a question froin
J. S. Woodsworth, C.C.F. Leader.
It is virtually a promise on the part of the
bonourable Minister of Justice that this
matter will in a few months enter into the
realm of practical politirs.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: On petitions from
the legislatures.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It seems to me
therefore essential that it should be discussed
in Parliament and, through t.Ie newspapers,
brought to the attention of the country, so
that the publie may be fully seized of its
significance.
Yesterday when the Senate adjourned I was
discussing what I may term the second
postulate of the group of gentlemen who hold
that Canada should be empowered to amend
her Constitution. The Government until a
few days ago had beld out to the provinces, as
a bait to obtain their consent to this fundamental change, the offer of another and more
prolific source of revenue, that of indirect
Fortunately this House rejected
taxation.
the Bill. In effect it was an attempt to
persuade the provinces to abandon certain
of their powers to the central Government.
In my opinion we should ponder the question: Is the Government under present conditions prepared to encourage the provinces to
gather more taxes? I know I shall be told
that for the last twenty years all governments,
both provincial and federal, have run riot in
levying taxes. True; and the provinces have
been the worst offenders of all. They have in
fact increased their taxation by very nearly
400 per cent. Surely the present financial

JUNE 17, 1936
condition of our provinces, particularly those
of the We.st, is so serlous as to make the
Government realize that th-is is flot an opportune time to encourage them to increase their
expenditures--to meet which they must of
necessity impose further taxation. I make
bold Vo say that the time has corne when iVis
the duty of everyone in this country to preach
retrenehment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

And practise it.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: We are glad
the honourable leader of the House thought of
that.
Hcm. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes. Strange Vto
say, there is sometimee a veiry wide dijiferonce .between the preaching and, the pracýtice
of certain governments. I venture Vo say
th-at it is possible Vto hning about such a
state of mind in the countiry thait t.his
preaching will be reoeivedý favourably. I
know that up to the present time it has
been thought that g.overnments which give
freely are pojyular; that the more a government gives to the people the more popular
it is. Governments in VMis country have
s9eem'ed Vo think that Vhey should Vax the
rich and, cater Vo people who own -nothing
and are worth nothing. Such a policy is
absolutely futile and impracticable. Any
goverume-nts which conVend VhaV they should
tax the rinh and give Vo -the poor harve only
Vo look at their own records to find that the
great bulk of taxation ormes noV from the
rich alone but from ail classes of Vhe populaion. The po-or are Vaxed as well as the
rich. I have a very interesfing article heme
-I do not intend. to delay the Hanse hy
reading itHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Read it.
HoKn. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -which says that
there are sixty taxes hidden ini a loaf of
bread. Up Vo now those who -have had the
responsibility of government-and I make
no distinction 'between partie&--have had to
chooae betweeai a Vax that ýwa appairentV and
a Vax that was hiciden, and they -have preferred the one wheireby Vhey could pluck
the most feathers while provo-king the feweet
squawks. If, instead, of epeaking to the vezy
small minerity of people W'ho have no-thing
and are wortà nothing, governmeiats were Vo
address themselves Vo the immense majority,
composed of people who have something, are
worth something and contribute something,
and were ta inform. Vhem of the serious
financial condition of this country, such a
policy might prove very effective.

For a long ime I accepted without ques.tion the sta-ternent that miost of the peo~ple
in the country have nothing; but I now
know that is noV true, as I think I can show
clear1y in a few worde. There are in this
country 2,500,000 insurance policies issued Vo
adults. That figure does noV taIre into consideiration either group insurance or msurance on childgen. Secondly, there are
1,300,000 people who own real estate. Adding
these figures tagether, we flnd a total of
3,800.,000 persons w.ha have insurance policies
or own real estate. The Votai nuiniber of
bank deposits is 4,600,000. Thes'e are, I
suppose, many duplications, ibut il you add
to 3,800,000 persons who own a'eal estate or
hdld insurance policies the many othere wi1o
own husinesses, and then add the owners of
boidýs or stocks, you will agree that it is no
exagg'-eration Vo say that at least four million
adults in this country own something and
pay taxes.
There are in this country five million
adiVîts. As four millions of these adulte own
something, and therefore pay taxes, I understand why governments should with one hand
keep holding out to the people the temptatiýon Vo squander mo-ney, while with the other
hand they surreptîtiously take away the people's
money by imposing hidden taxes. If, instead
of doing that, they were Vo tell the people,
and convincc them, that unless they were
careful they would lose alI they had, they
would very soon find that popular opinion
would change and its main concer would be
the preservation of the country~s întegrity.
I come now Vo the greatest postulate of
alI as-sumed by this group of distînguished men
who hold the idea that we should obtain the
riglit to, change our Constitution. What is that
postulate? It is that it is undignified for a
country like Canada, which
bas full
sovereignty-I do not contest -that; I think it
is rue-to depend upan another country, even
if it be the Mother Country, for any modification of our own Constitution. That is an
appealing argument. It is like a fiag carried
at the head of their forces. They say, in
effect: "Are we as a nation so small that
we alone, in the world, cannot settle our awn
charter? Are we so unreasonable that we, of
all the peoples of the world, cannot compose
our own differences and overcome our own
difficulties?"
I can well understand how
effective such a plea would he if made heforc
a large gathering nd presented as no doubt
many who hold such vicws could present it.
No doubt they could point the finger of scora
at "reactianaries and little Caniadians who do
not know that Canada bas grown."

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Any disparaging

But let us examine into this mat tan. Is
this contention truc,' or is it not? How do
we stand? We in this country are in such
a position that we can exact frorn Great
Britain, if we so desire, any amendiment to our
Constitution, and Great Britain is b-ound to
grant it to us. Unquestionably, we are in a
position to command; Great Britain's part is

can enforce our will, because Great Britain,
with lier wide comprehension and ber great

Is it a humiliating position that we occupy

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Who suggasted

H-on. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Three of the experts who were heard before the special cornrnittee of the House of Commons in 1935.
I amrn ot going to waste much time on that
contention, hecause I do flot think it is very
difficuit to refute. I cannot contemplate without tremendous anxiety a new Constitution
being hamrnered out from the rough, fer our
country. It took years to obtain the consent
necessary to bring about the British North
Amenia Act. How many years would it take
to obta.in the consent of those who would
corne under this new Constitution? In 1867

East. The emergency was pressing; sornething had to be donc. Govarnrnent had becorne an impossibility, in the province of

in our Constitution of the rig-ht to amend.
That seems as simple and easy as possible,

one side you woiild have, constantly and
Pcerpetually, the central Govaroment insisting upon taking frorn the provincial govcrnments a certain part of their authority;
and on the other side y-ou would bave the
provinces, and 'back of them the minorities,
constantly defending themsclvas, constantly in
fear of their rights being assaulted, eonstantly
in danger of having those rights taken away
from them. Is that a gond policy? Would
that be right?
But another question, very mucli more important, in my opinion, is this: How are
minorities protected to-day? As I said in my

JUNE 17, 1936
opening rernarks, they are protected by the
fact that they hold a contract, and that the
sacredness of contracts is respected in every
civilized country. I ar n ot talking of "scraps
of pa.per."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: What about
Ontario?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know there are
exceptions, but I trust that in Canada there
are only the exceptions that go to prove the
rule. There is nu doubt that we now hold
a contract. If these gentlemen, skilful and
conx incing as they are, were able to bring
about a change, where should we be? Why,
honourable members, notwithstandÀng the evidenco, notwitbsitanding the proof that bas
been accumulated here in the citations given,
ail of which were known to these gentlemen
of talent and honour, they have declared that
we have no contract. If you abandon the
first and foremost characteristie of a contract
-its sacrcdness, and the fact that it cannot
be undone without the consent of the contracting parties--what line of defence is lef t
to us? To-day our people can corne before
both Houses of the Canadian Parliarnent and
invoke the sanctity and honour of a contract.
Should such a plea fail here on any occasionand I trust it neyer will-they would have
Vo carry it to the Iniperial Parliament at
Westminster.
If ýwe were to provide that our Constitution could be changed without the consent
of the contracting parties, what would
happen? We should sec the authority and
right.s of the provinces dirninishing, while
the powe.r of the central Governméent became
constantly grieater. Acs the honou-rable senator fro.r North Yoirk (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) bas warned us, the rninority rnight
lose it-s sacred rights. 1 hope that bhefore we
atternpt. any such fateful step the country
will be at ail events well inforrned, so that
everybody mnay know the direction in which.
the step would lead and the consequences
that would follow if we took it.
Certain propagandists say our Constitution
lacks aomething, because it contains no provision foir arnendrnents. Thiey promise Vo
write a better constitution, one providing
that any ordinaey amendien&t, may be rntde
upon the consent of the rnajority of the
provinces, but that no arnendrnent touching
a question od mi-nority rights, such a religion
or race, for example, shadl; he possible un-less
ail the provinces agree. Well, is the British
Constitution writt-en? No. Has it endured?
Yeg. Have the constitutions of otdier countries--of France, for example-heen written?
Yes. Have t'hey endured? No.. Thîat is -the
first answer I make to these propagandists.

533

The second answer I make is this. We
do flot need in our Constitution a provision
that it -cannot be 6erended, without the
consent of the contrs.ting parties.
Why?
Bec-ause that is already provided by the
common law. No contract contains aIl the
legal provisions that govern it. The esentials are specified, but everything aIse is
governed by tihe law. For instance, if I
na.ke a contract in the province of Quebec
I sign rny narne a&tthe hottorn of perhaps
only a few lines. My righte axre protecteil,
though, flot rnerely by that con'tract, but
also by the Civil Code. Now, the provinces
of Canadla bave a Confederation contract,
and tbe comm-on law says a contract cannot be cbanged un'less the contracting parties agree. Thiat principle bas always been
recognized in British countries, and I trust
it alýways will be. If perchance, in connectl'on with the contract of Confederation, that
principle is ever ýrejectcd in Canada, it
will always be h-onoured in Great Britain.
Speaking for rny own province of Quebec,
I arn quite frank in sayiog that now we have
two lines of defence. We hold our minority
rigbts to be of the utmost importance. We
want to maintain our language, our religion
and our Civil Code-which in the opinion
not only of people of my own race, but of
aIl lawyers who bave to do even with the
common law, is pcrbaps the best civil code in
the world. We *are determineti Vo defend
these rights, and we regard this Parliament
of Canada as our first line of defence. Wby
should we discard it? Why should we bring
about a change whereby in future we should
have only one bulwark left, the Imperial
Parliament? Let us retain. the double protection that we have always bad. No dýoubt
rnany honourable rnembers bave scen a picturc, painted shortly after the War, representing Great Britain and the Dominions as a
squadron of the British Navy. Every one of
the powerful units is plowing along independently, under its own steam, but the courseof each is rnarked out on the sarne chart
of dernocratic liberty, and eacb is headed
for the sarne ideal port of order, peace,
prosperity and happiness. As I looked at
that beautiful picture I was irnrediately
struck with the thought that Canada is joined
to, the Mother Country by a oonstitutionalý
tie, by a line as light and supple as silk,
which cannot be severed or dropped overboard at the first demand. I say Vo our own
compatriots who want to, cut the line that
even though thieir wish were realized there
wo-uld: be no change in the course of our
ship. No! Whether th-at line exists or flot,
we will continue on the sarne course, guided

port. But, let me ask, if that l'ine were eut,
what would happen to the crew?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

To whom?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
To the crew of
the ship. Let them not forget that this
constitutional line was woven with skilful
and patriotic hands, not as a hawser to keep
Canada in tow of Great Britain, but as a
lifeline for the maintenance of unity in this
country and for the preservation of minority
rights, without which unity in this country
cannot be secured.
I trust that those who are sponsoring
this propaganda will pause and reflect. This
is not a question with respect to which we
can risk a leap in the dark. We are not legislating for ourselves alone. In a few years
we shall be gone, but what we do will affect
the lives of the Canadians of to-morrow.
Before we make any attempt to sever the
constitutional line, let us ponder over the
consequences of such action upon the concord and unity of this country. When Mr.
Baldwin was in Canada a few years ago he
gave us a timely warning. He said that of
all the problems of the Dominion, and they
are many and great, the predominant task
of its best statesmen would be the maintenance of harmonious unity throughout the
country, amidst the conflicting interests of
the East, the Centre and the West. It is,
indecd, a grave problem. Before we remove
the base upon which our statesmen and
people have built this nation, let us be sure
that we have prepared as a substitute an
equalýly solid foundation for the still greater
nation that we are justified in expecting
Canada will become in the future.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, this debate arose out of a question
that was put to the Government by the
honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) about two months ago, I
believe. I have postponed my remarks so
long as it appeared that any other honourable
member desired to speak. If my own speech
is the only one remaining to be made on the
subject, I shall move the adjournment of the
debate, in the hope of closing it to-morrow.
If there is sufficient time then I may also
try to close the debate on the order standing
in the name of the honourable senator from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé), deading with immigration, repatriation and emigration. I have
been ready to speak in both these debates for
the last month, but an opportunity has not
occurred.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
ready yet.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

THIRD READING

Ho>n. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading cof the Bill..
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable niembers, I arn rising not lx> take
objection to, the third readdng, but to, eal
attention to one clause of the measure which
tbe committee, in its wisdom, did flot sSe
fit to alter, but wbich I think contains questionable féatures. I shaà briefly outline a
few considerations and aak the leader of
the Government to press themn upon bis
colleagues with a view to baving the Bill
corrected if these considerations appeal to
th.e Government of the day.
I refer to the section wbich deals witb the
gift tax. It will be recailed tbat last year,
for the first time, Parliament provided a tax
upon gifts. The purpose of the legisiation
was to prevent evasions of income taxes in
the higher brackets by weaithy persons who
distributed tbe ownersbip, real or nominal,
of their property among, say, members of
tbeir family, so that the income upon each
section of property would appear separateiy
and lie chargeahle against the liolder of that
section, tbe taxes upon the incomes from the
separate sections being in eacb case within
the lower brackets and, when totalied, considerably less tban the tax would have been
f rom the property as a whle, the income
from which would bave been in a high bracket.
That objective was quite proper and,' se far
as I know, the legisiation met with the approval of ail maembers of the Banking and
Commerce Committee, and later passed in
the Senate. In tbe committee last session
it was provided, though, by way of amendment, that ail gifts sbould net be taxable.
The original Bill that came to us contained
a similar provision, but it was not expressed
effectively, though the intention was probably the same. The amendnment provided
tbat gifts up to $4,000 a year sbould be taxf ree. That feature is further amended this
year. But it lias been represented to me
tbat neither tbe legisiation of hast year nor
the present Bill was întended to do more
tban prevent tbe distribution of the capital
of the person taxed. It was flot intended to
prevent anyone from giving bis income away
if lie chose to do so.
It seems too bad that we should discourage
people from helping others; yet that is what
we do when we tax gifts of income. When
a man pays a tax on bis w-hohe income, surely
lie should lie aible to give a part of it to
others, if lie chooses to do that rather than
to accumulate it for himself. If a person
proceeds to distribute bis capital over a period
of years, witýh a view to evading income tax,

5M5

lie should, if possible, be prevented from
doing so: at ail events he is effectivehy taxed
when lie seeks to exercise that priviiege. Taxing gifts of income is different, for it seeks
to penalize, by means of a second tax, a
generous man who gives away part of bis
earnings. What I want to point out isand this bas been said in committee, thougli
flot by myseif particularly-tliat the principhe
of taxing the generous man twice and the
sehfisb man onhy once can hardhy be considered correct.
The reason I am not meving an amendment
is this. The measure is peculiarly a money
bill. It migbt lie quite proper to make an
amenciment and sulimit it to the other House,
but if it is flot accepted there this House
sbould retreat forthwith from its position.
We could flot seek to press any amendment
to a money bill whicli we did not consider
vital to tbe State-and so, far we neyer have
considered any money bill to be sucli. I content myself witli asking the Government to
oonsider these representations, in which I
know many members on both sides of this
House -agree, so that we may at least hope
for an amendment to meet these representations in a succeeding session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, there wus an interesting discussion on this
matter in the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, and the consensus seemed to lie
that the Cana<Iian taxpayer shouid have freedom of action to dispose by gift of surplus
income, witliout its being subject ta an
additional tax for tbe year in whicli the gift
is made. To my mind the question is one as
to the time when a man cesses to lie entitied
to treat income as ineorne and must regard
it as capital. If a man earns, say, $25,000,
and spends $15,000, lie lias $10,000 left. I
quite realize that if that $10,000 is in bis
possession at the end of the year it could lie
treated as capital, because next year lie would
draw intereat upon Ai. The income would bave
become capital. But I agree with my riglit
honourable friend that after the taxpayer
lias paid income tax on that income lie shouid
be free to dispose of the balance without
payment of further taxation. I shahl glaly
bring bis statement to, the attention of the
bonourable Minister of Finance.
Tbe motion wae agreed to, and the Bih' was
read the third time, and paesed.

JUNE 18, 1936
from perhaps an imperfect recollection of
the history of the law. 1 said yesterday that
under the present law the Crown had no
right of appeal in pension matters. Strictly
speaking, tbat is nlot correct. The Crown has
even yet a certain measure of right of appeal.
The constitution of the various tribunals, if
we may so describe them, is this. There is
a Pension Commission *of twelve. Invariably
it sits as two members, and sits quite legally.
The other members divide themselves into
quorums, and they are perfectly competeot
as well to liear cases. Indeod, if an applicant
fails before the commissioný, he can go personally ta a quorum and have bis case heard
again, and present new evidence if ho wishes.
If he succeeds, the case gocs to an officiai,
called the reviewing officer, and if he approves
grant of the pension-the "entitlement"ý-his
approval is final and there is fia right of
appeal on the part of the Crown. If this
roviewing officer should not approve, thon the
case goes to what is called the Appeal Tribunal.
This tribunal is, I think, composed of a judge
and a lawyer, both excellent men. There are
also two or threo other members. but 1 may
ho wrong as to this.
Hoýn. Mr. KING: One other member.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One other
member now. It is proposed to add two
ot-hers, who may nat ho mon of law at ail.
Lt will ho observed that while there is a right
of appeal hy the Crown, it is very cirdumscribed. The Crown is entirely in the hands
of a gentleman who holds the titîn of reviewing officer. If ho approves the grant the
Crown is shut aut completely.
I remarked yesterday that of the twelve
niembeýrs of the Pension Commission six are
medical mon, one is a lawyer, one a retired
judge, and four are Iaymen. I pointod aut
as well that the function to ho dischargedexamîning evidenco ta se if it really is
evidence--was not really a dactor's prorogativo. 1 do nat mean ovidence under the strict
rules of law. Assuming the miedical evidence
to ho correct, is or is nzot a case made out?
When this question is lef t to a board s0
constituted, ît is very likely there will ho
a tremendous number of errors--and there
have been. Taking the average since 1919,
I understand each year the commission- itsel-f
bas reversed 550 -cases, ta say npthing of
the very largo proportion reversed by variaus
higher tribunals which from time ta time have
been superimposed.
In view af the percentage of errer, which
has been s0 great, and the gigantie strides that
the pension bill bas taken in its charges over
these yearà, it doos aeem to me it is time

we took some stops to have an effective and
really intelligent review of these applications
merely in order ta reduce ta the minimum
the illegitimate charges on t.he treasury. It is
only unneoessary repetition, nothing but
supererogation, ta say we do flot want to
deny a pension ta any man sTightfully ontitlod ta one. Certainly I do not, and I do
not know anybody who does. I arn ready
ta give credit ta the present Administration,
as much as ta any other, for a desire ta see
that everyone is treated fairly; but yau can
sce the inroads that can ho made on the
treasury hy ingenuity and hy a not sufficiently
trained review of fihe cases. Lt is very important that thero ho security of pension.
The granting of a pension to which the applicant is not entitled may encourage him ta
marry and raise a family: t-hon ta have ta
take away the pension is far more harmful
to him than if it had been denied ta him in
the first place. Security of pension is valuahle ta the pensionco, valuable ta the man
entitled to it, but it is certainly essential ta
this country that something which involves
an expenditure of scores of millions a year
should ho rightly and thoroughly supervised.
As I said yesterday, this measure would make
effective and would perpetuate any errors
committod in the past. 1 have flot heen able
ta go into this situation thoroughly, but I
understand it is confined ta a very res'tricted
number of cases. If so. it is perhaps not
worth while taking up much of the time of
the Huse in discussing it. I shall discuss
mono particularly one or two other phases.
We are going ta appoint another member
of the Appoal Board, and I believe the Act
specitically says ho is te ho a doctor. That
will make two doctors on the Appeal Board,
six doctors on the Pension BoardHon. Mr. KING:
Appeal Board.

One doctor on the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One dactor
there, six doctors on the Pension Board, and
this reviewing officer, who also is ta ho a
doctor.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Really, as
a citizen, I do net feel safe with that situation.
I amn ready ta take a doctor any timo I arn
afflicted with physical disa-bility, provided I
know the doctor. But how will 'a doctor ho
in a position ta judge whether a pension is
such that the Crown, which. grants it, should
not have the right of appeal? The idea of
enacting that a man trained in medicine, and
ho glone, is the one who shall say whether a
pension is granted, rightly or not, does nlot

538

SENATE

appeal to me. If he says it is flot rigbtly
granted, that is flot the end of it--it is hardly
ever ended for the applicant; but if the
doctor says it is rightly graoted, that is the
end of it, and the Crown has no recourse
whatsoever. Is it reasonable to say that this
man should have such power? I do flot know
who he is. 1 have flot the slightest idea of
bis -name, thougli I arn informed that lie is
a physician. I do not think any physician
can possibly be qualified to make a decision
of that kind. H1e must draw conclusions from
tlie facts, ascertaining first wlietlier they have
really been proved in any manner that can
be depended upon. Is a doctor thie man to
do that? H1e will tell you the condition the
applicant is in. how long lie lias probably
been in that condition, and the cause or
probable cause of it; but surely it is flot
rit
that one witb bis training, and only
that, sliould be in a position to say to the
Crown: "Stand aside; the decision is permanent-for ever; you bave no right of
appeal." It is now proposed. to add another
member to the Appeal Court. 1 would far
rather sec an able man, trained in the law,
joined witb the reviewing officer in order
that there miglit bie two at that very pivotai
point in the pension process.
I corne now to t.he subject of disentit-lement becýause of improper conduct wbile
on tbe force, such improper conduct being
the caus~e of the dýisaýbility.
Under section
18 of the British Army Act, if a man is
guilt.y of. say. self-inflicted wounds, or of
deiberate cond'uct which is sucli as to 'bring
di&stbility upon h'im, that man is liable to
certain penalties. Under section 40 of the
same Act it is provided that if what he is
suifering from is the resuit of some fairly
trivial negleet, not som-ething in the nature
of a deliberate, intentional, self-inflicted
wound., or .resulting frnma intentional misconduct, lie cao lie convicted. My information
is that the practical difficulty of sbowing intent bas cau.sed virtoally ail cases to, be tried
under section 40. Thlie purpose of the present
amendment is to provide that convictionif it im.ay lie se diescibed-under section 40,
.5haîll not lie held to disentitle a mon who bas
net, been convicted, under section 18.
It
cao easily be seen that mrany men who
might bave been conrvicted: under section
18 were charged under section 40, se thýat the
nece:ssity of establishing intent might, be
avoided. Therefore, if we pass tbis arnendment, we shai make it certain that many
who, are nt in tbe least entitled to pensions
will beceme possessed ef tbem.
Surely
authority should be givoen te examine the
real merits and see wbetber wbat th«ose men
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

suifer fromn is really semething for wlicb tbey
sheuld now pay a penalty instead of being
supported by the State. If a man is suifering- as -a result cf some trivial negleet, -and
net frem anything intentional, and bis suifeTing st.arted during the War, I sbeuld bave
ne objection te our heling him, particularly
if lie is in distressed circum.stances; but
under the law as amended all sorts of impositions cao be practised.
I think it is
cl.early a case for detail-ed examination in
committee.
If I arn wron.g in these particulars I shaîl lie only ton glad; but I arn
disturhed hy the mounting figures cf our
pensions, hy the weaknesscs which bave been
represented te me from màaoy sources, particularly in respect cf tbe preliminary processes, and whicli reacli their finality at a
stage where I do net tbhink finality sbeuld
be raached, and by the very serious disabilities cf the Crown in seleing that real justice.
net m-erely sentimental justice, is dealt out.
Hon. Mr. DýANDURAND:
Don I understand the riglit heneurable gentleman te
suggest tbat this Bill be sent te dom.rittee?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIIGIEN:
it should be.

Yes, I think

Hon. Mr. IKING: Whcn I brouglit the
Bill hefore thie House on second reading. I
thouglit we could later go into Cnmmittee of
the Wliole. but at that time the suggestion
was made that we sbould give the Bill third
reading, and the suggestion was nccepted.
We sbould realize that this Bill cornes
beifore os net merely as a Government
measure; it lias beb;ind it the autbority of
a parlýiaýmentary committeea which sat for
weeks he'aring evidence. The questions raised
by My riglit honourable frîend (Riglit Hnn.
Mr.* Meighen) have been diîscussed in that
cemmittee, ot for a few minutes, but for
bours, and the committee. wbose object was
te meach finality, if possible, in some cf these
cases, bas presented its conclusions.
Furthermore, in 1933 a question arose in
regard to certain pensions te which the chairman cf the commission bad t-aken exception,
and wbich lie bad cancelled.
At that time
tbe Prime Minister rose in Parliament and
said, "These pensions wihl lie reinstated," and
the commissioner whe bad caocehled tbern
retired, and another was appointed.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
dealing witb tbaï; phase now. I said that
weuhd net lie important enougli to bother
with.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is very important.

JUNE 18, 1936
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am conceding the honourable gentleman's position
on that.
Hon. Mr. KING: Well, ·that is all right.
I have no objection to the Bill going to
oommittee, but is that committee to call all
these organizations before it and hear evidence again, or is it to do what the Committee of the Whole might do-read the enactment and discuss each clause? I understand
that when the report of the House of Commons committee was presented it was discussed and was accepted unanimously. Does
my right honourable friend intend that we
should hear evidence?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There would
be no need to call outside evidence on the
main point I raise, namely, the desirability
of having some stronger and wider tribunal
at the point where the Crown is for ever
stopped. That is the vital point of the whole
process. We now have one doctor. I do not
think the tribunal is a proper one.
Hon. Mr. KING: After all, we are dealing,
not with ordinary matters of law, but with
human beings. We have had many years
of experience. Ninety per cent of the evidence that comes before the commission is
medical evidence, and there must be medical
men to deal with it. I do not know whether
there should be six of them, or four, or two,
but there should be very good medical authority to interpret the medical evidence
that is given.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To interpret
it?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, and know what it
means.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The interpretation of the medical evidence is not the
effective thing at all. The important thing
is the interpretation of the facts concerning
a man from the time he claimed disability
until now; not the question of what is
wrong with him at the present time. Evidence as to his present condition would be
strictly medical testimony. So far as that
is concerned, hardly a day passes in the
courts when judges do not have to consider
medical evidence. I think it is wise in this
case that a doctor should be present, but I
do not think a doctor alone is a sufficiently
strong and dependable tribunal to safeguard
properly the public interest. I am complaining of the system.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no objection to
a reference of the Bill to committee. I think

that might be wise. We could discuss these
questions in committee in much more detail.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Without
breaking the rules.
Hon. Mr. KING: Without breaking the
rules. I had hoped the Bill would go to
Committee of the Whole to be dealt with,
and that we might finish with it there. Really
there is not much to this legislation.
With regard to the expenditure, I am informed that the curtailments and limitations
will pretty well balance the larger benefits,
and that there will be no increaseRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is time
we had a reduction.
Hon. Mr. KING: We shall not have a
reduction for some years yet. My information is that there will be no large reduction
until well along in the forties.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps so.
Hon. Mr. KING: A dead line being set,
the provisions of the Bill will bring about
reductions within two or three years, and,
I believe, will make a very material difference by 1940 or 1942.
However, I am quite agreeable that the
Bill should go to committee,, if my right
honourable friend so desires. What committee would he suggest?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
and Commerce., I suppose.

Banking

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I move that
this Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. At the
present time nothing is before that committee; so it may be able to consider this
neasure to-night or to-morrow morning.
There is now in the hands of his Honour,
I believe, the Veterans' Allowance Bill, and
I intend to, move that it be referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. As to
this present measure, I realize the importance of the question which my right honourable friend has put. What would be the extent of the inquiry that the committee might
make? It could perhaps ask the Minister,
who acted as chairman of the special committee in the other House, to come and try
to give some enlightenment with respect to
the questions which *my right honoumble
friend has in mind. Then the committee
could decide to what eitent, if any, the inquiry might le enlarged.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was agreed to.

Act to amend the Combines Investigation
Act.

On section 1-no person excused from gîving evidence on ground of incrimination;
protection from oral evidence only:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right lion. 'Mi. MEICHEN: Honourable
nxcmPerý. tiis is an excccd(ingivy important
amcndmcnt, and I a-t the indulgence of the
commitbcc whiie I ecek bo rettîte its alieged
monits. It je absolnbehy plain to everyone
tînt the intention of bte Government, incinding tint of fixe Prine Minister, who
introdnced the mensure in the flouse of
Gommons, is thoroughly sincere. I Tise to
criticize the propoeed cmendiment with atihi
more dýeference hecanse of the respect I have
for Hon. Mr. Sedgewick, whose letter was
the cause of the introduction of the measure.
I am going to su'bmit that Hon. Mi. Sedgewick wns not wholly correct in Pis letter, and
that the principle of -the Bill is entirehy anddangerons]y wrong.

,IUNE 18, 1936
It is a principle of British jurisprudence,
from which no court in a British country
would think of diverging, that a man cannot
be compelled to convict himself. It does flot
matter how monstrous a chare.ter bie may
be, or with wh'at atroojous crime bie may be
charged, or how evident it is to, the public
that hie committed the crime; under a mile of
British jurisprudence obtaining for centuries
back bie cannot ba compelled 'to convict himself. The onus is on the Crown to establîsh
the guilt of the accused. To such an extent
has this principle been followed that for many
years an accusad person was not competent
to take the box in bis own defence, t.he
reason being that hie mîglit convict himself
because of labouring under disadvantages
when subjected to examination by the Crown.
In tbat respect the rule lias been relaxed and
an. accused person may now take the box in
lis defence, of bis own free will. And bis
wife may give evidence if she so desires. But
if thc accused does flot enter tbe box, the
judge, counsel for the Crown and everyone
aise connected witli the case are forbidden
by iaw to comment upon tbat fact or refer
to it in any way before the jury. Such is
the protection tbrown -around evcry person
accused of a crime, no matter bow terrible
that crime may be.
Now I think it goes witbout saying that
anyone accused under the Combines Investigation Act will cert-ainly not be chargcd with
anytbing more terrible tIen murder, or
treason, or rape, or conspiracy to murder, or
any otber major crime on tbe calend-ar. On
the contrary, be wili be accused of something
which in certain spberes of industrial operations in this age is considcred not only
legitimate, but patriotic, yet whidli in certain
other spheres is regarded by Parliament as
being wrong. As to -the wisdom of Parliament in so deciding, I make no question at
ail]. If a mian combines contrary to the law,
wîetbar that law be wisc or not, lie ought
to ha subjected to the penalties provided. I
would flot for a moment seek to shelter him
from the penalties in any way. But bonourable members will sec bow, if we pass tîis
proposed amendiment, sudh a man could ba
placcd in a more disadvantageous position
tîan, under Britisb l.aw, a person accused of
coilspiracy to murder thc King, let us say,
couid be placcd.
It will ba reealled that ail activities under
tIc Combines Investigation Act are not final.
but investigational. Tbey are in the nature
of inquiries. Sweeping powers are given tIc
inrves9tigating commission, or the commissioner
acting under it. It is something in the nature
of a royal commission sudh as we bave very

541

often had in tbis country. The commission
or commissioner can, at will, send for papers
and documents, can compel witnesees to attend,
and can examine thcm as long as it likes, and
in any avenue in the worldi it may choose, and
no one who is meflected upon or seriously
affected by any sudh examination has any
rigbt of cross-examination whatsocvem. The
only igît lie bas--and that, I Vhink, is by
permission-is to be present and listen to
himself being impugned. H1e cannot say one
word in axplanation. He is toid: "Our powers
are given us under this Act. Our duties are
investigational. Notbing tîat bappens here
will hurt you. You cannot ha sent to gaol or
be leld up to public contempt by any criminal
proceedings just because of our report to the
Departmýent of Labour. So you are flot
allowed to cross-examine, or to modify the
affects of any evidence or explaiu it ini any
way." At the inquiry the man is conipelled
to produce a document and swear to tIe
signature, tbus proving it-unless hie commîts
perjury. Afterwards hae is accused. The document lie proved under circumstances whîch permitted Iim no right of qualification or crossexamination or defenca is produced, te convict
him.
1 corne now to Judge Sedgewick's latter.
The CHAIRMAN: Would it be proper for
the chairman to ask a question?
Right Hn

M*r. MEIGIIEN: Yes.

The CHAIRMAN: It wouid only be necessamy tIen for the accused to place before the
commisslion the vcuy worst incriminating evidence possible, and so, be free from. it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not want
to interrupt my rigbt honourable friend, but
I wouid remind 'him that a witncss summoned
befora the commission to be questioned and
to produce documents, books, and so forth, is
protected by the Act; bis oral avidence cannot
be used against him.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that;
but tIare is no difference betwean oral and
writýten evidence. When a man produces a
document hae swears to bis signature thereto.
TIen cvemything in tbat document is evidence.
Themefore if it is evidence against him -lie has
been compelied to convict himsclf.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By producing
the document?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By producing
and pmoving it . H1e has had ta prove it.
Hon. Mm. DANDURAND: No. TIc proving is flot against him, be cause it is bis oral
evidence.

542

SlN ATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
But the
document is proved,.
The meal point is
ra.ised by the chairman, and if I cannot
answer it I have no case -at aill.
That
point appears t0 have been in the mind of
the head of the Trad-e and Industry Comnmission when hie wrote bis leffer, nameiy,
if we provide that the document so proved
cannot be used against the witness, hie can
take advantage of that protection and, by
going to the commission and puffing the
document in, preveýnt it from being used
against bim later. If hie can do that, hie
sheuld neyer have anything ýat ail to say
agaiost this proposed amendment. The fact
is hie cari ot. No man can prove anything
oxcepf as directed, by the commission. The
commission hias charge of everything. No
man can put in anything exc.ept. wit.h the

But I was just about to read Judge Sodgewick's letter to the Prime Minister, in wbich
hiesays:

JUNE 18, 1936
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: How can he prove it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You might
wish, with respect to a certain crime, to put
Red Ryan-were he alive-into the witness
box and ask him if he was the man who fired
the fatal shot; but that could not be done.
Were it done, it would shock the whole nation.
Can you place somebody else in a position
different from Red Ryan's and say: "We
are going to call you before a commission
where you cannot have counsel, and we will
make you yourself establish some document
whieh later we intend to use to incriminate
you"?
I am sure if Judge Sedgewick had given to
this matter the attention which he has given
to many other matters be would not have
written that letter to the Prime Minister and
would not have felt himself under the disability he expresses in his letter. Why should
we distinguish between documentary and oral
evidence? They are of the same nature;
precisely the same principle applies to one
as to the other. If a man cannot be made to
convict himself by oral evidence, why can he
be made to convict himself by a document?
To compel him by either means is to do
violence to every British tradition of justice
and to those great protective features of our
jurisprudence which accrue to the benefit of
the vilest criminal.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I am not in accord with my right
honourable friend.
I have examined the
matter carefully. The Combines Investigation
Act allows the investigator or the Registrar
the right to investigate business and to have
access to such premises and books, papers or
records as he may need in order to carry on
his inquiry. I take it for granted that one
of the essential elements of an inquiry is to
obtain information from the books and correspondence
of the parties
investigated,
whether individuals or corporations. I believe
this element is at the basis of the investigation.
Those documents can be had by search
warrant, or by summoning the secretary, president or general managerRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or anybody.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Or anybody.
Section 24 of the Act as it was introduced
in 1923 referred to evidence only. At once
the question arose, in a prosecution following
an investigation, as to what evidence could be
brought against the accused. The case was
heard in British Columbia and the question
submitted to the judge as to what the word
"evidence" meant. He interpreted it as including all the documents that had been
produced-books and correspondence.

543

I should perhaps give the history of this
clause, for it has a history.
The Combines Investigation Act of 1910
did not include any provision for the inadmissibility of either oral evidence or
documents.
The Board of Commerce Act of 1919 (9-10
George V, c. 37) contained a section providing
that no documents produced on the board's
order should be used, in any subsequent
criminal proceedings, against the person producing them. No reference was made to oral
evidence. The section read as follows:
51. No person shall be excused from attending and producing books, papers, contracts,
agreements and documents, in obedience to the
subpoena or order of the Board, or of any
person authorized to hold any investigation or
inquiry under this Act, on the ground that
the documentary evidence required of him may
tend to criminate him or subject him to any
proceeding or penalty; but no such book, paper,
contract, agreement, or documents so produced
shall be used or receivable against such person
in any criminal proceedings thereafter instituted against him, other than a prosecution
for perjury in giving evidence upon such
investigation or inquiry, cause or proceeding.
In the original draft of the Combines
Investigation Act of 1923 the principle of that
section was followed and the exemption was
extended to oral evidence required during an
investigation. Section 18 of Bill No. 54, as
introduced on March 9, 1923, read as follows:
No person shall be excused from attending
and giving evidence and producing books,
papers or records, in obedience to the order
of the Registrar or Commissioner, on the
ground that the evidence or documents required
of him may tend to criminate him or subject
him to any proceeding or penalty, but no such
evidence or documents shall be used or receivable against such person in any criminal proceedings thereafter instituted against him,
other than a prosecution for perjury in giving
evidence upon such investigation, inquiry,
cause or proceeding.
On second reading of the Bill, however,
on May 7, 1923, the Prime Minister intimated
that he would move an amendment to section
18 deleting the words "or documents" in the
phrase "but no such evidence or documents."
The Prime Minister's statement appears in
Hansard as follows:
There is one other slight amendment, which
is to strike out the words "or documents"
that appear in section 18, line 42, of the Act.
The section as drafted makes it obligatory
upon any person to give evidence before a
Registrar or Commissioner and to produce
documents. It goes on to state, however, that
whoever gives testimony cannot be bound in
a court of law by the oral testimony so given.
The clause as it now reads goes beyond granting protection as respects oral testimony and
includes documents. The effect of the Bill as
drafted would be that where any incriminatory

SENATE
documents niight be disclosed in the case of
an investigation, subsequently, when court proceedings were held, a combine might find its
means of escape f rom the just penalty of its
illegal actions by having these documents protected. lIt is, therefore, my purpose to meet
such a possible situation by providing that the
words "or documents" shaîl be deleted.
This is from page 2521 of the Huse of Commons Hansard of 1923.
When the Bill was in committea the Prime
Minister moved to delete the words "or documents' from hune 42, and also moved to
insert the word "oral" before the word "evidence" in lina 40. The following is the eomplete Hansard reference made ta section 18
whcn the Bill was in coinmittee:
SMr. Mackenzie King: 1 have an amendment
to this section, Mr. Chiairman, that 1 mentioned it was my intention to introduce. I
luove to amend the section by inserting the
word "oral" before the word "evidence" in
hune 40 and by striheiug out the words "or
documents" in hune 42 and substituting theref or
the words "su given." The section as it stands
protects in the event of a (riminal prosecution
any person as respects tl)e oral evidence which
he may have given, and also as respects documents be may have introduced.
It is quita
clear that unless the words "or documents"
are stricken out, the clause would only serve
to protect the combine lu the matter of the
evidence that was needed at the criminal
prosecution.
Mr. Mlurdock: I would point out in that
connection that it will be necessary to insert
the word "oral" in hune 4.
Mr. Mackenzie King: That is wbat I bave
done.
Amendment agreed to.
This is from pages 2631 and 2632 of the
flouse of Commons Hansard of 1923.
Notwithstanding this ameodment, question
was raised iu the Western fruit combine trial
in 1926 (The King v. Simington et al) as
to the ad.missibility of certain documents.
Counsei for thc defeuce arguad that the
word "evidence," in the phrase "but no such
evidaence," inchuded bath oral and dacumentary evideuce. The trial judge bald that
certain documents, those produced by a witness an examination before the cammissioner,
cauhd nat be used in evidence against the
witnass or the corporation from wbom they
were takcn. H1e stated, in addrassing Couinsel
for tbe Crown, "I arn incliued ta think the
Act takes away from you sometbing yau
would bave without the Act."
After this trial Counsel for the Crawn
recamnmended tbat the section be cba.nged, on
the gr.ound that "the effeet of the statuta as
it stands now is ta permit a xitness ta produce ail bis incriminating carrespandence and

Acoordînghy, representations
were ma4e iu 1927 ta the Revision of
Statutes Commission. The Commission .recogn.ized th-at it was the intention of Parliamnent
ta exempt only oral evidence, and authorized
the insertion of tbe word, "oral" beifore the
word "evideuc*e," thus remnoving a.uy ambigu'ity that existed.
No other change was made in tbe se-ction until tbe Act was ameuded in 1935,
wbeu the words "or documents" were reinserted.

Act tbat Mr. Justice Sed.gewick says: "I dare

not investigate, I dare not move, because the
end I have in view in investigating a combine is to discover the true state of affairs,
and the stronger I make my case by documentary evidence, the weaker will be the
case from the standpoint of the prosecutor
if 'a prosecution ensues."
I have here a memorandum which bas
been put into my hands:
Section 24 of the Combines Investigation
Act as it was passed in 1923 provided that
oral evidence required of a witness during an
investigation could not be used against the
witness in any criminal proceedings, but the
exemption did not extend to documents. In
the session of 1935 the section was amended
so as to make the same exemption apply to
documents, thus making it possible for a member of a combine to file with the commission
any incriminating documents which the commission might require him to produce, with
the knowledge that they could not be used
against him in any subsequent prosecution.
In facing trial after an investigation the
members of a combine would be in a stronger
position than if there had been no investigation. The more thorough the investigation the
less documentary evidence would be available
against them in the trial.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
vestigation is stupidly conducted.

If the in-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On the other hand, if the commission did
not order the production of documents during
an investigation, the evidence might well be
insufficient to justify sending the case on for
trial. Merely by calling for the production of
documents in an investigation the commission
would prevent the Court from receiving them
in evidence in a trial. As the Prime Minister
expressed it in 1923, "A combine miht find
its means of escape from the just penalty of
its illegal actions by having these documents
protected."
The present amendment is designed to
remove this exemption with respect to documents. The protection to a witness required
to give evidence will under the new section
be the same as that made available to witnesses
by section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.
Now, the Canada Evidence Act says:
No witness shall be excused from answering
any question upon the ground that the answer
to such question may tend to criminate him,
or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person.
If with respect to any question a witness
objects to answer upon the ground that his
answer may tend to criminate him, or may
tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of
any person, and if but for this Act, or the act
of any provincial legislature, the witness would
therefore have been excused from answering
such question, then although the witness is by
reason of this Act, or by reason of such
provincial act, compelled to answer, the answer
so given shall not be used or receivable in
evidence against him in any criminal trial, or
12745-35

other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution
for perjury in the giving of such evidence.
The difference between my right honourable friend and myself relates to the documents producedý-books or correspondence.
They are in the hands of the investigators.
A witness, the general manager, director, or
president, is brought in and examined on
these documents. He may make all the admissions he pleases, for his oral evidence
cannot be used against him. All that will
remain as evidence for the trial will be the
books and correspondence in the hands of the
investigators, plus whatever evidence may be
obtained concerning the authenticity of those
documents, other than evidence by the accused, for he is immune from any oral evidence he may have given before.
The situation is a fairly serious one. Mr.
Justice Sedgewdck said, "I dare not proceed
with an investigation"; and I knew the Department of Justice had expressed the same
opinion. This morning I wrote to the Deputy
Minister of Justice and asked him for a statement on this point. Here is the letter he
wrote to me:
In reply to your letter of the 18th instant
I may say that the view expressed by Judge
Sedgewick in his letter to the Prime Minister
of the 6th May, 1936, is that which I have
entertained from the outset with regard to
this matter. I am of opinion that if the
Combines Investigation Act is to be effectively administered, section 24 should be
amended so as to provide that documents, the
production of which is ordered by the conmission in an inquiry under the Combines
Investigation Act, should be admissible in any
subsequent criminal proceeding.
I wonder what disadvantage the accused
will suifer, whoever he is, if anything he bas
said before the investigator cannot be used
against him. All that can be used against him
are documents emanating from the individual,
or the corporation, and those documents can
be secured in very many ways.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The evidence
attached to his recognized signature, or the
signature of his correspondent, or the contract, cannot be used against him. While we
may discuss at length the propriety of allowing the investigator to obtain the books and
correspondence by divers means, I think we
should put nothing in the way of the prosecution of any inquiry instituted under the Combines Investigation Act. I do not see that any
injustice is done to anyone, since the
Registrar or investigator bas the right to secure
those documents in very many ways, and all
that is done in virtue of this Bill is to say that

REIsED EDITION

SENATE
they shall net be impounded and safe as
against a future prosecution. If no harm is
done te anyone, I cannot sec that any principle is violated. The documents are brought
in, and they are documents that should be
at the disposal of the trial judge if a prosecution ever follows. Undier these circumstances I should think that this amending Bill,
which was passed by the House of Commons

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All I rise te
speak of is the letter of the Deputy Minister
of Justice. The function of the Deputy
Minister of Justice is te advise on matters of
law, not matters of policy. I do net know
what letter ýmy honourable friend wrote te
him, but the reply certainly contained advice
on policy. I venture te say the Deputy Minister would not have given that if he had first
made a thorough review of the subject.
I simply asked
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
if he shared the opinion of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.
I do net
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
think one ean read Mr. Justice Sedgewick's
letter and say that any single sentence in
it contains a wrong statement of law; but
it is net a complete statement or one a
any value in d;eciding upon the wisdcom or
justice of such an amendment.
ln the result, documents which the investigator, under the Combines Investigation Act,
might require to have produced to him in his
investigation, would be privileged and not
admissible against the offender in a subsequent
prosecution if section 24 remains in its present
position.
That is true if the offender is the one the
Crown is under the necessity of calling inte
the box te prove the document; se neither
the Deputy Minister nor anybody else could
read the letter and say it was net right. But
why should the Crown prove a document
through the mouth of the man who may be
prosecutcd? There are a dozen other ways
of doing it, and they have te be adopted
for any other court. Why should the Cro.wn
ask to be excused here? That is my whole
case.

required shall be used or receivable against
such person," and so on. Does the right
honourable gentleman hold that to mean that
no such documents shall be used against the
man who produced them?
Right

lon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

That is it.

The CHAIRMAN: But does it not imply
that they shall not he used against the company or the persons in the alleged combine?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. The
law is that a man cannot be compelled to
give evidence against himself. I should like
the senator behind me to tell what occurred
in the coal cases, to show how great is the
disability cf an accused under the present Act.
The CHAIRMAN: Will somebody tell about
what happened in British Columbia, before
the coal cases?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was not
there; so I do not know what happened.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ask permission
to have Mr. MeGregor come onto the floor.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wish my
honourable friend would ask to have Hon.
Mr. Sedgewick here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not present.

Of course, he is

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Honourable members,
I was one of the attorneys in the coal cases.
There is no doubt that the court proceedings
were based entirely on the documentary
evidence, which evidence was not obtained
as it should have been, according to the .rules
of procedure. An officer simply goes to the
office of the accused and there takes all the
documents, from which he extracts whatever
suits his purpose. That documentary evidence
is filed, whether the accused likes it or not,
and regardless of whether it is of an incrirninating nature. Later it is published in
a report, and used against a person who was
not accused until after the investigation had
ended.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The investigators use the documents to their hearts'
content.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: That is all they use.
These investigations
The CHAIRMAN:
start off as fishing expeditions, do they not?
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Yes. But you cannot
carry on a fishing expedition before a court.
The CHAIRMAN: Officers who go looking
for an illicit still are on a fishing expedition.
The CHAIRMAN.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It may he all right
to carry on a fishing expedition in an investigation, but an accused should not be the
subject of a fishing expedition in court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend does not move against the
clause?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I shall
simply vote against it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that the
clause be adopted.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall I read the clause
again?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The CHAIRMAN: The marginal reference
is: "No person excused from giving evidence
on ground of incrimination. Protection from
oral evidence only." The section reads:
Section twenty-four of the Combines Investigation Act, chapter twenty-six of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, as enacted by section
seventeen of chapter fifty-four of the statutes
of 1935, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:"24. No person shall be excused from attending and giving evidence and producing books,
papers or records, in obedience to the order
of the Commission, on the ground that the oral
evidence or documents required of him may
tend to criminate him or subject him to any
proceeding or penalty, but no such oral
evidence so given shall be used or receivable
against such person in any criminal proceedings thereafter instituted against him, other
than a prosecution for perjury in the giving
of such evidence."
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was
negatived: contents, 7; non-contents, 18.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable members, to concur in
the report of the committee?
I move that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
consideration of the committee's report he
postponed until to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.

GOVERNMENT ANNUITIES
REPORT

OF

SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consider the second
report of the speicial committee appointed
to consider and report upon the operation
of the Government Annuities Act.
Honourable
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, as I was a member of the special

JUNE 18, 1936
committee appointed to inquire into the operation of the Government Annuities Act, J do
not intend to take any exception to the
committee's report, but I really think that
possibly the committee's work was too hurried, because of the other committees that
we had to attend.
And although I was
present at all the meetings of the committee,
so far as I know, I was not aware that a
report was being brought down until we
had it before us. Furthermore, I feel that
possibly the committee did not make all the
inquiries that should have been made in
connection with Government annuities.
The report now before us for adoption
makes certain recommendations, with some
of which I think we all can agree. But it
seems to me that it does not tell the Senate
certain vital and important things that should
have been told. I have been looliing at some
evidence that was given in 1934 before a
special committee of the Senate on this very
matter, and I am going to read some extracts indicating the origin of these annuities
and also what has been accomplished in the
two years since that committee sat. We all
know that these two years have brought
about many remarkable changes in world
affairs, particularly with regard to matters of
finance.
The special committee of 1934 had before
it the Superintendent -of the Annuities Branch.
He was asked by the chairman, the honourable senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson), to tell what had been done in the past,
and he made the following statement:
As you know, the Annuities Act was passed
in 1908. Sir Richard Cartwright, then Minister of Trade and Commerce, introduced the
Bill in the Senate, and the Hon. W. S.
Fielding took charge of it in the House of
Commons. Mr. Fielding made a few changes
in the Bill, but subsequent events showed that
Sir Richard was right.
Sir Richard when
introducing the Bill in the Senate made a
very interesting speech, in which he predicted
several things that have since come to pass,
even the depression. He was a real statesman.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What year
was that, please?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

1908.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
that?

As late as

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: So this evidence
states. I myself was surprised when I read
that.
The Bill provided that the money received
from the purchasers of annuities should be
invested by the Minister of Finance in
Dominion of Canada bonds and in first-class
provincial bonds, the fund to be kept separate
f rom the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This
provision was changed by Mr. Fielding. He

did not want to be bothered with the investment of the small amounts of money that would
probably be received from the sale of annuities.
The rate of interest was first fixed at 3 per
cent, and Mr. Fielding did not think this
enough; so 4 per cent was finally decided upon.
This was all right for the Government for a
few years, but then the general rate of interest jumped to 5 per cent and 5à per cent;
then it receded to 5 per cent and ultimately
to 4j per cent. So the Government was paying only 4 per cent during all those years,
because an annuity is a straight loan, just
the same as a bond.
The Chairman: During those years the Government made something on the interest.
Mr. Blackadar: Yes.
The annuities are based on the mortality
experience of the British offices of 1893, which
was the standard table used all over the world
until a few years ago, when a new mortality
table was gotten out and is now the accepted
standard. The Government still uses the old
mortality table.
That was two years ago, when this statement
was made.
The rates have remained the same, with the
exception that in 1921 the Act was amended
to make the death benefit on the deferred
annuities 4 per cent, but we increased the
Conserate of premium correspondingly.
quently there really was no change in the basis
on which the rate was worked out. We did
that to offset the adverse effect produced by
people thinking they were investing in a 3
per cent proposition, when really it was 4
per cent.
Certain honourable members of the special
committee which investigated this matter
appear to believe that the Government is
paying out very substantial sums of money for
the benefit of those who have invested in
Dominion Government annuities. In this connection I may refer to a memorandum from
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. Let me
quote paragraph 6, for I think all honourable
senators should have it before them. This is
the paragraph:
As the present rates and conditions are so
advantageous, the premiums received by the
Government have trebled during the last two
years and have increased ten-fold since 1927,
as indicated in the following statistics:Liabilities under
existing annuity
Income from
contracts
premiums
Year:
$11,446,119
$ 1,894,885
1927..
35,023,476
7,071,439
1934..
46,906,192
13,376,400
1935..
65,000,000*
20,000,000*
1936..
*Approximately.
This growth by itself seems ample proof that
the rates are much out of line with what they
should be, yet the policy bas been further
to encourage the sale of Government annuities,
every one of which is issued on an unsound
financial basis.
I want to refer again to evidence produced
before the committee two years ago, of a
sort which we did not secure this year, for

550

SENATE

lack of time or some other reason. On that
occasion the Superintendent of Dominion
Government Annuities was asked by the honourable senator from Edmonton:
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: Why do you call it a
guaranteed ten-year annuity?

Mr. Blackadar: If he died at the start his
estate would not lose all that he had paid in;
the annuity would continue for ten years to
The cost of those
his wife or family.
annuities is within the reach of the average
person.
The Chairman: Last year you took in
$7.000,000 odd?
Mr. Blackadar: Yes.
The Chairman: How much did you pay out?
Mr. Blackadar: About $2,500,000.
Of course, honourable senators realize that
this does not by any means indicate the
liability assumed. The point is that to get
any correct estimate of what the Annuities
Branch is doing at the present time we should
have a more thorough investigation than we
have been able to carry on this session.
It bas been stated, not once but several
times, that originally the promoters hoped
that Government annuities might in many
cases obviate the payment of old-age pensions
or, under present-day conditions, unemployment relief-something we knew nothing about
in 1908 and never dreamt of. The report now
before us contains an expression of opinion
to the effeet that last year the Governrment
lost $400,000 on its annuity business. I am not
at all sure that those figures are accurate; in
fact my personal judgment is that they are
not. But let us say there is a bookkeeping
loss of approximately $400,000. No honourable
senator can dieny that persons now drawing annuities might have been on the dole for the last
year or two but for their foresight in making
provision for their old age. We do not know
how many of those annuitants may be taking
care of sons and daughters and other relatives
unable to get work. I can well imagine that
many annuitants drawing, let us say, $100 a
month are helping to take care of Canadians
who otherwise might 'be a charge upon the
federal, provincial or municipal treasury.
Therefore it seems to me we ought to be very
careful before adopting any suggestion which
might handicap a very important branch of the
Government se'rvice in helping those Canadian
citizens who are willing to help themselves.
I am net in strong disagreement with
the report except paragraph 4, which says
that a continuous audit should be maintained
for the information of the Minister in charge
of annuities and the Minister of Finance. To
me, although I am a member of the committee, that is just pure nonsense, for unquestionably the Minister of Finance bas the
necessary and proper check. I am not in
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

general disagreement with the recommendalions. For instance, I think that under present
conditions we are paying too high a rate of
interest. I am not sure that we should eut the
rate -down to 3à per cent, which is suggested, in
order te cover all expenses. Truc, the Annuities Branch bas in the past been maintained
as a separate entity at Government expense;
in other words, annuitants have been getting
the full benefit of the business, which bas been
carried on at the expense of others. I think
annuitants should pay the administration expenses. But apparently some persons desireI hope I am wrong-to curtail any further
efforts of the Annuities Branch. I do not think
its work should be curtailed. We ought to be
devising ways and means of making this a
more profitable undertaking for the benefit of
Canadians who in the years to come may be
ready to take care of themselves in their old
age. I think it might be for the benefi.t of the
people if larger amounts of money were
secured on a proper basis from Canadians who
are willing to help themselves in this way.
A great deal more might be said on the
subject, and I hope other honourable senators
will deal with it, particularly the honourable
Mr.
(Hon.
Edmonton
from
gentleman
Griesbach). I notice that in 1934 he took a
prominent part in the work of the committee
and brought out a good deal of information.
I have expressed these opinions and referred
to wha-t took place two years ago lest a false
impression might be created by adoption of
the report now before us.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
adoption of the report?

Do you move

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I am not at all in favour of abolishing the Annuities Branch. I hope I have not
given to the House the impression that I
favour its abolition. I do think, though, the
business has expanded to the point where it
ought to carry itself. I understood from a
remark by the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Mudock)-he will correct
me if I am mistaken-that he thinks larger
annuities might be permitted to those who
wish to make larger provision for their old age.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, no.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am glad to
hear that. I am not at all in favour of larger
annuities. In fact I think one of the abuses
is that the annuities now may be purchased,
and legîtimately, by people quite well off,
and thereby they escape a measure of income
tax. That is one of the things I had in mind
in supporting the inquiry.

JTJNE 18, 1936
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: I think $1,200 a year
sbould be the limait.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators, as
a member of the special committee whose
report is now before us, I may say that we
had the pleasure of tbe assistance of the
honourabie memïber from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
.Murdock), but I must add very candidly that
while listening to him I did not recognive
that be had sat on the committee, for the
eriticism which he now makes of the report
he certainly refrained from making when we
were studying it in the committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You mean when y9u
were there.
Hon. Mr. COTE: 1 mean at the last meeting of the committee, when tbe report was
submitted and discus.sed. However, I will
not pursue that thought. I am simply rising,
in the absence of the chairman, Hon. Mr.
Black, to move adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, I served as a member of the Special
Committee on Government Annuities, but
unfortunately I was not present at all its
meetings. I was chairman of the committee
whicb met in 1934, to which reference bas
been made. It is my impression that the
annuities system is a good thing if the business is properly carried on. It is my opinion,
from the evidence we heard, that there shýould
be a revision of the rates and the mortality
tables. The report of the Government actuary
showed that the rate of mortality had changed
tremendously in the past twenty-five years.
and indicated tbat the present tables were
very much out of date.
Thbere is a system in England which carnies
itself, I believe. and enables the Goverument
to ebtain money fro>m the people who wish
to buy annuities. Such, I think, was one of
the ideas former Finance Ministers had with
regard to our own system. By means of
annuities they were getting money more
cheaply than they eouid get it in the market.
Whýile the mortality tables were not correct,
the rate of interest was very reasonable.
Now interest rates have ohanged.
I think I can support the adoption of the
report as a whole. I regret that the committee did flot have time to go further into
the matter and to embody more details in
jts report. Much more could have been
aceomplished, 1 believe, had time p.ermited.
I think that the committee has done good
work, and that the report is a reasonable one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire aimply
te say that I shahl be happy to bring the
report to the attention of the Department

1

of Labour, which is charged with the administration of annuities, and also the Department of Finance, which is vitally interested
ini this inatter.
lion. Mr. 'GRIESiBACH: The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) has mentioned my name in connection
wjth tbis matter. I was flot a member of
this year's committee, but was a member
of the previous committee which looked into
the question of annuities.
Ail I want to say, as an outsider, is that
in raising the rates the Government would
be well advised. to consider the rate of intereýst
at whieh it will be able to horrow money
for the next t.wenty years. Two years ago
we were told that the average cost of money
over a twenty-year period had been 4-6 per
cent, and that the average cost of annuities
was 4-10 per cent, the resuit. being a profit
to the Government, based on tbe way in which
the business was donc. Now that the Gevernment is borrowing money at 3-25 per cent,
annuities sold on the old basis are obviousiy
being sold too oheap. The Government must
assume the responsibility of determining
whether or not that rate of interest. is going
to continue for the next eig.hteen years, or
what the rate of interest, will be.
The mortality tables, which were unearthed
by this committee, of course put a new
complexion on the matter.
1 think the purpose of the report is mereiy
to put the Government upon inquiry in this
matter, which, after ail., is the responsibility
of the Government; and if tbe report dees
th-at, and the Government takes appropriate
action in the premises, the work of the committee will be worth while.
The motion was agreed to.
SUPREME COURT 0F CANADA
ABOLITION 0F APPEALS FROM UNANIMOUS
JUDGMENTS.-MOTION-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resu.med from June 10 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Casgrain:
That in the opinion of the Senate, a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Dominion of
Canada, when unanimous, should be final except
in constitutional cases.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable memibers, it is really useiess for me te
begin to diseuss this motion with any ide-a of
finishing by six o'clock, and I cannet be
here to-morroyw.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Proceed.

SENATE
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: The
honourable gentleman who has made this
motion (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has supported it
by so many and so varied arguments that I
cannot help fearing that in trying to oppose
it, and to answer some of the .things te has
said, I may be compelled to occupy as mueh
time as te did. Hoping that that may not be
my fate, I shall go at once to what I think is
the very root of the matter.
Appeals from Canada to the Judicial Conmittee are of two classes. As tas already
been said, there may be an appeal as a matter
of statutory right, or there may be an appeal
as a matter of grace.
It is of importance to keep those two manners of appeal entirely distinct, because this
motion does not in any way touch the question of appeals by statutory right. These
are appeals to which there is a right, ordinarily, by some statute of the colony, the province, or the Dominion from which they are
brought. There is that right of appeal in
certain prescribed cases in the province of
Ontario, and equally there is the same statutory right of appeal in the province of
Quebec. I am not in a position to say what
the law on the subject is in any of the other
In the province of
provinces of Canada.
Ontario, and, I .think, equally in the province of Quebec, that statutory right bas existed
for a great many years. I think it was early
after the Constitutional Act of 1791 that statutes were passed by the legislatures of these
colonies providing that right of appeal. It
does not by any means extend to all cases;
it really extends to a very few. The amount
involved must be considerable before there
is any such right to appeal; end in other
respects the right is surrounded, by the provisions of the sta;tute, with many restrictions
which limit in large measure the number of
such appeals which can be taken. Of course,
this Parliament tas no control over such statutory right of appeal. It is a matter of property and civil rights in the province, and
no matter what we in this Parliament did,
either by resolution, as we are now asked to
proceed, or by statute, that right of appeal
would not be affected.
All other Canadian appeals that can now go
before the Judicial Committee are appeals by
special leave given in the exercise of the
King's prerogative right. So this motion concerns literally and entirely the exercise by
His Majesty of bis prerogative rights as king
and ruler.
The motion relates wholly to appeals from
the judgment of our Supreme Court. In the
Supreme Court Act there is now, and there
always bas been, a clause to which my ton'Uon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

ourable friend referred in moving the motion,
but which he did not read or put upon Hansard. It is now section 54 of the Supreme
Court Act, Chapter 35 of the Revised Statutes of 1927. This section stands by itself
in the statute under the general heading,
"Judgment final and conclusive." It reads:
The Judgment of the Court shall, in all
cases, be final and conclusive, and no appeal
shall be brought from any judgment or order
of the Court to any court of appeal established by the Parl!iament of Great Britain and
Ireland, by which appeals or petitions to His
Majesty in Council may be ordered to be
heard, saving any right which His Majesty
may be graciously pleased to exercise by virtue
of bis royal prerogative.
When the Supreme Court Act was passed,
in 1875, it would have been perfectly competent to the Dominion Parliament te provide
for a statutory right of appeal te the Privy
Couneil. A statutory right of appeal had long
existed in the two provinces of Canada, and
probably also in the Maritime Provinces. But
in the Act creating the court the Parliament
of Canada not only omitted to include any
statutory right of appeal from the decisions of
that court, but also, in express terms, negatived
that right of appeal. Now my honourable
friend wants to introduce into our law a modification of that negativing of the right of
appeal. He wants to create a new statutory
right of appeal in all cases in which the court
is not unanimous, and also to except constitutional cases from this express statutory
law.
I cannot understand my honourable friend's
motion, in the light of the arguments by which
te tas supported it. There is already., and tas
always been, in the statute itself the careful
provision that this denial of statutory right of
appeal is not in any way te affect His.Majesty's
prerogative right to give permission to appeal,
as a matter of grace. And indeed I should
think it could not be otherwise. Would anyone argue-I do not know whether the tonourable gentleman who proposed this question
would-that the Parliament of Canada. even
if acting by statute instead of by resolution
of one of its Houses, could limit the royal
prerogative in any way? Would anyone even
think that? Why, the royal prerogative, the
official actions of the King as head of the
state, are necessarily matters of Imperial interest. I submit that no Parliament in the
Empire, except the Imperial Parliament itself
acting with the assent of His Majesty himself,
could limit or lessen bis prerogative rights.
I want to call attention to what I must be
permitted to say is, I think, an entire misappretension on the part of the honourable gentlenan as to what the right of appeal te His

JUNE 18, 1936
Mai esty is. At the opening of his remarks, as
reported at page 435 of our Hansa.rd, be said:
Lt should be borne in mind that appeal to,
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
has nothing whatever to do with the inherent
and absolute right of any British subject to
lay bis complaint, his grievance, or his petition, at the foot of the Throne.
I agree with the honourable gentleman as to
the existence of this inherent and absolu te
right of the subject. But as I read on 1
found thet the honourable gentleman wa
thinking of an entirely cifferent thing. He
proceeded to illustrate his point by telling us
of an occasion when, acting for seine colleagues
or clients, certain bondholders, hie had exercised
his right, as hie thought it, te go to the foot
of the Throne, in the person of the LieutenantGovernor of the province of Quebec. That
wau not anything in the nature of an application to Ris Majesty or Ris Majesty's representative to exercise this prerogative right.
That was an application to the LieutenantGovernor of the province to enable the applicant to obtain permission to bring an action;
not to appeal at all. The two things are as
completely distinct as any two thingg in the
world could be. When anyone has a dlaim,
of whatever nature, against the government, or
the people, of any province, dominion or
colony, it is in formn a dlaim against the Crown.
Well, the King, the wearer of the Crown, cannlot be summoned into one of bis own courts
without his consent; so consent is given by
Ris Mai esty's Attorney-General for the provin-ce or dominion or colony, as the case may
be. That is not a petition pmeented' at the
foot of the Throne, 'but is simply an application
to the attorney of the public that hie will consider the nature of the dlaim which it is desired to bring into the court, and wilI assent
to its being litigated.
That right of application on the part of
every would-ýbe litigant is in these latter days
apparently considered to be something which
the Attorney-General of Canada, or of a
province, may and ought to use his own discretion about granting. 1 can only say that
in this respect 1 personally have very different
ideas, and that some twenty-five or thirty
years ago, during the time I was AttorneyGeneral of Canada, there were scores of such
cases and neyer did 1 refuse, or think of refusing, to shlow the litigant to bring his suit.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. SIR ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable memnbers, before the six o'clock adjournment I had tried to point out that the
only effect of adopting the resolution which is

553

before us for consideration would be to widen
rather than to restrict the class of cases in
rwbioh, at presei9t, the judgment of our
Supreme Court is by statute absolutely final.
But clearly the real purpose of the motion is to
endeavour to limit further, or in some way Vo
restrict, the exercise of the prerogative right
to sllow an appeal upon a petition of the subject. Therefore, the ail-important consideraVion in dealing with this question is the nature
of that prerogative right.
The prerogative right is noV a matter of
statute; it is a necessary resuit of any
monarchical system of government, and whatever may be the constitutionai position of
the head of the state in any other monarchy in
the world, the position of the King, as head
of the Empire, in British countries and British
communities, is founded upon the legal axiom
that the King is the source sud fountain of
justice.
The King administers justice in present days
through the agency, or by the means, of
sppointed representatives. IV was flot always
so, even in England. Under the Norman kings
-and the earlier Piantagenets, the King had no
justices and no judges; no courts except hie
own when he held. a court as King. In later
years, because business so increased snd multiplied that it was an absolute physical impossibility for any one man Vo do the work of
administering justice among his subjects, there
came to b.e representatives of the King, delegates of the King we might almost cali them,
appointed by him to administer justice. So,
courts gradually came to be constituted, by
legisiation when there was a parliament to
legisîste, and- to-d-ay the King is not merely the
source and fountain of justice, but the
supreme tribunal of justice tÜhroughout the
Empire. He is supreme noV oniy over persons, but equaliy over ail courts within the
Empire; and the final appeal, reguiated now
as it is by statute, is none the less an appeal
to the King, as head of the state, to sec that
justice is administered throughout the state.
My honourabie friend who introduced this
motion spoke of the difference between the
way in which appeais from courts of the
United Kingdom are dealt wiith, and the way
of dealing with appeuls from Canada and frora
other dominions of the King outside the United
Ringdom. There is noV in fact any difference
in principle. In both cases they are appeals
to the King. In Great Britsin appeais from
ail the courts go for hearing Vo the House of
Lords, because in earlier tiines, before there
were any other dominions of the Ring, those
appeals were to the King in Parliament. In
the beginnings of the history of the British
Parliament the King was pensonally present
and occupied his Throne. That Parliament

554

SENATE

did not then consist of two Houses. All members of it met as one assenbly, with the King
upon his Throne as the presiding member of
that ýaugust tribunal. In the theory of the
law that is to-day the exact position in regard
to appeals-in any event, of appeals to the
House of Lords.
My honourable friend made one little slip
in his address. wben he spoke of the Judicial
Committee as being a branch of the House of
Lords. At least, it is so recorded in Hansard. That, of course, he did not intend to
say. for no one is better aware than my honourable friend himself that there are several
members of the Judicial Committee, in fact
a majority as it is constituted to-day, who are
not members of the House of Lords at all.
We have three representatives from Canada:
Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Sir Lyman Duff and
Sir William Mulock. All three are members
of the Judicial Committee in virtue of ,their
position as members of the Imperial Privy
Council.
Appeals fron British courts to the House of
Lords at the present day are dealt with by
the sane individuals who, gen-erally speaking, sit in appeals from the colonies. The
Law Lords are appointed members of the
House of Lords, made peers for liffe, for their
experience as judges or their eminent position at the Bar; and it is their business to
sit either in the House of Lords or in the
Judicial Committee as occasion may require.
So there is no real difference in principle, or
in fact. between the manner in which, at the
present day, an appeal is dealt with, whether
it comes from one of the courts of England
and Scotland or from a dominion or other
outlying part of the Empire.
Let me point out exactly how such an appeal
is an appeal to the King himself-a petition
lodged at the foot of the Throne. I am
thinking of the manner in which, at the
present day. an appeal. to the Privy Council
if you like-to the Judicial Committee-is
begun in the Channel Islands. The Channel
Islands are so wedded to the ancient customs
that their court proceedings still are carried
on orally, instead of being, as in Canada and,
I think. all over the rest of the Empire, entirely in writing. When any litigant in the Channel Islands feels aggrieved by the decision of
ane of his courts and intends to appeal to
the King, be does it by the ancient clameur
de Haro. He goes to the market cross, and,
falling on his knees before it, throws his arms
around the upright, where be cries aloud,
"Haro! Haro!! Haro!!! A l'aide, mon prince.
On ne fait tort." He is appealing to his Duke
of Normandy-to King Edward VIII of England-the lineal descendant and successor of
s'r ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

Rollo, first Duke of Normandy a thousand
years ago, and he cries aloud for justice to his
ancient Duke--'Ha! Rollo."
That is literally and exactly the manner in
which the right of appeal by a British subject
seking redress of a grievance, this right to
claim the exercise of the royal prerogative,
is carried out in actual practice to-day. But
in Canada we put the petition into writing.
Any litigant who feels himself aggrieved
by the decision, not merely of the Supreme
Court of Canada, but of any court in the
King's dominions-no matter whether it be
a police court, a magistrate's court or any other
-has the undoubted right to petition his King,
claiming that he has been treated unjustly or
wrongly in one of the King's courts and
praying that justice be done. When such a
petition reaches the Kinig it is referred by
him at once, either under general order or
under special order applicable in the particular case, to his Judicial Committee for consideration. As I hove stated, that committee is not a branch of the House of Lords.
It is simply a committee, like any other
committee, of the King's Privy Council.
Every member of the committee is necessarily sworn first as a Privy Councillor. Every
petition from a British subject or any other
litigant who bas a grievance is referred in
such manner to this Judicial Committee. In
exactly the same way the public affairs of
every governmen't go, not to the King personally, nor, in the dominions, to His Excedlency. the representative of the King, but
to a committee of the Privy Council. Every
cabinet, every government, is but a conmittee of the larger body of all the Privy
Councillors of the dominion or colony, as
the case 'may be, or of Great Britain.
The Judicial Committee deals with a

form, though it may be in substance, acting
as a court. It is acting judicially, in that
respect just like our Divorce Committee,
which performs judicial work at its every

recommendations to the Senate. In exactly

Privy Council, on a reference of any petition from the King, meets to deal with it

JUNE 18, 1936
After leave to appeal has beeni giveri and
the appeal itself formaliy argued before the
committee., the comimittee makee no decree.
Like our Divorce Committee, it s8rnply
recomamendes. The inenhers of the committee agree among themeelves upun what
advice thoy shalill offer to the King in
respect of every petition. My honourable
friend says they are always unanimous. But
is that not true of any committee? No matter
what differences of opinion may exist in a
committee, its report to, ita superior bodyr
is one. It could not4 be otherwise. Hom
couid advice be given to the Ring except
by a report which, on the sm-face at any
ra-te, appears to be a unanimous report?
The-re is no such thing as a minority report
of that committee, or any other, for that
matter. A report from a minority would not
be a report from the committee.
When the Judicial Commnittee makes a
finding of judgment it expresses it by way
of advice to His Majesty. That advice in
formai shape, that report or recommendation.
whatever you picase to cail it, goes to, the
Ring and is deait with, flot by any committee
of the Privy 'Council, but by the Ring himseif
sitting in Council. When wc in Canada get
a judgment of the court, as it may be called,
it is an order and decree of the Ring himself,
surrounded by members of the Privy Council
who have been summoned; and the names of
those councillors in attendance are always
recorded upon the face of the order.
My honourable friend seemed to think that
ho was putting a compiete poser when he
askod the question: suppose the courts here
do not obey the order, what then? Weii,' it
is littie wonder that nobody could answer.
But 1 may say to ýmy honourable friend that
this is the course of procedure. The original
order or decree of the Ring, disposing of the
litigation. is filed in the office of the court
from whose decision the appeal was made.
On its being se filed it becornes a judgment
of that court. In Ontario, at ieast. it is
made a judgment of the court itself by the
statute which gives the righit of appeai. The
procedure is exaetly the saine in the oase of
an appeal under the prerogative right, an
appeal of grace. Once the Ring's decree is
pronounced and the official certificate of it
cornes to Canada, that certificate, on being
fiied, becomes, ipso facto, a decree of the court
and is enforced by that court juat as one of
its own judgments wouid -be enforced. Such
a decroe may be subject to the saine difficuities
in execution as is any judgment of the court.
For instance, if an officer of the court, in
execution of the decree, seized upon goods or
property not beionging to the man condemned

555

to pay, the true owner would have bis legal
rights, not in opposition to the decree, but in
objection to the manner in which it had been
executed by the court officer. But the decree
itself becomes and remains simpyly the judgment of the court which has been appeaied
from.
1 need hardly pause to say-and yet I have
to say it-that the rigbt of any British subject
to petition the King for red-ress of his
grievances seemas to me one of the most
valuabie rights that any subject couid posseas.
Why shouid any person seek to deprive hie
fel'low citizen of that right? I do flot think
any person can succeed in doing so, but why
should anyone want to do so? It may weil be
that some man does not value that right; that
he thinks he will neyer have any need to exercisc it. 1 have neyer had, personaiiy, but if I
should have I shouid think a great wrong had
been done me by any feilow subjeot who had
tried, to deprive me of it. Let me remind
honourabie senators how important that right
is, however it may be looked at. Think of
the Rýing's own officiai oath at Coronation.
The King piedges his royal, word and honour,
by soiemnn oath, that he wiil govern according
to iaw a*nd 'that to the utmost of his power he
will cause iaw and justice, in mcercy, to be
executed in ail hbis judgments. Would anyone
seek to restrict or limit the Ring in carrying
out his oath of office? That soiemn piedge
bteing made by the King on bis Coronation to
every one of his subjects, what does the subject
do in return? He gives to the King bis
equaily solemn oath of faithful, true allegiance.
As long as that relation exists beitween the
Ring on the one part and the subjcct on the
other, so long ought the subject, as a nocessary consequence and resuit of it, to have the
unfettered .rig-ht to appeal to his Ring for
justice, and the Ring to have the equei right
and power to sec that justice is done to that
su j ect.
The very duty of the Ring as head of the
State to see that justice is administered seems
to me to be the essential attribute of kingship. Gertainly it is as ancient as kingship
itseif. We ail remnember the story in the Bible
of the wise judgment delivered 'by Ring Solomon when trwo womnen were disputing before
him as to which was the mother of the living
ýchild. There is an instance, Vhree thousand
years ago, where the Ring as head of the
state was exercising bis right of administering
-justice because he had nobody eise to do> that
work for hMm. A thousand years afterwards
we have St. Paul exercising this identical right
of appeai to the Emperor as head of the state
-to the Privy Council if you iike. Paul, arrested in Jerusalemn for an aileged breach of

Roman?" The chief captain was astonished
to hear this Jew was a Roman citizen. and
answered, "With a great sumn ohtained I this
freedom." And Paul said, "But I was free
born." Two years later, when bie was before
the Roman Governor Festus, and Festus was
minded to send bim back to Jerusalem to be
dealt with by the Jews, Paul again assert-ed bis
rigbt as a Roman citizen and said, "I appeal

Nero, Paul went to Rome.
If hie bad

bave been different. That appeal to, Caesar
was valuable to Paul. It is just as valuable
to-day to every British subject wbho thinks he
bas a grievance in one of the King's courts.
Now, wben it becomes at least an academic
question, if not a practical, one, whetber
this Parliament or this Senate .should do anything to limit or cut down that rigbt of appeal,
I desire to question, and to question strongly,
the competence of any Canadian Parliament
to do anytbing of the sort. 0f course, no one
would argue that a mere resolution of one
Bouse of Parliament would bave any such
effeot. But my bonourable friend, instead of
moving this resolution, might have introduced,
as bie had a perfect rigbt to do, a Bill to make
judgmients of the Supreme Court, when unanimous, final and conclusive, and to amend the
section of the Act whicb I bave read, by
cutting out the concluding words, "saving any
right wbicb Bis Majesty may be graciously
pleased to exercise by virtue of bis royal
prerogative."
Tbat would be a measure
wbich in my opinion the Parliament of Canada bas no power to enact.
My honourable friend referred at considerable lengtb to the eorrespondence excbanged between Lord Carnarvon and Mr.
Edward Blake when Mr. Blake was Minister
of Justice. Tbey wtere not dealing at alI with

týhey were discussing was the competency of
the Canadian Parliament to legislate on tbe
subject, and to pass an Act which should declare 'that, with that exception, tbere sbould be

complished ini that correspondence was that
the British authorities did not see fit to act
under the power whicb the British North
America Act gives tbem to disallow Canadian legisiation. That powver, by the way,
stili exists. It is said to be obsole-te, neyer
exercised; but it is there. And long may
it stay there, for, so long as it is there, no
one is in a position to say that Canada is an
independent State free from the British
Empire.
In my opinion-for what it may be worthonly the Parliamont of Great Britain and the
King's own assent to its legisiation could
destroy or cut down this prerogative right.
Following the samne thought, let me point
out how appropriate it is that petitions should
be referred by the King to the Privy Council
at Westminster, and not to the Privy Council
of any other part of the Empire.. The only
Privy Couin.cil in whieh the whole Empire is
represented is the King's Privy Council in
England. We haire our own Canadian members of that Privy Council. Two of them are
sitting in this Chamber, and there are tbree
or four in the other House. These gentlemen
are by their appointments representatives of
Canada in the King's Imperial Privy Council.
So it is with other dominions and colonies
and portions of the Empire. No doubt, in
mai ority the King's Privy Cou-ncil is composed
of men from the British Isles, but none the
less it is an Imperial Privy Council, and the
only Priv~y Council for the whole Empire. It
is then the only appropriate body out of
wliich to form a committee wbich shall advise
the King in regard to petitions for appeals

presence in that committee of tbree Canadian
representatives. In the samne way there are
representatives from other dominions, and
such representatives can at any time, as
occasion may arise, be increased in number,
and the Privy Counicil, or the Jiidicial Committree, made ail the more Imperial.
That committee, or that council, is no more
English than it is Indian, Canadian or South
African. It is literally a council for the whole
Empire. It sits in London. but only because
London is the most convenient place for it
to sit. It might be situated, at any time.
anywhere else in the Empire. London is the

JUNE 18, 1936
place most like the centre or the heart of
the Empire. Just in the same way that
London is the place where, for the most part,
the King himself bas to be, so it is naturally
and conveniently the place where his Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council sits.
In contemplation of the law the Sovereign
is everywhere throughout the Empire, especially in his courts of justice, and
his high courts of Parliament. Sometimes
people-I am glad my honourable friend
is not one of them-attempt to throw a
little bit of ridicule, and very cheap at
that, upon the phrase "foot of the Throne."
That Is a, figurative expressio'n in some
respects, but in this case it is .literally true.
Is it not literally and equally true in the
case of this legislative Chamber? We use
those very words in our Minutes. Every
time His Excellency takes his seat in this
Chamber it is "upon the Throne." If the
Chief Justice comes as the répresentative of
His Exoellency, he takes his seat not "upon
the Throne," but "at the foot of the Throne."
So too our Speaker, when he enters this
Chamber to convene a meeting of the
Senate, bows formally and, I am sure, with
absolute sincerity, not to the piece of furniture which is now behind him, but to the
theoretical presence there, upon thaît Throne,
of the King himself, .or the King's representative in this country. The appeal to the foot
of the Throne is, then, literally and exactly
the appeal which, so far as I can do it, I
want to prevent any interference with.
My honourable friendi read several letters
from legal gentilemen. I do not intend to
follow him in any discussion of them. Those
gentlemen are entitled to their own opinion.
They do not influence mine. My opinion is
directly the - other way, and I intend to
retain it, notwithstanding what those gentlemen have said. But there is one phrase in
the -letter from Mr. Campibel, which my
honourable friend readi, that I muet make
a remark about. The letter, which appears
on page 473 of Hansard, says:
If, in view of the British North America
Act and of the statement that there may be a
general court of Appeal for Canada there
could be any argument that an appeal still
lay to the foot of the Throne, it would seem
to me to be a consequence that such appeal
would lie to the King, to be referred by him
not to the Judicial Committee, but to His
Privy Council for Canada.
I agree-if Canada is not part of the Empire;
if the King in his dominion over Canada is
a separate legal entity from the King in
his capacity as King of Great Britain and
the other dominions beyond the seas. Then,
of course, it would be logical that any peti-

557

tion to aippea.1 from this Dominion of the
King's should be reêferred to the Pri;vy Council of this Dominion. But let me point out
how exactly opposite the situation is.
Some publicists in advocating the modern
idea of getting free from Imperial shackles
have used the analogy of the relationship
which existed for 125 years between Hanover
and England, when the Elector o! Hanover
was at the same time King of England. He
then had two legal relationships: one to his
dominion of Hanover, and his Hanoverian
subjects. and another to his dominions in
Great Britain and overseas, and his British
subjects. Buit there was no unity between
those two relations. They were abso'lutely
separate and distinct, each from the other.
To illustrate how plain it is, think of the
position of a Hanoverian who might have
come to make his domioile in Engliand.
He was not a British subject belfore he
came, he was not any more a British subject after he came, andt he could not exercise
in England the slightest right of a British
That is
subjeot unless he was naturalizeds
not quite the situation as regards Canada
and Eng-land-at al1 events, not juet yet;
and because it is not, and because Canada
is a part of the British Empire, and because
our King is King of the whole Empire, the
only appropriate place to which he can
refer petitions for justice is to his Im.perial
Privy Council, and not to bis Privy Council
for any of his dominions.
Then my honourable friend cited the opinion
of Lord Brougham. I do not know when that
opinion was given. I am sorry we have not
the date. As I read it in the Hansard report
I wondered when it was. Lord Brougham was
for three or four years Lord Chancellor of
England, but the Government of which he
was a member was dismissed by King William
IV; and of course there was a good deal of
noise made about it. However, that was the
fact, and Lord Brougham was never afterwards a member of any government. It was
Lord Brougham who introduced and had
passed, and who, I suppose, had largely drafted,
the statute of 1833 which remodelled the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and
in virtue of which the procedure or method of
hearing our Canadian appeals still goes on.
But Lord Brougham had no voice in any
appointments to that Judicial Committee after
he ceased to be a member of King William's
Government in, I think, 1834. He lived for
thirty-four years more, and it is not surprising, perhaps, that he did not have the very
best opinion of the gentlemen who constituted
the Judicial Committee during those thirty-

SENATE

558

four years. However, whetber or flot that is
the case. I want to say merely this, that until
about fifty or fifty-five years ago the Judicial
Commnittee, in its composition, did flot coinmand the great respect and admiration whjch
ever since ith'as comman&d. I suppose it was
considered by the British statesmen of that
day as a maitter of no very great consequence.
But from the time of our -Confederation,
from 1867, and the moment important constitutional appeals began going from Canada
to Great Britain, the structure of the Judicial
Committee began to be changed, and fromn
that time forward its composition bas 'been
kept up to full strength with the best judges
and the best lawyers in England. They are
the men who have been given places upon the
Tudicial Committpe.
I have bad my share, at least, of practical
bof ore that committee. Every
experience
year for some fifteen years I was before the
committee. I do not know how many cases
I w-as concerned in; I neyer tried to, count
them; but I would say that I know of no
decision of that committee, in any case with
whicb I am acquainted, that I could say had
anything wrong in it from a legal point of
view; andi I know that up to the time when I
ceased active practice in Canadian courts, now
over thirty years ago, and came into office as
Minister of Justice bere, and for thirty or f orty
years before that time, there was no tribunal
in the world in which Canadian lawyers generallýy had greater confidence. It is ail very
well for people to, say that the decisions are
sometimes influenced 'by considerations of a
political character. I do not mean considerations of partisanship, but those of public
policy. It is very easy to say that, but I
should like to see somne proof of it. Whil-e
Mr. Bourassa was a member of the other
House he said that more than once, but lie
neyer produceci proof of any instance of it.
If it is ýconstitutional cases that are being
referred to, cases concerning our Constitution
or any other constitution, considerations of
public policy oughit to have weight. But I am
not hee 'to defend or to speak about the
reputation or authority of the Judicial Comnmittee. I should not do that if the Judicial
Committe-e were fine of the courti of this
eountry. I am not goîng to make coxnparisons. I will only say that I have alsways found
the Judicial Committee to be, as I believe it
always bhas been, one of the very best courts
of wbich I have ever had any knowledge.
If it would please my honourable friend
or anybody else to have me say so, I am
willing to admit t.his, in ail truthfulnes1s, that
one of the strongest ressons why I want to
see this right of appeal to the King's prerogative maintained is that I do consider it a link,

that are liglit as air, but strong as iron. I
hope no one will ever do anything towards

it is the intention of the Government

to from time te time amend the British North
America Act as it may deem proper.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I have been awaiting for some time
an opporbunity to anewer the question which
was addressed to the Government by the
honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
I may say that a conLyneh-Staunton).
ference between the Dominion and the provinces was held in December last, when a number of questions were considered. Constitutional questions were referred to a sub-

After a general discussion on the subject it
was considered generally by the members of the

sub-conference that the principle which should

be adopted as a basis on which such a method

of procedure might be worked out should be
that Canada, as in the case of all other selfgoverning dominions, should have the power
to amend the Canadian Constitution, provided
that a method of procedure therefor satisfactory to the Dominion Parliament and the
provincial legislatures be devised and that the
details of any such method would require to
be worked out by experts before the subconference would be in a position to satisfactorily discuss the same. Accordingly a resolution was passed on a majority vote of nine
to one (Mr. MeNair, representative of the
province of New Brunswick, cast the negative
vote for the reason that he was unable to
agree to the resolution in its entirety), reading as follows:This Conference, in the interests of the
Dominion and of the provinces, is of the

opinion:-

I will omit the first two conclusions.
(c) That the Minister of Justice convene at
an early date a meeting of appropriate
officials of the Dominion and of the provinces

to prepare a draft of such method of pro-

cedure, to be submitted to a subsequent conference.
(d) That a conference be held at an early
date after such draft has been prepared to
consider such a method of procedure.
The report goes on to say:
In connection with paragraph (c) of the
above resolution, the Minister of Justice intimated that he would convene a meeting of the
appropriate officials at the earliest possible
date.
Meetings were held acordingly in January
and February last. Progress was made, and
though all difficulties have not been solved,
a great deal of useful preliminary work has
been done, including the appointment of a
sub-committee and its instruction to consider
a number of technical questions. That is
where the matter stands at present, but some
further progress may be made by next session.
The Government will formulate a policy only
when the inquiry and study are terminated.
If I may speak of the various opinions
expressed by a number of honourable members who have participated in this debate, I
would say they disclosed two distinct currents
of opinion: the one based on sentiment and

fear and the other based exclusively on fear;
the one imperialistic and the other provincial.

At the outset I declare that I am not subject
to either of these currents of opinion. Though

Canadian. It is nearly three hundred years
since mv ancestors came to this country.
At the time of the Treaty of Paris, in 1763,
and long before that. French settiers in this
country cailed themselves and were referred
to by the French simply as Canadians. And
for more than one hundred years after that
period, new-comers from the British Isles,
more especially the English and Scotch, so

the province of Quebec. That practice was
continued until the Enlish-speaking people

and then only. for purposes of distinction, the
Canadians of French origin were referred to
by their Eng-lish-speaking f ellow countrymen
as Frencb-Canadians. For miany years during
the earlier part of my life my English-speaking friends, wlien referring to my Frenchspeaking friends, wou]d say "you Canadians."
I do object to being hypbenated against my
will. 1 emphasize my status for the henefit of
the vounger generation of Canadians of French
descent, who do flot know very much of their
hist ory.
I have a profound respect for the Imperial
.sentiments, of my colleagues who have partieipated in this debate. They express filial
sentiments based on legitimaite pride. The
honourahie gentleman from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), who initiated this debate,
expressed the fear that bie would lose bis titie
of Britisýh subject if the power of amending
the British North America Act wcre tran.sferred
from London to Ottawa. I have heen wondering why hie should entertain that fear while we
remain under the samne Crown. The doctrine
now under consideration is not new. Ail the
other Dominions have the power to amend

their own Constitution, a power whicba they
obtained from the Britisb Parliament. The
Australian confederation bas be-en in existence

for thirty-six years. Ta the Australian not as
good a British subject to-day as bie was before
1900? A ý,imilar question applies to the Ncw
Zealander.

Since 1867, wben we obtained our

Constitution, and since 1900, when Australia
became the Commonwealth of Australia, we
one and ail form part of the Commonwealth of
British Nations.
My old and esteemed friend (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth), wbom we bave juat heard witb
such delight, pref.ers the expression "Empire."
So does the honourable gentleman from Hlamilton. 1 feel the Dominions have outgrown a
status wbicha hespeaks dependency.

opinion on this question of the Commonwealth

not like the substitution of the phrase "Commonwealth of Nations" for that of "British
Empire." Sir Austen when he rose expressed
bis desire to break a lance withbhis old friend
Sir George Foster. H1e said:
I do not undervalue the word "Empire."

wealth of Nations," hecause it means that
each is at liberty to pursue bis common interest for the common weal. The daily interests of each part are but a fraction of
those for which the commonwealth exists, and
hy which it is justified. The Commonwealth
of Nations bespeaks equality and is based on
freedom. 1 rejoice in the increasing part that
is being taken by the Dominion in world
affairs.

This was tbe opinion of a representative of
the British Government who bas played a
prominent role in European affairs as the
bead of the most important department, of
the British Government, the Foreign Office.
At Geneva Great Britain appears under the
title "British Empire." but the Dominions'
representatives are there representing their
various countries, which are quite as autonomous and independent as'Great Britain herself.
At a meeting of one of the committees Sir
Cecil 'Hearst, discussing a question then hefore
it, gave the opinion of the British Empire. H1e
was called -to task for speaking for the whole
Empire. He immediately rose and excused
himself for using that term, "wbicb manifestly cannot," hie said, "include the Dominions, since they are bere among us speaking for
themselves. Yet there is still an Empire with
a variety of dependencies runnýing towards
the infinitesimal like the tail of a kite."
I arn firmly convinced that equality among
the British nations forming the Commonwealth,
far from leading to independence, -as my bionourable friend fromn Hamilton feared, will,
as far as human heings may foresee, mean
permanency of the whole fabric of the Commonwealth of Nations. Equality in the realm
eliminates; ail possibility of friction and misunderstanding, and it leaves intact the sentimental tic. In the Dominions, and in Canada
more espccially, the aspiration to equality
bas been constant and inevitable, hecause
natural. We ail remember the story of how
King Caniute, desirous of showing his courtiers
and fiatterers that bis powers were limited,
drew a line on the sands and commanded the
sea to corne no farther. It seemns to me that
to try tu prevent a movement wbicba bas

JUNE 18, 1936
gone on from year to year in favour of greater
and still greater autonomy of the Dominions
would surely be as vain as an attempt to
control the incoming tide. Ever since we had
our first legislature, in 1791, our every step
bas been in the direction of equality, then
within the Empire, now within the Commonwealth of Nations. Canada never faltered.
On another occasion, speaking of the desire for
equality, I said that we all wished to remain
subjects of the King, but we wanted to be
free from subjection to another group of subjects of the King.
Instinctively Canada bas moved towards
national manhood. To-day Canada is a
nation. One may be proud of calling oneself
a British subject, but that does not indicate
one's nationality. Every citizen of Canada,
whether at home or abroad, answers the query
as to his nationality by saying, "I am a Canadian." When abroad I should never think of
saying, "I am a French-Canadian," or "an
Anglo-Canadian." The first answer any of us
would give would be simply, "I am a Canadian."
My honourable friend from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) bas said that
if the Balfour resolution of 1926, declaring
the equality of the Dominions with Great
Britain, had been passed by the British Parliament it would have been tantamount to a
declaration of independence. Yet the British
Parliament, by the Statute of Westminster,
acted upon and implemented that resolution.
What does the Statute of Westminster say?
Let me quote it:
Whereas the delegates of His Majesty's
Governments in the United Kingdom, the
Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of
Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the
Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State
and Newfoundland, at Imperial Conferences
holden at Westminster in the years of our
Lord nineteen hundred and twenty-six and
nineteen hundred and thirty did concur in
making the declarations and resolutions set
forth in the Reports of the said Conferences:
And whereas it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United
Kingdorn shall extend to any of the said
Dominions as part of the law of that Dominion
otherwise than at the request and with the
consent of that Dominion:
No Act of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom passed after the commencement of
this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend,
to a Dominion as part of the law of that
Dominion, unless it is expressly declared in
that Act that that Dominion has requested,
and consented to, the enactment thereof.
The honourable gentleman thinks the embodiment of the Balfour resolution in a statute
would have been tantameunt to a declaration
of independence. I would go further and say
it would have been a real declaration of

independence, declaring us independent of
the electors of the British Isles, as represented
by their Parliament, but not independent of
the Crown. No longer are we the dependents
of a group of electors in the British Isles. In
no way are the members of the Commonwealth
of Nations subordinate one to another.
My honourable friend from North York
eays, "But it is no more humiliating te me
to be subordinate than it is te be the subject
of the King." Here, to my mind, there is a
misunderstanding between my honourable
friend and myself. I have no objection te
the formula "subject of the King," which no
longer implies subjection to the British Parliament; but I repeat my objection to our
being subordinated to another group of 'His
Majesty's subjects.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in 1908, when celebrating the third centenary of the founding of
Quebec by Champlain, said in a speech delivered in the presence of the then Prince
of Wales, the late George V, that the day
would soon came-and he paused-"The day
bas come," be said, "when the Parliament of
Canada is the equal of the Parliament of
Great Britain and recognizes but one supreme
link, the Crown, te which we are for ever
bound."
In 1867 John A. Macdonald suggested that
Canada should be not the Dominion, but the
Kingdom of Canada. What would that title
imply if not that from the moment of its
adoption we should be the direct Canadian
subjects of the King? That is what I feel
I am-a Canadian subject of the King.
My right honourable friend who leads the
other side of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), in 1919, put into the Immigration
Act a definition of Canadian citizenship. Under
that Act power was given to the Canadian
Government te return te the British Isles
any undesirable British subject coming from
those shores.
I will not discuss the many steps that
have been taken by the Canadian Parliament
towards establishing greater and greater
autonomy of the Dominion of Canada in
the Commonwealth of Nations; and when I
say "by the Canadian Parliament" I refer
to Parliament headed alternately by each
party in the House of Commons. At e'very
step towards obtaining a greater sum of
autonomy the same fears were expressed that
we have heard voiced in thie Chamber. It
was always felt by someone that we were
weakening the tie that held us to the British
Crown. I remember the introduction in the
House of Commons in 1920, by Sir Robert
Borden, of the legislation which authorized
the Canadian Government te appoint a

12745-- 6
REVISED EDITION

562

SENATE

Canadian delegate to Washington. The discussion was very interesting. During that debate
fears were expressed that we were weakening the tie and creating a division in British
representation abroad. I can still hear the
expressions that fel: from the lips of some
of the members of the House at that time.
It was interesting to me to read the closing
remarks made by my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) when Sir Robert
Borden, who had conducted the whole of the
negotiations with the United States and with
London. moved that resolution. My right
honourable friend said:
Well, when I hear the fears expressed of
the weakening of the tie with Great Britain,
my heart and sentiments are inclined towards
the critics of this new policy; but when I
appeal to my reason and look at the necessity
for a direct representation of Canada at
Washington, my reason inclines me to this
resolution.
When Sir Robert Borden sucneeded in
persuading the Allies, who were drafting the
Treaty of Peace, that in constituting its council the League of Nations should not debar
the Dominions, there were those who dîreaded
the thought of Canada's representative sitting at the council table as an equal with the
representative of Great Britain. And Sir
George Foster, who was in the Canadian delegation, feared that forward step. Yet for three
t
years Canada sat in the council of ·he League
of Nations and enjoyed the same authority and
the same freedom of action as the other
thirteen members of the counail, and at the
saime itime one of the leading men of Great
Britain represenited what was then known
as, and still is called in Geneva, the British
Empire.
In 1923 the Minister of Marine and Fishcries, the Hon. Mr. Lapoinite, negotiated a
treaty with the United States concerning
halibut fishing in Pacifie waters. I mention
this incident so that everyone may understand the reason for Canada playing its
role as ani autonomous nation in matters
that concern her exclusively. The Canadian
Government. by Order in Council. asked
credentials from His Majesty the King to
enable the Canadian Minister of Marine
and Fisheries to sign the treaty on behalf of
His Majesty. Chief Justice Hughes was then
Secretary of State for the United States.
The Order in Council was sent to London,
and Sir Auckland Geddes, British Ambassador
at Washington, intervened with a request
to have his name appear as the first signaThis request was referred by the
tory.
Imperial Governmen:t to Ottawa, and the
then Prime Minister, as Minister of External
Affairs, answered that the signature of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Canadian Minister would suffice. Downing
Street officials were manifestly displeased.
A few months later, in November of the
same year, an Imperial Coniference in London disoussed the negotiation, signature and
ratification of treaties by the various nations
forming the Commonwealth of Nations. That
conference approved of the attitude taken
by the Canadian Government, and agreed
upon certain terms as to the signature of a
treaty. I cite a rqport of the Imperial Conference of 1923-a summary of proceedings.
Among the conclusions of that conference,
under the title "Signature," one readis the
following:
Bilateral treaties imposing obligations upon
one part of the Empire only should be signed
by a representative of the Government of that
part. The full power issued to such representative should indicate the part of the Empire in
respect of which the obligations are to be
undertaken, and the preamble and text of the
treaty should be so worded as to make its
scope clear.
At that time Sir Auckland Geddes. the
British Ambassador at Washington, represented all the nations forming the British
Commonwealth, and especially Canada. I
wonder what his attitude would have been if
the British Government had asked His
Majesty the King to accredit a British Cabinet
Minister to sign a British-American rtreaty.
Would he have protested that his name
should be included ahead of that of the British
Minister? He was our ambassador and representative, and because of the superiority complex of British officialdom he intervened to
have his name placed over that of the Canadian Minister. In his mind Canadian Ministers were "second-zone Britishers."
That is a state of mind which no Canadian
Government would tolerate, and it explains
why it is that Canada has aspired to equality
of status with the other Dominions and Great
Britain in administering its own national
affairs. It justifies the statement made in
1908 by Sir Wilfrid Laurier that the time had
come for the Parliament of Canada to be equal
to the British Parliament and no longer subordinate in the administration of its own
affairs, domestic and external. I was present
when that declaration was made, and observed
that 'the one who applauded it with the most
apparent enthusiasm was the then Prince of
Wales, who later became King George V.
My honourable friend from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) has said that
we are still a dependent state, and by way
of proof he has cited the fact that the British
Parliament retains the right to veto our legislation and the power to amend our Constitution. But I wish to declare that the

I believe that those fears which some honourable gentlemen harbour are vain. My honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) expressed surprise at a body of
intellectuals of high standing claiming that the
Confederation pact is not based on a binding
agreement; that there is indeed no contract. He
fears that that view may develop, more especially with new-comers in the newly-formed
provinces. I draw bis attention to the fact
that at the present time throughout Canada

affecting the provinces, with respect to which
perhaps it might be ad;visable that consent
of a majority of the legislatures should prevail, and amendments dealing with major
questions affecting the privileges and rights
of mýinorities, with respect to which it is
vital that all the provinces should give consent. To-day there is no agreement as to
what the Parliament of Canada may do without consulting the provinces, what it may do
after consulting a majority of the provinces,
and what it shall do in questions affecting
the privileges and rights of minonities. If
the obligation of consulting the provinces
on matters affeeting their rights and priviloges were introduiced into the Constitution,
i ask, would not that b a much stronger
safeguard for the provinces than the present
situation?
On this score I would ask my friends from
Quebec to reflect. If in the course of time
this Dominion became independent, would not
the minority, in the province of Quebec, have
to rely on itself to safeguard its own rights
and privileges in a country endowed with the
sovereign power of making laws for the whole
Dominion? I say to the younger generation
of French-speaking Canadians, now dissatisfied with their lot, more especially in the
economie field, that they can by superior
training and higher culture qualify for an
important role in the Canadian Confederation.
They will thus form part of the élite which
will mould the destiny of this country. They

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY
BRANCH LINE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 90, an Act respecting the
Construction of a Canadian National Railway
Line from Senneterre to Rouyn, in the
Province of Quebec.
He said: Honourable members, there is one
thought that I want to suggest to this
Chamber and at the same time to the authorities of the Canadian National Railways; a
thought that I mentioned in the Railway
Committee. It is expected that some four or
five million dollars will be spent in the building of this line. Now, railway construction
is a class of work that requires the labour of a
considerable number of men. My suggestion
is that in view of the fact that there are still
tens of thousands of men on the unemployed
list, and that the country is bearing a
tremendous burden in relief expenditures, a
determined effort should be made to give work
to as many of these men as possible. I fear
that if the authorities fail to make their plans
from the very outset with this end in view,
when this grading of sixty4ive miles, or
whatever it isHon. Mr. GORDON: Ninety-nine miles.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -is undertaken,
sons of neighbouring farmers will flock to the
construction camp to take advantage of the
need for men. I have been told that if a
contractor were obliged to select his labour
from among the forty odd thousand unemployed in the city of Montreal his tender
would perhaps have to be at a higher figure

SENATE
than if he were free to take any help that
offered. I believe that by establishing special
employment bureaus in Montreal as good men
could be found among the army of unemployed there as would be available in the
neighbourhood of the proposed line. I would
direct the attention of the Canadian National
Railways authorities to this feature, that if
we are to spend about six million dollars in
building this branch railway, some of the
expenditure should provide employment for
the class of labour to which I have referred,
and so help to lighten the load which now
bears so heavily on the shoulders of the taxpayers of this country.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I understood the President of the
Canadian National Railways indicated before
the committee this morning that in the first
place he was prepared to let a contract for
the grading of the ninety-nine miles, and
when this work had been done be would
utilize laid-off Canadian National employees,
presumably from all over Canada, who are
experienced in track laying and maintenance.
I do not think we should specialize as to any
one class of labour. I imagine there are
several thousands of section men at different
Canadian National Railway points all over
the Dominion who would be glad to go up
into that country and help lay down the
track.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may remind
my honourable friend that I was referring
to the contract for grading.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That work, I
imagine, would have to be left largely with
the contractors. Personally I am interested
in getting some remunerative work for the
laid-off railroad men who have been out of
work for a number of years and are eager to
secure enployment.
lion. Mr. GORDON: My honourable friend
the leader of the Government is referring to
a class of unskilled workmen, while the bonourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) is dealing with another class of
labour entirely-men skilled in track laying
and maintenance.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. My honourable friend will realize that men experienced
in blasting and grading in rock cuts cannot
be picked up off the streets of Montreal,
Toronto and other cities. Presumably the
contractors will know where to get that
specialized labour at a remunerative profit to
themselves.
Hfon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: But the manual
labourers required for grading the road are
mcn who can handle pick and shovel.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Tfhe honourable
senator is quite right. I know that country
well as a surveyor. It is the easiest country
in the world for railway construction. There
is no rock to blast and cut through.
Hon. Mr. ARTHURS: If that is correct,
why should the cost be $60,000 a mile?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It should not be.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: How can it be such
easy construction when the local gold mines
are down in solid rock?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN: They are
down well below the surface.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Honourable senators, I am entirely opposed to the proposal
of the honourable leader of the Government.
Labour enters to but a very small extent
into the cost of the road. The bridges,
culverts, masonry work, sleepers, rails and all
that contributes to the completion of the
road will represent 90 per cent of the cost.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is all labour.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: It is not all labour.
Hon. Mr. KING: Labour and material.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: It is not necessary
at all to make this expenditure to-day. The
public have already access to that section of
the country. 'Other sections of the Dominion
are being neglected as far as railway construction is concerned. My honourable friend from
Guysborough (Hon. Mr. Duff) is familiar
with the road tbat was started some few years
ago-Hon. Mr. GORDON: From Guysborough
to Sunny Brae?
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Yes. That road is
graded, all the masonry is completed and rails
have been laid for about one-half the distance between the two points. On this part
of the line a considerable quantity of lumber
has been brought out during the last three
years. If that road were extended to the
Strai-t of Canso it would save the Railway
Department a very large amount of money.
The section from New Glasgow to the Strait
of Canso, eighty miles, is the worst piece of
road in the whole Dominion.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You are wrong
there.

567

JUNE 19, 1936
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: I am not wrong.
I have been over all Canadian roads of any
importance.
Hon. Mr. GRTESBACH: We have the
worst piece of railway in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: We leave New
Glasgow, eighteen feet above tidewater; in
four miles we clinb over Fraser's Mountain,
four hundred feet high; in another two miles
we are d'own again to tidewater. In fact we
are up and down like the teeth of a crosseut saw until we get within a few miles of
Mulgrave, where we are five hundred feet
above sea level. In building to Guytborough
an annual saving would be effected of more
than enough to pay interest on the money
expended to complete the road. Those are
facts; and facts are chiels that winna ding.
What I have stated cannot be controverted. I
objeict strongly to building roads where roads
are not necessary at the present time, and
leaving other sections of the country neglected
where a road can be built with advantage
not only to the community, but to Canada
as a whole.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I sympatbhize with
the honourable gentleman who leads the
House, coming from Montreal as bhe does,
where there is a large number of people
unemployed. I do not imagine anything we
say in this discussion wilil have any marked
effect, but to the extent that the management
of the railway may read our viewsRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
at all.

No chance

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He would not
be busy if he could do that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
express the hope that the railway management will do what is proper and construct
the road in the national interest.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am unalterably
opposed to the construction of a single branch
line which will not be a profitable feeder to
the National Railways. We all know that
between Quebec and Cochrane the railroad
is not Seing fed with freight. I know something about the territory through which this
proposed road will be constructed, a.nd I
believe it should be constructed, because it
will bring very large traffie to the main line.
I regret that the road may cost as much as
$60,000 a mile. This morning I moved an
amendment, which was difeated, that in place
of the estimate being $60,000 a mile, it should
be placed at $40,000.
f the road were built

at that cost we should save $2,000,000, and
that is worth saving.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third

Hon. L. MeMEANS: Honýourable senators,
at this late date in the session I do not intend ta enter into any extended discussion oi
tbis Bill, but I desire ta place on record my
reasans for voting in favour afifL.
Somne eleveu or twelve years ago a special
committee of this flouse was appointed ta inquire ino the situation of the Canadian National Railways. Tbe honourable the leader
oi the Goverument toock a very active part
in the work af that committee, which, I think,
,qecured the most valuable evidence ever
secured by any committee oi the Senate.
There appeared voluntarily befare that coinmittee gentlemen wbo staod at the heads of the
railways af the United States andi who gave
tbe committee the benefit of tbeir judgment
and opinion witb regard ta the railway situation in Canada. Tbey asked, because of the
higb positions tb.ey occupîed with the railways
ai tbe United States, tbat their evidence
sbauld not be publisbhed or quoted. As the
honourable leader of the Government will
recollect, tbe effect of tbeir evideuce was tbis:
that the railway situation in Canada at that
time was nothiug more nar less than a
tragedy. Tbey took into consideration the
mileage oi the railways, the population oi the
country, and every ather factor that an expert
wauld caýnsider, and, ai ter baving doue that,
tbey iniormed the committee that the Canadieu National Railways would neyer pay.
Tbe committee m~ade a report, ai which
the honaurable the leader ai tbe Governmient is iully aware. The Hon. Mr. Béique,
who at that time was a director ai the Canadieu Pacifie Railway, made a speech upan it.
Hie said that wbile lie vas very proud ai
tbe position bie accupied, he would rather
sacrifice it than continue ta allow the Canadian National Railway System ta be mun upan
tbe aId hunes any longer. Tbe committee
in its report made several recommendatians,
and, with alI due respect ta tbe leader ai the
Gov-ernment, I would sey that it mias his duty
ta carry tbose recammendations ta the Government ai whicba he was at that tirne a

Gov-ernment paid no attention ta the recommendations, but entered upon an orgy af
expenditure and extravagance neyer equalled
in the history of any other organization. It
st.arted at Paris, France, and swept across
the sea, and over this land ta the Pacifican orgy of hotels, ships, huge salaries; extravagances that made the Canadiýan National
Railways a tragedy for the people af Canada.

JUNE 19, 1936
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, the Canadian National Railways je,
I think, the largest singly owned and operated
system of railway8 in the world, and without
disagreeing in any general respect with the
views expressed hy the honourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), 1
think we must remember first, last, and al
the time, whether we like it or flot, no mat-ter
how the Canadian National Railways camne
into our lap, that in it we have something
that bas to be properly operated if the burden
of debt resting upon ýthe necks of Canadians
je to be reasonably reduced.
A great many honest, well-meaning and
distinguished gentlemen in this country have
argued. and no doubt will continue to argue,
because they believe it to be true, that
Canada's only way out of hier railway problein
is amalgamation and co-ordination under
private management. As to that proposai I
will say just this. There are no operating
officers of any railway system in this country,
ors'nywhere else in the world, who are willîng
to play Santa Claus to Canada to the extent
of taking over the Canadian National Railways, including the burden of debt. Even if
we to-day passed the operation of the Canadian National Railways over to a private
concern, should we flot be left holding in our
lap the enormous burden of bonded indebtedness that has come down to us since the days
of Confederation in connection with government owned and operated railroads? The
taxation burden would be. 1 think, very little
less, because we as Canadians are not going
to agree to aoy repudiation; we are not going
to pass the operation of our railways over to
other hands and then gay that, we are out of
the railway game and therefore have nothing
to do with making good on the bonds that
have been issued by component parts of the
Canadian National Railways in years gone by.
Anyone who taîks about lessening the load
that the Canadian taxpayers are shouldering
has really somethiog to talk about. But take
paper and pencil and figure out lust how much
could be done about the bonded indebtedness
that is ours now, and will be ours for some
years to corne, whet-her or not we are in the
business of operating the largest single railroad
systein in the world.
But it is about another matter I wish particularly to speak this aîteraoon. It is closely
related to the Canadian National Railways.
For the last few years we have had a most
serious 'business depression in this Canada of
ours. Neyer mind how it came to us. On
that point we differ. Each of us could argue
one way or another. but our dlaims and contentions would not convince the fellow who
holdis opposite views. The one thing upon

56i

which we are ail agreed, though, is that we
have been going through the worst business
depression that Canada hias ever seen. Ia
recent years there have been, as there still
are, thousands and tens of thousands of unemployed Canadians, men and women unable to secure work. A year ago a number
of social legislati on measures were passed by
this House and ia another place. Regardless of their origin, some of us looked upon
them with a degree of hope and encouragement, for we thought that at Ieast some of
them would result in tangible relief for part
of our army of unemployed. We hoped and
believed that the measure providing one day's
rest in seven, for example, might help to
distribute employment a little more evenly,
a number cf us being aware that not a few
Canadians were working seven days a week
while so many of tiheir fellow citizens were
unemployed. We looked for benefits, too,
from the application of the principle of the
eight-hour day, thinking one result would
be the placing back in service of rnany men
who had spent long years in a given callingyes, the railway calling-and who had lost
their jobs because of the depreasion. But
within the last day or so we have learned
that the hopes entertained' by some of us a
year aga wiil not, for the moment at least,
be fulfllled. When I say "for the moment"
I mean to indicate a period of weeks and
months. A very distinguished gentleman, ia
whose opinion I have great confidence, intimated to me that some of these measures
would probably be referred to the Privy
Council and be sustained. I certainly hope
that will be so.
In the meantime, and in relation to this
Bill, is there any obligation that we as
members of the Senate of Canada should
undertake, or have a right ta undertake, to
perform? Ia my judgment there is something
that we should do.
At the Iast session we passed an Act that
is Chapter 14 of the Statutes of 1935, "An Act
to provide for a weekly day of rest in accordance with the Convention concerning the
application of the Weekly Rest in Industrial
Undertakings, adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations in accordance
with the Labour Part of the Treaty of
Versailles of 28th June, 1919." The Convention referred to there was adopted sixteen
long years ago 1 Also at the last session we
passed an Act, aow Chapter 63 of the Statutes
o4f 1935, "to provide for limiting the Hours
of Work in Industrial Undertakings to eight
in the day and forty-eight in the week, in
accordance with the Convention concerning

570

SENATE

the application of the principle of the Eight
Hour Day or of the Forty-eight Hour Week,
adopted by the General Conference of the
International Labour Organization of the
League of Nations in accordance with the
Labour Part off the Treaty of Versailles of
28th June, 1919." Yet here in Canada, a
young nation that prides itself on being in
advance of almost any other nation on questions affecting the rights, aims and claims of
labour, these two conventions adopted by
the International Labour Organization sixteen
years ago have not yet been put into operation.
So far I bave been trying to lead up, as
briefly as I can, to what I think is a contribution we might make towards advancing, in
connection with this Bill, the welffare of unemployed Canadians. As indicated by previous
speakers. the present Bill literally destroys
the action that was taken in 1933 to set up a
Board of Trustees for the Canadian National
Railways. We need not enter into any argument, I think, for seme of us would not be
able to convince others of us as to the
propriety off the measure passed in 1933, nor
the propriety of the present measure. But I
want to stress the point that the Bill now
before us for third reading proposes to deal
with, to dominate, and, we hope, properly and
effectively to determine the rights of the
Canadian people in the matter of the operation of, the Canadian National Railway
Systcm-which, I repeat, is the largest singly
owned and operated railroad in the world.
What I want to do now is to move an amendment, seconded by the honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Harmer):
That this Bill be not now read a third time
but that it be referred back to the committee
to be anended as follows:
One day's rest in seven and 48 hours
per week
10. (6) The Board of Directors and the
President shall promptly on assuming office as

such prepare and make effective regulations to
ensure and require for all persons employed on
the Canadian National Railways one day's
rest in seven and not more than forty-eight
hoors' work in any week, except in defined
emergency.

Section 10 of the Bill deals with the appointment of the president and directors, and with
the question of the president's remuneration.
The marginal reference to subsection 5 is,
"Chief Operating Officer of National Railways
to act until President appointed."
It seems to me that the Senate here and
now could make a reasonable contribution
towards relieving the unemployment burden
of the Canadian people. I arn sure that someone will ask me, "What will this cost the

Canadian National Railways?"
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

admit frankly that possibly, under existing
conditions, the passing of my amendment
would result in some additional cost. Nevertheless I submit that the Senate, out of due
regard for the rights of thousands of unemployed Canadian citizens, should undertake
to give favourable consideration to this
amendment.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me to ask a question, before he ýresumes his seat? If we adopted this
amendment, would not our action conflict
with the finding that has just been handed
down by the Supreme Court of Canada with
respect to the forty-eight-hour week legislation?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My distinguished
friend is a lawyer and I am quite sure he
would not attempt to say that any employer
of labour in Canada to-day bas not the right
and liberty, regardless of any of this socalled social legislation, to put an eight-hour
day into effect and to insist that one day's
rest in seven be taken by all his employees.
This railroad is ours, and its employees are

undertakes to lay down some instructions to
which the president and board of directors
shaill be required to conform. What I am
suggesting is simply that we, the Parliament
of Canada, instruct the president and board of
directors to make effective on the Canadian
National Railways the principle of an eighthour day and one day's rest in seven, without regard to the provisions of the conventions to which I have referred.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable
gentleman inform the House if ihis amendment

d'eals entirely with the president and board
of directors of the Canadian National Railways. It refers in -no way to the Canadian
Pacific Railway. If it did, of course I could
not propose an amendment of this kind. The
subsection which by this amendment I propose to add to section 10 simply instructs
the president and, the board of directors to
make regulations to insure that all employees
of the Canadian National Railiways shall get
one day's rest in seven and shall not, except in
cases of emergency, work longer than fortyeight hours in a six-day week.

JUNE 19, 1936
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If the arnend.ment
should carry, how ,would, it be possible for the
Canadian National Ra.ilways to compete with
the Ca-nadian Pacifie Railway?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When~ the hon.ourable gentleman says "competie" I can hardly
analyse just what he means. We, the -people
of Canada, should be taking on ourselves this
additional burden, whatever the adiditio-nal oat
inight be, of giving effect-arn 1 justifi.d, ini
saying?- to a principle that in 1919 Canada, in co-mm on with other nations of the
world, agreed, at Ieast tacitly, to put into
effeot. Nothing bas.been done. Here -we have
one large ernploying unit -of the Canadian
famÀly with, appr.oxirnately 100,000 men, under
normal conditions. My proposal would, I
think, put to, work several h.undreds cd men,
sore of whorn have fifteen, twenty or twenýtyfive years of aeiniority rights, but find. no
regular work to> do. I agiree with the honourable senator that there would be some additi-onal liability placed u-pon the Canadian
people.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators. this Parliament last session ernbodied
in legislation the principle of the forty-eighthour week with .one dâay of reat in seçven. The
Supreme Court of Canada last Wednesday
declared the Acit to ha ultra vires. The Govariment, th'rough its Departmnent of Justice,
is considering wha'ther the legisiation shahl ha
sumritted to the highest; tribunal in the
Empire, the Privy -Council. I arn unable to
say what course the Goverament *will take,
but undoubtedly the Parliarnenýt of Canada
sh.ould not legisiate piecemeal on such an
important matter. Under the circ*umstanes I
arn unable to a-ccept the amendiment of my
honourable friand.
The am-endîment -of Hon. Mr. Murdock was
negatived.
The Hon. the SPEAK-ER: The question
now is on the main motion for the third
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I had hoped that the motion
for third raad;ing might be deferrad, for another day. In the intense rush upon us in
these closing hours, with a long succession of
bills requiring as thorough study ais can be
givan to them, I have flot been able to collect
and arrange in order, as I should have likad,
such matarial as would have anabled me to
discuss briefiy, and at the -same time not
ineffectivaly, this proposad measure.
Possibly point will be best given to what
I have to say by my telling the House in the
very first breath whera I stand in relation

571

to this Bihl. I amn opposed to it. I think it
is deplorable that the Governmenit should
have sean fit to introduce suah a mensure as
expressive of its poliey on a matter s0 vital,
indeed e matter that goas to the very fate
and destiny of our financial and industrial
wellýbeing. I arn noit only op.posed to the
Bill, but I *arn preparad to sas tha Bill
defeated, and to take all consequences, if by
any act omf
mine I could hring about its defeat.
I say that with no reflection on the bona
fides and intent of thosa who reason otherwise.
I have for a great many years livad with, this
railway situation certainly as cîoseîy as any
other honourable sanator, and I can assure
the House I have not corne to this conclusion
hastily, nor in any spirit of hostility to the
Administration. I amn arazed that such a course
as this should have been decided upon, almost
under the echo of the result of an alection,
and announced to the public without eve-n
sucli time for seernly consideration as would
appear to me to be alI-important in a step
s0 far-reaching.
What is the history of our railway problem? It must be stated hurriedly and irnperfactly. We were a you-ng country and
the means of locomotion and carniage were
essentially by rail. At vary considerable
national expense and, risk we engaged in the
construction, first, of one railway system in
the East, then of another frorn coast to coast,
and subsequently, cornmencing in the late
nineties, we encouraied t.he construction of a
systarn in Western *Canada to serve a vast
territory previously unsuppiad. In the early
part of this Century Parliamant as then constituted decided in its wisdom, stzpported, by
the people of Canada in their wisdorn as then
devaloped, that another road, should be constructed from coast to coast by means of a
complicated- system. of mortgages and guarantees inv-olving heavy liability on the Dominion. Then Parliarnent de-cidedito guiamntee the
obligations, at ail events the basic obligations, for a third transcontinental.
This
d'eoision was reached, in the early part of 1911,
and early in the session -of that year the
honour and pledge of this nation were afixed
to that stupendous ventura.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friand says 1911.

My right hion-

Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn referring
to the Canadian Northern, the third transcontinental lins. It was in the hast session
of the Laurier Administration. I arn not now
pausing to criticiza the .iudgment of the
Parliament of Canada or the Government of
that day. Suffice to say that it affixed the
signature of this Dominion to very serious

SENATE

572

obligations in connection with those two
systems.
The only important railway extension
made by the succeeding Government was
in respect to the Canadian Northern line
from Edmonton to the coast; an extension
which in my judgment-perhaps J was wrong
-was essential for the rounding out of an
a<ready almost completed system in so far
as the authorization and assistance of Parliament were concerned.
We found ourselves in possession, either as
mortgagees or guarantors, but largely as
guarantors, of the obligations of these two
systems. In many respects we found ourselves
the owners of vast sections of the systems.
We were the owners of the Interoolonial, and
of the Transcontinental from Moncton to
Winnipeg, and by the time the real crisis
arrived we were virtually the owners of the
Grand Trunk Pacific, too, from Winnipeg to
Prince Rupert; for as an independent venture
it had completely failed. Then the very first
of our railways found itself unable to operate
and to take care of its debts. We were
guarantors, not of all -the debts, but of such
portions of them, immense in their aggregate,
as to make us in effect guarantors of all;
and, being guarantors of the obligations, we
were virtually in the position of mortgagees.
From the superior, though not very well
informed, criticism of modern writers one
would think that the Administration of the
time of this crisis, about 1919, had been seized
with an ambition to become the proprietor
of these tremendous railway systems which
were in trouble, and that it had made the
vast error of plunging linto the centre of their
difficulties and placing the whole burden
upon the shoulders of the people of Canada.
The fact is, the burden was on our shoulders
then and could not be honourably removed.
It was as direct an obligation as any nation
was ever under. We could not escape from
it. We could of course continue under the
load of liability and let the assets go where
they would; but no one at the present
time can place himself back in that period
and, surveying the circumstances, think for a
moment that although the obligations were
binding upon. us, we could have just let
everything be sold under the hammer and
have awaited the chaos whieh would at that
time have been very quickly upon us if the
then Administration had displayed such an
utter lack of foresight and of common sense.
We have been too optimistic in the construction of railways. That is the fundamental
cause of oui difficulties.
As years went on, a way had to be found
of managing what the Government had decided

it should take over. I emphasize once more
the fact that the decision of Canada to take
over the railways was forced upon it; it was
not a decision prompted by any ambition to
incur the responsibilities of railway management. At that time a plan was devised to
incorporate all the railways into a single
system, taking their various elements in one
by one, or ten by ten, until all should

viding for it and making it inevitable had
been passed about one or two years before.
The method of procedure was to provide for
a board of directors and place the Government
of Canada in the position of shareholders of
the road, exercising such control as shareholders in a company are entitled to exercise,
the spokesman and active instrument of that
control being the Minister of Finance. Provision was made also that all capital expenditure was to be controlled by the Governor
in Council and provided by vote of Parliament. It was hoped and believed that this
method would sufficiently remove actual operation from interference of political influences
and give the railway a fair chance to vindicate itself as a business enterprise.
The board then created was headed by Mr.
D. B. Hanna, a man who previously had been
the general manager of the largest unit in the
new system. Towards the end of 1922 the
general manager and entire board were remnoved. I cannot recall that any reasons were
given as to why this action was taken. A new
board and general manager were appointed.
At that stage a nine-year period began. The
new general manager was Sir Henry Thornton.
At the end of nine years, or ten, the
system was in a rather pitiable plight. It
is only fair to remind honourable members
that we happened to be then in the dark
abysm of a depression, and the road had suffered more perhaps than any other single enterprise in Canada from the effects of that depressien. What the road suffered frorm otherwise I
shall not speak of personally. Anything I say
on that phase will be said entirely on the faith
of authorities much more important and
dependable than I. At that point, the systerm
being under liabilities aggregating not far
frorm three billions of money, the losses being
terrific, and the cloud formed by railway
difficulties being the blackest on the horizon
of Canada, the Government of the day decided
there should be a review by commission of
the whole situation with a view to finding a
new policy or improving the old one, or discovering some way out of our trouble.

JUNE 19, 1936
The commission appointed was 'headed by
the present Chief Justice of Canada. It was
cornposed of men of oustanding capacity and
repute. The leading member was Lord Ashfield, wlhose experience in the management
and corporate control of large rai1lway enterprises in Great Britain was pe.rhaps unequalled.
Another member was Sir Joseph Flavelle, who
had been president of the Grand Trunk System. in Canada about the year 1920, and wAho
is recognized as being among the first tWo,
three, or four of the men of front-rank business capacity in this Dominion. 0f the other
memibers, one, Mr. Lorie, came from the
United States.
is experience had been
gained in management of the biggest railway there. Another was Mr. Beaudry Leman,
one of the inost successful and respected, business men of the province of Québec.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And an engineer,
too.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Au engineer
too. The other member of the commission
was Dr. Webster, who, though Canadian,
born, had returned to Canada only wîthin
recent years, and who, had a very successful
career, indeed, in everything to which hie
hiad put his hand. No one has ever ventured
to suggest that there was any political bias,
or possibility of it, in the personnel of that
commission. I know of only two of its
members who 'had ever been identified in
any way with Canadian politi-cal affairs--one
on one side, and the other on the other side;
and certainly neither had been active. It
was an able commission and commanded the
confidence of the people of this country. I
neyer heard its ability challenged in either
House, or indeed anywhere in the Dominion.
That commission made a lengthy and
very thorotigh investigation into the whole
problem of our railways. Its report is
one of the most impressive documenits in our
literature. It does credit even to a man
with such. a record as that of the Chief Justice of Canada. The commissioners examined
first into the causes of the trouble we were
in, and di.sclosed those causes in most definite
form, amply supported by evidence and incontestable facts; indeed, by facts no one has
ever ventured to question. They attributed
..ur difficulty first to that earlier basic cause
I mentioned at the opening of my addressover-construction due to over-optimisca of
the Can-adian people. They added, though,
that another cause was .unrestricted, uncontrolled competition bet-ween two great systemns serving the saine people, one of wlhich
was publicly owned and the other privately
owned, and that the privately owned one

had deemed it necessary to meet the pace
of expenditure set by the .publicly owned one
in order to hold its share of the field. They
gave as another cause the absorption of
non-paying independent uines and Cther properties into the Canadian National System,
under compulsion of political or, as they preferred to descrîbe it, public pressure, the consequence being an appalling increaie in the
capital liabilities of 'the system. They gave as
a third cause, inelasticity in the power to coinpete with outside, extraneous mneans of transport, due to rigidity of freight and passenger
tariff schedulee. They gave as still another
cause the position ini which the railways found
theinselves because of international trade
unions controlling in considerable degree the
level of railway wages and compensation, and
tihe consequent inability of the railways to
meet periods of stress as they can be met in
individual enterprises. Th-ese were the main
reasons advanced for the immensity of the
problem which confronted this country.
The commission then proceeded to outline
methods of escape or alleviation; means
whereby the road might be saved for the
future so that improvement, at least, might
be looked forward to, and the impediments
surrounding the management of a nationally
owned system ba reduced to the utinost
extent, or removed.
Throughout the entire report one finds the
main criticism to be this: that the very fact
of the National Systein being publicly owned
and having the treasury of Canada as its
means of resource induced an atinosphere of
extravagance over the whole range of managemient.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Public ownership!
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As a conr>equance the entire history over the period
covered was characterized by the "red
thread of extravagance." Expenses in every
sphere of railway operation and near-railway
operation -were startling. The aggregate
amount was indeed something to shock the
people of our country. The commissioners
qu'oted the evidence of witnesses in explaining how it came about that a road
so controlled was subject to these influences;
and they did so in no spirit of hostility to
any administration, as is very clear from every
line. Nothing perhaps could exceed in yulnerability such a systemn as was in vogue,
namely a systein of a board with the Government, exercisin-g the autlîority of stockholdera,
as its dominating factor. They quoted the
authority of Sir Henry Thornton, who said,
in a language of which hie was a mastersonorous, very, very friendly and insinuating-

no matter what Government in the world
was in power, public pressure was bound to
exert itself through the medium of that Government and resuit in expendituros by the
road, chiefly of a capital nature, which no
private enterprise would enter uipon. They
gave other authorities and many instances.
They said it was net just a case of a member
of Farliamcnt wanting a pass or a job for
someone. or even of a Minister trying to tell
them what they had to do. It was the influence of communities upon the Administration. and through it upon the railread, that
resulted in this vast liability being incurred.
What were the liabilities? The commissioners found that over a period of nine years,
from 1923 to 1931, inclusive, liabilities of
the National Sysfem had boen added to by
922 millions of money, or ovor $100,000,000
a yeir. They found tliat somo of this, of
course, %vas due to the cumulative effect of
repeated anci successiv e deficits, which took
the form of liabilities to the Goveromont.
Four hundrod and fifýty-six millions of thýe
total in these nine years was due to new
capital expenditures. or over $50,000,000 per
annum. In instancing theso expenditures they
pointed to a fleet of ships tied idly f0 our
Western docks; f0 hotels of imposing magnitude in manv of our cities, wi'thout business
or, indeed, with closed doors; they pointed to
railroads taken over which had no earning
power and were only a liability after they
were absorbed. These things they euphemaistically but truthfully ascribed to the fact tba-t
the public treasury governed and supplied.
They did not intimate that anything in the
nature of corruption or wrong infent was
a]lowed te enter. This situation they portrayed as the inox itable resuit of leaving mancxposod f0 influences exercised

public pressure, upon which may depend the
fortunes of some candidate, or more than one,
as an evidence of the same influence whicb,
in huge degree, was responsible for the dilemma of the railways.
The commission-ers came thon fo the still
more difficulit problem of finding some means

overcome the disabilities incident te unrestrained cempetition, and te avoid the tremendous expenditures censequent upon them,
they recommended first of aIl a system of ceoperatien enferced by a tribunal te which

agreement.

responsible te the Government. The Government teck, the place of sharehelders and

In ail these regards and to ail this
adviee the utmost consideration was given;
consideration flot only hy the Government,
but by the flouse of Commons and, I tbink
I can say, particularly by this flouse. It
was in the Senate that new legisiation was
initiated. Here it received its first and principal review. Here every phase was criticized
and examined, the whole matter being brought
under our eye. This flouse decided, first,
that the proposed system was good and ehould
be given a fair trial with a view to seeing
whetber we could flot make at least some
progress towards betterment of the financial situation -of the road. Appointments
were made in t'he fail of that year, alter having been delayed somewbat because of difficulty in inducing men of reqùisite weight
and type ýto take on the duties of trustees.
To the position of chairman was appointed
Judge Fullerton, a man who because of bis
experience in the practice of law, as a judge
on the Bench, and, for some time before his
appointment, as head of the Board of Railway Commi.ssioners of Canada, was deemed
competent to take tihe principal. post of responsibility. The other appointees were certainly very good. men. I do flot know that
better men could be secured to-day than Mr.
Morrow and Mr. Labelle.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What did they
know about running a railway?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Wbat do you know about
it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The central
responsibility was on Judge Fullerton. 1
must have regard to tihe well-intentioned
interruption of the bionourable senator from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrainý), wbo
asked wbat tbey knew about running a railway. Well, Judge Fullerton did know quite
a lot about rail'ways; bis experience had
taugbt him a lot about tbem. In the next
place, the business of the trustees was not the
management nor the operation of thbe railway. The Act which autihorized their appointments, and whicb in this respect also
fulfllled the recommendations of the Duif
Commission, provided for the appointment
of an operating manager, witb the titular
rank of president, who was to do the operating. -The
tbree trustees were supervisionary
men who were to take the place of directors,
perform the functions of directors and report
to Parliament. Týhey were req.uired to direct
their energy-the ohairman was to give al
bis time and energy-to an endeavour to
better the condition of the road and ýto save
expense, while maintaining the character and

efficiency of the system and making it a credit
to Canada. Above ahl, they were to try ta
reduce the burden on tihe back of the taxpayers of this country.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman a question? Does he
no>t recali that Judge Fullerton, wben he
appeared before our committee the other day,
intimated that he took action entirely at
variance witb what the right honourable
gentleman bas just stated? I think what the
right honourable gentleman bas stated should
have been the position. But did not Judge
Fullerton say that be had taken certain
departments under bis own control and discbarged some responsible officers wbo had
served a long time on the road, replacing
them by others?
Right I-on. Mr. MEIGI-EN: The ifonourable gentleman will have plenty of time to
speak on this later. I would ask bim not to
interrupt me unless be bas something more
pertinent. Judge Fullerton said no such tbing.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg the bonourable gentleman's pardon, Hie did say such
a tbing. If there was a stenograpbic report
it will bear me out.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There was a
stenographic report all right. What Judge
Fullerton said was that in the matter of the
operation of the railway system the wbole
tbýing was lef t to the titular president, and
that be neyer interfered in the sligbtest
degree with that titular president. But there
were certain responsibilities of the company,
not at aIl concerned witb operation of the
road, wbich he deemed it bis duty to assume,
and which he did assume. And he bas reported
to Parliament, as to the committee, the wbole
result of that management. That I would

the result bas been. May I direct the minds
of honourable members back to, the evils
revealed by the Duif Report and te, tbe
reasons why the disastrous results of which
,we were witnesses bad taken place? Political
and public pressure was the main evil. Directly
due to the influence of that political and
public pressure was a staggering measure
of extravagance. Let us now examine into
the resulte effected by the board of tru6te-es.
I said there had been an aggregate
expenditure -in new capital of $456,00,000

But Mr. Fullerton did flot attack Mr.

Has anything furtiser been since adduced?
Mr. Fullerton reveals what bas been accomplished in two years of operation; and for
this he does not himself take credit, but
gives credit f0 the system under which he was
able f0 handle business unimpaired and unimpeded. He says that although on the Canadian Pacifie and first-class roads of the
Ulnited States the percentage of improvement
in traffie was not as good as on thse Canadian
National, yet thse percentage rate of increase
of expenses on the Canadian Pacifie and the
first-ciass roads of thse United States was not
by any means as low as on thse Canadian
National; and that the operating ratio of the
Canadian National in the two years under thse
trustece systemn had improved vastly over former
years--from 96 per cent to 91 per cent--while
thse ratio of Canadian Pacifie remained almost stationary, and that of first-class roads
in the United States was approximately staBy the test of operation ratio,
tionary.
altbough it is not perfect, you can most
intelligently judge efficiency of administration.
Mr. Fullerton says, "This bas been donc,
not by robbing men of their jobs, not by
economizing at the expense of labour." This
apparently he set bimself against, rigbtly or
wrongly. H1e says: "Instead of having fewer
men employed we bave 4,000 more. and instead
of having lower wages we have restored part
of tise eut. It appears in our labour payments
of last vear, which represent more than
$9,000,000 inerease as compared with the year
before.'
Thse consequences of a return to tise system

not be the consequences that followed the

consequences will flot be repeated.
It is said that this is a great national business and since the people have returned the
present Government t-o power, whether or not
you like tbe way it is going to handie the
National Railways, it ought to, be given a
chance. I know the duties of senators are
important, their responsibilities heavy; and I
recognize there are limitations surrounding
us, and it is in the interests of Canada that
those limitations should be observed. I want
to observe them. But unless the Government
has at least a specifie, definite and uniderstandable mandate fromn the people of Canada,
1 do not think those limitations go to the
extent of imposing upon me any compulsion
to support it when I have every reason
that any thougbtful man of experience can
have, to believe that the course now f0 be
taken will be calamitous in its financial consequences to our National Railways; when 1
knoxv what ail investigation in the past bas
shown, and that similar consequences cannot
well be avoided under the systemr now being
restored.
I said there was no specifie mand(ate. Is
there anything you can cadi a, mandate? Did
memibers of the present Government dîsclose
to the people of Canada before tbe election
that they intended f0 abandon the trustee
syvstem, with the trustees responsible to Parliament and not to the Government? 1 yenture to say not one man now in the Administration ever indicated to the people
of Canad a that such was his intention. Certainly the present Prime Minister did not.
Did he ever intimate to the people of Canada bis aversion f0 the principles of the
Duff-Flavelle-Ashfield report, or his intention
to tear if to tatters and thxrow if into the
limbo of the past? H1e neyer did. Certainly
everything that can be done to help the
Canadian National Railways the Government
bas a right to do, but it has no right to
substitute its ideas, undisclosed to the people
of Canada, for idea.s confirmed by Parliament
in «the past because of the aiitbority with
whîch they have been advanced, and in the
face of f aets which that authority reveals.
Certainly there is no compulsion upon me to
suppor't the Bill because of a mandate. A
mandate does not exist. I do net regard

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. It was
exactly as it is now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When the Grand
Trunk and the Canadian Northern and the
other systems were brought together, there
came the question of who should have the
direction of the whole system. We could not
take the general manager of the Grand
Trunk, or Mr. Hanna of the Canadian Northarn, as it was felt that neither of the systems
would be sympathetically inclined towards a
man who administered a rival railway. So we
did what Great Britain had done during the
War, when it gathered into a whole all the
railways of that country, and called upon a
stranger, Henry Thornton, of New York, to
administer them. So Sir Henry Thornton
was selected. That was in 1922; and I heard
him say, when we had the first public contact
with him, that he hoped within five years to
produce results.
Well, he had to raise the morale of the
whole system and obtain the confidence of the
thousands and thousands of employees on the
system. I think no one will deny that ha
:>btained this confidence. He spent largely
with a view to developing the system and
bringing it up to the standard of the Canadian
Pacific Railway; and from year to year results were shown, until 1926, when at last
there appeared a surplus that would help in
paying, at -all events, the interest to the public.
Those were years of great prosperity.
Every citizen in Canada was prosperous and
spending freely, and I suppose Sir Henry
Thornton and his directors were permeated
by the feeling thait they were in an era of
prosperity which would carry them to success.
At all events, the system became a splendid
working machine. But in 1929 a crisis
occurred, and from that time on, owing to an
absence of freight and a reduction in carloadings, the railways manifestly were running
behind.
The Duff Commission, of which my right
honourable friend has spoken, made a report.
It suggested a trusteeship, and the legislation
based on that report was initiated in this
Chamber. In our Railway Committee we
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

worked for weeks and we.eks examining the
situation. Various other methods were suggested, all tending to a closer co-operation
between the two railways. At last the Act
was passed. What was the hope of every
senator, of every member of Parliament at that
time? It was that through the close cooperation of the 'two railways a state of
equilibrium would be brought about.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
and a half?

In a year

We did not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
specify the time. It did not take two years
for Judge Fullerton to come to the conclusion that such a condition could not be
brought about. In 1934 he made the declaration in a report to Parliament, over his signature and those of his colleagues, and in 1935
ho repeated it, that it was a vain illusion to
think that equilibrium could be brought about
by co-operation.
The desire to bring about that equilibrium
was, I believe, the sole reason for the action
of the Senate and the House of Commons
in accepting the system of trusteeship. The
Prime Minister of that time, in introducing
to the other House the Bill which came from
this Chamber, said that it was essentially
based on the hope of establishing equilibrium
by bringing the railways together in cooperation and thus eliminating competition.
He may not have used exactly that phrase,
but it expresses the reason he gave when
he introduced the Bill in the Commons. Before the elections of 1930 ho made the declaracompetition
never;
"Amalgamation
tion,
ever," and I am quite sure that declaration
dominated all the deliberations of the Duff
Commission. The commission was faced by
the policy and the iron rule of the Bennett
Government. I shall not discuss that, except
to say that, in spite of the affirmation which
had been made, the whole purpose of the
Act was to reduce competition to a minimum.
There was a saving clause which stated that
there should not be amalgamation. If you
look at the Act you will find that every line
of it goes counter to the imprudent affirmation of the leader of the Government that
for ever there should be competition. The
whole effect of the Act was to reduce competition to a minimum; but it stopped at
amalgamation.
Now we have the statement of the trustees
themselves in 1934, and again in 1935, that
this ho.ped for equilibrium was an illusion.
t
"We canno bring it about," they say; yet
the sole purpose for which they were appointed
was to bring about equilibrium by means of
co-operation between the two railways.

JUNE 19, 1936
Last week, or the week before. we heard for
the first time from Judge Fullerton the statement that there was another reason for his
failure to bring about equilibrium. He had
said in his reports of 1934 and 1935 that the
only salvation lay in greater traffie; in other
words, in greater prosperity. Yet two weeks
ago he said: "I could flot bring about better
resuits. I failed in the direct mandate which
I had under this Act, because there was no
will to co-operate." I questioned him on that
statement. I asked hinm how it was that for
two years lie had made reports to Parliament
saying that there was but one chance of
restorîng equilibrium, namely, through greater
traffic, and that now, when hie is about to
leave, lie says there is no will to co-operate.
How is it that now, for the first time, we are
advised of that condition and ail our hopes
are dashed? How is it that sucli a statement
could be made by Judge Fullerton? It could
be made only because hie found that hie had
been unable to obtain resuits through cooperation between the railways.
Now, bow were savings to be effected
through co-operation?
They were to be
effected in various ways: the abolition of
cornpetition in express, telegrap'h and other
services; the joining togetber of terminal
facilities wbere pooling arrangements were
in effect between the two railways; and so
forth. A committee was appointed, consisting of three Canadian National Railways trustees and Sir Edward Beatty, Mr. Tilley, KGC.,
and Mr. W. A. Black, of Montreal, of the
C.P.R. That committee was to receive the
agreements made between the operating coinmittees of the Vjwo railways. The namnes of
thbe members of those committees were given
to us. Judge Fullerton told us that there
was no disagreement between the executives
and that as there were no disputes between
them there was no reason for se'tting up
arbitral tribunals. But the reason why no
arbitral tribunals were set up is obvîous: no
agreement was arrived at between the aperating men. No wonder there was no disagreemenit between the Board o-f Trustees and the
executives of the other railway. There could
have been none.
W'hat sbould -have been the work of our
trusteeýs? It was their d-uty to follow what
was taking place in th-at committee of experts,
to consuit with its members, and to press
them toward some larger resuIt. We have
no information as to what took place between Judge Fullerton and the experts appointed by him. He simply tells us that there
was no will for co-operation, and that we canflot expect any resuit leadinz towards equilib.

rium. We had his written statements in
1934 and 1935 that the work done by bis predecessors during the two or Vhree years before lie took office had been so Vhorough and
effective that hardly any more savings could
be hoped for.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: To whom was hie
alluding at that time? Who had made the
great savings?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

He was ailud-

ing to the board that preceded him.

Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Thornton?

Not to Sir Henry

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, to, the
board that was in office for the two or three
years prior to bis, Judge Fullerton's, appointment. H1e said that the prcceding board had
made such radical reductions in expenditures
that there was hardly any hope of doing more
in that direction.
Here is the situation which confront-s us.
The board of trugtees was given a mandate
to obtain reductions through co-operation with
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, as
provided in the Act. When Judge Fullerton
was before us at the Railway Committee, I
asked him, "You failed?" And hie replied,
"I failed." But lie said that hie lad donc
the best lie could to bring about reductions.
Yet in bis reports for 1934 and 1935 bie says
that big reductions could le achieved only
through greater traffic, increased car-loadings.
I asked if in.creased traffic could be procured
by the action of the board of trustees, and
Judge Fullerton said that was a question of
trafic,' something not in bis jurisdiction.
The board of trustees that we appointed
on the recommendation in the Duif Commission report bas not been able te, realize our
hope that tlrough co-operation between the
two railways the a.nnual deficit of $50,0O,000,
as it was in 1933, might be wiped out or very
greatly reduced. It is principally because our
hope in that direction bas been frustrated
that I am so keenify disappointed. We had
believed wbat we had been told by Sir
Edward Beatty and other eminent men, that
co-operation between the two roads might
bring about an equilibrium be.tween income
and expenditures. But expected results have
not materialized, and I feel 'to-day that the
work we in this Chamber did in 1933 on the
railway situation bas been all in vain. My
riglit honourable friend tells us to look at
wbat bas been done. He says that Judge
Fulierton bas made extensive reductions in
expenditures. Yet Judge Fullerto>n declared
that the economies effected during the two or

SENATE

three years prior to his appointment had been
on so large a seale that virtually no more
savings could be made along that line.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Did he say anything
about the abandonment of lines?
Yes. I put
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to him a few questions about the abandonment of lines. I think it was Mr. Coleman
who told us that only ten miles of Canadian
Pacifie track had been abandoned in consequence of co-operation.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Canadian National track.

That

was

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Did Judge Fullerton
state that the Board of Railway Commissioners had denied the railways permission to
make certain desired abandonments?
Yes. He said
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the railroads had not fared well in this respect
before the Railway Commission. He declared
they dare not abandon certain lines, because
of the outcry that would be raised by people
who are now served by them. I asked him
if the principal obstacle in the way of abandonment was not labour, and I.think he said
it was. Then I inquired if during his term
of office he liad studied the possibility of a
plan-to b approved by Parliament perhaps
-under which employees would be pensioned
at, say, fifty-five years of age, and younger
employees whose services were net at present
required would be given temporary compensation until such time as they were reabsorbed into the system. He replied that no
sucb study had been made.
I wonder what Judge Fullerton, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, really considered his mandate was. I asked him
w'hethcr he was net appointed for the express
purpose of bringing about financial equilibrium
through co-operation with the Canadian
Pacifie. My recollection is that his answer
was "No," and that my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) supported
him in a timid "No." But, for support of
my contention that equilibrium was the ohjective that we sought to reach through co.
operation between the railways, we have only
to refer to the Act, to the statement on the
subject by the then Prime Minister, and to
the speeches made in this House. Judge
Fullerton may net be solely responsible for
the failure to achieve this objective. I have
no doubt that Sir Edward Beatty bas always
cherisbed the hope of maintaining his railway intact, of net making any sacrifices of
power, capital or property belonging to his
sharrholders. I will not apportion respon-iHon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

bility for the failure between the heads of
the two railways. What I am saying is that
the trusteeship has failed. Look at the Act.
Then take the statement of Judge Fullerton
himself, in reply to my question, that with
respect to bringing about equilibrium the
trustees had failed.
My right honourable friend says that because of his responsibility as a public man
he cannot agree to the changing of the present
system, although a plan for change has been
prepared by the Government and endorsed
by two-thirds of the members of the House
of Commons, fresh from the people. I ask
my right honourable friend how long he can
maintain the present system, even if he rejects
this Bill? We ail know that two of the
trustees will retire by the end of the year,
and that Judge Fullerton's term would last
not longer than two or three years more.
Then what wou'ld happen? He would not be
reappointed. As my honourable friend from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) has stated,
such a condition would be chaotic. After
the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett became Prime
Minister, Sir Henry Thornton sent in his
resignation because be felt he had not the
confidence of the Government of the day, and
recognized that it was essential he should
have that confidence.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Judge Fullerton bas said that the way to
reduce the deficit is to have increased traffic,
greater car-loadingS, more income-which
things are dependent upon greater prosperity. Well, Judge Fullerton ias no special
means of controlling the future to bring about
prosperity. And he says he is not a traffic
mian; that it is net bis business to attend to

JUNE 19, 1936
traffic matters. I -tell my right honourable
friend that if it is nlot Judge Fullerton's duty
to try to bring about equilibrium by the
means indicated in the Art, then surely we
should secure business men to adminieter
the road and try to hring about those conditions in which, he says, lies the only hope
for wiping out the deficit. I hope the successors of the present tru.stees will he men
whose names insýpire the confidence of Parliament and of the country. I should be
greatly disappoînted if the present Government, of which I arn a meanher, were to weigh
the seven appointees on the scale of political
partisanship.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: focs the
honourable gentleman think they will be as
good as those appointed by the Government
in 1923?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
it was again.st my own view in 1923 that the
board should ibe composed of I'epreseTitatives
from different sections of the country. I
could nlot see the wisdoma of having one
representative at, say, Prince Rupert, another
at Hlalifax, and so on, as members of a board
who.se htad office wa.s ini Montreal. I have
always heen opposed to regional representation.
I feel that the directors of any very large
organization must he able to work together
daily, to devote their time and efforts to the
prdblems th at are constantly appearing. It
is. true that the provinces are interested in the
railroad, as indeed ail parts of Canada are.
Ideal though it may seem to have the nine
provinces reprcsented on the board, I neyerthcless hold to the view that the real function
of a board, is to direct. How can a board dispersed from the Atlantic to the Pacific direct
the operations of such an immense system?
My right honourable friend, at the opening of
this session, thought I should 'ho disappointed
in my hope that the commission to whom was
to he confided the question of employment
would :be composed of men of sufficient repute
to be accepted by the whole country; but
the gentleman wc selootedi as chairman received the warm approval of my right honourable friend. I hope that when we meet next
session ho will admit we have shown business
acumen in our selection of two men who will
try Vo bring about resuits by their business
ability. They are to he founid. With al
due respect Vo Juclge Fullerton, 1 would, point

matters. AIL I ask is that this Government

of the National Railwaye.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable

Canadian Northern Railway would be to

Hon. Mr. HORNER: It seemed like that
to me. As far as Judge Fullerton's position
is concerned, he was kind enough to make
.a report to the Government giving due credit
to the directors who immediately preceded
him; and I Éhould like to point out that the
Pacifie Bill
National-Canadian
Canadian
passed through this Chamber a year before
the retirement of the directorate of which I
formed a part. We were instructed to do
what we could to secure co-operation, and
to carry on along the same lines that the new
board was expected to follow when it was
placed in control. During my whole term the
honourable senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr.
Moraud) was on the board, as was also Trustee Labelle. It was then that these various
savings were made.
Now I feel that it is my particular
duty to express my objections to this Bill.
I do not believe that we, or the people
throughout the country, should have expected
that Judge Fullerton and the trustees would
be able to bring about co-operation between
the railways. I do not think it was the intention. I listened to Judge Fullerton when he
appeared before our Railway Committee, and
I do not think he said he entirely failed.
I do not think he admitted that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I think he said that
the problem was very difficult, but not impossible of solution.
We certainly could
understand that. Honourable senators must
know the position the Canadian National
Bon. Mr. HORNER.

trustees would find themselves in if they
attempted to bring about co-operation with
the C.P.R. within a year and nine months.
It was never intended that they should do
that.
While I am on my feet I want to say that
I am in favour cif public ownership. I know
there are some people in this country to-day
who are ready to oppose and decry any
thought of public ownership or publie operation. I suggest to them that they had better
look around them and see what is taking
place throughout the world to-day. We are
fast moving towards the time when it will be
the duty of governiments to assist in cooperation, and when, whether we like it or
not, there is bound to be a greater degree
of public ownership than there is now.
From my experience with the Canadian National Railways I would say that system never
had a chance to succeed under public ownership. Unfortunately for this country, and for
the railway, the man who was secured to
manage that great system was not at all the
proper type.
The leader of the Government has said
something about his view in regard to the
selection of directors for this system. In the
days of the last Government of the, present
Prime Minister there were three directors
from the Maritime Provinces, three from
Quebec, three from Ontario, one from Manitoba and one from British Coluibia. There
was no director from either Saskatchewan or
Alberta. I have often wondered why that was.
In the province of Saskatchewan there are
3,700 miles of Canadian National 'lines, and, as
we cannot ship by water, we have the longest
rail haul of any province in the Dominion.
During the years I speak of, branch lines
were being built in the province of Saskatchewan and the province of Alberta. In 1931,
when I was asked to consider an appointment
to the directorate of the Canadian National
Railways, I said I would much rather have
had it three or four years previously; that the
proposal was somewhat tardy, and seemed like
locking the door after the horse had been
stolen, so far as the interest of the province
of Saskatchewan was concerned. I mention
this in connection with my statement that, as
regards the Canadian National Railway
System, public ownership has never had a
chance.
It was generaldy considered that the Canadian Pacifie had the southern part of Saskatchewan and the Canadian National the
northern part. In 1929, when, if my memory
serves me aright, the present Minister of
Finance was the Minister of Railways, the
Canadian Pacific Railway secured charters to

JUNE 19, 1936
ýut into the best part of the Canadian
National's territory in Sa.skatchewan. The
Canadian. Pacifie obtained ru.nning rights over
two large bridges, one across the South Saqkatchewan river at Fenton and the other
across the North Saskatchewan. at Prince
Albert, as well as over one hiundred miles of
Canadian National traok. The Canadian
Nationail had previously built west of Prince
Albert Vo the south of Witchekan Lake. The
Canadian Pacifie then secured, a charter to
bu-iki north of thiat lake, the resuit being that
the trafflo was sh'ared between the two roade
and was unprofitabie for both.
The Canadian Pacifie built a lne to
Meadow Lake, tapping territory that would
have been served by the Canadian National
to Loon Lake. Dring my termi on the 'board
1 was constantiýy being requested to, do what
I Gould, to have th-e steel laid through the best
part of the territory from St. Waliburg Vo
Loon Lake. a distance of th-irty-fbur miles.
The line that th.- Canadian National had
buiilt between these points was forty-one miles
long, running over swamps and muskeg,
through very poo>r territory, in order tio serve
a certain political friend of the then Government. Hundreds of thousands of yards of
earth were sunk in that muskeg. and to-day
the grade is there without steel. 1 fear there
is now a danger of our returning Vo the, systemn
which produed such evils. IV would, have
bein a, good thing had both Saskatchewan and
Alberta been represented, by directors on the
Canadian National in that period when certain brandi uines were being eonstructed.
We hiave heard criticism of Ju4ge Fullertoýn
on the ground that during bis regime the
morale of Vhe men had fallen. The Good
Book says, "Woe unto, you, when ail men shall
speak well of you !" I assure you, honourable
senators, that any man who accomplishes what
it is neoessazy Vo accomplisi on Vie Canadian
National wiIl nlot b-e spoken well of by ail
men.
I had a good opportunity of knowing the
kind of morale that existed under tie old
sysbem. Regardless of what a'bility a man had,
if hie could devise some means of advertising
tie presîdent in a flattering way, bis salary
would, be raised, and his position thereafter
secure. I could namne instances. The president would go to a man and say: "You are
get.ting only $10,000. Tiat is noV enougi
You will receive $15,000 ini the future?" On
the other hand, if a man made any criticism,
out hie would go, even thougi hie were one of
the rnost valuable employees on Vie road.
I will tell honourable, members about one
man who wa-s given a good sala.ry at Van-

couver for doing nothing whatever of value
to the raiiroad. For the first six montis that
I was on the board I found it impossible to,
geV information about this case, the employees
being afraid Vo say a word until tiey feit sure
it was safe Vo do so. However, I hearned the
facts laVer. This man had the use, of a private
railroad car, and in addition.was supplied witi
a Buick automobile and a liveried chauffeur
who was .paid $150 a monti. H1e had an
office staff of three or four. Altogether the
Canadian National was spending $40,000 a year
on this favoured employee and his staff, and
in return receiving no services other Vian
periaps something of a social nature. The
iawns and groundis around his private house
were improved at a cost of $4,000, paid for
by the people of Canada. H1e was the cause
of a great deal of dissatisfaction among railroad
employees in Vancouver. My honouraùble
friend, from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
wili appreciate what I mean when I tell him
tiat this man had no railroad senîority. Otier
employees, who had spent long years witi the
railway, wanted to know why one of their
num-ber should flot have been given tie job,
if someone iad Vo be appointed.
Here is another instance to show what the
morale was like in Viose days. In the coach
en route to Montreal I would overhear conversations like this hetween nien wio were
unaware of my identity: "So-and.so, a conductor, was caugit cold putting down money.
But lie went to Montreal and saw the big boss,
and now lie is aIl right and 'back at work."
Tiere was a man who was paid, with his
expense money, around 815,000 a year, and
wiose chief duty was Vo advertise the president.
I arn glad Vo know tiat the present head of Vie
Canadian National Railways d'oes not require
any boosting at ail. I have read somewhere
that at banquets given in Rome three or four
thousand years ago it was a custom Vo have the
guests greeted by slaves and directed- wiich
foot Vo put forward, first. The advertising
man who was, getting this 'big salary performed
perhaps a service somewhat like that for Vie
tien president, and at other times acted as a
kind of advance guard to ses thaýt the president's movements were advertised, and bis eutertainment looked after.
I have here an inte.resting table of figures,
an analysis of the cost of supervision on each
of Vhe two railroade. The table waa handed
Vo me by the honourable senator from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis), who assures
me the figures are accuraite. I shall read only
a list showîng comparative expenditures by
eaoh of the milways for salaries Vo Vie
more iighiy paid officiais.

I think. honourable senators, that the operation of the Canadian National Railways is
one of the most serious problems facing the
count.ry to-day. I a.m not acquainted with
the present Minister of Railways, but I know
what happened to the road in years gone by,
during the administration of the present Prime
Minister. I am not at all satisfied that we
shall not see a return to certain bad conditions
which existed in those years. Coming from
the Prime Minister's own constituency, as I
do, I may say that throughout the eleotion
campaign I did not hear one word uttered
there to the effect that he intended to place
the Canadian National Railways back under
political control. I very much doubt that the
result of the election would have been what it
was had that been a p;lank in the right honourable gentleman's platform.
In closing may I say that I feel the Government should have waited at least another
year before proposing any changes. I do not
think it is fair to say that more should have
been doue by the precent trustees than bas
been done. In my opinion no man living could
have accomplished wh-at the leader of the
Government in this Chamber seems to think
Judge Fullerton should have a.ecomplished in
the one year and nine months since he
assumed the post of chairman of the board.
Il seems to me that the very best men obtainable will require at least four or five years.
if not longer, to bring about the improvement
my honourable friend seems to expect.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If my honourable
friend will permit me. I should like to say
a word in justice to the Canadian National
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

officials-and what I have to say wil apply
equally to officials of the Canadian Pacifie. I
understood my honourable friend to state that
while sitting in a eoach going to Montreal he
had overheard men, to whom bis identity was
unknown, talking about a conductor who had,
to state it bluntly, stolen money and had been
placed back in employment after an interview
with high officials at head office. I want to say
that as a resuLt of many years' experience I
am unable to credit anything like that. I
know the railroad officials of Canada too well
to believe that such a thing could happen.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The conversation certainly took place.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not doubt that
at all.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: And the gentleman
who was said to have been interviewed was Sir
Henry Thornton.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think the fellow
who was tellling the story was just "smoking
up.,
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable senators, in view of the vote which I intend to cast
in this matiter I think it is appropriate to put
my opinions on record, and I shall do so
briefly. I listened to-diay to the speech of the
right honourable gentleman who leads this side
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), and
I believe the statementzs lie made are incontrovertible. Furthermore, I am in entire
agrecinent with the prophecies and fears which
he expressed for the future. The question
which we have to ask ourselves at this time,
however, is: what would be the situation if this
Bill were defeated? The Government, particularly the Minister of Railways, have hamstrung the board of trustees. Under the circumstances it is inconceivable that the business
of this company can be carried on by these
trustecs. We are told that the term of office
of two of the trustees, Mr. Morrow and Mr.
is about to expire. The evidence
Labelli,
before us is ample proof that co-operation
between the Minister of Railways and Judge
Fullerton is impossible. If we voted against
this Bill, what would be the situation? The
honourable senior gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) said to-day there would
be a state of chaos. I am in entire agreement with him. On the other hand, if I vote
for the Bill, and it passes this House, I am
fully persuaded a distinctly retrograde step
will have been taken, and the result will be
disastrous. I find myself in such a position
that I must take refuge in the political
situation w-hich confronts us. A Government
has recently come from the electorate with

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable sen-ators, I do not intend to vote against this
Bill, although 1 do not approve of ail its
-clauses. But my vote for the third reading
must lot be taken as indieating any antagonismn on my part towards the board of trustees.
On the contrary, I consider the members of
that board have been t'horoughly competent
in the performance of their dutiesl. I know
Mr. Edward Labelle person.ally, and I have
frequently had occasion to admire bis ability
and integrity.
I have now no competence to say that tbe
remedy proposed by the Government will be
an effective solution of our railway problem.
Eowever, I think it is the part of wisdom
to allow the Administration to have a free
band and take full responsibility. The rigbt
honourable leader of the Lef t (Rigbt Hon.
Mr. Meighen) bas made a forceful speech
against the Bill, and it is possible that the
future will confirm tbe wisdom of bis opposition to it; but for my part, 1 repeat, I tbink
it is well to let tbe Government assume full
responsibility for tbe proposed change in the
administration of the C-anadian National Railways.
Hou. DONALD SUTHERLAND:
Honourable senators, it is witb a good deal of
diffidence that 1 take part in this debate.
During the few months I have been a mem'ber of this Chamber I have been observing
the attitude of the older and more experienced
senators. 1 mu.st say I bave been rather
disappointed to hear some honourable members say. "WelI, the Government is responsible,
and it is not for this body to take part in
such and sucb matters." In, fact we wpre
warned by one bonourable member to be
careful how we treated a certain measure,
as there was a strong feeling in -the country
in favour of abolishing this bouse altogetber.
I bave always had a great deal of respect for
the Sen'ate, for among its members there
have been, and always will be, many wise,
experienced and capable men. Their wide
experience and ripe judgment are invaluable
to this country, particularly at the present
time.
Witb respect to this Bill, I am inclined to
compare the railway situation to veins and
arteries of tbe body. Whenever there is any
jcong&seýtion or obstruction we may be certain

587

that our bodies will soon be in a very serious
condition unless we take proper measures to
restore bealth and effect a cure. It is an
old saying that hope deferred make.th tbe
heart sick. Well, my m.emory is pretty good
on some matters. particularly in connection
witb railways, because I have always regarded
them as the very arteries and veins on wbich
we are dependent for the development of our
country, and unless they are functionîng
properly everything else will be advereely
affected. For that reason I would ask the
indulgence of tbe House while I go back only
a f ew years and deal briefly with some important railway events.
I was a merober of the Ontario Legislature
when the tben Prime Minister of Canada
introduced rwbat was known as the National
Transcontinental Railway Bill. The event is
stili f resh in my mi. Apparently be did so,
witbout baving consulted 'bis Minister of Railways, and many honourable members will recaîl tbe speech wbich the Hon. A. G. Blair
made on tbat occasion in opposition to it.
H1e was right, and 'the Government was absolutely wrong. Time has justified to the very
letter every statement be then made, and býas
condemned the policy of tbe Government of
that day. At tbe present time we are stili paying tbe penalty for that blunder.
The bonourable leader of the Opposition
in this House tbis afternoon gave us a
masterly review of tbe Tailway situation, and
so enabled us to sec very clearly wbat our
duty is with respect to this Bill. H1e referred
to tbe danger of a return to, the old systeffn
of management, brin.ging the C-anadiaa Na-.
tional Railways under political control.
As was pointed out this afternoon, we were
forced 'to take over various Tailways, several
of them bankrupt, wbich now form. tbe Canadian National Railrway System, and we had
to assume their obligations. To-day it is
our duty to see that the moat efficient management possible be devised by tbe best minds
of tbis country and put into operation. I do
not know a great deal about the mnen wbo
less than two years ago were appointed to
the 'board of trustees, but I do know tibat
many of our strong party pa.pers, particularly
those supporting the Liberal party, have been
rather complimentary in tiheir references to
the work of thbe board of trustees during the
past two years. The Winnipeg Free Press
cannot be considered as very favourable to
t>he Conservative party; in fact it 'bas nearly
always been a stauncb supporter of the
Liberal party; yet as recently as March 27
of tbis year tbere appeared in that paper a
leading editorial reading in part as follows:

SENATE
Just what the depression did to the Canadian National in reducing its volume of traffic,
is clearly set forth in the report.
That is, the report of the railway board.
As against this, are the hopeful features of
the present situation-the improvement in the
returns from every branch of the system on
land and water, resulting from a betterment
of economic conditions, and the prospect of a
further moderate improvement, at least.

The average operating revenue was reduced
from $285.000.000 in the five years 1926 to
1930, to $169,000,000 in the five years 1931 to
1935. That is a drop of 41 per cent. The net
revenue after payment of operating expenses
averaged $42,644,000 in the first five years, and
$8,003,000 in the second period.

And after payment of interest on the funded
debt, the average income deficit was $9,542,000
in the first period-it was within that amount
of breaking even, according te any reasonable
conception of the position and real obligations
of the Canadian National-but

of the depression, when the traffic fell away

tonnage in all divisions. Operating expenses
increased by 4-6 per cent. as compared with
6-3 per cent on Class A railways in the

The Canadian

first time an operating profit. The amount
was $200.000, as against an operating deficit
of $96.000 in 1934. The Canadian Government
Merchant Marine bad an operating profit of
$311.000. as against an operating deficit of
$127.000 the previous year.
That is the result of the operation of the
Canadian National Railways by the board of
trustees for nearly two years.
I contend, honourable senators, that the
Government bas no mandate to do the very
thing which it is doing by this Bill. In fact such
a policy bas been denounced by none other
than the present Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, in a speech which he made in
North York in 1925. This is the Globe report
of September 7, 1925. In dealing with the
railway problem ho says:
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND.

It is one of the fundamental principles of
the Liberal party to ensure that the control
and management of the National Railways is
divorced completely from political influence
and control.
That was bis statement when he was appealing to the people of this country.
Now that he is in office, some bonourable
gentlemen contend that he bas a. mandate
from the people -of the country. Did the
Prime Minister discuss this matter with the
people of the country before the last election?
I venture to say that he did not go on one
platform anywhere in the country and intimate that if his party was returned the railway would come back under political control,
or that it would be the right of the Government to do with it whatever it thought fit.
Judge Fullerton, the chairman of the board,,
who was res'ponsible to Parliament. is being
replaced by Mr. Hungerford, who was also
on the board of trustees last year.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He was not a
trustee. He was the titular president and
manage.r of the road.
That makes
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND:
my argument all the stronger. I have here
a booklet entitled, "The Railway Situation of
1921." I cannot vouch for its acc.uracy, but I
know that some honourable gentlemen on
this side of the House will not dispute it. It
is issued by the National Liberal Committee,
145 Sparks Street, Ottawa, and bears the name
of Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King, Liberal leader,
and Andrew Haydon. National Organizer and
General Secretary for the Liberal Party. This
booklet goes very fully into the railway situation, and among other things deals with the
gentleman who is to be made president of the
new board, and to be responsible to the Government. The present Government did not
always have such a high regard for the ability
of Mr. Hungerford as it would appear to have
to-day. This article is headed, " Unable to
tell Committee cost of operating trains," and
reads as follows:
Mr. S. J. Hungerford, Vice-President in
charge of operation and maintenance of the
Canadian National Railways. was on the
witness stand on April 27. Mr. Hungerford
is supposed to be an expert on railway operation; in any event he is in charge of the

should know every detail of the operation of
all trains, but when the Hon. Chas. Murphy
asked him what the cost was of operating
a service between Ottawa and Montreal or
Ottawa and Toronto. or in fact between any
two given points, this Vice-President, this
expert on railway operation. the very man
upon whom the success or failure of operating our Government system depends, replied:
"I do not think it is possible to determine it."

JUNE 19, 1936
Just imagine the man in charge of operations saying that hie cannot tell how much it
costs to operate a Government train between
twe given points.
This is the gentleman who is now selected
,to save the situation and to put the railways
of Canada on a paying basis.
Honourable members, as f ar as I arn concerned, I amn going to vote against this Bill
even though I should neyer have an opportunity to vote in this asse«nbly again. I
hope the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) will not be terrorized
by the fear that an enraged people will
attempt to abolish the Senate and deprive him
of the position hie now occupies. My duty is
very clear, and I arn going to vote against the
Bill.
Some Hon. SENATOR.S: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is

CONCURRED

The Senate proceeded to consider the

to Bill 97, an Act to amend the Combines
Investigation Act.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, the Bill that came to 'us fromn
the House of Comimons, amending in two
particulars the Combines Investigation Act,
hias been amended in Com.mittee of the Whole
by tihe Tejection of the principal clause. I
desire just a f ew moments to express my
dissent, and to register mny vote againat concurrence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Concurrence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Against concurring ini this amenciment. I shail preface
myf remarks by stating in a very f ew wordls
,What I believe to be the situation with regard
to this Bill, which is said to 'be amended.
Mergers and combines generally ýbespeak
monopoly. There &nay be good comlbines or
bad ones. The law seeks to reach and to dissolve the bad onesl.
I think we all recognize that in industry
there are three interested parties: ca.pital,
labour, and the consumer. Capital, generally

589

speaking, is tihe prod.uct of labour. Sometimes it is the produet of sormething else, but
from the outset we ail -have recognized ià as
the accumulation of savings resulting from
labour. Labour in industry represents a very
important element. While it is not equally
important in every industry, there are industries in which it is a very large factor
indeed. The consumers are the public.
I believe that capital, when it takes the
form of a monopoly in industry, should be
controlled. We know wrhat hunian nature is;
that there is frequently a consideralile
appetite, and in some well known in-stances
greed, for profit. 1 have not reached my
present age without giving some thought to
the industrial problems and to thie confiicts
that appear all over the world batween capital
and labour. I surmise, and 1 venture to
express the opinion, that the solution of the
problemn of to-diay, and probably of tomorrow, is to give labour representation on
the directorates of industries which are monopolistie in character.
I may be asked why labour should be
represented on a board of directors.

Why should labour be represented on the
boards of industries which are monopolistie
in character? I belicve that we are rapidly
moving towards the day when it will be an
acccpted formula that capital is entitled to a
f air dividend, te protection for the future by
means of a depreciation reserve to be set
aside annually, and to a reserve for lean
years, or years of depression, and that when
these three things have been provided for
-depreciation, regerve, and dividend-a share
of the profit shaîl go te labour.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We can take
that up on a future occasion.
I come now to this Bill. What about the
protection of the consumer against a monopoly? The only protection for him that I
can see is in the working of the Combines
Investigation Act. When I come to the consumer, which means every respectable person
in the country, I feel that every monopolistic industry should be subject to the X-ray
of the Combines Investigation Act.
Are you going to
Mr. BALLANTYNE:

programme?
Perhaps. DoHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
minion Textiles might have increased its
capital less rapidly if labour had been invited to share in the profits.
Now I come to the Bill itself. My right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
has expressed fears for the witnesses who may
be called before the investigator with documentary evidence. I should like to read the
clause that we debated yesterday, just for the
purpose of one argument. Here is the clause:
No person shall be excused from attending
and giving evidence and producing books,
papers or records, in obedience to the order
of the Commission, on the ground that the
oral evidence or documents required of him
may tend to criminate him or subject him
to any proeeeding or penalty, but no such
oral evidence so given shall be used or receivable against sueh person in any criminal
proceedings thereafter instituted against him,
other than a prosecution for perjury in the
giving of such evidence.
I have emphasized the fact that any person
may be summoned by the investigator to produce documents-books, papers and any other
records. In addition to prodiucing such documents a person may give evidence, but that
will not militate against him if be is put on
trial after the investigation. Once the documents have been produced, they, or copies of
them, will be filed by the investigating official.
The person producing them will not run the
risk of being confronted later with any statement he may make concerning them, because
his oral evidence cannot be used against him
at a trial. Only the documents themselves
may be used in, the event of a trial.
Therefore I cannot understand why the word
"documents" should be left in the proviso
from which the Bill would delete it. The
House of Commons has twice voted in favour
of deleting the word, in order that the trial
of anyone accused of combining may not be
impeded. as it must be while the word remains. I wonder why we should insist upon
its retention, since, as I say, the oral evidence
of the person producing documents cannot be

TANNER.

used against him at a trial. My right honourable friend fears that the fact of a man
being examined and making certain admissions
with respect tò a document may weaken his
defence, should he later be put on trial and
the document be produced. It seems to me
that that stand implies too paternal an interest
in parties accused of having combined contrary
to the law. It seems to me also to imply a
fear that justice may prevail against such
person. I am not disposed to go so far towards protecting anyone against whom a
report of participation in an alleged combine
may be made. In the light of the opinion of
the law officers and of the gentleman responsible for administering this Act, Mr. Justice Sedgewick, I hold that if documents produeed at an investigation cannot be used later
at a trial the administration of justice will be
impeded.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? What is it
that the commission wants to cure by this
amendment? As I understand the matterI have not gone into it at all-an accused
person is protected by the law of evidence and
the common law of the realm. Does the
commissioner want these laws abrogated in
order that some purpose of his own may be
served?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: He wants only
one abrogated.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does he want to
change the law of the country to suit himself?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: At this late

somewhat obl-igated to say a few words on the
matter. I should have been to some extent
handicapped in piresenting any material arguAs to the
ment on the question ye.aterday.
question asked by the honourable the senior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans),
I think we had better ascertain whence arose
this whole point about documents. Welll, it
arose right here in the Senate, on July 3, 1935,
hardly a yeair ago. Prior to that time the
Combines Investigation Act d.id not make
the exception with respect to documents that
it now does. Would it be improper for me to
suggest that in this controversy-for that is
what it is-we are surely proving that great
minds do not always think alike?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Yours and mine.

JUNE 19, 1936
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

For instance.

But

I do not place mine in that category, for I
do not consider that I have a great mind on
legal questions. I have, however, a slight
knowledge of some interrejjate.d activities in

connection with this matter, and I think it
should be placed upon record.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: You are too modest

altogether.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us analyse the
record. This question arose in British Columbia in 1926, when, incidentally, the combinesters were fined $25,000 each. 1 think it
wdll that this information should be placed
on Hansard. I arn quoting from page 6 of
the Registrar's Third Report of Proceedings
under tbe Combines Investigation Act, 1926:
The admission of evidenée of letters and
other documents seized by Mr. Duncan during
his investigation under the Combines Investigation Act was objected to by the defence on
the ground that the statute stipulated that
such documents would not be used against the
person producing them in any criminal proceedings subsequently instituted againat him
except in a case of perjury. After hearing
argument on this point by the opposing counsel
Mr. Justice McDonald ruled that documents
whichi were obtained f rom the defendants by
Mr. Duncan in any manner other than production by a witness in giving evidence before
him were admissible against the defendants on
whose premises they were found. Mr. Duncan
accordingly produced sucli documents as came
within this ruling and the saine were admitted
in evidence.
Now, will honouraible senators please listen
to this?
When the Crown's case concluded on February 24, a motion by counsel for Miss K. A.
Gibson, of Mutual (Vancouver), Limited, to,
dismiss the case ýagainst hier was refusedl by
the court, but Mr. Justice McDonald stated
that lie would instruct the jury not to convict
lier on the ground that she was acting under
instructions sud was not credit manager of
the firm. Counsel for the other defendants
moved to withdraw the prosecution from the
jury, contending that the Crown had failed to,
prove the accused were parties to a conspiracy, but the court's decision was that the
case must go to the jury against all defendants
and the defence were instructed to reply to
the Crown's charges.
Right there the question came uîp of securing the necessary documents, books and information which it was believed conclusively
proved or disproved whe-ther the parties who
were alleged to be in a combine were or were
not actually in it.
In 1935 there, came to us f rom. another place,
under a Governiment led by a distinguished.
legal gentleman, who, I presume, knows legal
parl-ance and practice as well as any honourable senator in this House, a proposed revision cf the Combines Investigation Act,

which did flot have reference to the question
we are now discussing. On July 3, the right
honoura-ble senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), speaking for the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
presented. to this House tihe amendanent made
to Bill 79, an Act to amend the Combines
Investigation Act:
Page 6, line 41.
For "oral evidence s0
given" substitute "levidence or documents 80
required."
I was flot a member of the Banking and
Commerce Committee in 1935, nor arn I yet,
but I have always tried to attend important
meetings of the committee. I well recail the
discussion and the votes of those who deait
with the question at that time. I know in
my own mind whence came this proposai to
insert the word "documents." I think it is
only fair to me to say what my judgment
was in that respect. The right honourable
gentleman who then led the buse (Right
Hon. M.r. Meighen), and who this afternoon so ably discussed other questions,
was, I think, the most insistent that the
A littie later
word should be inserted.
I shall state where I think he got the suggestion or-may I say without impropriety?inducement to make a proposai of that kind.
I think it ought to be deait with in order
that the record may be completed. Then, as
chairman of Comimittee of the Whole, I heard
him give bis view-s upon this particular question. Whether we agree wîth the right lionourable gentlemen or not, every member of
this House, I amn sure, is always glad to hear
him in plain, un.varnished English state bis
views.
I repeat, I ar net a legal gentleman. Let
us see whether bis Iaw is sound and borne
out by the facts. Yesterday we heard him
say that in a murder trial docu.mentary evidence secured as under the Combines Investigation Act could not be used against the
accused. May I refer to the Security Frauds
Prevention Act of 1930? I quote the latter
part of subsection 1 of section 10:
-no person shall be entitled to dlaim any
privilege in respect of any document, record
or thing asked for, given or produced on the
ground that lie might be incriminated or
exposed to a penalty or to civil litigation
thereby and no evidence given shahl be
privileged except under The Evidence Act and
The Canada Evidence Act, and save further
that no provisions of The Evidence Act shall
exempt any bank or any officer or employee
thereof f rom the operation of this section.
Next let me cite the Public and Departmental Inquiries Act. Yesterday the right
honourable gentleman opposite, I underatand,
laid stress upon the assertion that persons
brouglit before the Combines Investigation

SENATE
Commission were not allowed counsel to
defend them. I think a reading of the Combines Act will show that is not correct. I
quote section 13 of the Public and Departmental Inquiries Act:
No report shall be made against any person
until reasonable notice shall have been given
to him of the charge of misconduct alleged
against him and he shall have been allowed
full opportunity to be heard in person or by
counsel.
Now, am I justified in holding certain views
as to what this is about and whence it came?
Let us imagine a situation within the last
two or three years. Certain individuals undertook to bring about a combination whereby
they would be able to exploit a large and
important section of the consuming public
of Canada. We find in such a case the possibility of a bogus set of books prepared for
the purpose of holding back the facts or
definite information relative to the combine.
Those "phoney" books are placed before the
commissioner making the investigation. With
what result? Well, under the present law,
which was not the law then, such "phoney"
books could not be referred to in a prosecution
for an attempt to sandbag-I am using a railroad term-the consuming public of Canada.
Presumably the actual books, if they could be
impounded or sec.ured by the Mounted Police
or in any other way, being alleged to be the
proper documents of the firm, would be evidence and would be placed before the commission. If the Senate, in its great knowledge,
wisdom and experience, is really desirous
of dealing fairly with the people of Canada,
I am very anxious to know whether it wants
to perpetuate a condition of that kind.
Let us not forget the 5th day of July, 1935.
We had an amendment handed to us. We
were hurrying right up to the last minute,
with no chance, maybe, to deal with some

going to stand. what about one concern which
the public suspects, righbly or wrongly, has
been sandbagging or holding up the people of
Canada-a concern, Jet us say, which some
years ago invested hall a million dollars in its
business and then proceeded to reimburse
itself by inordinate profits and in the course
of a few years enriched itself to the tune of
$15,000,000 odd? In the investigation of a concern of that kind, if this Bill is rejected, there
is the invitation: "Come right in and bring the
worst documentary evidence you have, and
we cannot do a thing with you, because we
cannot use it if you are insistent and put
in the documents before the investigating
commissioner." Oh, I know the right honourable gentleman opposite and other honourable
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

senators will say that you can issue a subpoena and get this or that document. No,
there will not be any chance to do that, for
this law is an invitation to come and shove
documents into the hands of a commissioner
under the Combines Investigation Act just as
soon as anyone intimates to some individual
trader he is under suspicion. All that fellow
has to do if he is as guilty as hell-pardon
the expression- is to present the worst cevidence that can be produced against him, his
own books and documents, and then he is
free under the Law. Yet the common people
are looking for a square deal under such conditions!
I come now to another phase. I regret a
great deal more than any of you can imagine
to be impelled to say whence came this proposal. I think I know the facts beltter than
any other member of this House. I say that
with all due respect to the right honourable
gentleman opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
This amendment is a thought born at an investigation held in a city in the province of
Ontario, where the high-class and capable
gentleman who now is an official of this Senate
was abused-improperly and unfairly treatedby a certain commissioner; in fact, as I understand, he was put out of the room. There was
no justification for what that commissioner
did to our distinguished friend. There and
then, in my judgment, this idea of documents
boing made immune from furtber consideration was born, and he developed it and kept
it alive until it came to us in 1935 on the
advice of our distinguished friend-advice
which, I am quite sure, the right honourable
leader opposi-te, as well as myself, regarded as
high-class. I think the whole thing is born
in resentment against injustice, without any
regard to thie possibility of greater injustice
that may be done to deserving consumers and
producers in this country, who may require
some of these documents secured by the
a,ttendance of witnesses.
When the right honourable gentleman
opposite was talking last night about murderers
and other criminals, and their being protected
against evidence of this kind, being used
against them, I wondered about a person, let
us say, "shoving the queer'-passing out
counterfeit money. If he were suspected and
arrested, and he happened to have an inside
pocket full of "phoney" $20 and $50 bills,
surely all he would have to do, should the
theory enunciated by the right honourable
gentleman opposite be correct, would be
to pull the bogus bills out of his pocket and
say: "Here they are; take the evidence. You
cannot use these against me."

JUNE 19, 1936
0f course, legal gentlemen will say, "No, a
comparison of that kind would be too inapt."
But the point is this. The chairman of the
Tariff Board heads the commission which
handies the Combines Investigation Act. I
arn not acquainted with him, but I have heard
nothing but excellent reports of bis courage,
independence and ability. Last nighýt the
right honourable gentleman opposite read a
portion of a letter written hy Judge Sedgewick to the Prime Minister, stating bis views
on this Bill. I have quoted briefly what Mr.
Justice McDonald said in 1925 in respect to
documents which at that time were received.
Then we have the views of the Deputy Minister of Justice, whioh, I presumne, are those of
the Minister of Justice, as this Bill received
bis approval. I dislike very much to do an
injustice to any man in thought or word, but
my firm, positive conviction is that only two
distinguished gentlemen are wedded to these
words, which they were insistent on putýting
into the law of 1935, and are equally
insistent to-day on retaining there.
Someone may say, "It do-es not matter
much what you think." I realize that, but
it is .my personal judgmýent that the rank and
file of Canadians througbout the length and
breadth of this country will not believe they
have any chance of getting a square deal
under the Combines Investigation Act if tbis
horrible perversion of justice-for I can
describe it as nothing else-is permitted to
remain in the law. It is a horrible perversion
of justice in that it contenmplates--yes, invites
and coaxes--the worst combinester or the
biggest crook to bring in the most convincing
documentary evidence he possesses, so that
for ever afterward he may be immune from
having it referred to again. I doubt that the
Sonate of Canada can maintain its reputation
as a reasonable and proper protector of the
ordinary citizen of Canada if it adopts to-day
the particular amendment made yesterday to
the Combines Investigation Bill.

yesterday as clearly as I could. I was convineed that the proposed enactment was a
wholly unnecessary departure from the common law of England, and of Canada, in respect
of persons whýo subsequently might be accused.
If I was rigbt in my argument, there -is no
more need of this law than there is of another Parliament Building on this bill.
I am afraid that yesterday I did not speak
to very rauch effect. Perhaps there is very
little use in my speaking any -more. I do

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will not the

He knows I was not talking of that. Certainly, if the tribunal decides it wants a document, and summons a man to produce it,
and makes him a witness. under the amendment before us that document cannot be used
against him. I know that. But the argument is made that without being asked for a
document at all, without being summoned,
all a man lias to do is to come in and force
the document on tthe tribunal. That is what
is acguel by the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock).

I should like it if the honourable member
would state that frankly. I would have donc
it for binm in a moment. I would net have
let anybody, without my objection, represent
that such a tlhing was possible under the law.
Il is so ridiculous it shocks the conscience.
I shall only refer to the point brought up
by the honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Murdock) with regard to the Security Frauds
Prevention Act, when he spoke of a person
having no protection except that given under
the Evidence Act. That is all I am asking
for here. Why should it net be granted?
One more word and I sit down. I am not
going to repeat all that I said yesterday; but
it bas been reprcsented to me by one for
whom I have a great regard in respect of the
law, that if a secretary, say, is summoned to
produce a document and does so, it is a
production by the company, and, because this
really deals with company matters, the company would be exempt froim the use of that
document against it in a subsequent prosecution. In every respect I differ wholly. This
is not a section that bas to do with the
procuring of something; it has to do with the
protection of a witness. Just read what it
says. I am saying this more for the purpose

JITNE 19, 1936
of having it appear in the record, to be read
by the party to whom 1 refer, and whose
marne 1 would rather flot give, than for any
other reason. The section says:
No person shall be excused f rom attending
and1 giving evidence
and producing
books,
papers or records. in ohedience to« the order
of the Commission-

Imagine someone saying he could force this
thing on the Commission! It is a scandalous
thing to say.

hine or subjeet hinm to any proceeding or
penalty, but no sucb oral evidence or documnents-as wxe think it should. read-so rcquired shahl be used or receivable against
suc'h person ln any criminal proceedings thereafter ilistituted against him ...
W'ho is in contemplation in the section? It
is the person voho cao attend and give evideoce and produce documents. The section
deals with bis protection. The evidence given,
whether docuimentary or oral, must be given
by a person Who can attend and give evidence
and produce documents,
Nobody but a
human being can do that. Only a human
hein-, who can attend and give evidence and
pro-duce books is in contemplation under
this section, and he is the only person wbo
is protected. A corporation is not protected
at ail, wbether it is a co-al combine, or the
textile industry-I thînk that is the one that
was mentioned under cover-or the plumbers'
organization that je being investigated. No
company is interested in this in any way at
ail, because no company can be a person. A
company can prodiice through its secretary,
but it cannot attend and give evidence or
produce books. It is only such a person who
is protected here. Now, have I made that
clear? ReaIly it is only individuals who are
concerned at ail.; corporations *have flot a
bit of interest in this. If VIhe comîrmissioner
thinks there is an individual who perhaps
should be prosecuted, he can have a search
warrant issuedHon. Mr. MURDOCK: As the Act is now,
does it not offer a means of protecting the
real crook?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

That cer-

tainly is flot the purpose behind the wording.

As I was saying, the tribunal can always get
documents from a co>mpany on a search warran t. There bas neyer been the slightest
trouble about that. One would think that thne

man was at stake. Wh'at humbug we do

I have no more to say. I have been trying
to answer a gentleman wbose opinion I know
is valuable, and who is quite honest and earnest in hýis attitude towards this subject. But
he is wrong in thinking that a eompany could
ever be protected by thne preisent Act, because
there is no question of a company being considered; at ail. The protection applies onýly
to a person who can giive evidence and producce documents. And of course a person.

OF READING

ROOM

Hon. W. A. SHARPE moved concurrence
in the eleventh report of the Standing Conmittee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Ac.counts.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
I understand that this report refers to one
of -the curators of the Senate reading rer.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I do not feel like
giving the stamp of my approval to this
report. There may be much to be said in
favour of the report, but I believe that at
this late stage of the session we need net adopt
the course which the committee recommends
and which, I submit, in the circumstances
would result in rather drastic treatment of an
old servant of the Senate. In my opinion the
facts that were stated before the committee
do net justify the recommendation which has
been made. I therefore move that the report
be not now concurred in, but be further considered at a later date.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: May I ask my honourable friend what he objects to in the report?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I do net object on the
ground of the age of the curator, because I
have satified myself that the age that was
mentioned before the committee is correct. I
may say to my honourable friend that since
the beginning of to-night's sitting I have corne
into posseCSion ni some information corroborating certain things that he told me. What I am
concerned about is this. The report reconmends the retirenent of an old employee of
the S-nate, whose services we have enjoyed
for many years. It is true that he was
obliged to absent himself from his duties a
few weeks this present session, but that is
something which may happen to anyone. At
any rate, I submit we certainly should not
consider it in the same light as if it were
wilful or deliberate neglect of duty.
I was late in arriving at the sitting of the
committee when this case was being dealt
with. So I do not accuse anyone of unfairness
or injustice with regard to the recommendation in the report. My main point is that if
we adopt the report we are likely to cause an
injustice to a man who has served the Senate
well over a long period of yea.rs. My second
point is this. It would seem to be rather unfair, to say the least, to retire this old servant
now, in the last days of the session, when for
some time to come his services will net be required as regularly as they are while Parliament is sitting.
i>n.

Mr. IJANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Honourable members,
the gentleman referred to in the report is one
of the curators of the reading room. During
almost the whole of the present session he has
been very ill and able to be at his work only
rarely. He is over sixty-six years of age. The
report recommends that he be rotired on full
pay for six months and that then he receive
superannuation, which will amount to from
$1,200 to $1,500 a year. I think there can be
no complaint about the proposed treatment
of him.
Hon. Mr. COTE: What is the condition of
his health now?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Very bad.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Can he attend to his
du'ies?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: No. He comes up to
the building to button-hole senators, asking
them to sec that he is retained in the service.
He is not doing any wo-rk at all at present.
Hon. Mr. COTE: If his health is sueh that
he can recuperate before long and resume his
duties, the fact that he is sixty-six years of
age is no reason why lie should be retired on
superannuation at this time. It is becau.se I
hold that view that I inquired as to the state
of his hnalth.

Accounts.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I was apprised only yesterday of the
decision of the committee to amend the plan
of organization of the Senate by cancelling
the position of "Second Assistant Clerk,
Editor and Chief Translator of French Deand substituting therefor
bates, Senate"
"Second Assistant Clerk and Archivist." The
position which it is proposed to cancel was
occupied by a gentleman who has since been
transferred to the Civil Service Commission.
It has remained vacant ever since. However,
it may be important before long to fill the
position again. The translator of our Hansard
has been transferred to the Bureau for Translations. I agreed to the transfer in 1934 in
the hope that our translation would be at
least on a par with the translation of the

appointed in the results, and my disappointment is shared by others. Instead of our
debates being sent to the Bureau to be dealt
with as rapidly as are the speeches of the

JUNE 19, 1936
Commons, the Bureau detailed two of its
transiators to the Senate and then appeared
to loac intereat in the work gaing on in aur
part of the building. One of the transiators
fel] sick, and for a number of weeks bis colleague bas bad to cope with ail aur work. This
lia resulted in considerable delay in the translation of our Hansard.
I tbink we shall soon have to decide to
reorganize our translation staff. The Clerk
of the Senate, wbo has tbe standing of a
Deputy Min-ister, advises me tbat a second
assistant clerk and archiviat is flot needed.
He concurs in my idea tbat tbe chief translator of our laws sbould be given tbe two
positions, so that he rnay superintend the
translation of both aur laws and aur Hansard.
I think tbe plan can be carried out, and for
that reason I would suggest tbat this report
ho not concurred in.
Hon. Mr. KING:
Honourable senators,
I dislike very rnuch -ta bave ta take a position
in opposition ta my leader.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wili support him.
Hon. Mr. RING:- Tbe Standing Committee on InternaI Econo'my and Contingent
Accounts is, I believe, designed ta look after
the canvenience of senatars ta see tbat they
have proper accommodation and staff. Last
session I had occasion ta move that tbis
position he fi]led by a persan wbo wauld give
bis services ta individual senators--not ta the
leaders, wba have paid secretaries. It is
necessary that we should bave somnebody ta
do research and otber work for us from time
ta time. As soon as I made my motion the
right honourable leader opposite (Rigbt Hon.
Mr. Meigben) said, "Yaur friend is not a
transIstor, and therefore he is out." H1e was
quite right. This year we have suggested
that the position of translator sbould be
changed te that of Second Assistant Clerk
and Aréhivist. My honourable leader does
not favaur the change, and says that it wil
be necessary ta appoint a transiator. If lie
refera ta the Act passed last session, I think
he will find he bas flot a chance of baving
sucb an appaintreent made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I tbink any
bonourable friend is in error.
Hon. Mr. RING: I do nat think so.
Under the Act passed st session the translators are concentrated in the Bureau for
Translations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I may say
that the position of "Second Assistant Clerk,
Editor and Chief Tranalator of French Debates. Spnate" can he filled, because tbere is

a vacancy. Next session I shaîl urge the
InternaI Economy Cominittee ta transfer tbe
chief transIstor of aur laws ta this post, and
Sa save ane of the salaries. Tbere wîll be no
difficulty in making the transfer.
Han. Mr. RING: Oif course 1 must accept
my bonourabJe leaLler's suggestion, but I arn
not canvincedý that be Lq rigbt. Under the
Act passed last session all translation work is
done iby the central Bureau for Translations.
Tbere was strong objection ta tbe Bihl by the
transiators and by the then Opposition, but
the la-w became effective and is in operation
to-day.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Sa there may be no misunderstanding, may I say ta my bonourable
friend tliat under the Translation BilI passed
last session the G*overnment mey by Order in
Council draft inta the Translation Bureau
transl-ators fram oth«er departments or from
the Commons and the Senate. Hawever, in
the case of tbe Senate it, bas refrained from
doing so., and bas sa stated to the officers of
this House. As a result we etill bave aur
translators bore.
Hon. Mr. RING: I arn gîtd ta hear tbat.
The recommendation cantained in this repart
wae sn.ýpported in the committee by a large
ma.jority. I understand tbe proposed appointee
is not acceptable ta some bonaurable senators. He was acceptable ta tbe committee, as
I say, by a very large majarity. I arn not bere
ta plead bis case, but woul urge that we
sbould bave such an officer wbom we can instruet, ta do research work and gatber information for individual senators. Unfortunately
we, are nat ai lawyers. Sorne of us are ordinary doctors and others are ordinary business
men, and we bave not. the training necessary
for rese-arch work and the gathering of linformation. This service would belp us lay
menabers very materisally and at a moderate
expendituro. I am n ot well acquainted witb
the individual wbo is suggested for tbe position. I used ta see bim &bout the building
when I was in the Bouse of Commons, but I
bave neyer bad any close association witb him.
I know he is a graduate of ane of tbe finest
universities on this continent, and a clever
man. There may be those who say lie is a
"darn nuisance" and is always looking for a
job. Well, I wauld encourage tbe man or boy
wha to-day will go out and look for a job.
There are not many doing sa.
If this report is not ta bo concurred in,
I wauld, suggeot ta rny bonourable leader that
we pass a resodlutian wbereby -a position of this
kind wil be establisbed for the convenience
of bonourable memibers.

SENATE

I may say to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
.ny honourable friend that it was through him
I was apprised for the first time yesterday,
or the day before, that someone should be
retained to help honourable senators in their
research work. I think we can arrange to
furnish that help to the mernbers of the
Senate. I take my honourable friend's statement that be is not alone in expressing a
desire for such help. But that is a matter
that can be arranged before, or at the beginning of, next session, in a much easier way
than the one my honourable friend suggests.
Under his proposal be would have to go to
the Civil Service Commission for a new classification, and the proposal for the appointment
of a person against the will of the Minister,
who for the Senate is His Honour the Speaker,
and against the will of the Deputy Minister,
who is the Clerk of the Senate, is not likely
to make that hurdle, even though it might
have succeeded in this Chamber. I think the
suggestion of the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. King) bas considerable merit, but I would
ask him not to press this question to a vote.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I just want to
offer a word on this matter. I have known
Mr. Wagar for some time. I know be is a
keen, capable, energetic and industrious man.
A few years ago the statement was made in
my hearing that the power existed to increase
the number of senators. I consulted a number of senators of long standing about the
matter, and found tbey had no knowledge in
regard to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They would
only bave to read the British North America
Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then an interesting discussion arose as to whether an attempt
had ever been made to increase the membersbip of the Senate. The matter was put into
Mr. Wagar's hands, and a day or so later we
got full information on the subject. It is
very interesting. I dare say it is not very well
known that an attempt was once made, in
regard to the Yukon Railway, to increase the
membership of the Senate. The decision of
the Queen then wasHon. Mr.

I think it was

It was in

the case of the Yukon Railway. It was thereupon laid down that there should be no increase unless it was necessary in order to
carry on the government. We received a
very full and complete document on the
subject from Mr. Wagar. It was that incident
which brought my attention to the fact that
be bas the ability to make such inquiries and
to produce interesting reports.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I want to say
just a word with regard to this matter. I am
a member of the committee concerned, and
supported the motion that was made in the
committee. My reason for doing so was that
I knew by experience how much we need
the services of a secretary of that kind, if I
may so call him. For years I did the kind
of work referred to, for a Minister to whom
I was secretary, and I know how bard it
sometimes is to find documents and references.
I have had the same difficulty in my legal
practice.
I tbink that in Mr. Wagar we have found
a man who has the necessary ability and
qualifications for such a position. But when
the ýmatter was discussed I was under the
impression, and I admit it candidly, that we
were just changing the title; not that we were
abolishing a position, which is something
vastly different. I would not for one moment
maintain that we should abolish the position
mentioned in the report, and if I had known
the first paragraph of the report when later
preparecl would take the form it has taken, I
would not have voted for it. I would have
insisted on trying to get a secretarial position
for Mr. Wagar or some other qualified person.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurandi) bas conceded, I think,
that if it is the desire of the members of the
House there should be a post of the kind
named. Then we have the question as to
Mr.Wagar. I cannot insist upon his appointment, but I do insist that this body of men,
not the Civil Service Commission, should
have something to do with the selection of an
officer of that kind.

to promote the economic and financial welfare
of the Dominion....
One may well ask whether it is appropriate
that a privately controlled institution should
control and protect the external value of the
monetary unit. Is it not the Government's
function to determine what our monetary
standard shall be; whether our dollar shall be
23-22 grains or 15 grains of fine gold; whether
in these days we will tie our dollar to the
pound sterling or to the United States dollar
or allow it to fluctuate half way between those
two currencies? It may be said on behalf of
the Bank of Canada that in performing this
funetion the bank would, merely endeavour to
carry out what the national policy, that is, the
Government's policy, happened to be at the
time. In other words, if the Government went
back on the gold standard at $35 an ounce it
would be the task of the bank so to regulate
the volume of credit in the country that our
dollar would remain at par, fluctuating of
course only within the gold points. in terms of
other gold currencies. Or if we decided to tie
up with sterling at a certain fixed rate it would
be the ta.k of the bank to buy and sell exchange in such a way as to maintain the pegged
rate with the pound sterling. I am confident
that this would be the way in which the bank
under its present management would interpret
its funetions. But is this a sufficient assurance for the future? Is it not possible to
conceive of a privately controlled central bank
in conflict with the Government, refusing to
carry out the declared national policy? The
only way by which such eventualities can be
prevented is to assure adequate Government
control of the bank.
Is it appropriate for a Government to leave
to a privately controlled institution the
stabilization funetions which are contenmplated by the preamble to the Act, which I
have just read? The preamble contemplates
that the Bank of Canada shall, by the appropriate mechanisms-chiefly open market operations and manipulation of the rediscount
rate-set at work influences which will tend
at times to expand credit and at other times
to contract credit, with a view to securing a
greater degree of stability in the level of
production, trade and employment. In other
words, when a boom is on the way and getting out of hand it will be the duty of the
bank to put on the brakes, so to speak, by
restricting credit, thus tendlng to cause a
decline in prices and to slow down the whole
tempo of business and speculative activity.
Conversely, in a time of depression it will be
the duty of the bank to bring influences to
bear t expand credit, thus tending to raise
prices and generally to quicken the tempo
of business activity.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

It is not necessary to stress how important
are such functions of the bank. If the bank
can by monetary action do something to level
off the peak of the boom and to fill in the
valley of the depression; if it can, as the preamble to the Act contemplates, "mitigate by
its influence fluctuations in the general level of
production, trade, prices and employment," it
will make an important contribution to the
economic welfare of this country.
For the first time in this country we have an
institution which is charged with the function
of regulating credit and currency, and wh.ich
therefore will consciously and deliberately set
influences to work which will affect the price
level as well as the level of production, trade
and employment. This is too vital a function

formed at all it should only be by an institution under adequate Government control.
These considerations apply to the sum and
substance of the Bill.
I suppose the

and Commerce after second reading?
Matters might
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

I think so.

Hon. LOUIS COTE: Honourable senators,
I am wondering why in his remarks the honourable leader of the Covernment referred
consistently to the bank, as at present constituted and operating, as a privately controlled
institution. I cannot agree that it is correctly
described as such. It is truc that all the
shares of the bank are held in private hands,
and none by the Government; but it is
equally truc that under the existing Act the
Government is given considerable control
over the bank. We all know that the Governor, who is a diirector of the bank, is a
Government appointee. Likewise the Deputy
Governor is a director and an appointee
under Order in Council. The Deputy Minister of Finance, a Government officer, is another director. These three gentlemen, together with a director elected by the shareholders, constitute the executive committee of
the bank and do all the executive work. The
other directors, elected by the shareholders,
are only an advisory body and meet but a
few times a year. The Governor of the bank
has a right of veto not only over the aets of
the executive committee when it is functioning as such, but also over the acts, resolutions
and decisions of the directors. Surely it is
not accurate to say that this institution, so

JUNE 19, 1936

appointees of the Governmen't, is a privately
controlled institution. The present Bill is
designed to give a still larger measure of control to the Government. Whether that additional coatrol is necessary or flot is, 1 suppose,
a question of noV very great importance, on
which opinions may differ. The Bill creating
the ,ban-k was considered in detail befcore our

Surely, therefore, it sbvuld net be seriouely
stated at this stage that the bank is a privately
controlled institution.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should flot
like Vo engage in a discussion as to the
measure of Government control provided for
by the present Act. There are features which
would seem Vo indicate that private interests
are able to exert con-siderable influence in
directing some of the policies of the bank. In
the Committee on Banking and Commerce
we shall be able to discuss these features with
the Deputy Minister of Finance, wbo is a
member of the board of directors.

BROADCASTING BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the Hou-se of
Commons with Bill 103, an Act respecting
Broadcasting.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: I desire to state broadly the
effect of this legislation.
The explanatory
note is as follows:
The objects of this Bill are to implement
the report of the Special Cotnmittee on the
"Canadian Radio Commission." The Bill proposes to repeal the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Act of 1932; place the direction of the
national broadcasting

system in the hands of

a corporation with an honorary board of nine
governors, a general manager and assistant
general manager, to carry on the business of

the corporation in the place and stead of the
present

contnission

of

three;

authorize

advances by the Government up to $500,000
to

the corporation

for capital works

to

in-

crease coverage, and up. to $100,000 for working capital advances. give the corporation
specific control over the character of programs,
especially
political
broadcasts:
give
the
Governor in Council authority to make regu-

lations controlling the use of equipment causing
interference
with
radio
reception;
licensing of broadcasting stations to remain
uder the Minister of Transport and technical
control of such stations is given to him to be
exercised in co-operation with the corporation.
Like every other citizen, I have followed
the comments from various sources on the
working of the present Act. I have never
reached a personal conclusion on the matter,
because it is outside the range of my knowledge-practical, technical or scientific. At
times I experience considerable pleasure in
listening to operas broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York; but what
I enjoy most about the radio, apart from those
splendid performances, is closing it down.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

them. My first action on reaching home is
usually to turn off the machine. I am probably a bad judge of broadcasting activities,
some of which are of considerable importance
in an educational aspect. If they were limited
to that they woutld be all right, but what
riles me most is to hear people, morning,
noon or night, offering to sell everything
under the sun. Nevertheless, radio broadcasting is a scientific development which is
one of the wonders of the age, and I suppose
I ýmust not be too refractory in regard to its
invasion of our homes in all its forms.
I move the second reading of this Bill, and
ask that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, wthere the
Director of Radio, Mr. Edwards, will be at
my side to explain this change in the supervision of the work. I may say that this Bill
is the outcome of serious study by a special
committee of the House of Commons, which
gave considerable attention to the matter
and reported unanimously. The Billl cornes
to us with the sanction and benediction of
virtually all the members of tie House of
Commons. I presume the committee's work
bas been well done. Even so, we have a right
to examine anew into the results that would
flow from the application of this measure,
and as to what improvement it would bring
about. In inquiring on that point we shall
have to rely upon the gentleman from the
department, who -is better informed than I
am.
Richit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I am
glad tbis Bill is going to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
J hope there is
someone on this side of the House who will
take a special interest in it, for, even tbough
it comes fron a committee of the Commons,
I am not tereby satisfied that it is a thoroughly good piece of draftsmanship. The fact
that J have no interest in radio is no reason
for my not having an interest in this Bill,
for undoubtedly radio is something which
very widely affects the Canadian people.
The feature of the Bill which I do not like,
though there may be sufficient reason for it.
is that it provides for the displacement of
persons who have given their services to this
national corporation, and for their replacement by others. This sort of change is becoming a habit in this country, and it appears
to me that it bas already seriously impaired,
and will impair still more, the efficiency of
our public work. Furthermore. it makes it
more and more difficult to secure the right
men to do that work.
While I am on the subject of radio may I
say that though radio may be a nuisance in

to some extent, but on the streets there is
no control. The situation is now such that
as you walk out of an evening to enjoy the
quiet that is su soothing and delightful, you
find that it is gone from you completely.
You hear a voice thundering from the window
of one house, and somebody broadcasting advertising from the window of another. It is
a series of noises that turns the city into a
veritable Hades.

NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
MESSAGE FROM HOUSE OF COMMONS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable members, a message has been received from the
House of Commons, reading as follows:
Resolved that a Message be sent to the
Senate to acquaint Their Honours that this
House agrees to their fourth amendment and
disagrees with their first, second, third and
fifth amendments to Bill No. 17, an Act respecting the National Harbours Board, for the
following reasons:
1. Amendment No. 1 makes impossible reemployment of many officers and employees of
present harbour boards who have long years
of service, and in addition would seriously
handicap the Board in the conduct of its
many competitive business operations.
2. Amendment 2 arises out of Amendment
1, and is not otherwise required.
3. Amendment 3 imposes restrictions that
serve no useful purpose, and which are not
presently imposed on other government services.
4. Amendment 5 is permissive only, and
confers on the Board no new authority. The
Government holds the view that the step
specified by this clause is nut desirable at
this moment.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members, I move that the Senate do nut insist
upon its amendments to which the House of
Commons has disagreed, but accede tu the
position that has been taken by that House.
I will read a memorand.um from the Minister
explaining the stand taken by the House of
Commons when our amendments were under
consideration there.
The Bill, as passed by the House, provided
that the Board should employ the necessary
staff and fix their remuneration; in other
words, powers previously held by the different
commissioners were to repose in the new
Board, which would in the natural course of
events give such authority in the matter to
port managers as would be required to provide
for the efficient operation of the harbours.
The Senate amendment provides that the
Board may employ its staff "under the
provisions of the Civil Service Act." Apart
from the question of principle involved, to
which reference will be made later, it would
appear that the amendment is inadequate in
its terms, assuming the purpose to be to place
the employees of the Board under the operation of the Civil Service Act, and its enactment in this form would create confusion in
administration and hardship to many deserving
employees in the harbours. Attention may be
directed to only one phase of the matter. At
the time of the coming into force of the Act
the Board will have no employees; its power
to employ under the Senate amendment would

SENATE
be operative only subject to the provisions of
the Civil Service Act. This would mean that
all appointees would have to pass a Civil
Service examination, be not more than 35
years of age, and otherwise eligible under the
provisions of the Civil Service Act. No preferelnce
nor blanketing-in
for the present
employees is provided for, as was the case
when the Civil Service Act was first made
applicable to the Government Service.
It is
not necessary to emphasize the chaos in the
administration of the harbours which would
be produced by the application of the amendment in its present terms.
The amendment also provides that temporary
employees employed otherwise than upon a
yearly or seasonal basis and labourers may be
employed by the appropriate port manager,
presumably without reference to the Civil
Service Act. It should be pointed out that
without supplementary provision for classification of harbour employees the scope of this
exemption is most indefinite. At the present
tine over 80 per cent of harbour employees
are outside forces, paid hourly or daily at
prevailing rates, and there are no classifications of positions as te whether they are
permanent or temporaiy. As a matter of fact,
for varions reasons the present commissioners
have found it desirable to a greater extent
than in the past, even for positions which are
likely to be of an indeterminate duration, to
make appointments on a monthly rather than
a yearly salary basis. The point is, that without a statutory requirement for the establishment of positions in accordance with Civil
Service rules and regulations, the Senate
amiendimîent wivill not achieve its purpose.
Criticism lias been directed against the
nethod enployed np to the present of recruiting harbour employees on the ground that
political
patronage
resulted
in
frequent
changes in personnel, to the detriment of the
service. al
that pressure to secure employment resulted iii more than the required
nunber of eniployecs being on the payroll.
witl conscqueiit waste of public fonds.
In
tle first place. I should point out that there
are among harbour employces in the outside
forces a great many wlio would be exempt
froi appointmnent by the Civil Service Commission even if the Act were made applicable
to the Board, whether or not the positions
occupied were of a permanent character. By
Order in
Council passed under the Civil
Service Act there are scores of categories of
employees exempted from the provisions of
the Act and miany of such classes of employees
are te lic found on flic payrolls of the harbours.
I might cite just a few of such exempted
classes:
labour foremîen, blacksmitlis, boiler
makers, carpenters, coopers, caulkers, charwomien, coppersimiths, masons, riggers, divers,
electricians, firemen, garage men, labourers,
locomotive engineers, nachinists, miilwrights,
plumbers, teansters, certain elevator operating
staffs, and so on.
The adoption of the principle of Civil Service appointmnent to harbour
staffs would. therefore. affect mainly those of
a professional, technical or clerical nature and
certain categories of outside employees engaged
in the operation of the port which might net
now be included in the exempted classes under
the Civil Service Act, of avhicli the police
force would be one.
Iln most of the harbours the principle of
iaintainiiig the technical and clerical staffs
irrespective of changes in government bas been
upheld to a very large extent.
Hou

Mr. DANDURAND.

I may say that that
practice.

bas been the

uniform

I admit that in ftimes such as these there
is great pressure brought to bear on those in
administrative responsibility and in publie life
to provide positions, but notwithstanding this
I can say that since the present Administration came into power the soundness of the
policy of maintaining intact staffs which are
competent, efficient and attentive te their
duties bas been recognized; such changes as
have been made are numerically lower than
on previous occasions when governments have
changed, and in many instances the changes
that have been made have been to tIse
advantage of the Service and brought about a
reduction in costs. I think I ani net unduly
optimistie in believing that it will be possible
under the new Board which will have responsibility in the first instance for flic administration of the harbours, te firmly establish
the principle of continuity of service, in so
far as the permanent organization is concerned.
As regards the contention that previously
the number of employees was unjustifiably
enlarged as a result of party pressure, such
action was in flic nature of things almost
entirely confined to the enployment in the
trades and labour forces.
These employees,
wiether flic Civil Service Act were made to
apply or not, would be outside Of the operation of tie commission. It would be no safeguard. therefore. fron
extravagance of this
kzind to bring the Harbour Boards under the
Act.
That safeguard is now te be provided
as it never was before by placinge flictinaicial
control of the harbours under tie Minister of
Finance and making the Board subject to an
annual budget, with an annual
audit of
accounts by the Auditor-General.
To rider now in

-to
be reminded that the liarbours are operating
business
facilities,
wharves,
sleds,
terminal railways, elevators and cold storage
warehouses.
It is my purpose that these will
be run, with due regard to public requirements, on a business basis tlat will render
these facilities, so far as is possible, selfsupporting.
To achieve that end I consider
that it is just as desirable that the management should have as full measure of control
over the harbour staff as, for instance, the
Canadian National Railways have over theirs.
Coipetitive conditions require tiat eiployees
should be competent and alert, and I doubt if
the interests of the public would be served by
iiposing upon their staffs the conditions wIhicli
apply to appointiment in tle Civil Service.
Civil Service appointment does not apply te
the Canadian Farm Loan Board. the Canadian
Wheat Board and tie Research Couneil, net
to mention other branches or positions in the
public service. Wlatever reasons can be given
for exempting these organizations are surely
applicable withi much greater force in the case
of business activities of an organization such
as a harbour board.
In passing this nseasure we are making a
very considerable departure in the adoption of
a systen of central as compared with local
control.
I consider if most important that

JUNE 20, 1936
in the initial stages, while the organization is
adjusting itself to the changed conditions,
there should be no hampering influences and
that the organization should be kept as flexible
as possible; I consider that this end cau be
more readily attained under a system of staff
appointment and control devised with the
special requirements · of port administration
ini mind than under a system of Civil Service
regulations and conditions, and for these reasons, as well as on account of the uncertainty
of the application of the amendment in its
present phraseology, I ask that this amendment
of the Senate be not concurred in.
I will cite now the opinion of the Department of Justice. It is contained in the following memorandum from Mr. Edwards, the
Deputy Minister of Justice:
Re Senate Amendments to Bill No. 17
Section 4 of the Harbour Board Bill deals
with the employment of officers, clerks and
employees. The first four lines of the section
read as follows:
"4. (1) The Board may employ such professional, technical and other officers, clerks
and employees as it may deem necessary for
the proper conduet of its business and fix
their remuneration."
The proviso provides that the preference of
returned soldiers for employment shall be
preserved under this Act. The Senate has
amended this section to read as follows:
This is the most important part of the
amendment.
"(1) The Board may, under the provisions
of the Civil Service Act, employ such professional, technical and other officers, clerks
and employees as it may deem necessary for
the proper conduct of its business and fix
their remuneration: Provided that temporary
employees employed otherwise than upon a
yearly or seasonal basis and labourers may be
employed by the appropriate Port Manager.
"(2) There shall be apnointed by the Board
for each harbour under the jurisdiction of the
Board an officer to be known as the Port
Manager who shall, as agent of the Board.
perform such services as are assigned to him
by the Board."
The only difference between the introductory
part of the section as it originally appeared
in the Bill and the first part of the Senate
amendment is that the words "under the
provisions of the Civil Service Act" have been
inserted between the words , "may" and
"employ" in the first line.
It seems to me that the intention of the
Senate was to provide that the officere and
employees of the Board should be appointed
by the Civil Service Commission. I do not
think that the insertion of the words underlined above has this effect. The Civil Service
Act provides the method or manner of ascertaining the qualifications of candidates for
employment and provides further that the
Civil Service Commission shall make the
appointment. This section, however, says that
the Board may employ and fix remuneration.
The employment and the fixing of remuneration are the main function of the Civil Service
Commission under the provisions of the Civil
Service Act.
It

is

submitted,

therefore,

that

all

the

present section. as amended by the Senate,
mreans is that in employing and in fixing the

605

remuneration of employees the Board shall be
guided by the provisions of the Civil Service
Act with regard to the ascertainment of the
qualifications of candidates for employment.
In other words, that competitive examinations
shall be held to establish lists of persons for
appointment; that such examinations shall be
open to all persons who may be lawfully
appointed to positions in the Civil Service
and that such persons shall be preferred as
to appointment in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Act; that such
persons who are ex-members of the military
or naval forces shall be entitled to the privilege
conferred by section 29 of the Civil Service
Act, and that all the provisions of Part III
of the Act shall be observed by the Board in
making appointments to positions.
In this connection it is submitted that the
age limit of thirty-five, set by the Civil Service Commission by regulation under the provisions of section 22 of the Civil Service Act,
will apply to all the appointees of the Board.
I understand that it is the intention of the
Minister of Marine to provide that the present
employees of harbour commissions shall, in so
far as possible. be absorbed into the new
organization.
I cannot find any provision
under the Civil Service Act which will enable
the Board to employ persons at present
employed by the various harbour commissions.
but who are over the age limit set by the
Civil Service Commission under the section
above referred to. I understand that Mr.
Bland stated to the Senate committee that
there will be no difficulty in this regard, but
it seems to me that he is under a misapprehension as to this. Upon the proclamation
of this Act the present corporations become
non-existent and the employees thereof will be
out of employment. as their positions will be
abolished with the abolition of the bodies
emploving them. This is not a case of an
established department of the Government
being re-organized by the Commission under
the provisions of Part II of the Civil Service
Act. This is a new organization being set
up. which will have an entirely new list of
employees. If, therefore. it is the intention
to apply all the provisions of the Civil Service
Act. it seems to me that some snecial provision
should be made for the employees presently
employed by the present harbour commissions.
For example, it is submitted. the sections
dealing with age and examination should not
apply.
There is also the question of the positions
exempted from the operation of the Civil
Service Act. such as skilled and unskilled
labourers.
The proviso to the section. as
amended
in the
Senate.
provides
that
temnorary emoloyees and labourers mav be
employed by the port manager. It might be
that temporary employment of a legal officer
or of an engineer or of any other nrofessional
man may be dealt with under this proviso.
Surely in the appointment or employment of
a legal agent or of an engineer or professional
person. the Board should be responsible and
not the port manager. For example, a consulting eniineer might be required. and it is
submitted. the best man to select an employee
of this kind would be the Chief Engineer of
the Harbours Board or, ït lenat. he
i'nlrl
recommend the candidate for employment to
the Board.

our faces. I arn prepared to meet the leader
of the Goverrnent and see that our amendment is put into a forrn that will nlot be
subject to practical objections, -that is, so
long as it continues to state the principle
that we want it to state. That principie is
that these positions shall be under the Civil
Service Commission, not under patronage. To
intimate that present ernployees cannot be
retained if this principle is adhered to is utter
nonsense.
If the principle was considered
impracticable our attention sbould have been
drawn to that f.act by the Minister or sorne
other representative of the Governrnent when
we were in cornmittee. But I say it is not
impracticable. and I arn prepared to stay
here until we cani get what we want done.
I do no! intend to, be cornered, stamnpeded,
nor browbeaten into letting this thing through
at the end of the session.
The Minister does flot want to open tenders
in public. As Mr. Howe he wants to run
everytbing. Apparently hie bas corne upon
the scene like an absolute potentate,' determined that things shall be done according to
bis own sweet will. But as a member of the
Goverrnent he is in the Public Service now,
and be mnust abide by those principles that
bave corne down througb the years. Like
every other Minister of the Crown, hie must
abide by tbe constitutional practice of this
country.
I have nu objection at aIl to abandoning
the las! arnudment. It is a permissive clause
anyway, and means very little. But the
fact that we have not as yet by generai legislation insisted upon the openinýg of tenders in
public is no reason wby we should not make a
start. Indeed, a start bas already been made.
Undeir tbe late Administration, tenders to the
Departrnent of Public Warks, the department
at wbicb mo;st tenders are received, were
opened in public. Here is a new eýstablishment of a gigantic character, wbich will be
lettinig tenders, and big tenders, in every part
of Canada. It will outrank tbe Department
of Publie Works in the letting of tenders.
Now is the tiýme to initiate in this new and
buge establisbhment the principle, of opening
tenders in public. Wbat is the reason given
against this prineiple? The Minister says that
other ministers can open tenders in secret.
It is true tbey can, but tbey sbould not be
allowed to do so, and neyer should have been
allowed.
I arn disappointed that the Mînister bas
objected to thiýs provision, whicb I understood
hie was prepared to accept. Apparently he bas
changed bis mind. 1 shaîl bave more to say
on the rnatter tbis afternoon, when I shall
move an amendment to the motion. But in

the course whicb I think should be taken,, I
will restate it briefiy. Our amendment should

ment?

What arnend-

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendment with refeq-ence to the Civil Service Commission. It sbould be sxbritted, to the Departrnent of Justice and put into the proper
form to carry out our intent. If it is necessary to provide-and I sbould not think it
was--tbat the prescrnt staff be blanketed in,
that will bave to be done. Nobody wants tbe
present staff disrnissed at ail; dismissals bave
been carried far enougb already. All we want
is tbat classification, supervision of tbe service,
the rnaking of appointm*ents after dismissals,
and so on, be placed in the bands of the Civil
Service Commission. We certainly do not
desire that men be disni.ssed because they are
over tbirty-five. Tbat is ridiculous, and nobody ever thought of such a tbing. We should
like to sec no one disrnissed except for incompetence, and cases of that kind wîll be left
to the Minister. But wben a dismaissal does
take place we do flot want tbe filling of tbe
position left to the patronage comrnittee
of Montreal, wbicb the honourable leader
knows is in existence and operationHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
know that.

No, I do nlot

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: J! is there.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The honourable senator knows of the one bere in Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Right, Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Well, I do.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If rny rigbt bionourable friend were addressing the House of
Commons, perbaps tbis would be more appropriate.
Ri.-bt Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: We desire.
in respect of this great new public service,
tbat the Civil Service 'Commission shaîl exercise the fonctions it was created to exercise,
just as it does with every other branch of
the Civil Service. If the commission is to be
a mere shell. let it be abolisbed.

Hon. Mr. DANTDURAND: I desire to say
a few words in an attempt to appease my
rigbt, bonourable friend. I repeat the stand
I bave often taken-the las! tirne, I think, as
recently as yesterday-that it is the duty of
the Senate to take ail tbe time it requires
to consider measures that are before i!. If
necessary, we shahl corne back next week.

SENATE

608

I believe we shall be sitting on .Monday
in any event. I stated, in the absence of
my right honourable friend, that we expected
to sit on Tuesday, the King's Birthday. and
Wednesday, St. Jean Baptiste day, which is a
legal holiday in the province of Quebec. So
that my right honourable friend may have
no misgivings. I will state my hope that the
Senate may always function regularly and to
his satisfaction.
I intended
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN:
to say. while on my feet, that we should save
time if we adjourned until 4 o'clock instead
of 3 o'clock. The extra hour will enable us
to be better prepared when the discussion is
resumed. I intend to be brief, though I know
we shall have to sit next week.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Broadcasting Bill has been re'ferr.ed to the Banking and
Commerce Committec. Could that be dealt
with this evening?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Broadcasting Bill will need only technical revision.
I sec no objection to its .being taken up by
the Banking Committee at, say, 2.30 this afteriioon. I shall net needi to be there, because it
contains no principle to which I am opposed.
I simply want
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to say a word as to the reasons why the
Government, represented by my humble self,
did net raise any special objection to the
form of our amendments at the time they
were being made in the Banking and Commerce Comnittee. I objected to the principal
amendment, that concerning the Civil Service
Commission, and. if my memory serves me
rightly. we divided on this matter. Before
the Bill was sent from this Chamber to the
other House, the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) expressed the
sane opinion that the Department of Justice
bas now expressed, that the amendment would
cause the dismissal of the present employees
at the harbours.
May I draw this te my right honourable

over during the adjournment? It will be
recalled that when the Department of Mines
and Resources Bill was before us it was
explained that the Minister desired to have
in his own hands the primary organization
of the new department before placing it under

The Minister contends that if our amendmonts prevailed, men who have been on the

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The harbour
commissioners have a free hand now.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: They have. So
I think the question narrows clown to whether
the Civil Service Commission should be

NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
MESSAGE FROM HOUSE 0F COMMONSREFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed the adi ourned debate
on the message from the bouse of Commons
respecting the amendments made by the
Senate to Bill 17, an Act respecting the
National Ha.rbours Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that we
do not inast on our amendments.
1274&-39

W

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Honourable
members, there has been some discussion of
these representations from the House of Commons with respect to our amendments, and I
do not intend to traverse the question at any
length now.
A study of the first amendment confirma
me in my opinion that the only proper course
to take is to have appointments in connection
with this branch of the Public Service under
the Civil Service Commission. I arn not yet
convinced that it cannot be done. It bas
been urged upon me, I fear with some force,
that we do not accomplish as much by our
amendment as was intended. Apparently the
Government bas dismissed ail the harbour
commissions. Up to the present the harbour
commission for each port employed its own
staff, which was retained with fair consistency
by sureeeding commissions for the same port.
The Government bas now appointed two of
its officiais as commissioners for each of the
harbours under federal supervision. The effect
of this is that each ha.rbour now bas a commission, but the same men are commissioners
of ail the harbours directly under the Minister
and are able to do, with respect to administration, ail that the old commissions could do
singly or in the aggregate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
ity is that?

By what author-

Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGH]3N: I do not
know of any authority for it. The bonourable
meinher behind me forgets that authority of
statute or iaw is net necessary, as this bas
been donc by a group of men who got into
power by denouncing autecracy.
Hon. Mr.
Liberais.

DANDURAND:

They

are

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Consequently, whatever we -may do with respect to
this amendment can, ito a great degree at ail
events, be circumvented if they take no0 action
or make no attemýpt to put the new laýw
into, effect until what they desire bas been
accomplished: The information I get from.
Quebec is that this method bas mostly been
followed.
Apparently we are confronted with a continuous delimitation and restriction, except
for salaries, of the Civil Service Commission,
the evident intention being that whiie this
commission may enjoy its rexnuneratjon it
shail be denuded, step by step, of its authority.
I suppose the commission will be able to say,

ieading a civil war and was being urged to
make peace with the King on condition that
he and bis officers should be given comfortable

posts of idleness in the service: "And we shall
feed like oxen at a stail, the better cherish'd,
stili the nearer death."
My own opinion now is, as respects this
clause and the others which I have stated
we feel like insisting on, that perhaps we
could get the most out of them by consideration in committee. I do net want to
delay the Flouse at ail. On the contrary, I
tbink we shouid probably reach an agreement
more expeditiously if we referred the message
to the same committee. The Minister should
be there if required, se we could hear what
it is possible to say with regard te the effect
of the arnendments made. I would not ask
this if 1 did nlot think they were very important. I think we .9hould adopt the course
of affording all the safeguards possible, and
I believe this could be donc better and more
quiukly in committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: As I spoke at
considerable iength on the second reading of
this Bill, I shaki delay this honourable Bouse
f or only a f ew moments. Permit me te say
at the outset, that I arn very much disappointed, indeed, at the attitude the Minister bas taken in regard te the very sensible
arnendments wvhich this Bouse bas made te the
I think honourilarbours Board Bill.
chibe meinbers wili believe me when I say
that I have net in mimd any political idea,
ner had I any when I suggested the amendments on the second reading oDIthe Bill. I
wvas .prompted by the fact that during my
six years' experience as commissioner of the
port of Montreal five under the Hon. Mr.
Brodeur and one under the Hon. Mr. Hazenwe were entirely free from polities. As te
the efflciency and economy of the management of tihe port during that period I arn
quite willing te take the judgment of the
Shipping Federation and the Board of Trade.

any man in this Bouse or outside of it te

Here we have before us agaÂn tihis rnost
important Bill deading with aur national barbours--our experts and our imports. It wouid
be a matter of great regret te me te sc
those ports bedevilled with polities. As 1

manager the appointment cf tihe labourers
Who corne and go; and I would strongly
favour the ope'ning of tenders in public. I
woulýd advocat-e that for my own preservation,
my own peace of mind.
Let me visuailize once more the position the
port managers are going to be in. Most of
their tirne will be taken up by people seeking
positions. W'hat a fine thing it would be for
a port manager to be able te say to those
people: "I deal only 'with the labouring men,
the seasonal eniployees; the permanent staff
i.s under the Civil Service CoYmmission." The
same answer could 'be made by the central
board, 'and aiso, by the Minister. When I was
considering- and offering these amenclments
rny one and only purpose was to ease the
terrifie pressure that would be brought te
bear, to an even greater degree b-ecause of
the deipression, by the people to whom I
have just referred. The present Minister apparently hokbs a contrary view.
I regret to say that information which has
already reached me is very disturbing. While
the permanent staffs remain-they have to,
remain for some time at l.east, because these
great ports could nlot be operated by any but
expert men who have been there for a great
nuniber of years--the seasonal staffs have
been completely wi.ped, out. The honourable
senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) told.
this 1{ouse a few days ago that in his city,
Quebec, there bs a patronage committee and
the dismissai of port employeea is now in the
hands. nlot of the port management, the board,
or the Minister, but of that patronage comimittee.. A simiLar condition wiii prevail in the
port of Montreal and! ail ýthe other ports if the
Minister and the Government of the day are

committee in each of those ports. There is a

to impress upon this House, the Minister and

which party has been in power, Conservative
or Liberai, and new apparently the intention
is to carry it on whoiesale from one end of
the country to the other. I dmeely regret this-

JUNE 20, 1936
I think that, as my right honourable leader
suggests, we sbeuld have this matter referred
back to the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. I was flot impressed
with the long statement read by the honourable leader at this morning~s sitting te the
effeet that when the Act came into operation
the board would have no employees at ail.
Any legal man could drs.w up a document of
that kind. It does not give us any information. It was not necessary for the Minister
to get such an opinion from the Justice
Department. for even to have the document
typewritten for presentation to this House,
for we ail were perfe.ctly weli aware of what
is therein set out. The difficuity in connec.tion with the employees, other than those on
a permanent basis--and I suppose there are
not altogether more than 150 je that class-could be overcome by inserting in the Bill a
clause that the Act shall fot be proclaimed
until sucli time as the Civil Service Commission, under Mr. Bland, bas classified the
service. Se. all the objections mentioned je
the honourable leader's statement are flot impressive at ail.
Now I ture to another matter. Having
livcd quite a f ew years and belonged. to
both parties, I think I know how the political
machine operates, both inside and outside. I
,certainly sbould feel keenly disappointed if
any Minister of Public Works, in cither a
Conservative or a Liberal Government, wcre
to adopt the practice of letting contracts
secretly, witbin the confines cf bis own office.
The cootracts that are let run into billions
of dollars a yearHon. Mr. KING: That is not done, is it?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 0f course it
is done. But during tbe five years tbat Mr.
Stewart, the late Minister of Public Works,
was in office, the practice was to announce
that tenders for such-and-sucb a contract
would be opened on a certain day at 12 noon.
At the appointed time the Deputy Minister,
Mr. Hunter, in the presence of the contractors
wbo had tendered, would open the tenders
and cal! themn out, the contract being awarded
to the iowest bidder, provided lie was able
to carry it out.
Hon. Mr. RING: I shouid like my hnurable friend to answer this important question.
Was tbere not a selected list of contractors?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Not at ail.
Hon. Mr. KING- We shall see.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to go into details on the floor of tbe Chamber,
but I can assure my honourable friend that

if he wiil go down and ask Mr. Hunter, for a
statement of the people to whom contrace
were awarded, hie wiil be amazed to see how
many of the contractors, were Liberals.
Hon. Mr. RING: But a number of contractors were not on the iist.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that what my
honourable friend from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) says is correct. Anyone wbo desired
to do so couid procure s. copy of the plans
and specifications for any proposed work and
put in bis tender. It made no difference
whether the tenderer was a Liberal or a Conservative. I know tbat is wbat happened in
Manitoba. Deer Lodge bospital was. built

Hon. Mr. HIAIG: No, you were not. Tbe
contract was let in 1933.
Hon. Mr. RING:- That was for an addition.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable leader will not dlaim that Mr. Janin
belongs to the Conservative party?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: You neyer can tel!
to what party a contractor belongs.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The contract
for the Customs building in Montreal was
given to Janin & Company. Surely we have
reacbed the point where ministers and goverements in this country should rise above
petty patronage in connection with the management of such large national undertakings.
as our barbours. Why should not tenders
be opened, publicly and the contract awarded
to the lowest bidder?
If the Government wants to take the
responsibility of running these harbours
strictiy from a patronage point of view and
by three men here at Ottawa, I can only
say that I am sorry for tbe Dominion of
Canada. In my opinion our export and import
trade will suifer and it wiil not be long before
the system will bave to be changed.
It certainly would have been better hiad
the Government decîded to implement another
of the proposais of Sir Alexander Oibb
instead of this cee. He did not make concrete recommendations, but hie made 8ug,
gestions. It would bave been better te adopt
his suggestion that the harbours should be
continued under the control of local boards,
which, however, sbould not bave the power
to incur any capital expenditure witbout. the
approvaI of the central board. Under that
plan the harbours would be kept under local

BANK 0OF CANADA

BILL

T11IRD TIEADING

Bon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the thjrd
reading af Bill 82, an Act ta amenci the Bank
of Canada Act.
Right Bon. ARTHUR MEIGBEN: Bonourable members, I bave given as much
study as time ,permitted ta this long prognastioated mcasure. Iýf in these strenilaus bours
at the close of 'the session a very tired. man
can .completely succumb ta a sense of -humour,
I am under tbe impression that I bave done
so in consequence -of ail tbat lias takeu place
with respect ta thîs Bank af Canada.
Two years ago Parliament passed the legislation estahlJishing 'tbe Bank of Canada. It
was ta be privately owned; that is, the paublie
were to, be invited ta subscribe the capital,
$5,00O,000. The bank was te be managed. by
a board of directors elected by the owners
of that capital stock. There were ta be appainted by the Governor in Council a Governar and a De.puty Covernor. The Bill provided further-I have the quotations before

JUNE 20, 1936
me if any honourable member desires tiheim
-that there ahould be an executive committee
of the board compesd of the Governer, the
Deputy Governor and one director to be
chosen 'by the directoirs, and that it should
have all the powers of the 'board-not part
but all-and should be the committee of
managiement, and should report its decisions to
the board. I ask honourable members particulaly to note tihat the executive committee
merely reported its decisions to the board,
and its executive acts the board had no power
to disa4pprove.
The by-laws of the bank were to be prepared and issued by the Governor in Council
-the Government of Canada. The by-laws
covered everything of any import at ail in
connection with the bank and its management and the transference of its shares. The
by-laws could be amended or altered by the
Goverror in Council. The board could flot
amend or alter by-laws, but could suggest or
submit amendments, which Council alone could
make effective. The Governor in Council
could alter by-laws without any representations from the board whacever.
The Act contained this further clause, that
no one should hold more than fiE ty shares
of, I think, $50 each, and that at an annual
meeting no one except the Minister of Finance
could vote more than fifty shares. Therefore no one but the Minister of Finance could
colleet proxies, and hie alone was in a position
to vote the stock at the annual meeting. Al
the annual meeting could do would be to
elect these directors with the status--for I will
not say powers--that they really had under
the Act.
It was provided furthefr that no action of
the directors on any subject should have any
effeet unless concurred in by the Governor
of the bank or, in bis absence, by the Deputy
Governor. Honourable members will be wondering now, and did no doubt wonder at
the lime, what effective control that board
of directors had. 'My answer is, it had
none at ail. It just represented a public
interest in the ownership of the bank, but
the incidence of ownership, the authority that
normally grows out of ownership, was shorn
fromn it and kept in the hands of the Governor
in Counicil and its appointees.
The Governor of the bank, appointed by
the Governor in Council, was to hoid office
for ten years, but on good behaviour at the
pleasure of the Governor in Council. The
Deputy Governor was appointed in the samne
nianner and under the saine conditions.
1 do not think anyone will seriously suggest there was anything in the way of control that was flot entirely in the hands of

the Governor in Council, representing the
people of Canada. The money was procured,
and the public interest was, as it were, collected and focused on the institution, by the
plan of having amail stock holdings in the
hands of a great many people~ scattered ail
over our country.
It wau further provided that the virtual
ownership was in the Crown, in the State
of Canada. Though the money was subscri'bed outside, the stockholders were entitled
to only 44 per cent, and ail money earned
over that was the property of the State. On
any discontinuance or liquidation-though
such a thing could hardly be thought ofail they got back was the money they bail
investeil.
This seemed to be pretty sa.tîsfactory f rom
the' standpoint of the most ardent exponents
of Government control of the bank. I do
net know what more in the way of practical
value could even be dreamt of by any individual. It did not, oE course, sa.tisfy a
certain class in our country, who think that
if yeu just run a banking system on sufficiently generous principles everybody will be
in possession of ail the currency hie needs,
and that nothing 'but a sinister money power
withholds that plenitude of currency fromn
everybody. The cry went forth, in language
that is se familiar, that this institution had
te be nationalized-had te be the property
of, and te be managed for, the people cf
Canada, free froni the money power, and
particularly that there should be expansion
cf currency in ternis of the public need. 1
notice many honourable members smiling at
those words, that currency should be issued
in terms of the puablie need. Those words
were used by the present Prime Minister and
by one of the niost active members of the
other flouse, then looked upon by niany, and
certainlv by himseîf, as an eminent authority
on matters cf finance and currency-the
present member for Vancouver.
Thus the public wcre excited on this question of a central bank; thus many o! theni
were led to believe t'hat money power had
triurnphed under the late Government and
had dictated the ternis of the measure of
which this House approved, I think, unanimously, just two years ago. Thus they beiieved that if only men of other principles,
men dominated by love cf the people and
not by -affiliation with the money power,
could get into centrol, currency would be
issued "in ternis of the public need"'; which,
of course, was interpreted by the niember te
whom I have referred, and by many another
man now eiected te the flouse of Commons,
as meaning that everybody who feit great

need of currency would get just the amount
of currency for which he longed. That class
of votes was appealed to in the campaign.
If was pretty numerous. It embraces many
wel-i-meaning people, for there are vast numbers who cannot be expected te have a very
practical grasp cf the real purpose, function
and destiny of currency and ail the difficuities
under which the financiai system of a single
country, one cf a family cf nations, must
be carried on.
And s0 we were told we were te have a
revision in order thiat those great public needs
might be attained. We were te, have a revision this session that would make this new
central bank the real property cf the State,
that would restere centrol te the Government
of the nation fer the people cf the nation,
with full mandate te issue currency in terms
of the need of the people. That is te say,
the more the need the greater the currency,
and the currency wouid flow where it was
needed-not remain merely in the hands of
those who were its rightfui possessors.
WelI, here we have this Bill. I will give
the Hotise the particulars in which the measure
changes the iaw. First cf ail, it provides that
the Government of Canada shahl subscribe
for another issue cf $5,100,000 of the capital
stock at the price paid by the public. That
is $100,000 more than the total capital stock
new heid by the public, and therefere, according to the pretext of the advocates cf the
mensure, gives the Government something
in the nature cf more autherify, derived from
more ownership. This further subseriptien is
net huilt lipon the theery that any more
money is needed for the capital cf the bank.
Even the Minister who introduced the Bill
did net ,uggest that more capital was needed.
The bank has ail the capital if can make use

such working capital as if desired. With the

financial existence without ifs requiring much
in the way of capital. Se the capital, se far
as if lies in the vaults cf the hank, is
redundant.
At this point may I intreduce a little

of themn for these years. The oniy ans5wer we
got in asking for an explanation was,
"$6,000,000." The Government had f0 have
$6,000,000. Ail that meney, or nearly ail, is
now shifted here. Those taxes were coliected
in order to put $5,100,000 into this central
bank, which has no need of it. That is one
way of stating the case, honourable members.
But the truc explanation is this: it is donc
in order to enable the Administration to find
a way eut-to make a pretence f0 the people
of Canada of executing a promise that meant
something, and to pay for its ewn vindication
out of the treasury. Affer the money is in
the bank, and after the Gov-ernment has
ciccted the majority of directors, the people
have not one atom more of control over that
bank than they had last year, or when the
Act was passed; not the shade of a shadow
of an atom. The control is the .same as before.

Covcrnor and the Deputy Governor both
appointed, by the Governor in Council-and
one director. If the officiais appointed by
the Governer in Council did flot de what he
desired them to do he could diseharge them.
The Geverner in Council, of course, weuld
be thoroughly .lustified in dismissing themn,
because the whoie spirit of the iaw was
that the policy and administration cf the bank
should be centred in and derived from the
Appointees cf the
Gevernor in Council.

te be named by the Government, the resolutions cf the board are going te be reselutiens faveurable te the Government, and

the board named by the Gevernment, or

could do before; it eau fire that man. This
measure is just one more assertion of supremacy; under it there is flot a whit, or shadow,
flot the remotest essence, -of additional power
given to the Governor in Council.
I suppose nobody can take objection to the
Bill. Certainly there would- be noa sanse in
defeating it. Money lias been coliected from
the hard-ridden taxpayers merely ta make
a pile of redundancy in the treasury of the
new bank. There is ail the control aver
the hank that any man could desire. It is
the same as before, and the principie of
organization is flot changed one iota. I canflot see, therefore, why those who agree with
the principla of 100 per cent contrai in one
form should have any very sariaus objection
ta the principle of 100 per cent contrai in
another.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 96, an Act te amend the
Criminal Code.
Ho said: Honourable senators, the flrst
clause of this Bill repoals section 98 of the
Criminal Code. A mneasure for the repeal of
this section bias heen passed by the House of
Commons on a number of occasions and
rejected by the Sonate, lIn the last olection
campaign. the section was attaýcked from
various angles, and its repoal was one of the
planks of the Liberal party.
From a memorandum that I have bore I will
attempt te give a briof history cf tho section.
During the War, in Canada as well
as in other countries engaged in tho struggle,
tb.ero wcre, undor War Measures Acts here
and clzcwherr, special rulos. special regulations
and special orders which were iii themsolves
rnfringements of the liberty of the citizen.
In times of war such moasurc-i have te hc
resorted te. But it inust ho donc in such a
way as te safeguard the liberties and the rights
cf private citizens. At all events. after the
War wvas over. thuse enactmcnts disappearcd
from the administration cf other countries,
but they were rcplaced in Canada in 1919 hy
section 98 of the Criminal Code. Honourable
membors will recaîl an agitation in Britain
about that famous war-time Act callod DoraDefence of the Realm Act-which was flnally
repealed. Tho same thing happened ovorywhere. I call attention te some of the previsiens of Order in Council P.C. 2384 of the
Dominion cf Canada, enacted under tho War
Measures; Act. In this Order in Council, dated
Septembor 25, 1918, the provisions of section
98 are recitcd almost word for word, but
always with thýs qualification at the end of
evcrv seccýon cf the order, "while Canada is
engagcd ini war.' You find that in section (b)
of t.he Order in Council, wliich spoaks cf
t'ie purpose cf
associations ci, orpn'zaLioe,
whiclh is te bring about any govornmental,
l'O it:cal, inclu-trial or econoinic changea inost identical with the phraseology cf
section 98, but witb these additional words:
"1while Canada is engaged in war."
In 1919, after the War, and after the troubles
that cccurred in Winnipeg, the Government cf
the day appointed a parliamentary committee
to consider amendmonts te the Criminal Code,
and that parliarnentary cemmittee brought
in the report upon which. section 98 was based.
Since thon continuons attompts bave been
made for the ropeal cf this section.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: By whom

have

Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Organized labour
in Canada. The Trades and Labour Congress
of Canada at every annual meeting bas passed
a -resolution asking fuor the repeal of this section. No one was more .persevering in that
demand or more eloquent in presenting it
ýthýan Mr. Tom Moore, who was then president
of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada.
Mr. Moore bas, 1 believe, the confidence of
everybody in. Canada.
What axe the reasons for the repeal of
,section 98? First, we bolieve it is dangerous
to perpetuate in peace-time enactments which
are war-time measures and design-ed to meet
special emergencios due te some extent te
the natural panic which exists in time of
war. The danger is mainly because of the
precedent which is created. If we can put
aside the erdinary rules of iaw on a matter
of this kind. why net put them aside on other
matters as well? And this crcates a precedent
that might be harmful under other circumstances. There are things in this section which
arc net susceptible of defence. To say that
the police may authorize any private citizen
te search my home, or the home of anyone in
Canadai, on the more, Fspicion that thcy may
find lit ,r.-îture whîch is objectionable, is contrary te ail principesi of law the world over. I
think everyone will agroe that the separatien
of pewers is a neccs.sary guarantee in the administration of justicc. It i5 not right that the
police, who are entrusted- with the duty of
carrying into exocution the orders of the court,
should becoec the court it.self. The police are
clothe-d with somne judicial powors when they
are permitted te authorize any private citizen
te search premises fer the purpose of flnding
literature. This cannet ho defendod.
This bas givon risc te many incidents which
ccrtain-ly cannet be considered as fair. In
Western Canada diîring tho War, under the
provisions of a sirnilar Order in Council, people
of foreign l-anguago saw their bibles confscated becauso thoy wcra printed in a
language which the polica, ceuld net understand. A man was arrostod bocause ho had in
his possess~ion a copy ef Plato's Rcpublic.

JU7NE 20, 1936
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND - -a
mani was
arrested because hie had in his possession some
literature that happened ta have been written
by Thomas Jefferson, who was one of the
authors of the Declaration orf Independence
and later President of the United States.
When the mani told that to the officer who
arrested him the officer replied, "Well, we
will take care of yýOU now and we will get that
man Jefferson afterwarde.")
May I refer also to the presumption of guilt
which appears here. A mani is seen st a meeting of one of these so-called illegal associations,
and hie is presumed guilty. If hie does nlot
prove that hie is flot guilty hie is liable to be
sentenced to gaol for twenty yea.rs. It is
prohibited, under possible penalty of twenity
years, to import any book in which. there may
he something which defends revolution. Some
people were afraid that the reading of a
book in which the War of Independence
bet-ween England and the United States was
justified would render them liable to jxmprisonment for twen.ty years under this section.
Even under the war Order in Council the
maximum penalty was five years, but because
of 'that panec in 1919 a mari who merely had
a book in lis .possession xnight be sent to gaol
for twenty years.
We have in the Criminai Code, which is
based on the common law of England, al
the provisions which make Enghish law and
British justice sufficient to meet ai emergencies. The common law relating to sedition
is already in our Criminal Code and always
has been. Section 133 says.
133. Seditious words are words expressive
of a seditious intention.
2. A seditious libel je a libel expressive of
a seditious intention.
3. A seditious conspiracy is an agreement
bctween two or more persons to carry into
execution a seditious intention.
Then section 134 states:
Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to imprisonment for a termi of flot
more than twenty yearsThat is the saine as in England.
-who speaks any seditious words or publishes any seditious libel or is a party to any
seditious conspiraey.
This crime orf sedition has been discussed
in Great Britain on many, many occasions,
In Halsbury's Laws of England, second cdition, volume 9, sedition is defined. at page 302:
Sedition is a misdemeanour at common law
consisting of acts done, words epoken and
published, or writings capable of being a libel
published, in each case with a seditious intention.
Where the words are oral the offence is
called the speaking of seditious words; where
the words are written, the offence is called

the publication of seditious libel; where two or
mnore combine for the furtherance of a seditious
intention the offence is called seditious
conspiracy.
At page 303:
Every person is gui]ty of thre common law
misdemeanour of speaking seditions words-And this applies to us.
-who apeaks and publishes words with a
seditious intention.
Every person is guilty of the common law
misdeameanour of seditious libel who publshes matter containing anything capable
of being a libel, with a seditious intention.
There the punishment is fixed at a terni not
exceeding two years. What I find in those
decisions is rather that in Great Britain there
hms to be sometbing constituting en overt act,
flot .merely an opinion whichi people might
hold. It is not until it is transformed in-te
an overt act which might be dangerous to
the peace of the State that it becomes an
offence. The principie in that regard cannot
be ibetter eirpressed than, in the words of
Thomas Erskine in his celebrated speech on
tire trial orf Thomas Pairie. He said:
His opinions were adverse to our systembut I maintain that opinion is free, and that
conduct alone is amenable to the iaw.
May I a1so quote what Macaulay said ini
his essay on Hailam?
To punish a man because he has committed
a crime, or because hie is believed, though
iînjustly. to have committed a crime. is not
persecution. To punish a man because we
infer f rom the nature of some doctrine which
hie holds, or f rom the conduet of other persons
who hold the samne doctrines with him, that
hle wili commit a crime, is persecution, and is,
ini every case, foolish and wicked.
The Bill adds a few words to section 133.
They may not be necessary, but the reason for
adding- themn is to make it clearer that nobody
cari by words or writing preach the use of
force to bring about governmential changes.
In somne of the judgments the courts seem to
have required that it must be proved that
the words or the teachings were strong enough
to lead to disturbance, disorder and trouble.
This is nrerely to make it absolutely clear
that nobody should be aliowed to teaeh the
use of force to bring about change of government in Canuda.
Ras section 98 prevented any persan from
being a Communist? A mari named Tîm Buck
was sent to gaol because cd a breach cdfsection 98. The Goverrnnent which enacted the
legisiation was responsible foir his releaae
after hle had served only haîf his terni. The
first thing hie did upon release was to hold
meetings in Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa.
What good did that do? As a matter of faet
hie ran for Farliament. Did section 98 pre-

vent Communist candidates fromn appearing against other candidates in the last elecLion? If the section is useless, why keep it?
May I also cail attention to this point?
Why should there be talk only of Communists
The
whien it cornes to this question?
Fascists, the Nazis in Ge.rmany, are just as
violent conoerning change of government
as are the Communists. I think we have in
the Criminal Code, under the sedition sections,
quite enough te meet the Fascists and the
Nazis as welI as the Communists.
For these brief reasons I believe we bad
better returfi to our Criminal Code, which
affords us all necessary protection against
those who may wish to resort to force in
one form or another.
H-on. Mr. GORDON: Is there anything
un record tu show that persons other than
seditionists or Communists have suffered' under
section 98?

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN: I find
no fault witb the discretion exercised hy the
honeurable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) in reading a memorandum
from the honourable Minister of Justice instead of venturing, te express bis own views
and giving bis own reasons therefor. I feel
confident that in bis heart he bas ne sympathy at alI with the terms of tbe memorandum, and I put it on record at the opening
Hon. Mr. DANDCRAXD.

of my remarks that as a member of this
House 1 feel a sense of insuit and resentment that the honourable Minister of Justice
shouki have addi'essed such a memnorandum to
us. No intelligent person could possibly corne
honestly to the opinion that that memorandum is a fair presentation or interpretation
of the intent and effeot of the section to be
repealed.
The memnorandumn states that somebodythe implication is, because of this sectionwas arrested for having a copy of Plato's
Republic. What is the purpose in telling that
to the Senate? A tyro of the second book
would know that under the authority of this
section nobody could be lawfully arrested
because be had that work in bis possession,
or the Bible or any similar work. I do not
believe for a moment that under this section
anybody was ever arrested even ostensibly for
any such so-called offence. If he was arrested
at all it would be in respect of something else,
regarded as serious at the time of the War.
Then the memorandium goes on to tell us
that under this section a man is to be punished for being a Communist. That is just
plainly, openly and violently false-and I hope
No man can be

arre.sted. under -this section because he is a
Communist or bas any particular belief, whatever it may be.
The memorandumn quotes an opinion of
Macaulay's that it is only wben the individual,
having harboured wrong ideas, gives effect
to themn to the detriment of the State that
be ought to be punished. Who within the
four walIls of Parliament or of anything other
than a lunatic asylum would ever entertain
a contrary opinion? This section neyer did,
does flot now, and never could punish anybody for harbouring an opinion, however
foolish, lunatic or dangerous.
One would aI-o think from the memorandum
that this section was devised under the panic
of war, to deal with offences which would
never bc offences in time of peace. I know
the honourable leader of the Government does
flot think so; he neyer did. Does anyone
suggest that in time of peace anyone sbould
be allowed to advocate the use of force to
Is

that, ail wrong in time of war, all right in
time of peace? I know the Minister opposite
does flot. think so. Wbat is more, I know
the Government does flot think so.
The bonourable leader of the Government
tells us that this Bill, as representing the
opinion of the Commons. bas been presented
to us frequently hefore, but we have always
reiected it. I know be did flot intend to
mizlead the House, and if he will reflect a

JUNE 20, 1936
..
minute he wilI realize tbat that is ail wrong.
-This Bill contains a whole gamut of provisions.
I will deal with none except those affecting
, section 98. No sucli Bill as this affecting
section 98 was ever presented here. This
Bill repeals section 98, it is true, but in another
section it restores section 98, or the full effect
cof it, after the repeal. To certain persona,
some of tliem well-intentioned, but principally
to the Communists whose votes it was necessary to secure .by a promise of the repeal of
section 98, the Government by this Bill gives
the repeal with one hand, and from tliem it
takes it back with the other.
I do not think the law will be in as good
forma after this Bill passes as it is now. I do
not niean that afterwards anybody can do
something forbidden under the present law. 1
cannot think of anything he could do then
that lie was forbidden to do before. I do not
say there is no change. There is a change in
respect of seizure, but t'hat is a mere incident
of the section. One would think this was the
only place ini the wliole Criminal Code wliere
drastie power is given with respect to seizure.
There are other sections, dealing with seizure
in gaming and bawdy houses and other places.
But seizure is not essential to the wording
-of this section, and the same seizure rule
miglit as well be adopted here as in respect
to other offences against the Code. In that
respect only is there any essential. difference,
save that uýnder the law as it will he, everything will be forbidden, but forbidden in sucli
à way that people will not so easily understand
the prohibition. In section 98 wliat is forbidden is made definite and clear, so that any
magistrate may know what it means. Under
this Bill it is made general, less easily understood and applied; it is thrown back, in considerable measure, on the common law.
Let me develop the subject a little further.
.,Sction 98 makes it an offence to be a *member of an unlawful association, and an unlà,wful association is one which professes as
its principal teachi.ng the overthbrow of the
governmental or economie or industrial systemn
by force. To be a mernuber of it is deemed
to be an o>ffence. I wonder if the member
is thus being punished for opinions. Is it flot
for expression of opinions to the detriment of
the State? A body is formed, and it professes
:a certain purpose which, it is determined to
effeot, and the core and centre of that purpose is to overthrow the State by force.
Does any h-onoura;ble member suggest that it
is merely the holding of an opinion to, be a
-member of that organization, which has a
definite, active purpose, professed and acceded
to by, all its members? I say that under
this Bill, if it passes, and under the law
as it then will' be, nobody can be a member

619

of sucli an association, for such membe-rahip
is sedition, and sedition at common law is
forbidden. Su there is no change there. The
law said there was a presumption a man was a
member, not if lie attended a publie meeting,
but if lie attended a meeting of the association. If he was not a member it was not very
liard for him to discliarge the onus. Ail lie
had to do was to swear he was not a member.
That is no great hardshipl That presumption
ini similar cases runs through the Code almost
from cover to cover. But to be a member
of such an association will be an offence after
this Bill passes.
So, I aàk honourable, meinbers who have
been seeking tlie repeal of section 98, what is
the real difference? The trouble is, a great
many people have been demnanding the repeal
of this section who did not know its real
effeet. Nothing forbidden under section 98
was Iawful before section 98 was passed.
Tlie section simnply made specific and definite
a certain line of conduct whicli always had
been sedition; but it was put in the f orm
of words, defrnitely described so there would
lie warning to evcrybody that sucli a thing was
sedition.
In this connection, I want to discuss what
sedition is. In the common law of England sedition has not been defined, nor lias
fi'aud, for tihe very dbvious reason that any
definition that the wit of man eould. devise
of eitlier one or the other could be eircumvented by some act whicli, whule it would be
sedition or fraiid, would not be so within
the definition. But sedition lias always been
a crime and ieavily punislied. The courts
have decided on the facts just whlat constituted sedition, and out of those decieions
there lias grown a body of jurisprudence,
whicli is in effect to-day in Engiand, and
indeed in ahl civilized countries, thougli noV
of course the same in ail, that forbids sedition
under aIl circumst.ances -and at ail times.
I arn asked wliy I speak of the common law.
We were, in respect of the criminal law, under
the comm-on law of England until 1892, when
it was displaced to the extent that it was
at variance witli the Crimin-al Code then
evolved and passed and incorporated in the
law of Canada. Sir John Thom.pson, in explaining the provisions of the Code and the
state of the law as it would be after that Code
was established, made it very clear that, subject to the superior authority of the terms
of tlie Code wherever the Code declared
something to be an offence and prescribed the
,punishment, the common law of England still
prevailed. Therefore, unless some act which
under the common law of England would
be lield to be sedition was declared Vo be noV

620

SENATE

within the terms of the Code, that act was
sedition still. On this point I shall quote
from as good an authority as I can find-and
I am sure no one will dispute it-in order that
honourable senators may see just what is
embraced within the very comprehensive term
"sedition," and therefore what is also embraced within the meaning of that term in
the law of Canada, because sedition is not
defined in our Code. I quote from Archbold's
Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 25th
Edition, page 1070:
Sedition, whether by words spoken or
written, or by conduct,-I hope honourable members will get the effect
of those words.
-is a misdemeanour indictable at common law,
It

embraces ail those practices, whether by word,
deed, or writing, which fall short of high
treason, but directly tend or have for their
object to excite discontent or dissatisfaction:
to excite illwill between different classes of the
King's subjects; to create public disturbance,
or to lead to civil war; to bring into hatred
or contempt the sovereign or the government,
and
the laws or constitution of the real.
generally ail endeavours to promote public
disorder.
That is sedition as defined through the long
succession of cases under the law of England,
and that definition applies in this Dominion today. Under section 133 of our Code all, such
sedition-even tlie intent is there defined-is
punishable by imprisonment up to a period of
twenty years. The provisions of section 98 do
not extend the ambit of that definition one
iota. Under that description of sedition, as
deduccd from the common law, scores of
offences are forbidden whieh are not forbidden
by section 98 at ail. Section 98 was nothing
more nor less than a specific outline and description of a certain feature or element of
sedition that always had been sedition. It was
portrayed there so that all would, know that
attention was upon it, and that if sedition
of that character was committed punishment
would follow.
Now, what did the Government do? It
promised to repeal section 98. I do not dispute that such a promise was made, and I know
why it was made. Therefore it bas a mandate.
I do not question that at all. I am not saying
what our duty would be, even under the compulsion of that mandate, if the very citadel of
our country, the home fires of the nation,
were imperilled by the repeal. I do not dispute
the mandate, but I question what we should
do were anything serious to happen by reason
of this repeal. The law is strong and impervious, even with the repeal, and the whole
promise was nothing but a roaring farce,
nothing but a resounding fake.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Now I come to an outline of the law as it
is to be. By section 4 of this Bill it is provided:
Section one hundred and thirty-three of the
said Act is amended by adding thereto as
subseetion four the following:
"(4) Without limiting the generality of the
meaning of the expression "seditious intention"
everyone shall be presumed to have a seditious
intention who publishes, or circulates any
writing, printing or document in which it is
advocated, or who teaches or advocates, the
use, without the authority of law, of force, as
a means of accomplishing any governmental
change within Canada."
Under this provision a new presumption is
raised, a presumption of guiit, if anyone utters
or publishes or circulates anything advocating
the use of force as a means of accomplishing
governmental change. Perhaps it is in the
minds of some honourable gentlemen that this
provision does not go as far as the previous
one. in that the former one forbade the d'oing
of certain things as a means of bringing about
either governmenta! change or economic or
industrial change. But if honourable gentlemen will reflect on the actual facts, and will
put the two sections together, they will sec
that they mean just the same thing. You cannot bring about economic change without
governmental change; you cannot bring about
industrial change without governmental change.
The governmental system must be overthrown
first in order that these other changes may
follow. The words "economic and industrial
change" were in fact just as unnecessary then
as they are to-day. The only important
purpose they served was to indicate to the
people that certain conditions must not ib
overturned by force-that they must not
advocate, or belong to an association whose
active purpose was to advocate, the doing of
these things. As I say, there is only one way
te effect industrial or economie change by
force, and thit is to overturn the Government and our system of government; and the
Government takes particular pains to point
out to ail and sundry that if they advocate
such change they are presumed to be guilty of
the intention of sedition.
The punishment is placed at twenty years,
which is heavy enough, and just what it was
The offence is just where it was
before.
before, and the law is just what it was before.
The only difference, and this is incidental
and unimportant, is in the method of procedure to convict. Still we have all this long
dissertation about the horrors of section 98.
I do not think there is, or ever was, a
good citizen in any part of Canada who, after
studying section 98 in its essence, would have
any objection to it. The denunciation of it

JUNE 20, 1936
and the promise to repeal. were only ineans to
a.n end-an electoral end-and now we are
given this repeal and 13h15 restoration, which
are perhaps as fine a piece of pol-itical comedy
as this oentury has seen.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 shali not
travel over the ground whieh has been covered
iby my right honouirable f riend. I shall
simply ask the members of the Senate to
read section 98 in order to understand how
it -came about that ail the labour organizations in Canada-and 1 could name manyfeIL that their freedom, wau tihreatened.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They abandoned that hallucination.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend admits; that the common law
as embodied in, our Criminal Code contains
aIl the powers of section 98. That is what
the Minister of Justice fiae been eontending
for the last ten years; that section 98 was a
special laîw mnade to meet .special circumstances, and arose out of a thrcat of rebellion
or general strike in Winnipeg, and that it
was time we returned to normalcy. My right
honourable friend, says that ail the power contained in section 98 is in the criminal law, and
will ibe there to-morrow. We are in agreement.
lion. J. T. HAIG: Honourable members, 1
should. like to ask the honourable leader of
the Government, to tel us just why, from
a legal standpoint, section 4 was put into
this Bill? 1 suggest to, him that by reason
of tihe amendmcnt of section 133 of the Code
it will lie as easy as it was bef oie to convict
of seditious conspiracy any person who belongs to -an association. It will lie just as
easy as, if flot easieî than, it was under section 98.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
thîough with section 98.

We are al

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, we are not. Surely
the riglit honourable gentleman <rom Eganville (Itight Hon. Mr. Graham) will allow
me to say a word or two on a subjeet thut
I think I know a littie about.
Right Hon. 'Mr. GRAHAM: I could not
stop you if 1 tried.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do flot think it is fair
for an old parliamentarian to try to prevent
me f rom spea.king, just because I am a greenhorn or a new meinber.
Rigit. Hon. Mi. GRAHÂAM: 1 could not
prevent you from speaking if I tried.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yeu tried. 1 do net
think it is fair that when a new member gets
up to speak on a subject another member
should try Vo sto>p him.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I did not.
Hon. Mi. HAIG. Then I misundersto>d.
the riglit honourable gentleman.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You know an
Irishman 'must speak out once in a while.
Hon. Mi. BALLANTYNE: Go ahead.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Yes. Go
ahead.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The leader of the Government says this section came into being
because of the Winnipeg strike. Those of
us who live in Winnipeg know that the strike
had nothing to do with the War at ah. The
War was ail over; the peace was signed. Let
me tell you what bappened. Because of a
dispute in certain industries ail working persons in Winnipeg went on strike and took
over control. Oui bread wagons and milk
wagons cairied a sign, "Permitted Vo, distribute
by the consent of the Strike Committee."
I ask the leader of the buse wbat he would
say if lie had at home two, thîce, four or more
children, and the only way in which he co;uld
get milk for tbem was to olitain it thice or
four miles -away. There was a revolution,
and the question arose whether under the
crimninal law of that time the Government
authorities had any riglit to prevent the
overthrow of the government of the city of
Winnipeg hy force. Section 98 was passed
to ineet that situation. The prosecution of
Tim Buck, and the Toronto cases, are the
only ones I know of that have cecurred
under the section.
True, certain labour
leaders were affected by it in 1919 and 1920.
Under section 4 of this Bill you make the
law more comprehensîve than it was befoie,
because bere you say intention is presumed
against the accused. I cannot sec wby the
members of the Government suggested, to us
last f sîl that they were going Vo repeal section
98. If that was their intention, wby Vhis
section 4? Why did ýthey not tell the people
it wus going in? I ask the leader of the
Goveînment to tell me anything 'the authoritics could do under section 98 that they will
not lie able to do under this section. My
honourable friend says that all that is contained in section 98 was contained in the
law priur Vo seotion 98 being passed. I will
not enter into an argument on that. Section
98 made it a crime for anyone to be a member of an association whose purpose was the
overthrow of government by force. It wua
under that section that Tim Buck was con-

SENATE
victed. Clause 4 of the Bill, as I have said,
puts the onus on the accused. TJnder this
clause any person accused of seditions intention will have thrown upon hirn the onus of
proving hais innocence. I arn sure that the
people of Manitoba, and of the West in
general, understood that section 98 would be
repealed abso]utely. This Bill repeals it by
one section and, in effect, re-enacts it by
another.

not so much to make the Iaw clearer as to
strengthen it, for the courts have become
loathe to convict an accused person unless he
hais committed a series of overt, acts front
which seditious intention could *be inferred. I
arn quite in sympathy with clause 4.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 should like to
ask my honourable friend if he objects to
that clause 4.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I iinderstand the
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
closed the dehate when he made his repiy.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I du not object to clause 4
at ail, but 1 (Io objeet to the hypocrisy of
repealing section 98 and re-enacting it by
clause 4 of the Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

people in the last campaign advocating the
repeal of section 98. Liberal candidates made
repeal a plank in their platform. May I read
to my honourable friends a statement made
by the Minister of Justice when he moved the
motion for second reading in the other House?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Do not read
it again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is a short
extract:
May 1 say here and niow why I propose to
add a few words to section 133? I do flot
think, they are necessaryHc agrees with my honouraibie friend.
-but it is merely to make it clearer that nobody cý,n by words or writing preach the use of
force to bring about govermnental changes.
I do it hecause in some of the judgments the
courts seern to have required that it must be

strong enough tao iead to distur-banýce, disorder
and trouble. This is rnerely to make it absoiutely clear that nobody should be aliowed to
teach the use of force to bring about change
of governent in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: May I enlighten my
honourable friend the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)? I believe the
Minister of Justice inserted clause 4 because
he knew that without it no honest senator
would vote for the repeal of section 98. That
consideration justifies the vote I shall give.
If it lhad not been for this clause 4, which
amends section 133 of the Code, I should
have voted against the repeal of section 98,
even if I were the only senator to do so.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators,
may I say a few words? I think that the
Minister of Justice inserted clause 4 flot
merely for the purpose of making the law
clearer, but, as he indicated, to, meet the
decisions of the courts. Actually the effect is

I arn very giad to say that I sometimes receive
more generous treatment from the honourable

to every citizen who concerns himself witb

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The establishment of a park does not imply expenditure of
money.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does, to me.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Are these places
for the unemployed to sit in?
Hon. Mr, DANDURAND: The Bill reads
as follows:
1. This Act rnay be cited as The Nova
Seotia and Prince Edward Island National
Parks Act, 1936.
2. The lands described in the schedule to
this Act, the title to which has been vested
in the Crown in the right of Canada, are
hereby set apart as a National Park of
Canada, and the said park shall be subject
to the provisions of The National Parks Act,
chapter thirty-three of the statutes of 1930.
3. The Governor in Council may, by proclamation, add to the said park such lands
in Cape Breton as nay be agreed upon by
the province of Nova Scotia and Canada as
being suitable for an addition to the said
National Park, providing the province furnishes Canada with clear title to the said
lands.
4. The Governor in Council may authorize
the granting of leases to the settlers in the
settlements at Pleasant Bay for their building
sites and improved lands.
Those are the clauses dealing with Nova
Scotia. The explanatory notes are as follows:
2. New areas to be administered and
developed as national parks under the National
Parks Act can be established only by Act of
Parliiament.
3. The clause provides for additions to the
park area that may be desirable after further
examination on the ground. There is a small
area in the northern part of Cape Breton
Island that it is intended to include in the
park as soon as the province lias surveyed the
boundaries of the area and furnished the
This
Dominion with a description of it.
particular area consists of a strip of provincially owned land immediately east of the
county line between Inverness and Victoria
counties and lies approximately west of the
Aspy Bay district. While the size of this
area is not known at the present time, it is
not expected that it will exceed 25 square
miles. Consideration may be given later to
the addition of a small area of approximately
12 square miles in the Bras d'Or Lakes
district.
4. There are some 50 families residing in
the Pleasant Bay district, which area will be
included in the national park. These settlements are well established and of long standing. While the province will acquire title to
the land and convey it to the Dominion, it
is desirable that provision be made so that
the present owners may continue in residence
under leasehold. There is no provision under
the National. Parks Act for the issue of
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

leases for any lands except in regularly
surveyed townsites. Clause 4 authorizes the
Governor in Council to issue leases to these
settlers covering their building sites and
improved lands after such lands become part
of the national park area. An annual rental
will be payable to the Dominion for such
leased properties.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

There are

as yet no national parks in Nova Scotia and
Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It may interest honourable members to know that the
honourable senator frorn Prince (Hon. Mr.
MacArthur) bas offered free of cost a large
tract of land in Prince Edward Island for
use as a public park. I understand that his
offer is now being considered by the Government.
I am in
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
favour of the measure, especially if it is
correct that there is now no national park
in either province. The system appears to
be that the province acquires the title and
provides the land; then the land comes under
the provisions of the National Parks Act in
order that it may be developed as and when
Certainly no
moneys are made available.
province bas more natural advantages frorn
the standpoint of scenery and general attractiveness than the province of Nova Scotia.
I am inclined to think the province of Prince
Edw ard Island is too mïuch a fertile garden
to have those peculiar properties which go
to the making of a national park. However,
it is well that every opportunity be given to
develop a park there, if it can be done.

Hon. Mr. Rinfret can be depended ripon to

arn sure that when he represents Canada at
the next international conference, on copyright he will be well equipped to protect
the rights of Canadian authors and musical
composers and of other authers and musical
composers whose works are sold in this
country.
It seems to me that producers and publishers will have good ground for grievance if
we adopt clause number 1, amcnding section 6 of the Act. It provides that a performance of any musical work by a church,
college or fair may be described as "without
private profit" if the only fees paid are those
paid to individual performers. I have had
s-)me personal experience along this line as
a director of ýwhat we caîl a church chorale,
andl I may have been guilty of infringing the
rights nf producers. 1 think it is generally
agreed that payment of fees should not be

required for the performance
wo.rks at agricultural exhibitions or fairs in
small centres; but in the case ni the important exhibitions at Toronto. Ottawa and other
large contres. it seems ta me, there should
be no exemption from the provisions of the

the proposed legisiation upoin Canadian
authors. -Only a special or a standing committee of this House could go into the matter
thoroughly. This would involve considerable
time, -and we are too near the close of the
session to attempt such an inquiry.
There is, however, this comforting reflection,
that before the end of the year an international conference at Brussels will make a general review of the convention. In preparing
for that conference our representatives will
have to review our copyright legislation to
ascertain whether we have flot given too large
a measure of consideration ta those interested
in this legislation, to the detriment of our own
authors. The principle is that an author is
free to deal with his work as hie pleases. His
freedom is subject to many restrictions, in
that we allow this class and that to use bis
work without fee. It appears to me that
it is for the author to say when hie will
authorize the use by others of bis own intelleetual production. 1 hope that if the Brussels conference concludes its work before
the next session of our Parliament we shall
be able next year to grapple seriously witb
the question.
Hon, C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, at an earlier stage of the session I dealt
with the practice of the other House in
deluging the Senate with important legislation in the hast days of the session, and I
ventured to make a suggestion by which that
condition of affairs could be remedied. This
Bill, to my mind, is an outstanding illustration of what should not bappen. I observe
that on February 27 a private member of the
House of Commons introduced a Bill on
virtually the samne lines as this one. The
Minister on that occasion, or the next
day, intimated tha-t hoe intended to bring
dlown a Government measure on the subjeet.
That is nearhy four months ago. This Bill
is founded entirely on the report of a royal
comm;ssioner. Judge Parker. As I understand
it. there was no nccessity for any further
research, because Judge Parker had made a
complete investigation. In common with the
honourable leader of the House, I want simply
to enter another protest against this practice
by the otlier bouse of dehaying legishation
until the very last days of the session.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: bonourable senators, as chairman of the committee whicb dealt with this Bill, I may be
allowed to say a word. I agree entirely with
the view that not only is this haste towards the
end of a session unseemly, but it becomes
impracticable to give due consideration to belated legishation from the other bouse. I
12745-40J

have spoken along similar lines ever since I
became a member of this House, but my
remarks do not seemn to have had mucb
affect.
This Bill, like the Patent Blill which we
dealt with hast year, is complicated. The
granting of patents throughout the world is
based on international conventions, and it
takes monthe to settle the draft of a bill to
deal with the subject. Honourable members
will recaîl that two years ago the Hon. Mr.
Caban spent many days and nigbts working
out a new Patent Bill. The question of conventions and treaties appears aIl tbrough that
legishation, as it does throughout this Copyright Bill. A proper study of the Copyright
Act, wbich is many-sided, cannot be made
in an hour or in a day. The committee did
the best it could. Some may say its best
was not very good, but that is hecause there
was so littie time to devote to it. I am ini
agreement with the suggestion that a new bill,
if one is to he brought hefore Parliament
another year, ought to be initiated in the
Sonate. It would give us something to work
on, and we should have time to deal with
it properly.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF AND ASSISTANCE BIL
FIRST READING

Amessage was received fromn the House of
Commons with Bill 100, an Act to amend the
Unemployment Relief and Assistance Act,
1936.
The Bill was read the flrst time.
SECOND READING

bon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Hionourable senators, this Bill
amends the Unemployment Relief and Assistance Act of 1936, which was passed by this
House and sanctioned during this session. It
contains but one clause, which I thin-k is selfexplanatory. It proposes to, replace section 4
of the Act by the following:'
The Governor in Council may enter into
agreements with any of the provinces respecting
relief measures therein and providing for any
paymants on accotant of such relief measures
to be made out of moneys appropriated for
relief purposes by Parliament for the fiscal
year 1936-37, and where necessary the Governor
in Council may grant financial assistance to
any province by way of boan, advance or guarantee to an amount not exceed.ing in the aggregate
the maximum amoont which may ha payable
by the province for its shara of the cost of
unemployment relief and undertakings during

the montbs of February and March, nineteen
hundred and thirty-six, and under any agreement between the Dominion and the province
entered into under the authority of this Act
as well as the amnount for which. the province
Thay be obIigated by way of loan in connection
with the cost of any undertaking for which
ecommitments were made under the Relief Act,
1935, and which may be continued under agreemnents entered into under authority of this
Act. The Governor in Council may aleo enter
into agreements with corporations, partnerships,
or individuals engaged in industry respecting
the expansion of industrial employment.
When the Unemployment Relief and Assistance Act, 1936, was drafted, it was proposed
to, obtain from Parliament authority to enable
the Governer in Council to grant, where
necessary, financial assistance to any province
by way of a loan, advance or guarantee of a total
amount not in excess of the total amount payable by the Dominion to such province under
any agreement entered into under authority of
the Act. Assistance on this basis. was thought
suicient to meet the unemployment relief
.rcquirements of any province; consequently
section 4 of the Act so provided. However,
at the expiry date of the Relief Act, 1935, no
arrangements had ibeen made for financing
the relief expenditures of one or two of the
Western Provinces for February and March,
the reason being that applications to the
Dominion for assistance for these months were
flot received in time to *be dealt with under
the authority of the Act. Furthermore, representations have been made that the provinces'
share of relief outlays may in some cases
exceed the total ameunt payable by the
Dominion under the agreement entered into
by authoritv of the Act. It is considered
ncce'ssary, therefore, to establish a new
cri terion.
Under this Bill, which amends only section
4 of the lJnemployment Relief and Assistance
Act, 1936. the Dominion will be empowered
to grant finan)cal asz'dstance to any province,
where nccessary, to the extent of its share of
lexpenditures for relief and relief undertakings
during February and March, 1936. or under
any agreement which may be entered into by
authority of the Unempîcyment Relief and
Assistance Act.
In other words, while the Federal Government bas assumed the larger part of unemployment relief, and bas lef t but a small share25 per cent, I think-te the provinces, certain
provinces are and will be unable to pay that
25 per cent and the federal treasury will be
o1bliged to come to their assistance. 0f course,
many people throughout the land dlaim that
unemployment relief is 100 per cent the
responsibility of the Dominion, înasmuch as
the crisis is a national one. I think it might
be called international.
Whatever opinion
Hon. Mr. DANDtYRAND.

may be held upon this point, we are facing
conditions that we cannot disregard, and the
Federal Parliament is now called upon to,
comne to the assistance of those provinces
which will be unable to meet their ewn share
of the responsibility.
lion. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I have listened with a great deal of
înterest to, the very clear explanation of the
leader of the Government, but it appears to
me that the Government is asking for a blank
cheque-something which it bas strenuously
opposed on other occasions. I understand
froma the honoura:ble the leader that the
Federal Government is prepared te assume
net only its own share of relief, but also that
of the provinces in the -event of their being
unablo to meet it.

to tell us bow much expenditure will be made
tinden tliis provision.
The question
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
asked by my honourable friend was answered
in the course of tbe discussion in. May laut,
when we passed the Act which this Bill amends.
Secion 4 of that Act, wbich is now on the
Statute Book, provides:
The Governor in Council may enter into
agreements with any of the provinces respecting
relief measures therein and providing for any
payments on account cf such relief measures
te be made eut of moneys appropriated for
relief purposes by Parliament for the fiscal
year 1936-37, and where necessary the Governor
in Council may hy way of boan or advance out
of the Conselidated Revenue Fund or by way
of guarantee, grant financial assistance to any

JUNE 22, 1936
province to enable the province to provide for
afiy expenditures for direct relief or other relief
measures up to an amount flot exceeding in the
aggregate the total amount which may be otherwise payable to such province under any agreement entered into under the authority of this
Act.

My honourable friend will note the last
sentence in the section is:
The Governor in Council may also enter into
agreements with corporations, partnerships or
individuels engaged in industry respectîng the
expansion of industrial employmnent.
This Bill does not modify that last sentence.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Does the
sentence mean that the Governor in Council
may give financial assistance to these corporations, partnerships or individuals?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It does.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In what form
and in what wey?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not remember what explenation 1 gave on this
point in May lest. I have not a memorandum
before me et the moment.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the lionourable leader have the information when
we come to third reading?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, the
matter is fixed by the Act which is now on
the St.atute Book.
Since some reference has been made to
the "blenk cheque" feature, which was discus-4ed when the original measure was poeepared earlier th.is session, I should like to
say this. Under previous relief legislation the
Dominion was exupowered to grant to any
province financial assistance of an unlimited
amount and for any purpose whatsoever. Under this legisietion ithe maximum
amount of financial assistance which. may be
granted to any province is the province's
share of unemployment relief and undertekings for Fabruary and March, 1936, and its
share under any agreement entered into
under authority of the Act. Therefore limitation is rprovîded both as to ainount and purpose. A close check will be mede to see that
any such assistance granted covers only bona
fide relief outlays. In fact, steps have adready
been taken in this direction.
The province of British Columýbia has applied for boans of $43,000 and UW60O, covering its shere of direct relief for the moniths
of Febnue'ry and March. .Applications for
these. lans were neeeived tee late te be deait
with under the Relief Act, 1935. The province of Manitoba "umitted an application
for a loan of S205,000, covering -Marcla exPendituos ýThis_ a.pplication also. was re-

629

ceived too late to be dealt with undea, the
Relief Act, 1935. As te Saskatchewan and
Aliberta, euthority was obtained under the
Relief Act, 1935> to grant loans covering their
share of direct relief up to March 31, 1936.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Did we not.
deal earlier this session with the matter about
which my honourable friend from Aima
<Hon. Mr. Bailantyne) is esking now? The
clause which hie is questioning is on the
Statute Book?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM - We passed that
carlier this session?
Yes.
1 think that after the explanation I have
made my honourable friend from Alma will
agree that the Bill provides sufficient limitations.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I quite understand, honoura.ble senators, that I am te some
extent out of order in discussing what has
already been approved thîs seson, but my
mind is not clear as regards the last part of
section 4. It would. seem te me that the Relief
Commission as empowered. te give to corporations certain moneys thet should go to
provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND: Since the provision to which my honourable friend refers is
already in the Act, may 1 suggest that hie
read the explanation given last mon-th when.
the Act was passed?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 think that iii
consequence of this discussion, we ought te
have before us what the honourable Minister
said on the matter in another place. Dealing
with agreements with provinces, hie said:
The clauee as dTefted is designed te accomplish two objecta. First, te permit the
Dominion to loan to the provinces such parts
of Paymnents made by the provinces for direct
relief or relief undertakings during the mionthe
of February and March for which accounts
have not been rendered to the Dominion before

the expiry of the Relief Act of lest year. The
second object of the clause is to permit the
Dominion Government to boan to the provinces
their share of direct relief peymente or their
share of payments for undertakings cerried on
co-operatively with the Dominion Goverument.

Under the clause as originally drafted and
before tqhe amendment which wes introduced
a f ew days ago, Provision wes flot made for
a boan by the Dominion in exces. of the,
amount which might be paid by the Dominion
te the province under any agreement with thet
province. The amendment is designed te meet

a quite unique situation which exista in Manir.

of Winnipeg. Under the terrms of that agreement the Dominion is obligated to boan to the
province its share, which is twenty per cent
of the total cost cf the undertaking, and to
the city its share, forty per cent of the total
cost of the undertaking, the remaining forty
per cent of the cost of the undertaking having
been assumed by the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: That dees not
answer my objection, but I do net intend to
proceed further at this late hour cf the
session. It is quite clear te me, at any rate,
that the Relief Commission ean take money
ear-markced for a province and divert it to
corporations, partnerships, and se on.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In the instance I

lion. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I should like te state briefly my
opinion on the question of restricting appeals
from one tribunal te others in Canada and,
fmnally, te the Privy Council. Having followcd
the debates on this question that have taken
place in various parts of our country in the
last fifty years, I gradually formed an opinion.

of a judge of the Superior Court could appeal

Court of Review could be ap)pealed to a Court
of Appeals consisting of five judges; and,
in turn, its .iudgment could be appealed to
the Supreme Court of Canada. Finally, one
of the parties could carry an appeal from the
Suipreme Court to the Frivy Council.
During my practice 1 realized more than
once that the systemn permitting appeals to
the Privy Council often led to injustice. A
workman, for instance, who had been injured
while in the empley of a railway or other
large corporation and ýhad been awarded by a
jury a judgment of a fcw thousand dollars,

we sbould not countenance an appeal from

whomn only two are versed in the Civil Code.

JUNE 22, 1936
As to appeals to the Privy Council, I would
abolish themn completely. True, members of
the Judicial Committee have had brilliant
careers and are bighly regarded for their
learning. I think that is the general opinion
of barriste.rs who have appeared before that
court. The honourable senator from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), wbo had
a large practice at the Privy Councîl, said
that after 1867, when cases bearing on the
interpretation of the British North America
Act began to corne before the Judicial Coinmittee, the members of that body were of a
bigher order than former rneniibers. The late
Joseph Doutre, who was the head of the law
flrm to which I belonged. and was as highly
esteemed at the Montreal Bar as the honourable senator from North York was at the
Toronto Bar, spuke very highly of the Privy
Council judges. But I arn of opinion that
Canadian justice shvould be ample and, satisfactory for Canadians. The sentiment in
favour of appeals to a tribunal across the
seas was forrned, quite properly and naturally
so, at the time, when Canada was developing
as a colony and had what I can. only describe
now as a colonial inferiority complex. We
should have passed that stage in our national
if e. We must be more self-reliant and place
more confidence in our own cultur'al and
intellectual attainrnents.
Briefiy stated, these are the opinions that
I .hold on the question of appeais from the
judgrnents of our courts.
Hlon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
in the absence of the honourable senator from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) I have
heen asked to read the follo>wing 9tatement
from bim, and I do so without prejudice:
"I promised the other evening, before a
sparse Huse, that I would not make a
speech, though I have the right to do so.
A'biding by my word, I have written two or
three sentences.
"In speaking to rny motion I did not intend
to give a legal dissertation. The law is not
my profession. The burden of my speech, the
objeet of all ry work-and it was bard work
for me-was an appeal for eleemosynary aid
for poor unfortunates who, after having been
perhaps one or two ycars before the Canadian
courts, have not seven or eight thousand
dollars in cash and are not able to borrow this
sum and tie it up in London without interest
for two years in garnbling on a lawsuit before
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
I desire to stop the blackmail that goes on
when the loser in Canada finds that the winner
bas no money to pay for sending lawyers to
London. In such cases there is a compromise,

631

and for his j udgment the winner gets what
Shylock would give.
"In the course of this debate we have been
told very often that the King is the fountain
of aIl justice. But in order that a Canadian
may drink out of that fountain in England
he mnust have seven or eight thousand dollars
in cash. No rnoney, no drink.
"Sir John A. Macdonald drafted the Supreme
Court !Bill, and Alexander Mackenzie made it
law, in order to save the expense of sending
Iawyers to England. What was the reason for
creating this substitute if full use was not
intended to be made of it?
"I arn an Imperial'st and flot asharned of it.
I corne by my convictions honestly, rny
forbears having servedi the King continuously
since 1791. In my fldelity to our King I give
way to no man. But I repeat what I said
earlier, that I do not believe the foundations
of the Empire will be undermined if Canadian
cases, other than constitutional cases, are
decided by Canadian j udges in Canada."
This debate bas continued over a long
period. As we bave arrived at -alrnost tbe end
of the session and so many members are
absent, I would suggest. that the question be
dropped, to, be taken up again at another
session if so desired.
The Order was discharged.
CANADIAN COLONIZATION PLAN
MOTION

AND

DISCUSSION-DEBATE
TINUED

CON-

The Senate resumed from May 27 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Sauvé, that it be resolved:

That while recognizing the necessity of
utilizing our immense territory according to,
a rational plan of exploitation and colonization,
this Bouse is of opinion that:(a) immigration into Canada must be conducted along lines of the greatest prudence, so
as to protect our traditions, strengthen our
institutions, and also so as not to complicate
our national problemas nor aggravate those
affecting agriculture and unenployrnent;
(b) that the repatriation of emigrated Canadians should be efflciently encouraged before
sny other immigration;
(c) the ernigration of naturalized Canadiane
should be controlled in such a way as to reduce
it to, its lowest possible f orm, if flot to prohibit
it altogether.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, it is a long tirne sinoe I have
had the pleasure of preparing a few notes to
answer my bonourable, friend who initiated. this
discussion (H-on. Mr. Sauvé).
Tbe honoura-ble gentleman gave us the history of Canadilan emigrati-on, more particularly
from the province of Quebec to the United
States.. In another debate during this sesion.

632

SENATE

I had occasion to read a letter written in 1840
by Lord Sydenham, in which he spoke of the
constant movement, somewhat accelerated by
the events of 1837, towards the then more
prosperous country to the south. I am inclined to think that movement started perhaps
even before 1840. It must be borne in mind
that in the rural sections there is always a
surplus population, more especially in Quebec,
where large families are the rule. One can
easily visualize what happens when eight or
ten sturdy boys attain manhood. They can
no longer remain on their father's farm, and
they leave to seek employment in industrial
centres.
The drift towards the New England manufacturing centres was constant during the
whole of the nineteenth century. No effort
was made, by the offering of lands and financial
help, to stem the tide and induce Canadians to
remain in their native land. At first the exodus
was hardly noticeable, but gradually it gained
momentum. As thousands of Canadians from
Quebec secured a fairly prosperous livelihood
in the New England States, their relatives and
friends at home became apprised of their improved condition. That explains how one
successful emigrant would draw after him
anywhere from five to ten of his friends from
the same village.
My honourable friend has suggested a fairly
drastic remedy. Apparently he would close
our doors to further emigration to the United
States.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: No. I explained my proposals in the course of my speech, and if
the honourable leader of the Government has
had no time to read it, I would suggest that
he do so at the first opportunity. I favour
rcgulation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: After reading his
motion I take it for granted that, if possible,
means should be employed to prevent the
exodus. There are several ways in which
people may be dissuaded from leaving their
native land, but I think my honourable friend
went so far as to suggest preventive measures.
Only Russia, Germany and Italy have resorted to such an extreme course. Before
they may leave their fatherland the nationals
of those countries must receive officiaI permission. But even there the prohibition is
not for all time. I understand that Italy has
relaxed, if not entirely withdrawn, its prohibition against emigration. No such prohibition cen endure in a free country.
Our clergy in Quebec, realizing the danger in
this steady drain of population, pleaded in
vain. For a time Bishop Taché, of St. Boniface, appealed to all the hierarchy in Quebec
to have them try to divert the southward flow
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

towards Manitoba. That suggestion was not
received very sympathetically. Our clergy still
hoped to retain their flocks. I believe that the
attitude was a short-sighted one, and that if
the people who subsequently left Quebec had
become convinced of the advantages of
migrating to the West we should have had no
difficulity in retaining them in their native
country.
Emigration to the south began in times
when our farming community was not faring
very well, but even during periods of prosperity the movement continued systematically.
There was a time when our industrial workers
moved into the United States in large numbers. When the Government at Washington
established an immigration quota against
European countries and Mexico, it placed no
such restriction on immigration from Canada. As a result oi the quota, salaries and
wages reached their maximum and mechanics
engaged in mass production were paid 810,
$12 and $15 a day. There was no comparable
condition of prosperity in this country, yet,
as honourable senators may be surprised to
hear, in the thirty years between 1901 and
1931, in spite of that constant movement to
the south from the rural and urban centres
of Quebec, no fewer than 220 rural parishes
were established in the province.
My honourable friend spoke of the meagre
efforts made by governments towards repatriation. I believe he is gravely in error in that
respect. As a matter of fact, the Department of Immigration started this work in
1889, but the results have not been very enThe Statistical Year Book of
couraging.

I fear that to-day any further efforts towards repatriation are hospeless, for if our
compatriots on the other side of the line
are prosperous they will not return to Canada.
Many of those immigrants live in towns and
cities and are surrounded with grown-up
families. Boys and girls brought up under
urban conditions in the United States cannot
be expected to take kindly to a rural life.
In times of depression and distress they may
think to better their condition in the Do-

minion; but we must not forget that we have
in our own towns and cities a serious unemployment problem. Admittedly it is difficult
tio induce our unemployed artisans te go back
to the land. I suggest it will be still more
difficult to persuade our industrial workers
across the line to return to a country life.
Naturally we shall be happy to receive them
if they are prepared to go on the land. It is
estimated that to-day there are between three
and four thousand farms in the province of
Quebec still 'owned by Canadians living in
the United States. Those owners may return
to continue their work on the farms which
they deserted. The Dominion Government
has made praiseworthy efforts to repatriate
those willing to return to the land. For the
benefit of honfourable members I desire to
place on Hansard this memorandum from the
Department of Immigration:
It is difficult in the compass of an ordinary
memorandum to review all the ramifications
of this movement carried on for se many years
by the Dominion Government. The following,
however, touches upon the principal features:
1. Repatriation work dates fom 1880, and
thus is one of the earliest activities of the
Dominion Government in the immigration field.
The effort has always been limited to the
United States, because it was to the United
States our Canadian people went. The effort
all through the years, from 1889 until recently,
was directed mainly, I might almost say wholly,
to the repatriation of people of French racial
origin. Repatriation Fathers were employed
in this work, usua.lly at a very small salary

plus travelling and living expenses.
2. When the work was first undertaken in
1889, immigration was handled by the Department of Agriculture. Repatriation expenditure
between 1889 and 1893, when immi gration was
transferred
to
the Interior
epartment,
amounted to approximately $7,000.
Between
1893 and 1918, when immigration was a part
of the Interior, the expenditure was $340,000.
From 1918 to 1032 the amount was $433,000,
but this does net include any of the expenditures on regular agencies or on exhibitions, etc.
3. In addition to the employment of Repatriation Fathers, the department employed
other agents, several of these being established
in the New England States, where many French
Canadians and their descendants were to be
found. These agents were net Colonization
Fathers, but laymen. Their work was carried
on through established agencies. For example,
at one time we had agencies in Portland and
Biddeford, Me., Boston, Mass., Providence and
and
R.I., Manchester, N.H.,
Woonsocket,
Saginaw, Mich. In addition te the distinctive
repatriatien agents there were other agencies
established in various parts of the United States
which gave some attention te repatriation work,
althogh that was net their principal activity.
These agencies were at Detroit, Mich., Buffalo,
N.Y., Chicago, 111., Columbus, Ohio, Minneapolis,
Minn., Omaha, Neb., Fargo, N.D., Great Falls,
Mont., Kansas City, Mo., Spokane, Wash., and
Ban Francisco, Cal.
4. In the autumn of 1927, following a discussion of the then Minister of Immigration
vernand Colonisation with the Provincial

ment of Quebec, an understanding was reached
that repatriation work in and for the province
of Quebec would be taken over by the Provincial Government, the Dominion Government to
make a contribution on a fifty-fifty basis, with
a maximum from the Dominion Government of
$50,000. This arrangement became effective on
the 1st April, 1928, and the Pederal contributions for that and successive fiscal years were
as follows:
1928-29.. .. .. .. .. .. .. $29,680 62
49,920 40
1929-30.. ............
50,000 00
1930-31.. ............
50,000 00
1931-32.. ............
No grants were made after the end of the fiscal
year 1931-32.
When the arrangement was made between
the Dominion Government and the province of
Quebec, the same offer was made to other
provinces of the Dominion for the carrying on
of repatriation on a co-operative basis. No
other province took up the offer except the
province of New Brunswick, and in that case
the expenditure was very emall and was limited
to one year, being mainly investigational work.
5. In the autumn of 1930 immigration activities were curtailed and graduafly terminated.
Immigration agencies in the United States were
closed between 1930 and 1932. This affected
not only distinctive repatriation agencies, but
all others as well. Several of the agencies in
the British Isles were closed, and whereas there
were formerly agencies at London, Liverpool,
Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin, Inverness, Aberdeen,
York, Cardiff, Southampton and Bristol, the
agencies now retained are at the first four
places named in this list.
6. In the autumu of 1930 the immigration
regulations amended were appioable te continental Europe, and many other countries as
well. This did not include the British Isles,
self-governing British Dominions and the United
States. Provision was made for the admission
of but two classes from continental Europe:
(a) Wives and unmarried children under
eighteen years of age joining family heads
established in Canada;
(b) Farmers with sufficient capital to begin
farming in Canada on their own account.
7. As the result of the closing of the agencies,
the discontinuance of propaganda, and the
change in the regulations, immigration fell from
164,993 for the calendar year 1929 te 11,277
for the calendar year 1935.
8. The expenditures on repatriation were continued beyond the date when expenditures
on immigration propaganda oeased; hence this
activity, which was one of the earliest undertaken by the Federal Government, was the
last to be discontinued.

I really believe that Canada bas just about
seen the end of the repatrialion movement.
It may be that the lahouring elemnents of our
own people, on both sides of the line, will be
attracted te our prairie lands, rather than te
Eastern Canada, if they are offered a low
railroa(l rate to the West like the one granled
to foreigners who are travelling on a through
ocean-and-rail ticket. At various times there
hav e been complaints; because Canadians had
te pay a high rate te the West, whereas
immigrants from abroad, travelling on through
tickets, could be sent to Winnipeg, half-way
across the continent, at a low rate. It was
suggesled that if Canadians from the East
were given the same advanlage they might go
te tlie West and settle. It might seem difficult
te justify such a policy; the answer, however,
is quite naturel. Efforts were being made
at the expense of the public treasury te
increase our population and there seemed te
be no justification for transferring a part of
that population from one section of the country le another. Yet, in my opinion, if our
Western Provinces are to-day desirous of
increasing their population they might well
approach the railway companies with a view
te securing low rates for our own nationals
in the East who are unemployed and are
disposed te settle on the land, provided there
is a reasonable expectation that they wilI
succeed.
The ground for my suggestion is
the statement that there are only some
lion. Mr. IJANDURAND.

12,000,000 acres of arable land left in the
This would provide
province of Quebec.
120,000 farms of 100 acres each. I arn informed
that there is an annual surplus rural population of 10,000, who are free to, take land and
settle upon it. If that is so, and if this surplus
rural population is granted an opportunity to
go on farms in the province of Quebec, those
120,000 farms will be occupied within twelve
years and there will be no more land available
in the East. I arn told that in the Abitibi
district of thie province of Quebec, in the
valleys of the Laflamme, Aricana and Turgeon
rivers, whicb flow towards James bay, there
is land enough to receive 50,000 families, and
that the Abitibi region of the neighbouring
province of Ontario will accommodate 150,000
families. I do not know what the quality of
the landl throughout those regions may be.
Soe say il is good arable land. However,
il is for the provinces to decide upon the
advisability of inviting setlIers to occupy lands
within their boundaries. The West could, if
desirous of increasing ils population, draw
first upon the surplus population of the East
by offering the inducement of low railway
rates.
(Hon. Mr.
The honourable gentleman
Sauvé) has spoken of the period preceding
Confederation, when we received the overflow of population of Great Britain and the
United States. In 1867 Canada's population
ivas more homegeneous than il is now, there
being Ihen but the French, the early pioneers,
and the English, Scotch and Irish, four races,
wilh two languages. Then, as my honourable
friend has said, we had the railway age,
beginning in 1885, wben the West n'as opened
up. This opening of the West Ivas desired
by the Eastern Provinces. Macdonald and
Cartier took pride in the purchase of the
Hudson Day lerritory and in the bringing
of British Columbia into Confederation. From
the moment the Fathers of Cenfederation
dýecided that, the West and the East should
be united mbt one Dominion, the colonization
of the West was a natural and logical
sequence. Over a long period of years we
recei%-ed a large number of vigorous representatives of nations in northern Europe. My
honourable friend admits that the general
quality of these immigrants was excellent,
but he feýars that, the influence of this foreign
element may tend te alter the ethnical character of t.he country. He fears, too, that
the new-comers may introduce here the radical
nostrums of Socialists and Communists.
The primary objeet of the immigration
policy of aIl governments bas been to settle
the West with farmers. A reîatively small
number of immigrants settled in the province

JUNE 22, 1936
of Quebec, and a larger proportion in Ontario, but the great bulk went west at once.
Thousands of t.hemn found their way into
Western cities, and in time a great many
retraced their steps and came ta live in cities
of the East. These people belonged ta diverse
races and spoke their awn tongues. I quite
realize that aur population speaking English
or French bas nat yet become accustomed
ta this casmopolitan section. It will take one
or two generations before these strangers or
their descendants feel they are Canadians
like the rest of us. They will cease ta be
regarded as new-comers when they speak the
language -of the community in whîch they live.
-Unùil the thousands of our people who are
at present unemployed are able to obtain
wark, we should be slow to invite additional
immigrants to aur shores. In that expression of opinion I arn simply repeating what
my honourable friend bas said. If any one
province desires ta open its doors to immigrants it shbuld make sure that they will
remain an the land and nat drift to cities.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: We ail know
that since the natural resaurces were handed
hack to the Western Provinces they have
the first say as ta admission of immigrants
inta their own ter-ritory.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: May I take it that
the hanoura-ble leader is expressing the policy
of the Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Though I have
not conferred with my colleagues, I believe
I may well say that I arn expressing the
policy of the present Gavernment.
I would urge that any pravince desirous of
attracting additional population should draw
upon aur Canadian sources before seeking
new-comers frorn other cauntries. In this
regard I arn speaking simply my awn view.
I believe, though, that this is the view of all
thinking and far--sighted men in' Canada.
We should have no immigration policy whicha
would tend ta attract people to aur towns and
cities, where already there are thousands of
unemplayed. Our provinces are mainly agricultural. Should any one of them, desirous
of increasing its population, prefer to appeal
ta people of the British Isles or any other
outside country rather than ta acclimatized
Canadians, I hope it will be careful ta bring
in' only such classes as are likely ta become
good farmers.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
I wish ta make only a f ew remarks. We
should be grateful ta the honourable senator
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) for having

6M~

submi:tted to the House such a complete and
comprehensive study of one of the most important problems facing Canada to-day. I
have no hesitation in saying that one of the
chief reasons for our present social, political
and industrial problems in Canada is the fact
that we have too many miles of railroad,
main and branch lînes, and nlot enough people.
One need only look at the statistics of Canada
to observe in what a capricious way, if I
may use that terra, the population is distributed in different sections.
I think that the address made by the hanourable senator fromn Rigaud should induce
each and every one of us to study the Immigration Act and regulations during the coming
recess with a view to determining whether it
should nat be amended, more or less radically
if necessary, in ordcr ta fit aur new needs.
As we aIl know, in most cases before a persan
is admitted as an immigrant ta Canada he bas
to pledge himsclf to settie on the land, to
become a farmer. His inclinations, ability
and previaus training are nat considered. He
may came from the slums of London and not
know the difference between a horse and a
harrow, but in arder ta be admitted ta Canada
he must agree ta go an a farm. I think it is
necessary only ta mention such a state of
affairs to show how ridiculous it is. What
happens under these conditions? A large
number of immigrants, after spending a few
weeks or perhaps a month on the land, break
away and go ta cities, where they get factary
jobs, while qualified mcchanics who were born
in Canada and whose families have long been
taxpayers in thase cities are out of wark.
In the district where I live I have known
of many sucli instances. It is nat merely a
mistake, it is a disgrace, on the part of the
Canadian Gavernment-I am not blaming one
party mare than another-that this kind of
thing 6hould go an, decade after decade. The
results of such a policy are only taa plain
to-day. My words may saund a little strang;
I may be exaggerating a bit; but it is well
that -once in a while someane should be bold
enough ta say such things.
There is one other point Vhat I wish to,
make. lrmtmgrants from thie British Tales are
usually preferred by Canadian authorities
ta immigrants from. continental Europe, who
may corne frein countries where agriculture
bas been developed to a science. Even
though they are -potentially good farmers,
people fro>m the Continent are often segregated and treated in a moet unfair way.
My bumble suggestion that honourable
members study the Impiigratiain Act e~nd
regulatians du-ring the receff is offered in' ail
earnestness, i the hope that we may later

636

be in a position to deal with the whole
problem submitted by the present resolution
and amend the Act so as to make it more
suitable to meet the disorganized conditions
that the depressiaon bas brought &bout in
society, industry and even in our national
ife.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE:- Hon ourable

and thanks to the honourable leader of the
Government and other houourable senators
in respect oaf their ve.ry i'nteresting remarks

it is stili very doubtful just when the Comnmons will have the Suipply Bill ready for us.
I would therefore move t'hat the Senate

me to intimate to the House that hie thouglit
the sitting might be resumed about 10 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think it would

say that I have liad a short interview with
the honourable the Minister of Justice and
hie assures me that the other House will finish
its work and prorogation will take place

TRIBUTE TO CURATOR 0F READINGROOM
On the motion to adjourn during pleasure:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before I move
that the Senate adjourn during pleasure, I
desire to say a few words concerning the retirement of an old employee. I refer to Mr.
E. E. Bérubé, the curator of the reading-room.
He entered the Senate as a page boy in 1886,
and for fifty years has been a faithful employee of this Chamber. Most bonourable
senators have bad occasion to require hais
services in the reading-room. He has been
a devotcd servant, and before hie leaves us
I should like to state that the members of
the Senate have been com-pletely satisfied with
the way in wbicb hie bas discbarged bis duties.
We wish him long life to enjoy bis wehl-earned
leisure. For the tbirty-eigbt years I have been
here I have seen bim at work. I hope that
during bis days of retirement hie will pray that
1 myseli may complete fifty years of service
in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I am very glad indeed of this
opportunity to associate myseîf with the
leader of the Goveroment in the very fitting
and timnely reference lie has made to Mr.
Bérubé, an old and valued employee who is
now retiring by reason of having reached the
age of superannuation. It is indeed greatly
to his credit that hie bas served this House
and the Parliament of Canada so faithfully
and well ditring the long period of baîf a
century. I should like to join witb the leader
of the Government in hoping that Mr. Bérubé
may enjoy gond healtb and live for many
years to enjoy the pension bie so richly
deserves.
May I add that it is tbe unanimous desîre
and wish of this House that our gifted and
genial leader of the Government may not
onhy complete bis fiftieth year as a member
of this House, but may also be with us for
many years to follow.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.

$90,772,525.81, and for 1935-36 the sum of
$16,031,028.69.
I need not dilate upon the im.portance of
thîs Bill, which has been scrutinized in detail
and agreed to by the representatives of the
people. The Senate hae adopted the custom
of accepting such measures from the House of
Commons without question, that Chamber
being the only one which oan initiate them,
and I take it for granted that all efforts have
been made to compress the controllable expenditure te the lowest figure at which the
various departments of the Government may
continue te carry on thýeir laudable work.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill

wvas read the second tinte.

DUTY ON

MANUFACTURED

COKE

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. LACASSE inquired of the Goveroment:
1. When the duty was placed on manufactured coke entering Canadla in June, 1931,
w-hat promises w crc made to the Goverumnent
by the "coke ov ens" to assure the supplying
of thie market?
2. -vN-Ihat drawback was then given te th
"coke ox'sns- on the importation of bitumninous
cok~e uscd in the manufacture ef gas and its
by-.pr(.fiit, coke?
i
3. Wh was tlle drawback reduced in 1935,
or thiercabouts. to 50 pcr cent?
4. Wb at is tbi" cou) I liso n betweiin the cost
of produci ng coke i n Ca nada anud the cost i n
the United States?
5. Why is the priee at the main producers'
us in Ontario, in the city et lainiltonî
oen
1on er than the' price in ether cninilnIities'
6. IIow unany tous ef coke did the Hamilton
by-product ovens import frem the United
States, or otlîerwise. since the year 1931 and
reseil te the consumer in the Dominion et
Canada?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The bonourable
senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) bas
incjuired concerning the duty plaeed on manu-

factured coke, and the drawbacks allowed.
The answer is a.s followa:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

1. No officiai record in the Department of
Finance.
2. The drawback ef duty granted (not
including special or dumping duty) during
by
coal imported
on bituminous
1931
proprietors of by-product recovery coke ovens
and converted into coke at their by-product
recovery coke ovens was 99 per cent. No
drawback was paid on coal converted into
coke at a gas retort plant or a plant using any
other process than the by-product coke
process (Tariff Item 1049).
3. The drawback payable on imported
bituminous ceai used in the manufacture of
coke was reduced from 99 per cent te 50 per
cent by the budget of April 19, 1934. As well
as reducing the amount of drawback this
amendment extended the drawback to alI
companies manufacturing coke, whether in
by-pruduct recovery ovens or in ordînary gasmaking retorts. Previously, drawback was
allowed ouly on coal converted into coke by
the former proccas.
The reason for the amendment macle in the
1934 budget was te remove what was dccmed
to bc an inequality under which produccrs of
dom&cýtic coke by one method secured practically duty-frcc coal, whereas producers by a
dîferent method hâd to pay the full import
duty ef 75 cents a ton. The effect was to
make the drawback apply to, all producers of
domestie coke and give ail a 50 per cent
drawback, rather than a drawback of 99 per
cent to those using by-product ovens.
4. The relative eost of coke production in
Canada depends entirely upon laid-down cost
of the coal at that plant. Labour charges,
methods of financing and costs of conversion
are about the same in both counatries.
.5. The rc,îson that coke prices at the plant
in Hamilton are lower than in other commnunities is due to the advantageous shipping
facilities provided wherehy United States coal
can be shipped from Erie Lake ports to
Hamilton by water at a lower transportation
This permits of United States coal
cot
being laid down at Hlamilton for somietling
like $4 per ton.
6. Importations consist of both £oundry ani
domestic coke as follows:

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In relieving you of your duties, I congratulate you upon the care and attention given
the many far-reaching measures submitted for
your consideration. Your labours have been
arduous and exacting; they have, however,
served to complete, almost in its entirety, tht
extensive program outlined in my speech at
the Opening of Parliament.
The Trade Agreement concluded on Armistice
Day. 1935, between Canada and the United
States of America, received your early approval,
and its provisions have now been in force for
some time. Legislation has been passed implementing the undertakings of the Agreement

with Japan. Substantial reductions have been
made in the rates of duty on implements cf
production in the agricultural industry, and on
machinery in other basic industries, as well as
on articles of domestie consumption.
The
pronounced increase of our trade during recent
months is evidence of the beneficial effects of
the Government's fiscal policies. My Ministers
are continuing their efforts te expand trade
with other countries.
Comprehensive measures have been enacted
te effect a nation-wide co-operative effort te
overcome conditions created by the longcontinued existence of unprecedented unemployment, and te effect a more complete

authority and responsibility te Parliament.

recommendations have been embodied in legislation which provides for the carrying on of
a national broadcasting service in Canada

measures enacted at the sessions of Parliament in 1934 and 1935, have been received
within the past few days, and are being carefully studied by my Ministers and by the law
officers of the Crown.
My Ministers have given continuons thought
te the serious international situation. They
have sought te support by all appropriate and
practicable means the establishment of a world
order based on justice and equity. At- the
forthcoming meetings of the Assembly of the
League of Nations te be held at Geneva at the
