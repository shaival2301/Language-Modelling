Hlonourablc Gentlemen of the Smo te:
<~ilmnof the House of Conimons:
I congratulate you that after an enforced
absence of four yeare. itlaI possible for you ta
assemble in your new legisiative home, resting in
trustful security upon the old foundations and
aurrounded by the picturesque and historic
setting of P'arliament Hill. Though not entirely completed, its noble proportions, ita wide
and conv'enient apacea, ils beauty of deeign

and chasteness of finish and ils unique local
situation ma rk it a s a moat striking and dignified stru eture, worthy of the people whose
national life it will henceforth serve.
Since the last Session of Parliament eventa
of importance have taken place which have
brought appreciably nearer the much deeired
settiements of peace. Following the exchange
of the final rauificationa. the Treaty of Peace
between the Allied Powera and Gerrnany has
been brought into full force and effect and
haa rendered poaaible the conatitution of the
League of Nationa and the establishment by
it of the various Comissions and inandatories
authorized by the Treaty to be carrled out
Il ia satiafactory to note
under its direction.
that the statua of Canada as a member of the
League haa thus been delinitely fixed.
The Treaty of lPcaee with Bulgaria has been
concluded and will be aubnmitted for your approval.
Negotiations for the conclusion of
Treaties of Peace with Hungary and Turkey
are now well advanced and, If concluded in
tine, will be laid before you during the present
Session of Parliament.
The first meeting of the International Labour
Conference. in accordance with the provisions
ofE the Treaty of Peace. was beld at Washington in October and Xovember of last year and
was attended by representatives of my Government and of the Canadian employers' and
employees' organizations. It will be gratlfyjng
t0 learn that Canada was selected as one of
the twelve Governmients whose countries are
entitled to representation on the governing
body of the International Labour Office.
When the remaining Treatiee shall have
been concluded and the functions of the League
of Nations and the various tribunals authorized
thereby become fully operative, il la confidently
hoped that the end will have been reached of
the confusion and uncertainty consequent upon
the long and regrettable delay iii bringing into
operation the provisiona of the Treaty and an
effective beginning miade in the improvement
of national conditions and the adjustmnent of
in ternational relations whicha will ensure the
continued blessings of peace.
The forces whlch Canada contributed ho the

have resumed their avocations and again becomne active and important fachors in civil life.

Hon. WILLIAM PROUDFOOT rose ta

Excellency the Governor General to off er
the humble thanks o! this House to His Exceilency for the graciaus Speech which he
has been pleased to make to, both Houses of

Exceilency the Gavernor General in reply
Wo
the Speech from the Throne, I wish first
of ail Wothank the honourable the leader
of the Government for the honour he has
done me in aelecting me" to make this
motion. As a newcomer ta this Chamber I
f eel it an especial mark of confidence, in
that I have not had the pleasure o! participating in the many and important measures which have been before the present
Government during its term, of office, and
niany of which muet be amplified and
deveioped during the present session. It ie
an especiai honour Wao, in that the present
ie. I am quite convinced, one o! the most
crucial times in the history of aur country
and to, a marked degree Canada's future
will stand upon what we build now. The
way is open for a Canada such as before the
war we but dreamed of. Honourable gentlemen may flot agree with that statemnent, yet
it is true. When they consider they will
find that we take for granted wvhat before
t~he war we aspired to from different points
o! view, but, I venture Wosay, with conviction on the part o! none that the end
would be achieved without years of graduai
national and conetitutional development.
Ris E.xcellency refers Wo
the ratification o!
the Peace Treaty with Germany and to the
treaties wvith other beliigerent nations which
are to be brougaht before the House for approval. The first meeting of the International Labour Conference has been held,
and, as Hie Excellency points aut, Canada
has been selected as one o! the twelve Governiments whose countries are entitled to
representation in the governing body of the
International Labour Office. Look at the
Empire how you wili; d&cide for yourselves what should be the consitutionial organization for the Empire: t.here is flot tbe
s]ightest question that Canada ivill occupy
in the Imperial Conference, ta mieet this
year, a position that but for the war she
could not have occupied.
We cari thank aur gailant soldiers for this
in a large measure. From the momnent that
aur firet contingent set foot in Engiand an
indefinite change took place. It was juet a
matter of getting better acquainted, an opportunity which had been denied Wo the
masses o! the people on bath sides a! the
S-li

Atlantic. The secand battle o! Ypres, when
the Gernians firet used gas, when aur gallant lads stepped into the breach from
Gravenstafle ta St. Julien and etopped the
eavage horde which would have swept;
through Ypres to the sea, cemented thechange. Our battered firet division, when
it em;erged !rom that conflict, found that in
the hearte of the people of Great Britain
eabh and every one af themn was a hemo.
The reception a! the wounded in Engla:nd
was touching. Theee boys' mothers and
sisters were toa far away Wotend Wo
them,
but self-constituted foster mothers and sisters were ever ready to <la their utmost for
their kmn by blood and by tradition. And
s0 the mutual knowledge and affection grew
as aur firet thirty thousand was foliowed
by many other tens a! thousande. When an
leave ar in haspital, they came inWo Wuch
with the people and made friends in, I yenture ta eay, practically every city and town
in England, Scotland and Ireland. When
they did not themeelves hecome, acquainted
wvith the people, somne Eng-lish Tommy, or
Scottish kiltie, or Irish fusilier, came home
and taiked af hie Canadian pal. I have
beon toid on goad authority that when
Britishi Tommy and Canadian or Australian
Tam rny met, the salutation was, "Well,
mate, liow goes itF" The termn "colonial"
we.e forgotten-and how many o! us were
unconsciausly annoyed by that terra in prewar days. Think o! the attitude of even
the Prince a! Wales an hie visit ta Canada.
To other people he was a guest and a prince,
even if no retinue a! courtiers stood betwveen. To the veterans he was one a! themselves. I am told-and I mention it to
show how aur army impressed even the
enemy-that the Germans in a quiet part
of the front, when the lines were close Wogether, have been known ta cail out: "What
are you fellows, British or Canadiain?"
And in another way too, thanke Woaur
gallant lads, the way is open. The greater
proportion o! those who are fit and well
are back in their homes, scattered tram
coast ta caast, and either settied or in the
wvay of settiing down, but with a different
prospect and a wider outlook. It is wonderfui ta think that 400,000 and more of the
bes! o! aur young blood have been in the
Old Land and had an opportunity o! studying its waye and conditions. Nine out of
every ten o! these men have grown in ambition and in confidence in the poseibilities
o! their country. What a great educational
factor this is, and what a spirit it is for
us ýto encourage, ta foster and to help!
And again, what a stimulus Woimmigration! England has in a measure educated

been told of this Canada of ours. Given
the proper opportunities and encouragenment, thousands of hearers Nviii be eager to
corne out ta, take their part in the developtuent of Canada.
And sa I say that in the new knowledge
and understanding that has grawn up out
ai tihe relations af aur boys witb the people
oi the Mother Country and have, consciausIy or unconsciausly, changed the relations
of Canada ta, the Old Land, and, in a
wider sense, the conception of the Empire
by the world at large, a new foundatian bas
been laid for the development af aur country. 1 rnay safely say that wve bave a new
self-confidenice, a newv autonorny whicb but
for the war and aur part in it, we should
have been years in attaining. Friendsbips
and mutual understanding of aur needs and
aur desires have been developed in a way
that would otherwise have been impossible.
This, as I have tried ta point out, we owe
in the largest mneasure to the boys who
bave foughit for us. Of the debt we awe to
themn and how we are ta psy it I shaîl
speak later. At the moment I wish ta emphasize that the greatest opportunity for
Canada's future bas arrived-is naw in aur
hands-and it is aur grave responsibility ta
see that by wvise and provident legisiation
we take advantage ai it ta the full nat only
vithin Canada but also abroad: within
Canada in its developmont, enriohmerit and
betterment; without Canada in its development in relation ta the Empire and ta the
world at large, commercially and politicaliv.
0f the latter phase I shail bave but
little to say. We have the apportunity. We
must develop it and its development
depends in a large measure on the success
af aur internai expansion, wvhich will give
Nveight ta aur outside influence. Yet I desire
ta sp.eak briefly of what %v'e must attend

the lat-e war, and if not thien, how miuch
less for any future wars. I am quite corivinced that. the power ai the Parliarnent
ai Canada is in ne sense impasired. I amn
at one witb the Hon. Mr. Doherty when be
says:
If unjust aggression occure. I have no doubt
the Parliamnent off Canada wvould act on the
advice off the Council of Nations. but there is
nothing in the Treaty of Peace or the Covenant
that provides
off
the League off Nations
machinery for the expenditure off a single
dollar or the raising off one soldier if the Parliament of Canada is unwilling.

It is true we bave no direct representation an this Concil, whicb. cansists of
representatives af the principal allied and

associated powers, Great Britain, France.
the UTnited States, Italy and Japan, tagether with representatives ai four other
mexmbers ai the League, -elected by the assembly fromi time ta, time, at, its discretion.
It is reasonable ta think that Great Britain
wiil continue ta bave direct representation
on the Council and that so long as she does
a second British representative will not be
chosen. For this reason it is doubtful il
any representative of the Dominions will be
eiected ta nmembersbip, but aur techiiical
rijlht ta it is the recag-nition by the League
ai the equality ai Canada with ather nations.
This new status w'hich we have, I say wve
must retain in aur relations ta tbe world at,

and permsanenlce of the Empire, "to guarantee and maintain the essentials of politicai
freedoin and to establish equal citizenship
for ail subjects of the linperial Crown."
This is a inatter for ourselves and the
Mother Country to deal with. It is not open
to question and interference by other
nations. Nor is our place in the League of
Nations. That arrangement was ýnot made
ta give the British Empire any undue representation, but to recognize the position of
the Dominions in the Empire and assure to
the overseas British countries equal authority with the smaller nations. 0f late oui
position has been cbailenged. It bas; been
moit ably defended by the Hon. N. W.
Rowell, the President of the Privy Council.
He said:
Canada, by the free action of her own Government, and the whole-hearted co-operation
of lier own people, raised 600,000 men to, takre
part in this war. She mortgaged hier future

these facts. It ls Inconceivable tbat any GovIn Canada could Ib £0 false to both
ernment
thse living and the dead. and to Canada's
future, as to give the assent of Canada to a
proposai which would deprive Canada of the

position and statue won for bier by lier soldiers

on the field of battle, and accorded to lier ait
the Peace Conference by the enllgbtered judgment of nations; partlcularly Is this the case
when full statua and voting rlghts are granted,
and we thlnk. properly granted, to several
nations on the Âmerican continent which either
by reason of treaties with the United States or

of economlc necesslty are dependent upon ber,
nations whlch tookz no part in the war and
whose combined population probably does not
exceed

that of Canada.

These words summairized our position.
The rights we secured should ait ail bazards
be retained. For the sacrifices of Canada in
tise war there neyer can be any adequaite
rnoney compensation. 'There is, however,
the consolation that we did something to
save freedoin, soniething to strengthien the
Empire and soinething- to ensure dloser caoporation aniong- ail the British countries
in the future.
Turning now to dornestic affaira in Canaida. In its development and reconstruction our. first duty is to our soldiers wvho
miade its new future possible.
As pointed out in the speech from the
Throne, the Department o! Soldiers' Civil
Re-establ i slment and the Soldiers' Land
Settlement Board continue to provide vocational training and opportunities for permanent occupation wbich greatl-y aid ils ii
solution o! the problern of readjustnient. It

is true much lias been done; but there is
stili rnuch to do. I arn strongly of the opinion that no effort should be spared to renlcr
as light as possible the burdL-n. of those who
were wounded in the wvar. Encouragement
and assistance bas been gîven, but we frequently corne across men who feel they have
flot received the treatment they should
have received, and that the rigbt of securing the vocations they desire have been
den¶ed thein. It is possible that in some instances they have been unreasonabie, but
their wishes should flot be lightly put aside;
our efforts should be directed towards making them happy and contented.
Canada bas done much to aqsist bier returned men, and wîll, I arn satisfied, continue to do more. Her pension list is the
moat liberal of any nation engaged in the
war; but when we consider the cost of living our supposed generous pensions are
wholly inadequate. My own opinion is, and
1 know that this House and the country will
agree with me, that the wounded and the
families of those who did not return should
be our especial care, and that the treasure
o! the -country should bie used to make their
lot as pleasant as possible. After we have
accom*plisbed this end, ail the available
resources of the country sijould be used in
assisting those who require assistance, not
by way of charity, but as the gîft of a
thankful nation. These men. did not hesitate Vo place their lives in jeopardy that
we migbit live; why then should we hesitate to spend our money so as to lighten
theur load. Every main should be plaoed in
a position to secure a living. No man who
went to the front, fougbt for his country,
and returned uninjured can rightly dlaim
that the nation owes him a living; but wbat
lie can rightly dlaim is that the nation owes
him an opportunity to make a living:This is one of the problems the Government bas bad to deal with. Mucb lias been
done, but stili more is required. Let us
have unîty of tbought and action, for only
in that way shall we accomplish what is,
expected of us and hand down to future generations, and place before tbe worid at large,
the fact that the Canadian Government
with its able and patriotic leader, Sir Robert
Borden, did ail that was bumanly possible
ini bringing the country througb a crisis of
a kind with wbich no previous parliament
of Canada was ever confronted. Mistakes
doubtless were made; but a generous and
sympathetic nation wîll not and does not
withhold its thanks and gratitude for what

bas

beEn

accomplished.

F.irst and foremost, as I bave said, is our
duty to our soldiers, not only for what

SENATE
they have done, but, as 1 have already
pointed out to the country at large, because
I seýe in th4ern, through the broader view
they have acquired and in the influence
for colonization itbey have Ie!t behind in
the Old Land, one of the greatest factors
in the new dev-elopment of Canada.
As 'we are in a eense laying new foundations after the war, another very essential
factor is our money. Our aacrificeG ini the
war in relation to our wealth have been
so rnuch greater than those of other nations,
-particularly as most affecting us, those
of the nation to the south of us-that we
find ourselves in a very disadvantageous
position. If 'we are to compete on -a Teasonable basis, that condition musît lie righted.
Varion~s simple and effective proposais invoiving sacrifice on the part of other
nations have been advanced; as for instance a sharing of the total war expenditure by ail the belligerent nations in proportion to their wealth. But we can hope
for no such solution; we must rely upon
ourselves; and if in so doing we create conditions unfavourable to those other nations
-we rnust not hesitate to incur their displeasure. Proportionately we have done
imore for the common good than they. They
have profited by our loss. They should. not
complain.
How is the desired resuit to be accompli.shed? Were 'we in Canada able to, produce ail that we reqtiire and te dispose o!
ail that we produce wae need not werry
a.bout this eubjeot; but we musit import
and we muet expert. As Mr. Maoaulay
truly stated,
Every person who buys from the Mother
Country instead of fromn the United States performs a patriotic service, for hie helps to improve the value of sterling exehange and avoids
increasing the Premnium on American exchange.
The heavy premium on New York funds, and
the huge discount on sterling funds, are the
natural and inevitabie result of our purchasing
chiefly fromn the United States, while selling
chiefly to Great nritain.

then, ail parts by trading together will
make the whole Empire prosperous, populotis -andc commercially independent.
Oanadian funds should not be at a discount in New Yo>rk. Our currency is as
sound as that o! the Uni'ted States, and our
total expoits show a balance of 'hundreds
of millions ia excess of our total importa.
Unâtil the United States sees fit to aocept
our rnoney at par and treat us on a basis
o! equality, our duty is to stop buying
luxurie-s !rom them, and to purchase nothing f rom them that is not absolutely necessary. As Canada is one o! the largest
purchasers from the United States, it will
not take themi long to reacli the conclusion
that our trade is worth having-, and then
the high rate o! exchange will disappear.
The Speech from the Throne refera to
the business situation and points out that
business is on the whole satisfactory. I
arn pleased te be able to corroborate- that
statement. The trade returns for January
o! this year show that our imports from
Great Britain totalled $16,414,503, as compared with $9,882,984 in December, and
$6,709,200 in January, 1919. They sho-w
that the expor4. ta Great Britain were
$38,288,049: and our imports frorn the
United States were $74,520,423, as against
$71,069,509 in Decerniber, and $59,379,127
in January, 1919. They also show our exports te the United States were $43,577,945,
as compared with $41,227,589 in January,
1919. For the ten rnonths o! the present
fiscal year, our trade shows a favourable
balance of $357,500,000 with Great Britain,
an unfavourable balance o! $230,300,000
with the United States, and with ail countries a favourable balance amounting- to
$263,600,0O0.

FEBRUARY 27, 19207
It is satisfactory to note that a Domninion Franchise Bill will be introduced.
I have no idea of -what its provisions will
be, but doubtless tbey will be in keeping
with public sentiment and modern ideas.
In my opinion the franchise should not
be granted, for eome time at any rate, to
aliens, slackers, and men wbo avoided
military service. Canadians bave not yet
reached the point of forgiving themn or placing themn on a basis of equality with others.
I *bave for years feit that the Federal
and the Provirncial Governments should
get together and agree on a franchise covering the whole Dominion. The preparation
of the lists could be left in the hands of
the municipal authorities, and they could
be used for elections rto both the Federal
and the Provincial Houses. Many millions
of eixpense would be saved in this way,
and lis.ts so prepared would, on the whole,
be found more sa'tisfactory.
It is satisýfactory te note by His Excellency's Address th-at amendments to the
Loan anid Trust Compamlies Acts are cont.emplated. It is important 'that these Acts
sbould be amended éo as to prevent fraud
and speculation with company iunds.
In the past the moneye.-of investors have
been jeopardized. and many people ruined
by tbe improper manipul-ation of fuuds by
those plaeed in positions of trust.
- I -trust that axnongst the o'tber Bis foreshadowed but not epecially mentioned in
His Excelleincy's Address rwill be fourid one
dealing rwith proportional (repreasentation,
w"hich, te my rmind, is the proper and fair
iiýode of electing representatives of elective
bodies. Whilst a member of the Legisîsture o! the province of Ontario I gave this
matter a gret deal of consideration, and
I carn assure honourable gentlemen that
if the Government does not intend to introduce such a Bill, I shahl endeavour to
bring tbe inatter befo-re the House la some
formn.
Another Bihl which I trust is amongest
those foreshedowed la the Speech fromi tbe
Throne is one creating a Divorce Court for
the Dominion of Canada. I do not knoiw
biow far the Federal Government can go in
enacting a law of that kind; but wben wve
find at tbis session of Parliament, as vo
do. that we bave one hundred and twentv
divorce petitions to come before us, there
is an object lesson we should heed,
end by wbich we should profit. We must
remember that in this country divorces
are not only grant-ed by this Parliament,
but tbat there are courts in several of -the
provinces 'wbich have similer powers. Al
divorces are not granted on the saine

ground; it therefore behooves the Dominion
of Canada, if it wants to retain its position in so far ais divorce is conoern-ed, te,
which will be
have a comnion divorce 1a-%v
properly administered by a court created
for that purpose; otherwise we shall find
ourselves in a position similar to that occupied by the Unit-ed States, where, in some
states, divorce has been made so easy that
iti-has -become a public scandai. XVe do
flot want any.thing of that kind to occur
in Canada; and the only way that 1 can
see of preventiing it is by the Federal Parliament dealing with the question.
Honourable gentlemen will concur with
me when 1 express satisfaction with the
progress wvhi-ch has been made in completin- ;thits building, which has enabled us
to use it this session. We ail know that
the committee have done everything possible to hasten -the completion of the work.
While there has been some delay, we know
how difficuit it is to eecure satisfaetory results, and if we go into the mag-nificent
Chamber of the House of Commons we can
readily understand it. I am sure I voice
the opinion of this House wben 1 express
the hope that before next session the building and «ppointments will be complete,
and that we shall then meet in a Chamber
even better than that now occupied by the
Commons.
Before concluding, I desire te cail the
attention of the-House to -the fact, wvhich
is well known to, us ahl, that since we last
met, the Prino of Wales concluded bis
visit* to Canada and bas returned to the
Mother Country. His visit, which wvas a
great suocess vas, to a great extent,
brought about, -as bas been well said, by
the fact that from the day hie landed at
St. John hie establi.shed a relation with the
people as naturul and intimate as exists
in a hap>py liouseliold. There was no suggestion of official restraint or the compulsion of official machinery. His own bearing, of %ivhich hie was unconscîous, drew
aIl classes to his side, and bis own quality
was bis best passport to the -affection of
Canadians. Because bhe bas been here the
,position of tbe Throne is more clearly understood, and its prestige greatly enhanced.
No statesman could have interpreted the
Monarchy as it has been initerpreted by
this modest, smiling, gracious, democratic
young Prince, nor could he have done a
service of bigher or more enduring value
to the British Commonwealth.
I desire to express my regret at the continued illness of our Prime Miriister. He
bas had a hard siege of it. Ail Canadians,

I am not, hewever, sumprised that he should
have acquired such a reputatien, because I
have myself -frequently had occasion le cross
swemds in the arena of political debate with
Hon. Mr. Choquette. In justice, however, I
desire te add that while cemibating with ail
the energy I possessed the opinions of the
bonoumable gentleman and the principles
of the party he repmesented I always found
him te be intensely loyal te our institutiens

provision for a tribunal of the saine character, by w'hichi it wvas hoped to iiaintain the
peace of Europe. There tvas thus a sort
of League of INationis in anticipation. In
these later days writers have published interestirig studies upon the possibility, the
opportunity, and 'the probable degree o!
efflcacy of suoh an institution. What is to
the crédit of Mr. Wilson is that hie gave
concrete form to this idea in placing before

not be so rash as to give a confident answer
to such a question. But if asked what we
might expect froin such a league, 1 should
be inclined to rep.ly, " Neither too much nor
too little.- In presence o! this new in

excessively optimistic or stubbornly pessimistic, it is too soon, it seemns to mie, to
prognosticate with assurance the outeome

powers who deliberated at Versailles were
willing at least to give it a trial. We carnnot do better than follow their example,
and, while hoping- for the best, avoid iflusory expectations on the one band and
equally baseless apprehensions on the

Was not Christianity, as it was known to

MABCH 2, 1920

Another of the paragraphs in thie Speecil
froixi the Throne I desire to discuss briefly.
It is that which is concerned with the question o! re-establishmient o! our returned
soldiers, and o! their returu to or takin.4
Up of agricultural lite. . This latter point
has for me a protouud interest. 1 must say
that it wvas with sentiments of patriotic joy
that I read that 46,630 disbanded soldiers
had made a request ta be settled upon the
land. The Agricultural Gazette o! Canada
in its January numiber inforrns us that
$51,572,332 has already been lent to soldiers
who desired ta engage in agriculture. The
Soldiers' ýSettlernent Board has granted provisional titles ta 869,000 acres o! land in
Of 42,630 disthe Western provinces.
charged men who have applied for certificates authorizing them ta participate in
the benefits o! the legfisiation relating ta
settiement 32,363 have received thern. I
amn aware that tram titis number there wiii
necessarily be some deduction, because al
men are not equally persevering, and there
will be discouragemients and abandonnients.
Bu't if even sixty per cent 'or oniy flfty per
cent o! our soldier farmers remain on the
land such a resuit will be highlly gratifying. It is, you see, a response ta one o!
the most urgent needs of the hour. Ail our
far-sighted economists would seemn ta have
taken as their watchword, "Produce, and
ag-ain produce !" And of ai our products
those o! the farm rank among the miost
necessary. The increase in the cost of living, has become almost a publie calarnity.
It has caused anguîsh to reign in rnany a
household. It haunts like a nighltmnare an
infinite number o! firesides. It wringýs the
heart of many a mnother sud sears with
liues o! care the brow of many a tather. Iu
the preseuce of such a state of tlngs a sudden accession ta the ranks o! the fariniug
conmunity inay be hailed as a national
benefit. The poiicy o! turnuieinobilizýd
soldiers into cultivators o! the szou is oxie
'whichi merits general approbation.. Moreaver, it is a policy which iiay possibly have
been inspired by the noble traditions o!
our early history. Such a policy was put
in operation in Canada two and a hiall
centuries ago. In 1667, in the reigu of
Louis XIV, with Colbert as Chie! Minister
o! the Crown, and with Talon as intendant,
the Governixiext dexnobilized hier soldiers ta
transformi theus into farmers. Permnit mie
ta read ta you a few extracts bearing precisely upan this subject tram a book entitled: "The Colonization o! New France,"
written by -M. Enile Salone, a distinuguished
Freuchnian. We thiere see ixox history re-

is uothing ne~w under the sun. Referring
to the disbanding and settlernent o! the

in civil occupations could not offer a more
consoling aspect.
The economic and financial situation
among the nations, tomn and impoverished
-by the war, is iess satisfactory. In that regard no one will be tenipted to find 'too
sombre the picture drawn -for us in the
speech fromi the Throne, when it describes
the ru-inous conditions ocf exchange, the
lack of international credit, the excessive
circulation of paper money, coinbined wi'th
the scarcity of raw materials. the insufficiency of transports and the labour dificulties. To remedy these evils one hears
repeated on every side that we must increase labour an-d production, and that individurals, like states, must practice saving- and economy. Also, is it flot plain to
vou that this universal precept is universally violated? Since the termination
of the war thiere seems to feign everywhere
a frenzy of pleasure-seeking and a frenzy
of idieness. From the hig-hest to the iowest
i-tmg of the social ladder one -%vitnesses the
same spectacle. Those of the lower cl-asses

this favourable trade balance sufficient i-cason for indulging in a song of triumph. But
it does seem to me that the figures are encouraging, and constitute a f avourable
sy m ptom.
There is another matter which I -would
have discussed at soîne iength if tbe limits

whicli 1 have set for niy discourse had periiitted mie to do se. It is that of the elctoral franchise, with reference to which the
Speech from the Throne bas announiced pro1 will confine myseif

opinion, one of the electoral systemns, the
imost rationa1 and the xnost equitable. the
surest and the inost apt to safeguard the
stability of political institutions, is that
which Belgium enjayed before the war, and
of which the principal traits were propartional representation, age limiit, and plurality of voting. 1 shahl possib]y have occasion again to address the House- on this
subject before the end of the present session.
And now it only remiains to mie to re-echo

and the glory of the Canadiaii Confederation.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, after bearing the very eloquent
speech of the honourable gentleman who bas
seconded the Address, we feel that a very
strong addition bias been nmade to the debating power o! this Chamnber. I wish to
congratulate both the mover and the seconder of the address on their speeches.
They both corne to this Chamber wîth experience in the public life of this country,
and I am. sure that their knowledge and exIjerience wvill be of great henefit te us in our
work.
1%eeting as "'e do in these new buildings,
I think it is pcrhaps fitting that 1 should
refer first of ahl te the cable read by His
Honour the Speaker at the apening on
Thursday last, conveying to this Parliamient
the greetings of His Majesty and good
wishes for our future. It reminds us flot
only of the severeignty which we share in
common with ail parts o! the British Empire, but o! the constant concern of members of the Royal Family for the well-being
and prosperity of this Dominion. We may
recaîl that -when it first became necessary
to flnd a home !Qr the representatîves of the
Dominion the site of our Parliament Buildings was chosen by our late beloved Queen
Victoria. The corner stone of the aid buildin" wvas laid 1- lier son the Prince o! Wales,
afterwards King Edw'ard VII of Eng-land.
The corner stone ot the present building wvas
laid hy Ris Royal Highness the Duke of
Connaught, and that of the Memnorial Tower
by bis Royal Highness, Edward, Prince of
Wales. Freini Confederation down te the
present tinie thie foundation and constructien of our Parliament Buildings have been
intimatelv associated with the Royal Famiiy, and they have shown a keen interest in
the develupmnent e! aur institutions. If anything wcre lacking te bring home to the
minds of the people of Canada a knowledge
ef this lact, it wvas adequately supplied by
His Royal Highness the Prince of W~ales
when hie made bis trip through Canada last
year. His frank and open-hearted manner

2, 1920
of meeting the people aroused a feeling of
mutual affection and respect which we hope
inay ever be maintained.
Meeting as we do to-day in these buildings. which have risen frorn the ashes of the
old building, we recali that the aid building
w'as the resuit of the determination of the
Fathers of Confederation to bring" about
unity and co-operation among' the British
colénies on the North American continent.
May we hope that thîs imposing edifice,
with its dignifled and noble proportions,
will inspire ail those who corne within its
portais to strive to carry on the great work
of bringing more closely together this great
Dominion in bonds of unity and feliowship;
and, further that this country mav. as tirne
goes on, mnaintain its propcr pla'ce arnong
the Dominions of the British Empire, and
more and more be recognized in the councils of the nations of the wvorld as a power
niaking for peace and the iniprovement of
the human race.
XVhen we contemplate the -finished design
of these buildings., \ve realize that the chief
architect, Mr. John Pearson, and his associate, Mr. J. 0. Marchand, have succeeded
in a wonderful way in irnpressing upon ahl
who enter these portais the greatness of the
ideals at which we should be aiming; that
it ia not only for to-day we are wvorking,
but that any action of to-day may have an
influence on the future in a way wve neyer
contemplate. Mr. Pearson'and bis associate,
the members of the Building Committee o!
both Houses, the officiais of the Public
Works Department, and others who have
been entrusted with carrying ont this work
have succeeded in making this building a
standing record of some of the resources of
this country, working into it materiais from
several provinces, thus further exernplifyin- the unity of the whole. It teaches us
that we should try more and more to bring
about unity and gond fellowship throughout
this Dominion o! Canada.
The Speech from the Throne deals with
a mnnber of Gubjeets, principally with tho4se
touching our relations with the outside
worid, only a very snmaîl portion of it being
devoted to the question of the economie
conditions that so seriously affcet the
country at the rpresent time. We are al
pleased to know that peace with Germany
has been succes.sfully completed, and that
we rnay now look forward to a settled condition of the world. At the same time, we
must realize that conditions of urireat prevail
throughout the world, even in this country,
and that it will take us a very long time
to overome themi se that we nmay be able

SENATE

ta carry on the administration in the best
way !possible. The people ai the country
are tu-day beginning- ta realize that, the
work which bas been going on during the
war, and the conditions under .which they
have laboured, have had an effect on the
country and on the finances of the country.
I think it is fair to say that anly lately
has the enormous destruction *wrought in
the world during the years of the war been
brought horne to the people of the country.
What has brought, it home ta them most
clearly is the depreciation cd our currency.
They find that their money is being taken
at a digcount in many of the counitries of
t
he wnrld, and they realize that in order La
overcome that difficulty th-ey will not only
have ta produce mare, but that they will
have te spend less; they realize that it
must be th8ir aim te deal iwitLh cauntries
where their money is acoepted et a more
favourable rate rather than. with the.se
whi-ch are nearest to, thom. This, I think,
will have a tendency te bring together the
-various parts af the Empire. Each will find
out more and more about the resources ai
the other, and -ail will corme iuta closes
relationship in trade. The effect af this
will be of very great benefit flot only ta
Canada but ta ail parts of the Empire.
Conditions brought -about Iby the war
have caused people ta consider expenditures
much more carefully, especially those made

realize that expenditures 'have gat ta be
curtailed. They have learned within the
last few months, for the firat time, ai the
large sums of money required to carry an
the operations ai the Governiment railways.
A short tirne ago it was said tha.t the Governrnent railw'ays 'were costing- the country
$2,000,000 per month ever and above what
wss received in revenue froisi the roads.
That larzre suin does not take into account
the g-reater expense which w,.e may be under when, in addition ta, tihose roads we
already have, we take aver the aperatian
ai the Grand Trumik Railway System.
These figures refer only te actual aperating
expenses; they do not, take into accaunt
the question af impravemeut or betternient;
they do not tke int-o -account any new
construction which the Governient m-ay
,have ta undertake. At present we have nat
the figures te show exactly what those
items have amounted. ta for the past year,
but 'we may be satisfled that when fliey
are taken into account the total wvill be a
very considerable sum. No<w that 'we are
called. upon to provide $115,00O,00O ta pay
the interest on the debt of the country,
lion. Mr. BOSTOCK.

$35,000,00O, for pensions te the nien who
have roturued from the war, and which
we are only taa willing ta pay, -and a large
sum over and abave that for general expeuditures, when we think ai the large
sum of xnoney spent upon our railways,
ndsiah, if ,properly managed, should -be
bringing in a revenue instead ai causi ng
an extra expenditure for operating expenses, we will have cause for serious consideration. A6 time goes an I thin< tha.t
the people cd the country will scan closely
this large exp>enditure-.
We know from. the press that -an agreement was submitted ta the shareholders
af the Grand Trunk Railway Company,
aud that it was accepted by them, but a.s
yet vwe have not seen it. Last year, in the
dying days ai the session, we were called
upon ta put through a Bill .for the acquisitien of. that railway, without having an
opport.unity of eeeing 4the full details aif the
agreement that was ta be made with the
conipany. We had ta act on the faith that
the agreement -would be a satisfactary one
in the interests ai Canada. We expect now
that.the Government -will bring that agreement down te the House without further
delay, and that we shall have an opportunîty a& studying it and seeing- whetiher oT
flot aur hoýpes in that reg-ard have been
realized.
In years gone by we always expected
that the Speech from the Throne would
mention the legislation that the Gavernment intended ta ask Parliament ta deal
with during the session, but the information cantained in the Speech i rom the
Throne is very meagre iu that respect.
Last sessian the Speech from the Throne
said nathing at ail about the purchase ai the Grand Truuk railway, and
the legialation was not brought down
until lhe members ai bath Houses expected that they would very shortly be
disinissed and allowed ta returu ta their
homes. I hope that the fact that very
littie leg-islation is meutioned in the Speech
from the Throne au this occasion does not
mean that legislatian is going ta be sprung
upon us iii the saine w-ay; and 1 trust that
we shahl nat be asked ta deal with questions which have not been announced ta the
country, and which the cauntry has nat
had an apportunity ai thoroughly studying
before they are ta becaîne law.
Iu a cauntry as large as the Dominion ai
Canada it is mast important that propased
legcisiation should be aunouuced in the
Speech irom the Throne sa that the people,
as weIl as the representatives ai the people

MARCH 2, 1920
and the members of this Chamiber, way
have an opportunity of carefully considering and understanding what the policy af
the Government is to be. Unfortunateiy,
owing to the war, and owing to the necessities af the conditions in which we have
faund ourselves during the last iew years,
this systemn has not been adhered to as
closely as it should have heen in the interests of the country. The safeguards that
aur constitution gives us are such that they
should be carefully adhered to. It is ta be
hoped that, from this time on, naw that we
are in a periad ai reconstruction and are, 1
might almost say, 'wholly rebuilding the
affairs of the country, we will adhere more
closely to the safeguards and checks whieh
have been provided in the past ta properiy
protect the interests of the people and to
ensure fair play and justice thraughaut the
country.
The Speech from the Throne refera ta a
Franchise Bill. The Liberal party has always maintairied that it is very much more
in the interests ai the peopie that the lists
should be made up by the local aut.horities
in the variaus provinces. It is maintained
that the men called upon ta make up the
lists in that way have a very much hetter
knowledge ai the people and 'the country,
and are therefore able ta compile the lists
in very much better shape than men brought
in from ather parts ai the country, and who
are asked ta deal with a situation ai which
they have possibly no local knowledge. In
I885, when the franchise was the subject
ai a great deal ai discussion in this cauntry,
the Liberals objected ta the proposai which
was made ta adopt a system of revising barristers. The system was adopted, and the
Franchise Act which was passed at that
time remained, and elections were held
under it until 1896. Shortly aiter the Ljberal party caine inta power in 1896 they reverted ta a system ai provincial and municipal lisa, and elections were heid under
that system fram that time until the Wartime Elections Act ai 1917 was passed. I
do flot think that the changes that were
nmade in 1917 would be ai advantage ta the
country at the present time; and I hope,
when the Franchise Bill cornes before us
with ail its terrns and conditions, we shahl
find that the Government has gone back ta
the system which prevailed prior to 1917.
In the country ta-day there is a great deal
oi criticism ai the hig-h cast af living. The
high cost ai living is being brought home
ta the people-more and more as the prices
af goads which they require advance from

lu

tinie ta time. Towvards the end ai the
session ai 1919 the Gavernment braught
down ta this Hause a Bill establishing a
Board ai Commrrerce. That hoard has been
operating for samne tiine. Honourable gentlemen wilI reinher that when the Bill
establishing that board was brought down
ta the House exception wvas taken ta it an
the ground that we had not had time ta
consider the importance ai such a measure
at 'such a late date in the session. We did
not have an apportunity ai fuily considering the details and understanding the
powers that were given ta the commissioners. 1 think the criticism we hear ai the
action of the board, and ai the Government
in estabiishing the board, show that the
hurried passing ai suoh legislation is not
wise. The other day the board acted in a
way which, an the face ai it, seemed very

made in the papers that from a certain day
the board wouid cease ta contrai the price
ai sugar. The statement was made in the
press that the board consider that they
had saved the country $100,000 a day for
the period d.uring which they had been controliing the price ai sugar; yet, in spite ai
that, the Government allowed them ta
rescind the order. It was made ta appear
that this action was taken because t.hey had
been subjected ta criticism which they apparently did not think was fair. If the
board was daing its duty ta the country
and was saving the public the amount ai
maney it bas heen represented that they
were saving", it is most extraordinary- that
the Government should allow them ta act
as they did. What they did appeared ta be
the act ai a child who did nat appreciate
bis duties or responsibilities ta the country. They did not seem ta realize that
the menibers ai a board ai this nature miust
expect ta be criticised, and that their oniy
defence wouid be a justification ai thae
action they had taken, and ta show the
country that what tbey were doing was in
the best interests ai the people. To-day
they occupy the position ai having thrown
up their hands and taid the country that
because they have been criticised, they are
nat prepared ta ga an and do their duty tawards the people in cantrolling the price
ai sugar in the country. I think wve should
have an explanation fram the Government
in regard ta this matter. Sugar is one ai
those things that touches very elosely the
pockets ai the people, and enters into their
lives ahmost mare than any other article of
food that they use. I think the Govern-

The Address which is before this Cbamiber for consideration has been deait with
by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Botock) in a temperate and reasonable way,
to which I can take no exception whatever.
This is the third session since the Armistice of Novemiber 11, 1918, was entered
into. At each of the preceding sessions we
indulged the hope that, the war being
over, civilization would at once settle
down in the normal channels of peace.
and that the world, forgetting the terrible
holocaust throughi which it liad passed for
five years, would niot onlv cultivate the
arts o! peace, but leave no hurnnmeanz

forces will naturally rua their course of
human license before they settie down to
anything like esiablished government. Even
in the countries of the Allies there are to
be found conditions of unrest and disturbance that also must necessarily run their
course, and cannot by any system of law
be suppressed. Until the disturbing forces
set in motion by the war more or leas exhÉust themselves through the various channels in which to-day they are finding expression, we shall have to face these conditions.
In Great Brîtain, in the overseas Dominions, and in the United States the
people are suffering to-day fromn the abnormal conditions that constitute the afterrnath
of the war. Markets have been destroyed;
great systems of production and trade have
heen wiped out. New channels of trade
must be buîlt up; new international relations must be sought, cultivated and established. Labour, owing te many causes,
bas hecome restless and uncertain, and so
varying in its demands that the unrest
and disturbances are seriously reflected in
ail the areas of production. Production of
the wor1d's necessary commodities has
been and is seriously handicapped by the
many causes that have led to the difflculty,
and often the impossibility of securing raw
materials, in addition to the untold difficulties of producing the ifinisbed. product;
hence, to-day the great arteries of trade
are seriously impeded. Trqde, in its widest
sense, is seriously battling with almost
overwbelming obstacles to release itself
from tbe forces that are yet taking a
strangle-hold on its freedom. Canada is
not exempt from this world dislocation of
trade brought about by five years of war.
WThen we consider the causes that have
led te these conditions, it is not difficult
to understand why this should be the case.
It is easier to pull down thaii to build up.
It took nearly five years to alinost destroy
a civilization that took centuries to build;
an~d now that for the hast fit teen rnoilths wve
liave faced a world wrecked by the greatest
war tiot ever cursed a smiling- earth, it is
nedless to say that it is going to take time
ýind ur.precedented human enterprise anîd
eîiêer-y to build up what man has so ruthlessly rent asunder.
Under these circumstances governmeiî., .s
being carried on. Under such circumstances it is of vital importance that a
governiment, charged with national responsibilities that transcend in consequence and
importance the duties cast upon any former
government, should receive a proper recn-ijition of its efforts and achievements. My

March 2, consideration of the motion for
an Address in reply to His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening
of the Session.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAN-D:
able gentlemen, I desire first to congratulate the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Chapais) who has been called to this Chamber to occupy the seat for the Granville
division. It has been my pleasure and advantage te follow the career of the honourable gentleman since hie has been in public life, as it is about the saine ieng-th of
time that we have both been interested in
public affairs. His selection sipeaks welI
for his high standing in our community.
I confess that when a vacancv occurred in
our province, 1 feared the present Govcrnment, net knowing the province of Quehec,
liad fine chances out of ten of g-oing astray.
Fortunately the present Cabinet hiad Iseard,
as they couid not lielp hearing. of the honourabie gentleman and his splendid record.
If I am net mistaken, the honourable
member for Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais>
could have corne into this Chamnber about
three years ago. Rumour has it that he
wvas offered a seat. which he respectfully
declined because there was couoiled with
it the offer of a portfolio. If his refusai at
the time is a fact which canniot be contreverted, I doubly congratulate him for having declined te conipiy with the condition
which was attached to the offer of a seat
in this Chamiber; for the province of Quebec has spurned representation in this
sharn Union Governmient.
Last sumiiner a newspaper stated that Sir
Robert Borden, who Nvas navi2atinz the

which I intend to put on record, býecause

The Gazette annouaced racently that Sir Rabert Bordea desired ta give Our proviace its just
share of represeatation la lis cabinet, but that
lie was prevented fromn dolag so because of thÏe
fact that the Frencli-Canadians lad at the election of 1917 rejected ail lis candidates. Ia the

last session stated la the Upper House that If
the Frendli-Canadians were witliaut representation in the aîinistry the fault lay at the door
of their chiefs, wbo had been invited to jola

clear that our province was goiag to drive out

The chief of the Coaservative party could no

1 have said that we are ta-day facing a
sham Union Goverrnent. Wheni the idea
of a Union Governiment was first mooted by
Sir Robert Borden, hie went ta a nuiinher
of the leaders of the Liberal party and affered thema an opportunity ta jain in the

w-as the answer whichi lie received frorn
these g-entlemen? It will be remembered
that they came ta Ottaw a ta confer upon the

were the financiers in Canada who thought
it was a rnos' imprudent and most dangerous policy ta pursue and that it would
croate a difficuit condition and cause violent
recriminations in the collection of the Incarne Tax. Thiey ivere answered that that
wvas the only way ta ensure the success of
the *blans. My honourable friend has
boasted of the last boan, $700,000,000 which
was taken up by the people of Canada. I
would ask him to reflect and consider
whether that last loan, which was not made
free from impost, is not a full condemnation af the previaus loans, and of the previaus policy iollowed by the Minister of
Finance?
WVhat was that policy based upon? It
wvas a policy whichi allowed wealthy people
ta invest their rnoney in boans which. would
f ree them from the incarne tax. WVhat was
it based upon, if not a distrust af the
people? There was a patriotie duty ta parfornm, and instead of going squarely ta the
people and telling thema that thay should
take the boans of the Goveriaint at 5à1par
cent, they lured them ta it by the exaînption front taxation. The people gave the
Governinent a lessoxi in patriatism by subscribing $700,000,000 last autumnii without
that exemption. To iny mind the truc test

iny opinion the real test is ta be found in

might meet our yearly obligations. I arn
convinced that the present Cabinet wili,

My honourable friend spoke with glee
of the last loan of $700,000,000; I think at the
sanie tirne of the $38,500,000 interest upon
it the country will annually be called upon
to, pay. As I said last session, 1 arn convinced that the taxpayers of this country
will have to be bled to the tune of $200,000,ON0 in additional taxation in order to meet
our yearly expenditure. WVe have heard no
announcement, either in the Speech front

Then, in order to show the chaotic condition of the Cabinet, the writer goes further

This is delightf ut irony. The Govcrnnient will have ne candidate in those three
constituencies, but wvill try to win on its
fiscal policy. It wilI not show its face; it
will rely upon the Opposition carrying its
colours to victory.
Now, what is the fiscal policy that is
spoken of? Is it thet high tariff of the
Cockshutt wing of the Conservative party,
the low tariff of the Calder group, or the
moderato tariff of the Meighien-Winnipeg

in those three conistituencies; yet, their
policy wvi11 be there. It is important that
the people should be told what the policy
is, as there may be so many candidates that
the people wilI be at a loss to know what
candidate they should vote against. I may
informi my horiourable friends on the other
side that Quebec is not just now much concerned with the policy o! the present Government; it has decided to vote against
thîs sham Union Government. The ToryUnion Government must atone for its sins.
The Tory party in 1911, by denying themn
reciprocity, bronght the western farmers
into the political field. The Tory party bedevilled the province o! Quebec in 1911 by
subsidizing the Nationalists and by constantly traducing it tbereafter. The ToryUnion Government aroused the farmers of
Ontario by violating their pledge not to
conscript their sons. Here is a statemient
by Sir John Willison, a pillai of the Unionist temple, on the situation in Ontario,
contained an editorial in the Montreal
Star o! October 28. A!ter explaining that
prohibition had much to do with the defeat
o! the Hearst Government in the cities
and towns, he goes on to say:

to the Ontario farinera. And k-indly note

The bonourable gentleman wvho moved the
Address (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) spolie of the
new national status of -Canada-o! our increased autonomy resulting fromn our becoiing a member of the League of Nations.
Last year the Governmient boasted that by
Order in Council they appointed their own
representatives to the Peace Conference.
They claimed that we had thus made a step
forward in the developmnent o! our national
status. I stated that if the present Government had passed an Order in Council
naming representatives to the Peace Conference and had sent that Order in Council
direct to the King to be approved by him,
and if those representatives had been a ppointed by him without consulting his
Imperial Cabinet, 1 would recognize in that
fact a considerable advance in our national
statua, but I feared that the -Canadian
Cabinet had been obliged to act through
the British Cabinet, the immediate advisera o! the King. When the correspondence was brought down, I found that as a
matter of fact the Order 1h Council had
bee.n sent to the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd
George, and hie had been pleased to submit
it to His fMajesty tbe King for his signature.* To my mind this does not prove that
our autonomy has been enlarged. We remain as we were. The British constitution
is an unwrîtten one; ours is a written one
and we înust act within the four corners
o! it.

I read last year a statement wbichi bad

important function field in the city of

hiear these words, which to bis great surprise were applauded by the heir to the
throne, the present King George. Here are
Sir Wilfrid's words:

on the surface of thinge, this mnay flot

does flot alter the truth of hie statement. The

when our Canadian Parliament wili claim doequal rights with the British Parliamnent, and
when thie only tiee binding us together will be
a same flag and a sme Crown.
Ta hear my hanourable iriends from the
ather side, and their leaders, it would aeem
that we bad reached the stage at wbicb. we
cauld dlaim that we were no langer a dependency, but a sister nation and that we
exercised ca-equal rights with the Imperial
Parliament. I still believe tlîat we are in
the same condition as wve were in 1867, for
I find in the Votes and Praceedings of the

Then conies the amendnîent itseIf, whicb

aperate and be deenîed ta have operated
extra-territc.rially according ta ils intention
in the likze manner and ta the saine effect
as if enacted by the Parlianient af the

Hanourable gentlemen, I soe nothing
altered in aur status. We are stili dependent upon the Imperial Parlianient for the
exercise af any power which w-e do not find
in tbe Blritish North America Act. It seenîs
ta nie that the Cabinet, flushed with pride
at Canada having attained national status

by being" represented un the League of Nations, rnighît wvell have passed an Act declaring that the Parlianient ai Canada, hav-

ing co-equal rights with the British Parlianient, "enacts as follows" and might have
sent the Bill for approval to the other aide,
tlîus creating a precedent. Now is the time,
if ever, for this Canadian Parliament and
the Dominions at large to claini co-equal
rights ivith the British Parliament, recagnizing a comman king, but no subservient
or dependent situation. This 'bas not been
done, and I regret it, because it seemis ta
me, with the feeling now prevalent in Great
Britain that the Dominions must no longer
occupy the position of mere colonies, but
shouHd be sister nations, we ought to have
been able to obtain recognition of our
equality and of aur full nationhood.
Hon. RUFUS H. POPE: Honoura>le gentlemen of the Senate, I have listened attentively ta the honaurable gentleman who bas
just taken bis seat. I think it unfortunate,
as 1 have previously atated, that members
of this hanourable body do not refrain from
participating in party caucuses. I observe
that the Liberal party held a caucus the
other day. Even if 1 had not read of that
political caucus I s'hould have learned of
it by listening toi the speeches of the Hon.
Mackenzie King and others, the day before
yesterday, and hy listening to the speeches
of the Liberal Senatora in this House. The
speeches were ail of the same type. I say
it woùld be much better for this House to
stand absolutely, or to a great degree, independent of those party affiliations, especially if, as the honourable member for
Delarimier (Han. Mr. Dandurand) states,
the parties in the other House do not represent anything. In that case we do not want
to be associated witb thiem. In view of the
dignity and independent position af the
Senate af Canada, its meinhers should not
engage in political or party strife.
The honourable gentleman started off
with the complaint that the Frençh Cinadians ai the province froin which we both
came have not the representation they ought
ta have in the Cabinet. Then he read in
French a very long statement, which my
imperfect education, 1 amn sorry to say, prevented me fromn closely following. A fewv
moments later he inforied us that the
present Cabinet and the Union Government,
or the sa-called Unîonist party, were not
sufficiently attractive for the province of
Quehec ta think af associating with thern.
If the hanourable gentleman trulv represents bis province, as lie dlaims, and if
sncb is still the sentimient of Quebec. I
shauld like ta know îvhat practical schemýe
the bonourable gentlemîan proposes in order that the French Canadians of Quebee

SENATE

26

may find representation in a Cabinet whicli
hie says is not attractive and is unworthy
of that great branch of the Canadian familv.
if I did not misunderstand the honourable gentleman, he stated that in 1917 the
French Canaëlians were flot represented in
the Cabinet, but hie is aware that we went
to the people with two French Canadian
memibers of the Cabinet, Hon. Mr. Sevigny
and Hon. Mr. Blondin. Their fate was the
fate of polîtical parties in time of great
strife or stress. Well do I remember the
National party under Mr. Mercier, of whom
the honourable gentleman was a follower.
He was the father of the National party in
the province of Quebec long before R. L.
Borden was thought of in the public life
of Canada. Well do I remember the keenness of that struggCle which resulted in that
honourable gentleman having not a single
English-speaking representative in the local
House at Quebec. The honourable member
for DeLorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will
agree that such a situation was not due to
ill-will or a desire to deprive any one of bis
constitutional rigbits and privileges, but
was simply the result of an election. And
whiat hiappened? A way wvas niiade for Col.
Rhodes in Megantic county, because we desired to have a representative in the provincial cabinet; not because we believed in
that cabinet, not tbat we were in agreement
with Mercier and his National sentiment,
but because we thought the English-speaking people of the province of Quebec should
have at least one representative in the
Government. And Col. Rhodes remained
in the Governument until defeat.
It was unfortunate tbat wben the Union
Governumient was bein.- formied, the offer of
a fifty-fifty arrangemient %.vasrefused by the
bite lairiemted Sir Wilfrid Laurier and those
associated with hinii. It was unfortunate for
the province of Quebec, and I shaîl ever
feel that that rigbht bionourable. gentleman
iiissed a great opportunity to unite the
p)eople of Canada wl-ben hoe declined to make
whatever personal sacrifice was called for
and to enter tbe Cabinet which %vas at that
tinie being formied for flic prosecution of
the war. Tbe attitude whiich lie tben took
created a certain sentiment in our province,
and naturally his advice was followed.
Honourable gentlemen, permit me to say
tbat in this bouse, as well as outside, I amn
known as a Liberal Conservative, and the
ideals and traditions of the Liberal Conservative party are as sacred to nie as the
ideals and traditions of any other persons
are to tbem, no inatter wvhat language thiey
speak, aud wbile I deeincd it my (lut V to
Hon. IMr.

r'Ori:

give to the Union party when it -%,zs formed,
and to this UJnion Govp.rnment, in the interest of unity and the prosecution of the
war, ail the support and influence I possessed, yet I do flot feel that I have forsaken a single one of my principles or
ideals. And, honourable gentlemen, 1 will
go further and say that if Union Government can make good, if they can do as
gréat things and can go forward as fearlessly, regardless of popularity and party
polities, in peace time as they did during
the war, they will stili have my support,
although I amn a Liberal Conservative. As
president of the Eastern Townships Liberal
Conservative Association, which bas its
ramifications in nine or ten counties, 1 arn
calling the members of that association together at a very early date. We did xiot
meet during the war period, hecause the
Prime Minister of Canada said that political matters and political organization
should not be taken Up during the war.
In 1917, -wben the writs were issued, w-e
met and decided to take no part iii the
elections. The members of the org-anization were to have a free hand. 1 went mv
way as I saw fit, and others, of a different
nationality, went their way as they saw fit,
and now that that strife is over, now that
that difficulty la passed, I see no reason
why we should not bury any hard feelings
that may have been eng-endered.
But my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)> says we are not fighting the byelections, but are putting up independent
candadates to fight them on principles and
ideals,

and hie does not understand

that.

1 ar n ot surprised that dyed-in-the-wool
Liberals like my honourable friend cannot
understand. It is because they neyer liad
any principles or ideals, neyer fouglit for
any, and do flot know anytbing about tbemii

Any set of ideals and principles that thcy
ever published at any of their confercuces
were violated and throwvn inito the scrap
basket wlien the opportunity arose to put
themi into force. My honourable friend is
astonished and surprised, and 1 syvmp-atliize
witb Iim iii b is miserable condition. 'But,
gentlemen, I arn not the keeper of the Governmient. Whiether or not thev shall go
forth to fight these by-elections, it is not
for me to say; but if they do go forth,
armed with principles and ideals, I venture
to say that they will corne back liaving,
wvon some victories.

spoke of "'apopular candidate," " a popular party," " a popular policy "-about the
only thing that seemed ta be considered was
the securing o! something -"papular." The
honourable gentleman knows how many
nights and days hie spent striving ta conceive something " papular " ta give ta the
unfortunate party ta which hie belonga. He
warked diligently, hanestly, and well. Having got one of the moat charminz men in
the wirld, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a man o
universal popularity, ta lead thern, the party
started down the track under a f ull head of
steam, and away thsy went until 1911, when
the whole load o! popularity was dumped.
They should have built upou ideals aud

that, although the information has been
asked for in Parliarnent rnany tirnes. Why
is it flot given? Prices, both of exports and
imports, are four tirnes what they were
formerly, and the quantity of t.rade looks
large because it has been rnultiplied by the
very highi cost of the articles. Until the
articles whieh we favourably produce in
this country are produced at a low rate, our
trade can neyer legitiniately expand. The
countries that will take our products are
those that have becorne destitute, and have
been deprived o! their money. They wvill buy
in the cheapest markets, or froiîn any country that will give themn credit in the hope
of being repaîd some day. We have given
credit and have established trade by this
artificial nieans, but that will nlot be permanent. It is by the production of articles
of intrinsic value and hy the production M!
articles at a moderately lowv prîce. or a
shall
competitive price, that w%%e expand oui
trade in the mnarkets of the world. I say
that statements of that kind, no matter how
elaborately or skilfully prepared, are entirely delusive; that they do not afford a
just view of the resources or the operations
o! the country, and that they must be analyzed, if they can be analyzed, and show
what articles are being exported, what
articles imported, and hov tlie articles that
we produce mnay be exchanged for those we
imnport. Trade can be establishied oniy along
those legitimiate lines.
The honourable leader of the Governmnent
in the House (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
felicitated himself, and urged it as a proof of
the popularity of thc' Government and the
confidence of the people in it, that huge
loans hiad been acquired fromi the people of
Canada. I shal tnt at ail speak of the
meuans bv whichi these boans were acquired.
The last boan wvas for $700,000,000. Thie iniister thoughit it was a subject for jubilation

Mr. Lloyd George yesterday announced
that it wvas a mistake to hiumiliate Gerinany. Two or three years ago Russia "as
our ally; later Russia was our enemay and
we fought against lier. Sorne two or three
sessions ago I made a rernark sornewhat
along these lines, and was derided for it

British statesmen realize that Russia will
be rehabilitated, and that she will be our
greatest enerny in the future. and they are
striving to build up a great barriei in
Gerrnany to repel any invasion.
So rnuch for what we have acquired: our
political status, and, as a last resort whien
ail other things were illusory and ephemieral, peace. I1 pass from these topics.
When honourable gentlemen reflect upon

occurs to you to make some rernarks which
your friends and other persons may read.
While there have been good men ail about,
the lower provinces are not represented in
the Cabinet. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island are without representation. Where is the security of the
Union Government if they cannot take in
representatives of some of these provinces?
The Government must have considered them
of no use, or would not have them, or else
the Government was af raid to open up the
constituencies. It is of littie use for us to
speculate as to what the nation is thinking
of, but I tell you that if there were an election to-morrow-not that I wish itý-the opponients of the Government would sweep
this country. I could refer you to men, some
of themn under this very roof, who would tell
you the saine thing.
Reference bias been made to the debt of
Canada. The question is, how are %v-e going
to pay it? As the president of a bank, once
said, unless you have money in the bank,
you cannot take money out. 1 agree with
the honourable gentleman from. Halifax
(Hon. AMr. Roche) that our currency can be
restored to a gold basis only by economy
and by progress in developinent. Look at
the mniddle man to-day. Coal is now being
sold at $20 a ton, and if this were the timne
and the place, I could tell you soniet.hing of
%vhat is going on in this respect. And the
price of $20 is for a short ton, 2,000 pounds.

watchword is - Canada." 1 wvill ixot I>e led
astray by any highfalutin cries iu favour
of this person or of that. We are entering
upon a new era. Ireland bias two Parliaments; Scotland is looking for a Parliament now; the Church of England is disestablished in Wales. What is the meaning
of thisP It means that people want to govern. themnseives and nlot be controlied by
oty~rs. In Canada we have no democracy,
but there is a great -deal of extravagance.
Money is spent freely and easily, for it
consista only o! pieces of paper. It la said
that the wealthy people mnuet be rewarded.
Politica is just a game, as it hias always
been. But there is a higber plane. The
world la dissatisfied. The people are biecoming educated. by means of the press,
which is the greatest missionary we have
to-day. Through the press the people may
obtaîn a fair education. In the Illustrated
London News, for instance, you may learn
something of central Africa and the nmanners and customs of the people there.
Twenty or thirty years ago we used to hear
of the Mountain of the Moon, îvith an elevation of, I think, 6,000 feet. There are
28,000,000 people there, and they can grow
anything fromn strawberries, to cotton, and
now there is a raiiway running through
te Cairo. How can you, with your high
prices, compete with wbeat that will cost
5 cents a bushel? How can you compete
with cotton that costs alrnost nothing?
You must remember that John Bull is
pretty clever. For instance, hie lias turned
over to us the Grand Trunk, raiiway.
As my honourable friend bias pointed
out, our debt is now two billion dollars
as a resuit of the war. and the cost of living is higher than ever. Prices must be
brought down in somne way or there will be
a revolution lu this country. If yau crush
down the poor people anid they sec John
Brown, who is no botter than themiselves,
i'iade Lord Brown, or whatever it mav bie,
and they will say that no consideration lias
been given to themnsclves and their families.
This is what la going on in ail classes of
Society.

we under Confederation?" Our ideal was

He said: May I say, by way ai explanatian ai that motion, that it Nvas thie opinion
ai the Committee on Selection that this
committee should act tentatively, pendincthe organization ai the restaurant %vhen
the new quarters are comI)leted. 1 intend
ta inave. when we have dispased ai the

Houses be appainted ta deal with the quertian ai the new restaurant -when it is coinpleted. Ba far as the building and eqipment are concernied, the restaurant wilI

ACOCOMMODATION OF SENATORS IN
. HOUSE 0F COM0ONS.
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RUFUS POPE: H-lnourablo gentlemen, 1 rise to a question of privilege. I
was very niueli surprised yesterday aiternoon, on entering the lobby af the House of
,Camions, ta be told by the doorkeeper
that the rule of the Speaker prevented iny
admittance. , I %vas infarmed that no senatar might enter at that doarway. I refer
ta the space, in front af the Conunons
Chaniber, icading ta the lobby ta the left,
behjnd the Governinent side af the House.
I do nat know how narraov an interpretation
niay be placed upon the clearly written
article af our Constitution which. praelaims
that Parlianient consists of two Houses,
naniely, the House of Gommons and the
Senate. I consider that a broad and reasonable interpretation of that particular
article of the British North America Act
would include niembers of the Senate as
well as members of the House of Commons
as being entîtled ta i ree entry inta any of
the lobbies in and around Parliament. I
mjention this matter because I think the
order af His Honour the Speaker of the
blouse of Comnions indicates too narraw
an interpretation and one that should nat
Personally, as you are

aware, Mr. Speaker and honourable gcntlemien, mny knowledge of the rules and regulatians af Parliament is nat wvhat it ought
ta *be, considering the numnber of years I
liave been loafing about the foot af the
Throne. That, of course, is ioiy own fault.
But I think it would be desirable for this
Hanse ta take sartie action ta provent the
recurrence ai such an unfortunate and uncoinfortable situation as I %vas placcd in
yesterday.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
suggest, hanourable gentlemen, the desirability ai there being a clear understandîng
between the twa Houses as ta what the
privileges ai a member ai Parliainent should
be with regard ta the lobbies ai either
House. I amn unaware ta what extent the

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

34

order proiulgated hy the House of Coninions is effective. It inay be that the lobby
behind the Thronc and the lobby in front
ef the entrance te the Flouse of Conimons,
because of the open grill-werk. are regarded

as part of the floor of the House.

I do flot

*know whether that is the case or not, but
if it is, it seeins to "me to ho a very radical
departure fromn the privilege which was

extended particularly te members ef this
House in the old Parliainent Buildings.
There is ne reason why there should be a
stricter rule enforced against the visit of
a Senator to the lobbies of the House of
Conunons than previously. It is very desirable that good relations should exist between the two Houses, becajîse waee
rules inay be passed by the House of Coinmens, if they operate as a restraint upon
senators, will prohably beo duplicated in
this House, se that si-milar rules rnay
operate equally by way of restraint upon
the members of the lIeTuse of Commions.
1 arn not suggestingHon. Mr. POIRIER: Der ta,,.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 amn not
suggesting reprisais in any sense. but it is
desirable that we should have unif'ormity,
to say the Ieast.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Reciprocity.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: M-Nav I
therefere suggest that His Honour the
Speaker of the Senate take up the
matter with His Honour the Speaker ef
the House of Commions, se that there may
ho a goed understanding as between both
Hou-ses and a mutuality of privileges.
Hon. FREDERIC NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, w~hile this matter is under
discussion I would lilke to draw% the attention of the lieuse te the tact that the seating arrangement of the Senators' gallery in
the House ef Commons permits ct only
twenty seats. On erdinarv occasions twenibn imin
ty seats may ho ample, b)ut
portant debate is in pregress. miany Senators who take an interest in the leg-isiation
which is hein- discussed and are anuxieus
te learn at first hand the viewpoint of the
Commoners, would be quite unable te attend in the gallery reserved for themi in
order te listen te the dehate instead ef readIf
ing about it next day in Hansard.
seems te me that twenty chairs in the
gallery space provided in the new House
of Commons are altogether tee small a pro1
portionL te be allotted te the Senate.

of the House that His Honeur the Speaker

ADDRESS IN REPLY.

The Senate resumed from. Wednesday,
March 3, consideration of the motion fer
an Address in rely te His Excellency the
Governer General's Speech at the opening
ef the Ses-sion.

Hen. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Heneurable
gentlemen, in asking your indulgence fer
a short time this atternoon, may I say that
I have decided to niake some remarks because At appears te me that this is about
the only opportunity the memibers ef this
Heuse have ef speaking on certain subjects. In the other Chamber we had at
least two eppertunities, and sometimes a
third.
My first intention was te confine my
remarks almost entirely te twe questions:
one et these is the agrarian mevement in
this country and the entry ef farmers inte
pelitics, and I was presumptueus enough
te intend te discuss, as the second questien, the machinery ef this honourable
body. But atter listening te my hionourable friend frem De Loriinier <Hon. 'Mr.
Dandurand) yesterday, I decided it %vould
ho necessary for me te mnake a fewv ether
remarks before entering upon the discussion of the subject on which I had made
sonme preparatien.

There seems te have been since the beginning ef this session a concerted action
te abuse-Il do net think that is tee streng, a

werd-the present Union
Geverniment.
Since I entered this House I have learned
te respect very highly the ahility et the
heonourable gentleman who speke yesterday.
I have a very higli appreciatien of his
mental qualities. I have aIse found him
a very amiable man. Se yesterday I had
te conclude that something was wrenigthat nîiy honourable friend -%vas net exactly

normal. He is in my *estimation too big a
man to make such a criticism as hie made
yesterday; and as a physician I have
diagnosed his case. I àm sorry the honourable gentleman is not here. He wvas suifering from a sluggish liver and a very disordered spleen. II have made this prognosis, however: hie would make a very
rapid recovery, and I have no doubt that
my honourable friend is to-day back in bis
normal physical and mental condition.
1 said. there seemed to be a concerted
action to abuse the Union Government and
to criticise adversely the work that it did,
and es;pecially to critîcise Sir Robert Borden. I have no brief for Sir 'Robert, nor
doe, hoe need to ha defended by me, and
I trust that any remarks of mine will be
considered as coming from niyself only. I
have watched Sir Robert Borden pretty caref ully and, although I have tried to think
back to the very beginning, 1 do nlot k-now
of any mistake that he made in the conduct of the war. From the criticism to
which I listened in the other House and
the criticism made yesterday in this Chamber it does seemn to me that the members of
the Opposition in the House of Commons
and the members of the Opposition-if it
may be termed an Opposition-in this
House absolutely forget that for four or
five years we were carrying on a war. They
talk about the immense debt and about our
ministers being away from Parliament 'and
off in Europe; but 1 would remind those
honourable members that there has been a
war-a very severe war, and if our debt
bas increased and if there is unrest in this
country to-day, these effects may be attributed largely to the events that have
been occurring tbroughout the world, particularly in the belligerent countries in
Europe, diiring the last four or five years.
The unrest whichi undoubtedlv does exist
is not confined to Canada. -I think I am
within the bounds of truth in saying that
unrest is prevalent ail over the world. But
let nie confine my remiarks to this country.
There is unrest amongst the soldiers. How
could it be otherwise, honourable gentlemen' Five liundred thousand young men
went overseas fromn this country to preserve
our libert.y-in fact, I may say, to preserve
our very selves. There are present in this
House to-day men who have experienced
the loss of sons. When we consider for a
moment thle trials to wbich. our men %vere
subjected during the war, not only in the
trenches, but elsevhere, is it any wonder
that there is unrest among the soldiers at
present? To my mind if could not be other-

wise, and what surprises me is not that
there is unrest, but the fact that there is
not a great deal more unrest than at present.
And what about the people who stayed at
home? 'It may safely be said that there
is scarcely a bamlet in thîs great country
of Canada that bas not feît the trying conditions of the wvar. Those who did not;
bave husbands or sons or brothers over
there certainly had iriends wvhose relatives
wvére overseas. In my own little town we
bave lied a number of sad cases. One in
particular is that of a woman wbo sent
three sons te the war; tbey are ail buried
iin Flanders.
The point I wish to make is
that, as not only the soldiers who have
r turned, but also many other people, have
been affected by the war, we could not expect conditions te be normal.
-My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) told us yesterday that Quebec
would vote agaînst Union Government.
That was brand new information toi us,
surely; if was sometbing we did nlot expect.
A great deal bas been said about the
money which we have expended and the
amount we have borrowed. Reference bas
been made to the fact that the public debt
of Canada bas increased from $350,000,000
to $2,000,0O0,000. That is not strange.
Does any one think that war can be carried
on for any length of time without very
greatly increasing the public debt?
We
have beard complaints, both here and in
the other House, because of the large
amount of money that bas been raised in
Canada. Over and over again, it bas been
stated that the Government had lost the
conifidence of the people. If that is so, if
seems most peculiar that they sbould bave
been able to raise the large amount of
money they did.
My bonourable friend from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Roche) yesterday asked what wve had
got in return for the moriey expended. He
said:
We spent t7wo thousand millions of money;
we gave the services of five hund-red thousand
men, ân-d, what was more precious. sacrificed
the lves of sixty thousand mien.
What have
we got In ratura?

I must say that if neyer occurred to me
that we antered the war expectîng t0 gain
anytbing. [l ami sure that wben Parliament

ta destroy the peace of the world. This
tyrant comnienced operations by attacking
littie Belgiuîn, and later aroused the indigýiiatioi1 and anger of nearly ail cix ilized
nations by orderîng the sinking of ships,
Mlus causing drawning of innocent women
and children. In August, 1914, Sir Riobert
Borden-I do not think lie waited for a
meeting of Parliament-at once cabled ta
the Mothier Country that, if it was necessary, the people of this country were wiiiing
ta sacrifice their last man and their last
dollar ta heip preserve the peace of the
world and the existence of the British Empire. That is whiat hias been preserved ta
us. That is what we have gat. Our mnen
were sent overseas, flot for the purpose of
gaining torritory, but because the people of
Canada beiieved that it ivas their duty ta
assist Great Britain in restoring peace ta
the world.
A good deal bias been said by honourable
gentlemen on the other side of the House
about the War Time Elections Act. i'hich)
was passed, I think, in 1917. 1 have nat
gat a list of fie ugly names they called it.
I must say that that Act neyer seenied ta
me ta be very unjust. What were the two
pr~inciipal objecta which iA effected? First,
it took the vote from a certain olass oi
people who were not sympathetic with the
aims and ideals of this country and the
British Empire. That sanie injustice hiay
have been done here and there 1 arn not
going to deny; it is -impossible -ta bring about
any great change with-out sanie individual
injustice; but surely it xvas nat wrang ta
take the franchise froas people wlio were
not in syrnpathy xitlh us. The ather abject
of the Act-and I think perhaps more fault
hias been found with that-was ta extend
the franchise ta the inathers, sisters. and
ivives of those whio were fightin.- in France.
Those are the two points ta xvhich the greatest amount af adverse criticisn lias been
directe&, and, in my opinion, the Government were justified in doing what they did.
1 believe that Sir Robert Barden and his
Government made very few mistakes. If
ever a man was imbued with the interests
of the Empire and of this country, and if
ever a man sacrificed himseif ta his ideals.
that mnan was Sjr Robert Borden. I think
that some of the criticism which was
directed yesterday towards him was too
smalI for the men who made it. 1 wish ta
offer my meed of praise ta the Union Government, and ta the men a! the iÂheral
party, who upon the solicitation of the
Premier joined xvith the Conservatives in
Han. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

honourable gentlemien in this roomi were
hcn, uxîder
in Parlianient in days gaone by -w

at greater length than we do to-day. They
will remember that on miany occasions we
commenced sitting at 3 o'aiock an Monday
afternoon, and fought continuously until
12 ' o'clock an Saturday night, only stopping
then becauffe of the Lord's Day Act.
Honourable gentlemen opposite were diefending their beloved leader, and 1 do flot
think any one on either side of the House
woisld say that hie w.as not a rnost lovable
mah. When the crisis came, however, some
honourable gentlemen, in adhiering to their
party principles, seemied to forget the
importance of the crisis that xvas facing us.
In the early days 1 was flot 6o enamoured
of Union Government as 1l aiterwards was.
Now, in the iight of what bias transpired. I
amn confident that Sir Robert ]3orden 'vas
right; and 1 want to give credit to the men
froim the other side who joined with him.
On Tuesday, in the House of Commons,
a spiendid tribute was paid to the Union
Gavernment by a gentlemnan who, judging
tram his name, neyer belonged to a Tory
family. 1 refer ta Mr. M-\owat. The very
name smack-s of Liberalismn. This is what
hie said:
1, in comman with the Liberals on this side,
have had pleasure in eupporting this Government, and supparting it enthusia.stically, even
though it be unpopular. During war 1 do flot
want ta support -a Governrnent merely because
it Is popular.

-Since this session commnenced, we have
heard a great deal about the unpopuiarity
of this Government and the remiarks of Mr.
Mowvat appeal ta me very strang'ly. He
goes on ta say:
I want ýta support a

One of the things the Governmient lias
hiad ta do was ta enforce Conscription. In
ny opinion, Conscription was necessary

in

order ta properly carry on the war. 1
wauld say that every man shouid do his
part. Mr. Mowat continues:

unpopular, but whlch were in their belief for
the ultjinate good of the country.
The only
thing that saved Canada during the war was
the fact that there was a. Government that was
flot afraid to do thingis that would be unpopular.

That is very gratifying w'hen one considers the source frorn which it cornes.
1 do not want to detain the House too
long, but 1 woudd like to read a short item
f romn the Toronto Star, which I always
understood to be a strong Liberal paper.
Thie is what it says about the Union Government:
"T'he Union Government le in an extreordlnary position," says the Toronto Star In reviewing the session of Parlisanent just ciosed. It
says: "Rt Ma given the country more legislalion of fîrat-rate importance than any previcus
government ever did In the saie length of
turne. It ha6s hown more courage in handling
big and difficuit questions than any previous
governinent.
Yet it ts conceded on ail aides
that the Union Governrnent stands -no chance
of belng upheld by the country, and apparentiy
nobody, even at Ottawa, expecta anything else
than that the Government will be wiped out
when the next electione take place, be It acon
or late."
"The work tha.1 stands to the credît of the
Union Government since ;the election of 1917
is considerabie. but that which lias been done
in the brief session now ciosing wouid In itzelf
be enougli ordinarily to make the Teputation
o! an administration.
The Grand Trunk lias
been natlona&lized In the face of ail the influence
,that the C.P.R. and the big financial and other
corporationis.
mostiy
with headquarters
In
Montreal, could exert."
"The Union Government lias pushed through
legislation enabling Ontario or any other province. to make prohibition bone-dry withln its
boundaries by taking certain steps which wiil
ensure federal aid in the dolng of it."

There may be sorne difference of opinion
on that point.
The work of aboliishing patronage and perfecting civil service reform, of havlng ail purchasing done on a qsounid basie, bas been pushed
through. This ia one of the biggest things in
the way of cleaning uli graf t and waste ever
done by any goverfiment in any country.
Another great thing has been done. It n'as
during the present session that the Governinent
explain-ed -the new status Canada liais attiiined
within the Empire-a statua which lias been
accorded international recognition. Canada la
now declared to lie one of a group of Britieli
nations. in full controi of lier own affairs..

Canada's new status is sornething which
seeins to be causing our friends on the
other side of the House a great deal of uneasiness. The honourable gentlemian froin
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche) was at great
pains to show that Canada had not at'tained a new status.
As I have said, during- the period of the
*ar the Government bas done mucli; and
the same is true of the period of reconstruction. I do flot know about rnilit.ary ife-

37

there are nmen here who do--but I believe
I arn not far wrong when I say that it is
extremrely difficuit tu re.es'tablish mien in
civil life after thcy have spent some tirne
in the army. 1 can only refer to what bas
been done in this respect in Manitoba. The
rernarks which I amn about to read were
ruade by the member for Lakeside in the
Manitoba House. The following are statistics on soldier unernployrnent in Manitoiba as of February 7:
Number of eoflders flot working, 1,481; mnimber who have not applied for work, who were
living wlthout assistance o! any klnd 600 ;
nqsmber to whlch A class certificates had been
lssued, or thofe who bail no employment and
were seeking work, 165; nirber to which B
class certificates had been issued or thoise in
employment whose wages were mlot sufficient,
148. Those who had been receiving assistance
right aiong nuxnbered 591. When it was consldered that 30,000 soldlers had been demobilized
In ManLtoba4 said iie, those figures were very
veassuring.

Judging from that statement the Government has been very successful in the reestablishing of the soldiers.
During the last year or two we ;have
heard a great deal about 'the agrarian
movernent, the fermiers' movement. I do
flot know of any reason why a farmer should
flot move if he wants to and has the ability
to do so. The syrnpathy of the House may
not be with. me in what 1 arn about to say,
but I ask honouralble members of this
Chamber to accept whîat I say as a sincere
expression cif my views. I believe that
Canada, because of its diversified interests,
is one of the moat difficuit countries in the
world to, govern. It is easy to govern a
municipality because the interests o! the
people are flot so varied; it is comparattively easy to carry on a local government.
because the interests of the people are similar; but when it cornes to governing Canada,
owvin-- to the diversified intereats and extent of the country, government is a very
difficuit problern.
For forty years I have lived iii thýe West,
and what 1 arn about to say wiIl apply
principal]y to the three Prairie Provinces.
The three Prairie Provinces have not very
rnuch on whidh to, depend. It is estimited
that the'population of those provinces is
to-day very nearly 2,000,000 people-1,960,000, I think. Including British Columbia,
the population of Western Canada is about
two and a hal! millions of people.
The
people of the three Prairie Provinces have
a great deal with which te contend.
Some of you know it and sorne of you do
jiot. 1 mas astounded to read in the press
the other day a staternent te the effect that

38

SENATE

the proprietor of one of the leading papers
in Montreal-and that is in Ganada-hiad
noever until a year ago visited the great
West. To mie that does flot seem right.
May I say in passing that I believe it to
be the duty of inembers of the ýSenate and
the House of Gommons, the representatives
of the people, to became conversant with
the requirements of every province in this
Dominion, in order that we may legislate
intelligently.
The three provinces have, as 1 have said,
a great deal with which to contend-much
more than have any of the other provinces
of this Dominion. The beautiful province
of Nova Scotia, down by the -sea, is not
entirely dependent upon one thîng; it hias
lumbering and fisheries, and apple-growing.
The apples grown there are, in my opinion,
the best in the world. And the people of
that province have other industries besides.
There is certainly a good deal of agriculture.
Coming to New Brunswick, you find a
sirnilar condition. It hias the fisheries; and
the lumbering industry is quite extensive
though it may flot be as great as it formerly
was. New Brunswick is a fine province.
Quebec is flot only a great agricultural
country, with a splendid class of farmers,
I
but it has also wonderful industries.
knew very littie about Quebec until,
through the kindness of one of our most
respected members, I had the privilege
of visiting some of the industries of that
province last year. Any man from the West
who hias had the opportunity of visiting the
great industries of Ontario and Quebec will
agree that they are wonderful. They surpass any conception I ever had of thern;
and if any remarks of mine convey the impression that -I arn opposed to those industries, then I amrn ot saying whiat I intend
te say. I amn in favour of industries. We
cannot get along without them. I arn not
quite s0 inuch in favour of industries as the
hionourable leader of this House (Hon. Sir
James Loughieed), if 1 understood his words.
If I asked hirn what lie ineant, hie would
probably answer that hie meant what lie
said. His opinions as te the manufacturing
industry in this country were a littie too
strong te suit my mind.
The great industries of Ontario and Que-bec have a foreign market, I admit, but I
would ask this House te consider for a few
moments what a market of 2,000,000 people
may mean te these provinces, -%vhIethier for
agricultural implements, boots or shees,
liarniess, wag-ons, buggies, or whatever it
may bo. I rernember on one occasion I

lion. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

Without making myself known, 1 said te
the owner: "! suppose yen seli your goods
-If Ontario

were our only market w~e should have te
close up in three weeks.- "-Vhere do you
sell them?" I asked. Ho told me a large
proportion of his eutput was sold iii what
lio called the Northwest. The Northwest
is certainly the source of a great revenue
to'the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
Iii the three prairie provinces our only
industries are grain growing and cattie
raising, although there is considerable
rnanufacturing in Winnipeg. It hias beeni
said that there is no market like the home
,narket. The home market means much te
the fariners of Ontario and Quebec, but I
do net think I am far astray in stating that
it is of very littie service te the people of
The province of
the Prairie Provinces.
British Columbia has the lumber industry,
the fisheries, and minerais. We in the
Prairie Provinces have minerais te sorno
extent, I suppose. (1 am glad that British
Columbia possesses those resourcos, for I
r--ally do net know what we shouldl do with.
eut them.
To give you an idea of the importance of
lurnhering te the province of British ColumLia. I may say that the total value of the
forest production in that province for the
yenu 1919 was ne less than $62,000,O00, as
compared with $54,000,000 in 1918, accordingte a prolîminary survey. Water-borne shipments of lumber show an advance ovor the
preceding year of 17,000,000 feet, while the
value ef pulp and paper sold increased from
$10,000,000 te $ 12,000,000 last year. We in
the West have been hearing a great doal
recently about the pulp and paper industry
and do net feel wvell disposed towards it.
for our newspapers, even in the great city
of Winnipeg, had te suspend operation for
d ý.,ck.

I arn glad, i say, that British Columbia
lias lumber resources. In every one of our
nunierous towns in the three Prairie Prc%inces is te be found a lumber yard, and
1 wi1L venture to say that in net ono eti
thexu will yen fail te find a large quantii\
et British Columbia lumber or timber. It
is 'lie samne with the flsh; yen cannot go
into the smallest butchoer shop in any ef
those provinces without finding fishi from
British Columbia, se I dlaim that if teday we are a little rostless it is bocause of the way we believe we have
been treated, and I mention these facts
se that some honourable members of this
House who are net familiar with the conditions inay know what they are. Even as

MARCH 4, 1920
to our principal crop, wheat, we have a great
deal with which ta contend. There are present here corne mien who are Manitoba wheat
farmers, and the>' will flot dispute the statement that had it nat been for what were
reg-arded as high prices far wheat, man>' ai
the farmers wauld have had ta leave their
iarms, because for variaus reasons it would
have been absolutel>' impossible for thern
ta, make a living. We in the West have ta
contend with a great deal af dry weather.
We used ta suifer ta some extent frorn irast,
but that does noît affect us sa rmuch now.
The great difficuit>' in that country i.s the
lack ai rain and in the st twio years we
have had ta contend with sornething we
tihe
neyer experienced before, namel'
wind starms, that blew out the craps.
1 think that the han. mernber from
Manitou <Han. Mr. Sharpe) will agree
with me that millions ai dollars were
spent in buying grain not oni>' for re-seedThe treing, but for the third soiwing.
mendaus winds we have out there were
bloiving the grain outaif the ground. Therefore, as I have eaid, it was oni>' the high
price ai aur wheat that enabled the farmers
ta stand the test.
Of course there are places in the West
where maney has been made. Some people
have been ver>' fartunate. In 1915 the crop
was excellent; I think we had about 3W0,000,000 bushels ai wheat. Last year in the
three provinces the yield was about 192,000,000 bushels.
There is no need for me ta labour this
aspect iurther. The point I desire ta make
is that those three provinces have been
entirel>' dependent upan wheat growing and
cattie raising. To-day it does not pa>' ta
raise cattie. That is true not anly ai the
West. I read yesterday a statement made
b>' Mr. Morrisan, secretar>' ai the farmer's
part>', that there is very littie export of
cattle irorn Ontario to-day. There was at
one time a ver>' large expart.
It was, 1 think, in the three prairie provinces that the farmers' arg-anization originated.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do I understand
the honourable gentleman ta se>' that it
daes not .pay ta raise cattle in the West?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It is said that
cattie raising does nat pay, because ai the
price that the farmers can get for their
grain and because cf the long, cold winters;
and I could give the hanourable gentleman
a wonderiul illustration regarding Alberta,
if I had time. Without fear ai contradiction 1 sa>' that there is flot much malle> in
cattle raising in the Northwest to-day.

39

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is not necessary
to bouse the cattie in the winter.
Hon. Mr.'SCH.AFFNER: In Alberta tAie>
miust be housed.
Conditions have
Han. Mr. FOWLER:
changed since I have been there.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I may make
sqme mistakes, but I amn trying ta be fair,
as well as careful, in stating w'hat I believe ta be the facts.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My hon.
friend does flot undertake ta say tkiat in
Alberta range cattie are housed.
Hon. Mr. SOHAFENER: I arn speaking
of the fariners in Alberta. They house their
cattie, do they not? 1 think that staternent
is correct. I arn nat referring ta the ranges.
Now, what is it that has driven the fariners ta forrn a party? I know that the statement I arn about ta, make will flot have
the syrnpathy of this Hause. My data rnay
flot be absolutel>' correct; hence I may be
wrong in my conclusions; but I arn af the
opinion that thia agrarian movement in
tihe West has been caused by what is called
«'big business "-the big industries af the
other provinces. 0f that I amn firrnly -cn
vinced. The big interests have nat been
satisfied with fair profits. As ta the question ai fiscal policy, the farmers af the
West believe £hat the tariff is taa high.
Now, I arn nat a free trader. The leader af
the Farmers' part>' is, I believe, Hon. Mr.
Crerar, and hie is reported ta have eaid he
would rsweep away the tariff wall in its entiret>'. I believe he has not been correctly
reported. 0f course we muet always say
we have not been correct>' reported when
we do not like what we have said. A despatch. front Woodstock, N.B., states that
Mr. Crerar--advocated the entire sweeping away cf the
protection wai and the production ef a revenue
tram direct taxation as a Tnea.ns cf replacing
the revenue whjch would be needed te carry
on the busins of the ountry, declaring thait
protection conferred a apecial privilege upon
induistry, and that Canada should only be makIng the thingis which ehe can nbake c.heapest,
and then enter imto unrestricted world trade.

I do not think Mr. Crerar said that.
What Mr. Crerar personali>' thinks, I
arn nat prepared ta say, but I arn pretty
well prepared ta state what his first lieutenant says. Before caming down' here I
spent several hours with the man whom I
consider ta, be his first lieutenant, and he
states that the>' are net askîng for free
trade. «'But," I told hîm, " You are talking about class legisiation." I have ne

SENATE
hesitation iii savin- that for forty years we
in this countrv hav'e been living under class
legaisiation. That is niot Mr. Crerar's statement, but it is whiat 1 bélieve, and there
oug-ht flot to be class lezisiation on either
side or the other. It is clear to me that the
time has corne when there should be in
Canada a greater unity for national wvork.
It is high time that the class legisiation
which the big industries are imposing upon
this country should cease. and I can assure you that the three western provinces
are going to see, in so far as thev can,
that it does cease and that thev receive fair
treatment. On the other hand i believe that
they are introducing ciass legisiation
and I tell them so. I believe in moderate protection. Some of the profits that
have been made aie amazing-, and in this
respect, later, 1 shall offer a littie criticism of Union Government, if I do flot forget to do so. As I have said a dozen tîmes.
I believe in the importance of manutacturing and other industries, but it does seem
to me that there bas not been the effort
made that ought to have been made to
bring the industrial and agricultural classes
of the people together. The priviieged class
which has heen developed hy the large industries bias had its way for so long that it
bas apparently failed te consider the other
aide of the question. Therefore it will do no
harm to have some farmers in Parliament.
In my opinion there will be many froiti the
West. And I am glad of another thîng.
honourable gentlemen. There is to he in
Ontario a combination Farmer and Labour
government. and the tendencv o! the oldtime Liberals and the old-time Conservatives is to give Mr. Drury a chance to show
,that bis government can do. I helieve
that there is justification for the farîners'
movement, particularly in the three Prairie
Provinces, and I lay tho blarne largeiy
upon the big interests, which do flot like
this agrarian movement. 1 do -not likze to
use the word, but it seemis to mie that there
bias been a good dcal of hoga-ishi work, going on anion.- the big- interests of Canada.
For soîne reason or other-I do not know
why-our Governinent doos not seemi te be
able te control to any groat extent these

big in terests, such as exýist in the United
States.
I read

last nigýht the remnarhable statenment-and I give it for w;hat it is worth,
without knowing whether it is truc or not
-that the five great packing institutions of
the U'nited States have been fouiid bh' the
courts to have mnade in the vears 1915 te
1917, inclusive, a profit of $192,000.000,
whereas during an equal periodi prier to
lion. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

1913 they made $59.000.000.

The point J

dosire to makze it that this increase was due

mainly te the war.
Our Governiment bas been unable, se far
as I can see, to get hold of the men who
have been making- treniendous profits. It
makes no difference who they are. I say
it is the duty of the Government to d,)
what is being doue in England, thar is. ',o

percentage of profit. For instance, th-ý

percentage than that of the pre-war perii
there bas been so much larger investment.
Not only Great Britain, but every European
country that was fighting on the sido o! the
Allies, bad te draw nearly ail their xîîoat
supplies from those packing houses in the
United States. It is altogether likely that
if the figures were inquired into, there
would flot be shown a very liucb larger
percentage o! profit, although the gross profit bas been increased because e! the enormous increase in the volume of business.
1 think it is the percentage of profit, not

the gross profit, that sbould be deait with.
Hon. Mr. SCliAFFNER: The honourable gentleman is in exactly the samne position that I was in. Ho says that a larger

if a mla'i fias miade th'sc treinendous profits
he should be taxed whether he wvas a farmer or not. But I will tell the honourable
gentleman that because of things to which
I have alre'±dy referred the f.rmers, as a
class, have not made large suins of money.
Because last year we expected to have a
splendid crop. The outlook led us to believe that there would bie a yield of 35 bushels to the acre. But what was the average
According to the âtatistics
in Canada?
of the Dominion Governiment it was ten
bushiels to the acre. In some places no
doubt the yield was greater; but in many
places it was nlot more than 3 bushels to
the acre.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Ten bushels?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Ten bushels, according to the statisties.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That was bad farming.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It may have
been, I am simply giving the facts.
Then there is the labour problem. Because the cities have adopted the eight-hour
systein, daylight saving, and a few other
f ads, it is almost impossible for the farmers to get hielp. The farmer, or his wife,
or daughter has to rnilk the cows. Y~ he
does get help, when the afternoon cornes
along, the hired man, because he knows
that men in the cities are working only
eight hours a day, wants to stop work, and
it is difficult to retain him. 1 do not know
what is going to happen. 1 believe that
the farniers in the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec have a better epportunity of making money than the farmers of the Prairie
Provinces.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Hon. 'Mr. SCHAFFNER: But in spite of
their opportunities, no one can deny that

To a certain extent 1 ag-ree with the leader of the House whien hie says that we require manufacturing; but I say that the
inanufacturers of this country have not
treated the three western provinces fairly.
I may be wrongý, but that is iny opinion. If
there is a market of 2,000,000 in those provinces, it ie worthy of the consideration of
the manufacturers. I have said many a

stood for the slogan. - Get togethier." I!
Canada is to become a great country it
will be throug-h union and compromise,
and 1 cannot state that too strongly.
In opening I said that I would have the
presumaption te say a few words about the
machinery of the Senate. Last year the
honourable gentleman froni Sydney (Hon.
Mr. McLennan) moved for a committee to
consider the machinery of Governiient. 1
amn glad that the honourable gentleman got
his committee, because, if for ne other
reason, it gave this honourable body semething to do. Another Committee of the
Seiiate considered the question of the navigability of the Hudson Bay. The committee
secured a great deal of very intering and valuable information, and during the recees I had much pleasure
in reading and re-reading the evidence. The chairman of the cemmittee was
the honourable member for Sussex (Hon.
Mr. Fowler), and although lie cornes from
the East, I must say that bis judgnent and
fairness were all that could bc expected,
even frorn a man hailing froin the West. I
compliment the honourable gentleman upon the way in which the inquiry was conducted. The honourable g-entlemiani frorn
Sydney (Hon Mr. McLennan) talked about
the machinery of Government. HiBmigit have
stopped nearer home, and talked about the
mnachinery of the Senate. He talked about
the Cabinet, and the difference iii the preblems of running a Governînient and munning- a private instituition. He was well
answvered. by the leader of the Gevernrnient.
and the honourable gentleman frein 'Montreal muade a good speech upon the question; but, in my opinion. the honourabfe
Girgentleman froma Antigonisli (Hon. Mmýf.
reir) did more than any one else te refute
the argument advanced by the lionourable
gentleman freont Sydney. They say thiat hie

teols. I do net think that the iiachinery of

numbered nearly ninety. These things are
peculiar to war tirnes and wilI right themnselves.
In my opinion, we have had too many
commissions at work i this country. Parliament is here to represent the people. Ini
that connection, 1 arn going to say some-hing that perha.ps you do net know. The

believe, however, that i-t can be made
popular, and that it can be made exceedîngiy useful. Whenl 1 suggest changes in
this body, 1 arn reminded ef the men who
corne ta the Hause et Gommons to atused Vo
tend their first caucus. They stood up and
told us what thev were going ta do. To hear
them, one would have thought that we
were fools. Alter they had been here a
wvhile they settled down and found that
others had been there before them. I remember one particular case. A ma~n, a big man,
carne to a caucus and told Mr. Borden, "If
you do nlot do things right, I arn going Vo
vote against you." This was in the days Gf
party Governent. This gentleman sat two
or three seats behind me in *the House.
Towards the end of the Session I went ta
himi one day and said: "This is a fairly
good Governrnent, is it not?" He said,
-Why?" I said: "At the first caucus you
told us that if things were not done
right yau were gaing ta vote against us,
and on every division you have voted wifh
us." Per.hars I arn sametbing like that
man. I believe, however, that we adjaurn
tao often and for toc long periods. There
is one subject at least with which I believe
a large committee of the Senate could
profltably ernploy itself for a considerable
period of time. I arn sure that a comrnittee
ta cansider aur natural resaurces could
do good work, work that would be iu thbe
best interests of the country. One hardly
ever hears a public speech w-hich. does nat

criticisni cf -the Opposition, I think, t-bat
t-hey have conducted the affairs of the
country very much te the satisfaction cf
the people. They were unpopular, it s truc;
wby? One reasan, I thnk, was Conscrptien. The crificisrn has been made that the
Government went Vo the cauntry in 1917
and tald -the fariners that their sans wou.ld
not -be conscripted. Perihaps t-bey did. I
rather -think that promnise was rnade. Even
suppasing it was, there is just as rnuob
reason why a farrner's son shoul go ta the
war as anyone else. What was thbe condition
when that promise was made? At Vhat time
production was just as important as sending men ta the front, perhaps more se; but
in April, May and June, 1918, as my bonourable friends well know, the situation at ithe
front was exceedingly serieus. We were net
at ai fea sure who was going- to win the war.
We felt very oestless and uneasy. Under
fbose circumstances, men becarne more
important -than production. As Sir Robert
Berden said, "What is t-he good cf production if we lose the figýht?" Wc had te have
men. Wben matters became se seriaus,
notwi-fhstanding the fact tihat, the promise
had been madie flot ta consoript farmers'
sens, the Governrnent changed their minds
or broke their promise, if you will, and in
my jUdgment they were jUstified in deing
50.

There is one matter in which I think thbe
Goverrnent has failed during the last three
or four years, narnely, in securîng money
in the terna cf taxes frorn the wvea1thy
corporations. I say that they have net sufficiently .ta.xed the big interests and the
moneyed mien, I care not w-hether fhey be
farmers or any other class. In t-bis country
that work bas net been dene as well in
any sense as in the little eolony ef New
Zealand or in Australia. If it could he
successfully done there, I sec ne reasGn
why it could not be donc -bere, if prorper
efforts had been made.
A moment ago I speke et thc farners'
platformr. They believe àn direct taxation,
but t-bey do net believe in free t-rade. Mr.
Chipman and his lieutenant toid me, "No.
we do noV believe in free t-rade." Tbey
propose taking the cluty off a few articles
whieb -they wanf. That is w-bat I caîl the
beilgbt cf class le-gislation. I wiIl just read
trami their platform:

arnaller industries ond the adx'anfflnient of
pricEs on practically ail manufactured goods
to the fullt extent perrmitted by the tariff-

And here is where I say they are unf air:
Therefore be it resolved, that the Canadian
Councll ef Agriculture. representing the organized farmers of Canada, urges that, as a me.ans
of rernedying these evils and bringing about
arnuch needed social and economnic reformas, our
tariff 1aws ahould b-e amended as flollows:
That ail foodstuifs not included in the
Reciprocity Agreement be placed on ithe f ree
flet.
That agriculturi lxnplemnents, farm. mnachinery. vehicles, fertilizers, coai, l.wnber, cernent,
tiurninating fuel and lubricating o11e be placed
on the free Eist, and 'that aIl raw matertals and
machinery used in their maniufacture aiso be
placed on the free list.

I asked Mr. Orerar and his lieutenant why
the manufacturer whe makes these things
should be placed in a different position from
that of any ether manufacturer, and why a
labourer should have te pay duty on all
that hie buys?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn trying to
follow the honourable gentleman. Is hie in
faveur cf abolishing the duties?
Hon. Mr. SOHAFFNER: I arn net. I arn
now reading from the platferm of the
Counicil cf Agriculture of the three western
provinces.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman does net adveeate what he reads.
Hon. Mr. SCHA.FFNER: 1 said in the
beginning that I was net a free trader,
and I say now, just as strong-ly, that I arn
net in faveur of the privileged class that
high. protection has given te this couitry.
1 say the tariff is tee high; it sheuld be
reduced. There should be a compromise, as
I have stated time and tirne again, between the interests and agriculture. They
should corne togýether. You ask me if I arn
in faveur of these articles being free. I
arn net. I will go further than that. I liad
the henour, about 1907, 'when Mr. Fielding
broughit down the tariff, te move that the
duty on agricultural implernents, that la,
mewers and binders, be reduced. -The items
in the tariff are always indicated by nurnbers, and I think the number of the item
in. 455. 1 rnoved that tlîat clause be arnended
,by reducing the du.ty to 10 per cent. Well,
lit is 12à nowv; it has been reduced nearly to
what 1 meved for, and I think it is f-air. I
arn nut asking for a further reductien. 1
claimr rthe farmers have ne right te ask that
these things be made free, fer 'we must have
a revenue.
I arn wearying yeu. henourable gentlemen, but 1 amn deeply interested in this

question and I would like to point out that
there are in my opinion botter ways of
raising mioney than by the tariff. There
must be a tariff, but my contention is that
it should be a tariff for revenue only.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You are like the
Liberals: for revenue only.
Hon. Mr. SCIIAFFNER: Like the devii?
ýome Hon. MEMBERS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Like the Liberals.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: 1 say that when
we get the duty reduced to 12J per cent it
is lowv enough, and the farmers should be
willing to pay that. Without desiring to
boast, I may say that 1 have farrned extensively in Manitoba and have bought a great
many agricultural implements, and I
believe it is our duty to pay our part of
the taxes and we should be quite wiliing
to do so. I knew that my contentions
would flot satisfy this honourable House,
and I feel perfectly certain that I shail not
satisfy the district froin which I corne, for
I strongly maintain that we must te a
certain extent protect our industries. I
repeat. though, that the industries have
taken adv'antage of us. Sir John Macdonald has been quoted by some honourable
gentlemen here. When Sir John Macdonaid drew up his National Policy, what did
honourable friends over there
hie say? M-%y
will remember that lie said it was "to
assist struggling industries." Those were
his very words. These industries have
apparently been "struggling" ever since,
to judge by the way they have kept up the
tariff. Ail I ask is that there be a cernprornee.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman if farm tracters
are not free'
Hon. 'Mr. SCHAFFNER: Up to $1.400
they are free, and it was a good move te
niake themn se. I do not know whien that
honourable friend's
step wvas taken. M-Ny
question renîiinde me of something- I had
been forgetting-. The Tories, you knew, are
colled the high protectiontists, and the
Liberals free traders, but what '.%r. Drury
and the farniers are going te find out is
that there ir, a great difference between
standing on the outside looking in, and
beîng on the inside and administering. Our
friende over there found that out in 1896.
They were about as far advanced iri respect
to free trade wlien they lield their convenition in 1893 as the farmers are at present.

How

niuch?

Hon. Mr. 8;CHAFFNER: Eighty million
dollars. Less than $100,000,000 eut of the
big iinterests for taxes.
Let us for a moment consider Australia
and New Zealand for the purpose of making
a littie coiriparison. 1 have obtainied sonie
figures- frein a reliable source and 1 tlîink
tlîat tlîey are practically correct. Ow'ing te
their distance from the theatre et w ar and
the shortage of shipping, Australia and New
Zealand were probably werse off. instead of
heing better off, financially fer the war.
Yet these two ceuntries tooek advantage of
the war te adopt direct taxation te a far
greater extent than did Canada. Now. I
amn net geing te quote ail the figures 1 have.
In New~ Zealand, for 1914, the custenis and
excise ainounted te £3.500,000, and the inconue tax te £55,000. The total frein these
and other revenues, such as death duties.

natter o! taxing the big interests, 1 say
the Governnxent have fallen down. 1 miay
bie wrong, but that is my opinion.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: What would the
honourable gentleman suggest?
Hon. Mr. SCHKFFNER: 1 would suggest jnst what is being done in England
now. The British Government are gettiflg
aft,4r such mnen. They are exernpting £25,000,
and for the wif e £1,000, and for each child
£500.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: That would exempt
nine ont o! every ten persons in this country.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I am not saying the exemption should bie the same, but
I do say that while our men were bleeding
in France, the great interests had no right
to be free from the obligation to contribute
some of their money to reduce the debt of
this country. That is exactly my point.
In 1918 alone New Zealand -raised from
income a total o! $28,000,000, as I have
said. Canada's revenue from taxation, and
the proportion which. it bears to the total
taxes, are set forth in a table which I have,
but I will flot give in detail. Customs and
excise, which furnished 100 per cent o!
the revenue from taxes (exclusive o!
Chinese revenue) during 1914 and 1915,
stili furnished -over 80 per cent o! it in
1919. The business profits tax f urnished
only 14 per cent of it.
In 1914 we raised in customs and excise
$126,143,000; from business profits nil;
from income nil; from banks, trust coinpanies, etc., nil-a total o! $126,143,000.
In 1915 the total raised by taxation was
$97,519,000, and there was no revenue from
business profits or from income, or banks
and trust companies.
In 1916 we raised $121,000,000 by customs
one-eighth o! the population, and %vith fex
and excise; no business tax, and no inwar orders, collected in income taxes.

this way, Nvhich does not satisfy me: That
New Zealand lias only one inconie taxwhereas in sorne of the Canadian provinces
there are separate inconie taxes. municipal
or provincial. But if you makie the calculation you will find that the total revenue derived from income taxes does not 'orne anywhere near the arnount that bias been collected in New Zealand. Their income tax
during the first four years o! the war
amounted, as I have said, to $55,000,000.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFN ER: In 1918 the
revenue from customs and excise was
$170,568,000; from business profits $21,271,000; and the arnount of incorne taxes is nat
stated here.
In 1919 we paid $189,000,000 in custorns,
$33,000,000 in business tax, $9,349,000 in incorne tax.
Hon. Mr. CASGRLAIN: Only 89,000,M00?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That would be
for 1918, I presume.
There is another argument brought up by
the Government. At ieast I have heard
it brought up by Sir Thomnas White, a gentleman for whom I have great respect, and
whom everybody recagnizes as a fiist-class
business man, a man of great ability. As
any person who bas sat in the House of
Commons knods, Sir Thomas White had
not niuch faith in introducing the income
tax. It was pretty difficult to get him to
introduce it at ail, for he always used the
aigument that the cost of administration
would be nearly as rnuch as the revenue
received frorn it. That does nat seem ta
have been the case in the United States,
Australia or New Zealand. Australia. did
not adopt the incarne tax until 1915 or
1916; 50 it was nearly as new ta thern as
ta us. New Zealand and the United States
had an incarne tax for a long while, and
there bad been an incarne tax in Great
Britain for a great many years. If yau

new thing. It will takce tîrne ta get it established.- I recognize that, but I think
we have been altogether taa slow in getting
after those who owe the tax, and in collecting it.
Durîng the first years of the operation
of the incarne tax in Australia, the Comnrnonwealth collected a total of nearly
£4,000,000 or $19,000,000. The second year
a total of 528,000,000 was collected. In the
third year, this tax brought ta the treasury
a total of nearly 537,000,000. In the three
years the total collected by the Commonwealth in incarne taxes was $84,701,000. The
population of Australia according- ta, the
census of 1917, was 4,935,311, including

aborigines, or about five-eighths that of
Canada. In the three years Canada, on the
basis of bier population anid in proportion
ta Australia's proceeds, should have collected $135,522,000. As a matter of fact she
collected nothing at ail on incornes during
those three years, and only $33,777,000 'n
business profits taxes, or $50,000,000 less
than Australia, with only five-eighths of
the population, collected in income taxes.
AuÊtralia's first war profits tax was collected in 1917, and netted $3,400,000.
Sa rnuch for Australia and New Zealand.
Human nature is very rnuch the saine thc
world over. If a certain tbing can be done
in New Zealand or Australia, while perhaps
m7 cannat do exactly as they have done.
thiere is no reason why we cannat do very
nearly the samne.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Did they ppblish
the lists in New Zealand?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Does the hon.
gentlemian mean, did they publish the
naine of every man who paid the tax' I

done.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: Can the honourable
gentleman tell us upon what basis the tax
was collected?
Han. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I cannat. I
have sirnply taken the figures showing what
they raised.
A further comparison in the tapping of
wealth and the adoption of direct taxation
iniav be gathered frorn the United States
revenue figures. In 1915 corporation and
individual incarnes contributed anly about
$80,0W,000 to the Treasury. In 1919 thev
contributed over two and a haif billions.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: 1 do not know.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That would arnount
to many millions of dollars.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: No, about $100,000,000. 1 tbink the figures 1 give include
patriotic contributions. If any honourable
gentleman bas better information I sbould
be glad to bave it.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: There were contributions to many societies here.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I think the Patriotic and the Red Cross funds were the
principal ones.
Canada's population is about one-thirteenth that of the United States, thereiore,'
on the basis of population, we should have
collected $200,000,000 in taxes on wealtb
during the year.
I must apologise, bonourable gentlemen,
for baving taken so long. I bad no intention of speaking at sucb great length. I
repeat again that I believe the industries
ci this country shou]d be protected; at the
same time, I believe that they have been
protected to too great an extent. Too much
money bas been raised by custom tax, and
too little from the wealtb of the country'
That is practically the only criticism that
I have to maiçe o~fthe Union Government.
I believe tbat no body of men could bave
worked more earnestly, or with greater success during the war than tbese men; but
now tbat tbe war is over there must be a reduction in the customs duties, and more
money must be raised from wealth, or in
soine other way.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: As the honourable
gentleman has given us so much food for
thought, I would ask that the debate be

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable gentlemen, I1 do not rise for the purpose of
xnaking any remnarks that migbt' be dignified by the name of a speech. I bad no intenrtion of speaking on the Addrees; I bave
no notes, as honourable gentlemen may see,
and I have made no preparation. I wish to
refer for two or three minutes to some of
the remarks made by the honourable gen-

47

tieman fromn Manitoba (Hon. Mr. Schafffer); but while on my feet I feel disposed
to refer to what was said by the honourable
gentleman frorn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), yesterday, and to the line of
argument advanced by gentlemen of the
Opposition, both in this and in the other
Chamber.
There has been a good deal of speculation in the House and about its corridors
as'i to why the line of argument bas been
taken that Quebec does flot desire to be
consulted by this Government, or, as I
might say, by any one. Although I have
been somewhat at a Ioss to know why such
a statement sbould be made, 1 amn going
to express wbat in my opinion is the reason.
It is this. It is getting to be pretty well
understood that the next general election
will be fougbt out on the tariff issue. Those
who have been watching- events closely
know that industries have been going into
the province of Quebec very rapidly during
the last few years. Those who advocated
protection told us that if we kept at it long
enough the Americans would corne over with
their money and akill and would develop
industries. We are learning înow that that
is what bas happened in Quebec, largely
owing, I tbink to the favourable labour
conditions there. Some of our friends on
the other side, what might be called a solid
Quebec, are comrnencing to think that the
new condition may result in a division of
the votes polled in that province in the next
election; and in order to head that off, and
because of a feeling of pride of race, they
desire to -continue a solid Quebec.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The honourable
gentleman from Manitoba (Hon. Mr.
Schaffner) outlined at great length the many
resources and advantages of the Maritime
Provinces, the province of Quebec, the province of Ontario, and the province of British
Columbia; but I was someiwhat surprised
to hear a man who bas lived so long in
the West, and who, I believe, bas made a
fortune there, give such a dismal report
of the three Prairie Provinces. He savs that

could devise a policy that would overcome
the great difficulties under which the

that the people of Canada make no money

audience should listen to that line of argument. If he were to compare the condition
of the farmers of Western Ontario to-day
with their condition ten years ago, we would
find that they are fairly wealthy.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:

Dees Ontario

Hon. '.%r. DONNELLY: I will deal with
that question in a moment or two. The
honourable gentleman also said that there
was no rnoney in raising cattle, because
cattle are not exported. Conditions are
very different to-day to what they were
wvhen cattie were largely exported. I remember that at that tirne the very finest
cattle raised were exported te the old country, and the poorest ivere eaten in this
country. To-day things are different, and
that Ontario is the market for the best
cattle. A large quantity af meat is being
shipped from that province. If yeu go on
the Toronto market to-day you will find
that what is being exported is a class of
cattie usually called canners. I amn well
aware that there is ne large expcrt trade in
live cattie, but there is a large trade in meat.
net only from Ontario, but from aIl parts of
Canada.
My honourable friend bas said that the
rural population ln the province of Ontarie has been decreasing. That is quite
true; but I have neyer felt like admitting
that that was any evidence of a lack of
prosperity on the part of the farmers. I
arn speaking from my knowledge of conGreat additions in Western Ontarie.
vances have been made in farming methode,
and many of our people have -ene inte
stock-raising- and have made money. With
improved rnachînery and se much land
used for grazing purposes, it dees net require much more labour now te operate
three or four hundred acres than it did te
operate a hundred acres a few years ago.
The result is that where a famîly formerly
-occupied only fifty or a hundred acres, today they occupy three or four hundred
acres. That largely accounts for the decrease in the rural population.
My honourable friend had something te
say about the packers of Ontarie. I have
ne brie! te speak for thern, and in daine
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

se I realize that I arn taking a very unpopular stand. Owing te a certain propaganda, a great înany of the people have the
idea that the packers are pirates. I do
net think that is the case. I do net think
vou would find anything- ta justify that
view. I have had some experience with a
lu'mbering, firm who buy their moeat direct
froni the packers, and I know that they can
buy mneat from the packers cheaper than
they can buy it frein the farmers in their
inniediate vicinity. Why is that? It is
owing te the efficiency of the methods ai
the paekers. They are able te remove the
bides in a much more economical way, and
they use the by-products more advantageously. The packers are not charging- excessive prices. The rniddlemen inay be.
The packers, owing te the great volume ai
the business they do, derive great incarnes,
but their actual percentage of profit is net
se enormous as one rnight think.
The honourable gentleman bas referred
te the question ai taxation. I thînk there
is Just a possibility af raising- the incoîne
tax or the business profits tax te suah an
extent that it will defeat its own abject. I
will try ta give an illustrartion of what I
mean. Honourable gentlemen are all aware
of the very high price of lumber in Ontario
to-day. Many people wcnder why prices
have advanced se rapidly. I arn gaing to
"ive one explanation which I think is pretty
well founded. We ail know that for many
years a great deal of sauthern oak bas been
brought into this country for use in connectien with the furniture trade and for
finishing the interiors ai houses. The price
of the oak has advanced very rapidly, being
te-day about three times what it was three
years age. Owing te the advanced price ef
oak, aur manufacturers have had ta turn
te domestic woods, and this has had the
effeet ai increasing- the price ai aur ownn
hardw'oods. You ma3r say that increased
taxation has nothing ta do with that, but
I arn geing ta try to show that it has. The
oak in the Southern States is largely held
by iainly wealthy campanies. They have
te pay a very high business profits tax.
They baught that timber for perbaps $5 an
acre, and they find, whien the Government
accauntants go over their books, that they
wvill allow them credit for aMly $5 an acre
for that timber. To put it briefiy, the result is that if these people cut the oak and
sel! it at tehe present higah prices, they will
have ta pay out practically ahl that it is
worth, se they prefer te let it stand until
conditions change. That, I believe, is responsible in a large measure for the in-

MÀIICH
creased price of Oak to-daY, and is just
one evidence that taxation miav defeat the
object aimed at.
'I sympathize ivith what miv honourable
friend bas said in regard to the farniers'
mnovement. I think that the fariiners have
just as nîuch right to organize as any other
class iii this country; but, as a fariner, I
do not think it is right or proper for any
class to, atternpt to take to themnselves the
business of carrying on the affairs o! this
country. I have neyer seen a Governnient
which was not prepared at any time to do
what it believed was in the best interest of
the farmers. if their case was properly presented. I think the farmners would be justified in organizing and trying te find out
what wvas in their interest, and then presenting their dlaimn in the best possible way;
and I amn sure that they would receive just
as favourable consideration as any other
class of the community.

haustive and very intcrcsti ng address by

bis address 1 should ho disposed to agree;
with other parts 1 should flot feel like concurring. However, it is flot myv intention
this afternoon to delay the House with any
general review of the honourable gentleman's discussion of public affairs, nor, in
fact, with any general reviow of the debate
so far as it bas proceoded up to this timo.
There are one or two observations, however, that I should like to mnake with referenco to the remarks of my honourable
iriend. If 1 understood hinm correctly, ho
roforrod to what he called the -privilegod
class," or the "privilegcd classes " of this
country. Now, I submit, with ail deferenco.
that thoro is no such thing- as a privileged
class in this country, and that it does not
make for the cohesion or the hottermont of
the country as a whole for any honourahie
mombor of this House, or of ant House. or.
in fact, any person, to ondoavour to inipress upon the public mind the~ view that
one person is better than anothor, or that
any man bas greater rights or more priviloges than his neighhour. No person in
this country is enjoying privileges over his
neighhour. I take it for granted, from the
tenor of the honourable gentleman's remarks, that he bas in mind the impression
that there are people w~ho enjev privilegos
under the custemns tariff; that is te say thiat
the policy of protection, as vo hiave had it
in this country, extends privileges to some
people which it does not extend to others.
hlat xvas in
In answer to that, if that wvas -w
bis mind, I want to say that iu my judgment his view -,vas entirely erroneous. The
National Policy, as we bave understood it

desig-ned not morelv to assist mnanufacturing. but to build up flie wholc coiuntry. It

themselves, reasoning upon the events

issue with that statement. Ho does nec
tell us how. I arn surprised at his rnaking
such a statement; for in another breath
hoe tells us that the province et Quebec is

selidly Liberal and therefore bas arrived
at the stage of perfection. Nowv, if Sir
Robert Borden did anything te hring about
that state of perfection, if his bedevilling
resulted in the Liheral party becoming a
un 1t and having full control ef the province
ef Quebec, surely my honourable frîend
should ho glad indeed that 8ir Robert Berdon bedevilled it. I regret that my honourable dfriend from De Lorirnier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) is not here. May I say, with
ail deference, that the men who have hodevilled the province of Quebec are leaders
like the honourable gentleman. The people
ef Quebec are sound at heart. They are
patriotie people, they are industrieus, they
are energetic, they are progressive; but they
have been badly led politically. They have
been led by men who did net look te the
interest of this country, nor te the develepment ef a sound Canadian patriotisrn extending from ocean te ocoan, but had thieir
hearts set upon the fleshpots of political
preferment, and thought more of a political
party than they did of their country.
Everything that they have been deing lias
been done for the purpose of solîdifying a
pelitical party, regardloss of what it cest
the ceuntry. On these grounds, which 1
think are patent te everybedy whe investigates public matters in this country, I
say that these are the gentlemen who rnisled the people ef Quebec, and if thero bias
been any bedevilling, they are the persons
who have done it.
The honourable member (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) also told us that when Sir Robert
Berden callod in certain leading Liberals
they refused te cerne and serve under hlm
as the leader of a Union Governrnent. That
înay or may net ha true. As te that I have
ne information. It may be true that men
who had long been contending against the
pelitical party led by Sir Robort Borden
looked with some doubt upon the proposed
Union Government, and were net at first
willing to accept positions under Sir Robert
Borden, as Prime Minister ef this country.
The complote answer te that is that, ne
inatter what their attitude was at first, some
gentlemen from the West, frein the province
of New Brunswick, the province et Ontario,
the province of Nova Scetia-men who are
high in the councils of the Liberal party,
men who had been honoured, respected,
and trustod by the Liberal party--did jein

hie made that statement. If my observation of the Government ie correct, I see
every evidence of sincerity, every evidence

formn the great Union Government. I was
about to say that it was the greatest Goverument Canada ever -had and I do not think I
should be exaggerating. I see nothing whatever of sham but mucli of sincerity.
My -honourable friend said that the Government was brainless and headless. I do
not think that hie stopped to conaider before making that statement. I arn not goingto say one word which would be derogatory
to the party of honourable gentlemen on
the other side of the House, nor arn I going
to say anything against my honourable
friend hinîseif; I recoganize his ability; but
whule 1 grant that he bas brains sud ability.
1 want to make this reservation. that lie
does not, nor do his colleagues, posse-ss al
the brains or ail the ability in this country.
My honourabie friend says there bas been
no leadership. I would ask hlmi if he stands
so very mucli higlier than the leader of the
Government. He is willing, as some honourable gentlemen are always willing, to
rnake sweeping assertions; but if I put the
direct question to him, I arn sure lie would
admit that Sir Robert Borden is a man of
if
ôutstanding position in this country.
I were to ask my honourable friend if hie

lie would Gay. 1 amn sure that lie would

rise up indignantly to protest, and to tell

Postmaeter General ia a fighter, and I feel
confident that if my honourable f riend

has anything to say about the Postmaster
General hie generally -keeps a good distance off when hie says it. Neverthelees,
I venture to say that if hie were in bis seat
to-day, and I were to, ask himi if lie would
characterize the Postmaster General as a
brainless leader, hie would not undertake
to make good the assertion. There is just
one way to examine these general assertions, and that s to get down to details.
The details make up the general assertion.
If the details are not correct, of course the
general assertion-le not correct; if the detaîls do not work out, the general assertion
fails to the ground. If we go into the other
Chamber and look down the ranke of the
Government, we 'will find there Hon. Mr.
Doherty and Hon. Mr. Ballantyne, both
from the province o! Quebec. I wonder if
my honourable friend fromn De Lorimier
would also characterize themn as brainlesa
leaders? I wonder if hie would characterize
the other distinguished gentiemen-because
there are distinguished gentlemen sîtting
on the Government benches-as brainlees
leaders? In conclusion, let me say that

political partisanship simply made statemente of which I believe hie would be

that lie would be, and 1 believe that lie will

There le juat one other remark made by
iny lionourable friend f romn De Lorimier

SENATE

56

(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) te whichi 1 should
like to refer. He said that no French
Canadian worthy of the name would serve
under Sir Robert Borden. I regard that
statement, honourable gentlemen, as almost
the climax of political partisanship; I also
regard it as very personal and very offensive. I do net know whether my honourable friend would draw a distinction between the mentality, rnorality or principles
of the English-speaking people of this country, and those of the French-speaking peopie of this country. 1 think that honeurable
gentlemen on this side of the bouse
who corne frorn the Eng-lish-speaking
provinces are willing te concede al
the respect and henour to which the
French Canadian people are entitled.
We believe that they are an honourable people, and I think we have the
right to expect that they will regard the
English-speaking people in the same way.
When we find that many men of goed character and good standing in the business
and social if e of the cornmunity have been,
and are, willingto associate themselves with
Sir Robert Borden and serve under hirn, I
want to say that my honourable friend goes
a long way when he intimates that ne
French Canadian worthy of the name would
associate himself with Sir Robert or serve
under him. The other day my honourable
friend paid great respect te our newly-introduced member frem Granville (Hon.
Mr. Chapais). He spoke of him as a man
of very high character and very high standing in the cemmunity. The honourable
member for Granville is very happy, as 1
understand it, to corne into the House as
a supporter of Sir R{obert Boiden. WVould
my honourable friend fromn De Lorirnier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand> suggest that by se
doing the honourable inember for Granville
is in any way ne longer w'orthy te be regarded as a French Canadian? Would he
rule him out of the French Canadian fraternity? The honourable gentleman forgets
that Sir Wilfrid Laurier wvas willing to
corne into Union Government, and to serve
withi Sir Robert Borden. 1 shahl prove
that by reading a paragiapli frorn a letter
whîch Sir Wilfrid wrrote te the Premier on
June 6, 1917. This letter. I say, proves
conclusively that if the question ef conscription had flot been involved, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier would have been willing te join
forces with Sir Robert Borden in forming
a Union Government-in other words, in
the mind of the honourable gentleman. he
would have become unworthy of the namne

something that Mr. Crerar said in another

I wish here and now sirnply te bear testimony to thjs fact that the Prime Minister of
this country carried a burden which very few
citizens of Canada appreciated, and discharged
the rnost onerous tasks with a conscientieusnes
and sense of duty that certainly challenged
the reepect of those who were intim.ately associated with him.

That shows the relation that existed
between Sir Rebert Berden and every Liberal whio wvas associated with -him in the
Union Grovernrnent. They rnay net have
trusted hirn before they joined him; but

MARCH 5, 1920
after they joined him they trusted hirn implicitly, because they found him to be an
honourable man and a great and patriotic

of partisanship interfere with bis duty to
the people of this great country. Therein

who spoke the other day; 'who was brimming over wlth political partisanship; who

lie could once more dip bis hands into the
political flesh pots.
Hon. Mr. DOM VILLE : Should not lie
have a chance with the rest of them?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Not only in Canada,
but the world ovor, no man stands higlier
than Sir Robert Bordon. He stands higli in
the councils of the Empire; and no man
occupies a higlier position in the estimation
of the French people at this time; no man

In the great republic to the south of us I
arn sure that lie stands for uprightnoss,
bonour, and greatness in statesinanship.
As followers of the Union Governrnent we
are proud of him. The honourable gentleman from De Lorimier says tbat no Frenchi
Canadian 'would tarnish himself by f ollowing him. We are proud to follow a mian wlio
stands hoad and shoulders, and I think
rightly so, over any other political leader
in this country. He stands as higl as any
political leader thore ever was in this country, if not higlier, and lie is the peer of
any political leader in the world to-day.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I arn about
to conclude these remnarks -which, without
much preparation, bave of necessity been
rambling and longer than I intended to
make them. Thore ia just one furthor remark that I wish to make about the honourable gentleman to wboxn I bave referred.
Not only was bis speech ovorflowing- with
politîcal partisansbip, but it was ontirely
empty of any great suggestion. and absolutoly devoid of one substantial idea whicb
would bie helpful to the poople of this country. Moreover, from boginning to end, thero
was not one real criticismn of the record
of thie Governmont of Sir Robert Borden
since 1911, or of the Union Goverrent
since 1917. The honourable gentleman satisfied himself, ae such crities usually do.
with genoral statements. Instead of taking
up the Government's record, item by item,
and cballenging it, lie was content with the
goneral statement that tbe Governnment had
done nothing. It was bis duty, if lie bad
any ideas whicli would tend to the botter-

à

ment of this country, to make suggestions
us
and recommendations. But lie 'eft
%vithoutone suggestion, without one idea.
Talk about brainless leaders. Talk about
beadless parties. What kind of head would
he make, what kind of leader would lie be,
when he bas nothing to propose, nothing
to suggest, but satisfies hirnself with empty
criticisms, and, I may say, violent attack.
I 'rant to say ini conclusion, honourable
gentlemen, that for these reasons I1 was
greatly disappointed indeed with the speech
of the honourable gentleman from De
Lorimier.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Poirier. the debate was adjourned.
REVISION 0F PUNISHMENTS BILL.
MOTION FOR SECOND READING
POSTPONED.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code so as to provide for the revision of excessive or inadequate punishments.
He said: The Bill of which I have the
honour to propose the second reading is
one which does not require explanation,
It passed this honourable body in the yc ar
1918, but unfortunately it passed at a verv
late hour in the Session and did flot reach
the House of Commons. Last year the
Bill was referred to commnittee, and aftk>r
being fully discussed it was again passed
by the Senate; but owing to the lateness of the hour it failed to pass the other
House. It is unnecessary for mie to take
up time in discussing this niatter ag-ain.
The Bill is a very simple one. It provides that where a niag-istrate or a judge
bas erred in imposing a sentence, application may lie made to a Court of Appeal,
and if one of the judges of that court considers it is a case for the court to deal withi.
the court bas the riglit to examine into tlie
f acts and decide whether tbe sentence was
a proper one or not. This Bill docs not involve the question of appeal in criminal
cases; it simply provides for the rectification of any error that may have been made
either by a magistrate or by a judge. 1 arn
happy to say that in my opinion there will
not lie many cases in which application
will lie made, but there is no doulit thai
grave miscarriages of justice sometimes
occur, and according to the methods by
wvhich the criminal law is adrninistered in
Canada, there is no remedy. Canada is.
so far as I know, the only British country
in which there is no redress where an error
bas crept into a crirninal trial.

58

SENATE

In England there is -,liat is called a Court
of Criminal Appeal. It was instituted only
a short trne ago and it is giving entire
satisfaction to the people of England. There
the Court of Appeal lias very extensive
pewers. It may flot only re-try the case
and alter the sentence, but it may aise
make any order that it thinks justified in
the circumstances.
Ina great many of the United Statesin every state 50 far as I know-there is
a board that revises criminal sentences and
has the power te rectify any exror that may
have occurred.
1 believe that this Bill does net go far
enough. I think that in Canada we sheuld
have a Court of Appeal in criminel mnatters
just as there is in England. 'Only the day
before yesterday I had some business wvîth
the Justice Department and was speaking
to the gentleman who looks alter tlue system known as the ticket-of-leave, whereby
a prisoner may be released frem the peuhtentiary and is required to report to thepolice. This officiai told me of a case titat
lied occurred in tlie adjoining countv of
Renfrew. A returned soldier stole a *case
of whiskey. That may be a serious crime.
Some honourable members of this flouse who
are prohibitionists miglit consider it xvas
a good act, removing temptations from the
individual. On the other hand, those accustomed to keeping a littie in their cellar
miglit look upon that as a very grievous
offence. However, in this particular instance, the returned soldier was tried by
a inagistrate and sentenced to five years
in the penitentiary. I need not ask the
miembers of this honourable body wlietlier
or not a sentence of five years for a returned soldier wlio had stolen a case of
whiskey was justified. In my opinion it
was not. But here is the difficulty: there
is no way of correcting that sentence if it
is erroneous or too severe. Our code does
neot permit of the revision of tlie sentence.
It may be said that the Minister of Justice
miglit allow this man to be released on
ticket-of-leave; but even so, lie %vould stili
have that five-year sentence lianging over
him.
There are glaring cases of injustice occurring from day to day, and it is largely
because of the fact that in the Western
Provinces at any rate-I cannot say as to
the Eastern-men do flot need to be members of the bar, or to have any legal training, in eider te be appointed by tlie Local
Government to the office of police magistrate. Very often the magistrates, from lack
of experience or some other cause, make
Hon. Mr.

MMAS

very serieus mistakes in imposing criniinal
sentences.

I arn asking by this littie Bill that with
tlie consent of a judg-e of the Court of Appeal any erroneous sentences may be revised. I miglit discuss this matter at inucli
greater lenguli, but as the Bill luas already
been se thoroughly considered in this
House, it is unnecessary for mie to do so.
I arn endeavouring to have the Bill passed
et 'an early date in order that it may reach
the flouse oh Commons and be fully discussed theie, and that a law may be enacted
which will provide some remedy in the
cases of injustice that arise se frequently
ini the administration of criminal law.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The Bill has
net yet been printed. Therefore we cannot
proceed with the second reading to-day,
and it must be deferred until Tuesday next.
The motion for thet second reading was
postponed.

MONETARY EXCHANGE
PRODUCTION.

AND OIL

INQUIRY.

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE inquired:
1. fias the Government considered the losses
to Canada caused by the present condition of
the manetary exchange between Canada and
the U3nited States?
2. Does the Government recognize as a fact
that were Canada ta purchase tromn the United
States fewer gaods that this trouble about the
monetary exchange would be ame liorated or
would perhaps disappear?
3. Are the Government awsre that by the
development ot the oll-yielding shales of Canada the present importation of fuel from the
United States may be very largely decreased?
-4. If they are aware. what means do the
Government lntend to take ta secure such develaprnent?
5. If they are not aware, do they intend ta
hold any Investigations so that this fact may
be proven?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 and 2.
Tbis is a matter of monetary exchange between the United States and Canada, and
is one thiat cannot be controlled by the action of the Gavernment. 3, 4 and 5. The
Government is nat charged with the development o! these resources.
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.
On the Orders o! the Day:
Mr. RAOUL DANDURAND: I rise ta a
question of privilege, and I may say that
this is the first time in nîy twventy-twa
years' experience in this Chamber that I
bave done so. Last week I delivered a
speech on the Address. Mýy honourable
friend fromn Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) replîed, unfortunately wvbile I was absent,
and my attention bas been drawn to a reHe said,

once more dip his bands into the political fleshpots.

I hope that the importance of this expression escaped the attention of the hionourable gentleman, because it speaks not
only of my desires for the future, but of my
past career. I should like to ask him to go
thoroughly into that career, and to, find,
if he can, witb the help of his friends, one
single instance which would justify such
a statement. For his own enlightenment I
may say that it bas been my privilege to
represent the Government abroad more
than once in matters appertaining to, the
public affairs of the country, and that I always refused to submît a statement of My
expenses, altbough I was pressed to do so.
If the bonourable gentlemen, publicly or
privately, sbould express a desire to see
the correspondence establisbing that fact
I shall be very glad to lay it before him.
I deemn it necessary to, answer the honourable gentleman, because 1 believe that
bis statement imputes unwortby motives to
a member o! this Chamber. Neyer in the
past bave I tbought of looking towards the
flesb-pots, and 1 bope it will neyer enter
miy mind to do so in tbe future. My tastes
and ambition do not lie in that direction.
The bonourable gentleman sbould not have
deemed it necessary to impute such motives
in order to explain my attitude towvards the
Governiment and the party in power. He
might bave found sufficient enliglitenment
corning, not fromn the province o! Quebec,
but from Ontario, and I would draw bis attention to an article whichi appeared in the
Farmer's Sun of the litb of February last
and which. explains the attitude o! Quebec,
and my own attitude. It reads as follows:
It la funny to hear the big intereats rnakisig

It la for the French-Canadian to laugh, perhaps rather bitterly. Only two years ago they
were belng denounced as siaokers and traitors.
The whole province wvas boiling with sedition.
The sturdy men of Ontario aught ta go down to
Quebec and clear the French-Canadians out.

Hon. Bir JAMES LOUGHEED: May 1
interrupt the bonourable gentleman to raise
a point of order? My honourable friend is
apparently entering upon another speech,
or'what would constitute a speech. I f ail
ta understand in whiat way this is a point of

wbich lie made the other day in bis speech,
and wbich called forth the reply fron niv
honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. 'Mr.
Tanner), who unfortunately is absent today. It would have been in better taste for
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to have waited until the bonourable
gentleman frorn Pictou was present.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I accept the
point and do flot intend to, continue the
cussion; but 1 would draw the attentiondisof
my honourable friend te this fact. My intention in rising was not toi attack the'honourahle gentleman from Pictou (Hon. 'Mr.
Tanner), and 1 arn not attacking him: I arn
simply answering the imputation that is
implied in bis speech. Witb that portion of
the article which 1 have read I arn content
to stop, inasmuch as the point made by my
honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) may be correctly taken. I desire to add
only that the situation w'hicb is disclosed by
tbat Ontario paper, witb, iii addition. th'e
War-time Electiens Act, fully explains and
justifies the attitude of Quebec and mv ou-n
attitude towards the present Government.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH.
ADDRESS IN REPLY.

The Senate resumed from Friday, 'March
a, consideration of the motion for an Address
in replv to His Exeellency the Governor
General's Speech at tbe openieg, of the SesSion1.

Houi. P. POIRIER: Honourable gentlemen, it is remarkable m-bat can be found in
a Speech froin the Throne. eveni the xnost
non-commnittal, the niost anodyne as that
wbicb was delivered to us at the beginning
of this Session. We b-ac. flrst. bazed upn

ways, but more especially for the hroad
views he toolz on public questions; andi that
of the seconder. one of the most polizlied
oraters in tbis Dominion, who lived 'up te
bis reputation. Next, we bad the bonourable leader of the Opposition in this House,
in bis usual polished. urbane style. trving bard to find fault witb the Go\-ernment's programme; and, as that programme
outlines very little of the Governniit' s
policy, contenting itself ýwitb pleasant generalities, it w'.as the bouniden dutv of the
honourable leader of the Government te
show the brigbt side of bis administration.

friends at least that the Union Governinent
liad during the war done ail that could be
cxpected from an enlightened and patriotie
Governinent, and that since the Nvar tluey
bave been doing ail that could be expected
of any Government-in fact, a little better.
Then rose my honourable friend from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who gave
some explanations that explain se far as
they go. He delivered an address which be
migbt better have Ieft undelivered. This is
ne time, bonourable gentlemen, nor is tbe
Senate tbe place, te revive or perpetuate
racial differences. If personal abuse and
the reviling of our public men, even thebest,
the most patriotie, tbe cleanest, bave becorne planks of the erstwhile great Liberal
party, the handling of that unholy timber
had better be left te, the National friends of
the honourable member. Some parts of bis
English speech were really vicieus, I amn
sorry te say. and somne parts of bis French
speech wvere worse.
However, other honourable rnembers bave
ru-oui in their turn te express their views,
and have drawn from the Speech frein the
Throne what best suîted their fan.*cy. I had
the misfortune te meve the adjournment of
the debate in order te prevent the vote
being taken on Friday. My purpose in doing
se Wvas te enable my honourable friend frore

liad signifled te me bis intention of doing
se. But now I am myseif participating in
it.' and 1 must find something geod, bad or
indifferent. in ~:Speech from the Tbrone.
This is what I ghould like te inquire: what
anount cf meney is the Administration
geing te ask from tbe country this year, and,
particularly, what application wvill it niake
of th is appropriation? As te the amnount, we
mcv. make up our minds that it wvill run
into the hundreds of millions. Last "0cr
the amnount was ever $300,000,000, and. according- te the budget as laid on the table.
the inmeuint appropriated for soldiers' !andl
settlemnent wvas $25,000,000. There is likelv
te be as much, if net more, this year. Tbe

its railways te expand, its soldiers te be

Dominion a great and wealthy country.
But, honourable gentlemen, te nîv mind
that is net sufficient. A country advances
net alone by material prosperity. There is
the superstructure which rnust be looked
after: the country musf be made net only
prospereus but alse enlightened. On cernparing what is being done tewvards the refinement of the country with ivhat is done
for its material presperity, I anm amazedindeed, a littie shocked. For exaniple. the
Astronomical Society gets $2,O00; that is,
outaide of what is necessarv te conduot the

gets $2,500, the Mining Institute $3,000,
and the Royal Society of Canada $4,000.

country, honourable gentlemen, let us nef

confine ourselves whelly te the material
part, but let us look to its mental qualities,
its seul; for a country, like an individual,
lias what in French is called "le genie d'un
pays." Let us give to the intellectual aspect
of the country the same encouragement as
we give to the material part. 1 know that
people will say that such encouragement
should be kift to initial efforts; but I would
poigit out that in *many instances personal
initiative is not sufficient to overcerne the
first difficulties. Why is protection in force

are bonuses granted te the steel industry?

inany ways fhelping private industry. What
1 ask of the Government is that it do sornething towards helping the intelligence of
the country.
I have mentîoned the Royal Society.
There may be sonie ameng you, there certainly are many persons in flhe countrv, who
do not know anything about the Royal Society. It was founded some thirty years ago
by Lord Lorne for the very purpose I arn advocatingm. That society is working under
great stress and difficulty, as you may well
imagine, on an expenditure of $4,000 a year.
For a society which has four branches, and
whose mnembers corne from every part of
the Dominion, is that sum adequate te the
resulfs we expect frorn it? I sav it is not:
we should do more. Witlî the small arniount
of material help it new receives, the Royal
Society can do no more than print its own
records. That is not tlie ultiniate object
of the seciety. It is composed of persons
%vho are among the very best frein the four
quarters of tlîis country. They corne froin
Britishî Celumbia, Nova Scotia, New~ Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario-in fact, from every
part of C.anada. They have te meet in
Ottawa at their ewn expense. Ail they can
do is to deliberate wvhen they are here, and
What
afterwards print their deliberations.
1 î%vould ask is that the Government
appropriate an adequate sum of money
-say $l0.000-to enable the Royal Socie.ty
to discover and assisf Canadiani talent and
bring if into the limelight. How rnany
young men are there in Canada te-day who
wiigo down te unknown graves, net having had an opportunity te develop the
niaenificent genius that lies latent within
thern because they have net had the material rneans te develop it? If $10,000 were
voted for ftle Royal Society, they could help
the poet, the historian, the novelist or the

SENATE

dramnatist to corne out with his first edition, and amon.- the mnanv who would be
helped would be somne geniuses who would
do honour to Canada. An appropriation of
that sort. honourable gentlemen, is what I
should like to see in the Estimat-es this year.
This question has been brought to my
mind particularly b-ecause I have noticed, as
honourable gentlemen also must have
noticed, that the staff of our Geological
Department has been depleted. Our savants
are leaving us, gentleman, and why? Because they are underpaid.
In this connection there is another matter
to which I should like to draw the attention of the Government. We had a commission who, thoug-h they did their best, seemed to ba unable to appreciate the difference between manual and intellectual work.
In the classification they took, no account
of that difference. I understand that that
error or injustice is now being- rernediad.
It is time.
Referring again to the Geological Survey,
1 find that this year six of their hast men
have leit the service of Canada. I have a
list of them; here they are: Reineeke,
Burling, O'Neill, Rose, Mackay, Haves, Cox.
Some of the hast equipped memibers of the
Geological Survey have left, and why? Because their salaries were too small. They

is a mistake, honourable -etii'eiiei. The
mnineral resources of Canada thra are known
to-day, and those whice entual1y will coule

534. This vear thev produced over $200,000,000. And we are just at the hegining.
Here let me relate an incident. I feel
somnewhat reluctant to do so, hecause we
are sometimes a littie severe when Government employees appear in the linmelight.
In the early days of the war, especially
when Russia began to lose ground, the British Govarnment was saeking the world over
for -petroleum oul which previously it had
go1 from the region of the Black sea. Bnitain first looked to ber dominions. Not
findinig what she required, the English
capitalists, wîth their millions of pounds
sterling, then went to Mesopotamia, South
and the
America, Nicaragua, Mexico,
United States in search of petroleum. Why
did they not corne to Canada? Bacause we
have no patroleumi oil, some will say. Truc,
we have not sucb fields of oil as may ha
found in some other countries. But that
was not the reason. At the beginning of
the war thée was a report printed in Canada which almost forbade English capitalists te coma and invest their money in this
Dominion. A book dealing with our resources in petroleumn and gas was publialied, from which the conclusion could ha
drawn that it was useleas for capitalists to
look to Canada for patrolaum in paying
quantities. I read the book, and I was s0
struck by the nature o! it, and the barm
that if could do to Canada, that I went in
search of further information. I found ouf,
honourable gentlemen, that the makers cf
the book wera alI foreigners-that there was
not a Canadian among them. The work was
clavanly done, and one of the greaf rasults
of it was that British capitalista, instead
of ccmning to Canada, wvent te other countries looking for petroleum. If some cf
theè men to whcm I have referred had not
been allowad to leave our service, if wve bcd
had our ow'n geologists* sucb a book would
nc f have heen wvritten, ai-d to-day millions
ef mnoney wculd ho coming tc Canada instead cf going te other parts of the world.
It is preposterous tc say that petroleumn cil
cannot he found in Canada. Providence bas
CiývCf us hcundless resources cf ahl kinds.
We have minerais such as are nct found in
amv other part cf the xvorld, and there is
iodoubt that eventually petroleumi will
lie found in this country in large quantifies.
This brings me again to the necessity cf
estabîlishing a strong and réliable Bureau
of Geologv. In the very province cf my honcurable friend the leader cf the Governmnent (Hon. Sir James Lougheed>), in Alberta. there was a great shortagZe cf water.

Hon. L. O. DAVID: Honaurable gentlemnen, I think. proper to commence by congratulatin-, the Govornment upon, the
appointmenta to tiiis Senate of the honourable the mover and the honouable, the
,secender cdf the Addxess. We on this aside
pOfthe House do not often have oocasion
ta congratulate the Go'vernrnent, so the
,Government must lie happy on ths o-casion, anid they deserve it. In this instance
they deserve to lie congratulated upon set-.
tin- -a good precedent, which. will be followed by this GPovernment and other Governments.
1 think I may say that the Government
has generally been happy in their choice
of members of this House. I see before
me several members whose views and opinions are worthy of consideration; but in
the appointment of the honourable gentleinan from Granville (Hon. -Mr. Chapais)
there is something out of the ordinary,
something characteristie. I amn happy to
see that his independence in certain circumstances was not an obstacle ta his appointmient. As the hionourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. '-\r. Dandurand) said. it was vers- well known that the
honourable miemiber for Granville could
have been appointed a inember of this
House, and could eveni have becomie a
member of the Governmrent. if hie had
.been willing ta follow the policy of the
Governmient upon the rnost important question of the time, namiely, conscription. 1
am glad that his independence was flot
deprive the country of bis services. The
province of Quebec las been happy to
hear of the appointment o! the hionourable
member for Granville, because in that promember for Granville, hecause in that province hie is recognized as one of our rnost
eminen't journalists and histerianis; and
those who heard hlm here the ot.her day

63

had an apportunity ta judge whether or
not he is a good speaker.
Now, 1 wjsh to say a few words upon the
remairks of! the honourable member for
Bedlord (Hon. Mr. Pope) and the henourable meintber ý,for Boissevain (Ho-n. Mr.
Schaffner) in reference ta the refusai o!
Sir Wilfrid Laurier to enter the Borden
Governanent. They spoke of the illustrious
dceasedl st.atesznan rwîth a good. deal o&
respect and symîpathy, but they blamed.
him for having- refused nt tihat time to
formn part o-f the Government, saying that
he was thereby refusîng ta promote what
they called the u'nity of Canada. Honourable gentlemen, I know the motives and
princîples which guîded Sir Wilfrid Laurier
upon that oooasion, and 1 have ne, hesitatien in saying tthat his motives and principles were good and noble-that owing to
the position which he had taken on many
occasions, and the declairations which he
.had m-ade, he wais in honour bound
to refuse to enter the Borden Govern.ment. As a matter of principle lie
had always been opposed. ta conscription as
being- a doeTcive
m-easure,
it was contrary ta his character and natural
disposition, of which he gave proof when in
the settiement of the Manitoba school question he refused to accept a policy which
could not lie put into execution without
coercing the province o! Manitoba.
At
the time when the Nationalists, supported
and'subsidized, marally and financially, by
the Conservative party, were denouncing
hlm as a traitor te Canada, -stating that hie
was preparing the way for conscription, lie
declared emphiatically that hie would neyer
be in favour of conscription and would aiways fight any measure o! that kind. Sa,
honourable gentlemen, being the man hie
was, how could hie repudiate his convictions
and declarations and jain the Borden Government? No, lie could not do it. Ia view
of the declarations of certain newspapers.
lie ivas under the impression, as wvas the
wliole province of Quebee. that conscription was directed particuiarly agaiast
that province. Those declarations aroused
a great deal of indignation throughout Quebec, and saine.Conservatives like Sir Alexander Lacoste and the honourable member
from Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) -%vere
also opposed ta conscription. How, then,
could Sir Wilfrid Laurier lie in favaur of
such a measure when his own province,
includiagc the Conservatives themscives.
were opposed ta it? Had he favoured conscription, lie would have loat his prestige
la the province of Quebec and left that

SENATE
province to the niercy of the ýagitators, al
to no purpose. He had always been of the
opinion that the voiuntary system was adequate to enflist ail the soidiers required at
the tirne; and when Canada had furnished
400,000 volunteers, he thought that number
was sufficient, or if it was not enough the
additionai men xieeded could be obtained
by the same system, without recourse to a
conscription measure. In that view he was
corroborated by the honourabie the Postmaster General (Hon. Mr. Blondin), who
expressed exactiy the same opinion in England or in France, I arn net sure which.
The Postmaster General had the courage
to say at that time that if the voiuntary
s3ystem had been properly carried on, the
Goverument -%vould have found the number
of men considered necessary.
Now, honourable gentlemen, were net the
views of Sir Wilfrid Laurier justified by
what took place? What has been the resuit of conscription? What was the resuit
of ail the trouble, agitation, discoutent,
which was created by that question through(,ut the whole of Car ada, and especially in
the province of Qtiebec. Out of 80,000 soldiers couscripted, how many went overseas? About 50,000. And how mauy of
those went to the battie front? Noue or
hardly any. So the voluntary system, which
would have cost oniy a fourth or a fifth,
would not have been ineffective. No, honourable gentlemen, in this case, as throughout his brilliant career, the illustrious deceased statesman did what he thought %vas
rigaht, according to his judgment and conscience. That xviii be the verdict of bistory.
I desire now to say a few words on the
question of the tariff. I intended saying
more, but have decided for several reasons
net to make a long- speech. I want to explain iwhy I approve of the remnarks made
by the honourabie leader of the House (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed), when in his strong
speech he said it was absolutelv necessaryto the prosperity of the country to maintaîn
industries. I thought that the remarks of
the honourable leader of the House appiied
to what we cail manufactured products. I
have always been, and arn stili, of the opinion that ail our manufactured produets cannet compete with those of the United States
without a certain degree of protection. I
was of that opinion 50 years ago. Iu 1870.
'71, '72 and '73, in a newspaper cailed
L'Opinion Publique, which I pubiished at,
that time, I commenced to express those
views, declaring that if we xvould stop the

honourabie gentlemen, that sinee that
time our industries have grewn, and our
mianufacturers are better able te compete
xvith the Americans. There are undoubtediy a number of products in which we eau
compete; but we must determine which
products they are. Investigation alone will
furnish that information; so I would flot
like to express a definite opinion on this
question before that investigation bas been
made.
When the tariff of 1878 -as .adopted I cong7atulated the Goverument, although I was
an oppenent. And, honourable gentlemen, I
have no hesitation in saying that we in
Canada owe in great part to that tariff the
industrial prosperity of our country; that
it has enabled our manufacturers to provide millions of shelis and munitions for
war purposes, and te pay high wages to our
workingînen, besides bringing« to our Goverument in the iast 40 years many millions
of dollars to speud for the progress and
prosperity of the northwest provinces.
Now, we must admit that the idea of establishing free trade cornes fromn the Northwvest. The f act is that a great mauy of our
troubles coule from the Northwest.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Hear, hear; the
Hudson Bay raiiway.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: There are strong- men
in the West, with strong wills, and some
amongst them waut everything for their
province-everything and sornething more.
They want cheaper rates fromn the railways
and higher prices for their wheat, and they
are in favour of the nationalization of railways and free trade, although it is net certain that such a policy will give themn -%hat
they expeet, and althoughi it may flot bo in
the general interest of Canada. They do
net seem to realize that f ree trade would
liamper the industrial interests of the old
provinces, xvhich have neyer hesitated to
spend many millions to promote the progress and prospcrity of the Nerthwest. The
provinces of the.Northwest are the daughtors of the old provinces, and they. cannot
complain that their infancy bas been neglected or that the mother provinces have
net doue ail they ought to have doue for
them. Se I thiuk the daughters oughit net

te do anythiug that wouid check the prosperity of the mother provinces.
But, honourable gentlemen, I

arn

sure

there are enougha reasonabie men in this

mARCU- 9, 1920
bouse and throughout the country to realize that Canada cannot prosper and attain"
its higl destiny unless the different provinces of which it is composed consider and
do what its general welf are and their
mutual interests require. A policy of selfishness would be a policy of destruction.
You will find that in this respect the province of Quebec will take a wise and patriotic position. If there are certain industries upon which the customs duties could
be reduced-and I think there are--there
are others that require more protection in
order to enable them to increase their production and to manufacture some of our
raw material which is manufactured in the
United States to the detriment of our
country and in the intereat of American
manufacturera and workingmen.
What has happened in the United States
may perhaps happen in Canada. You know
the history of the United States, and you
remember t1hat there was a tirne when the
western and southern states were opposed
to protection, and did everything they could
to defeat the Bills which were brought hofore Congress for the purpose of establishing a protective tariff. What was the outcorne? Manufacturera established themselves
in those states, and then they favoured
a protective tariff. I think the same thing
will happen in this country-that before
long rnanufacturing wiIl become established
in the prairie provinces, and the people
o! those provinces will then be in favour
of a certain amount of protection.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There are a good
xnany of them there now.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I suppose so.
Well, honourable gentlemen, I think that
is enough for to-day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Go on. You are
doing wvell.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Here is an incident
that may interest you. I remiember that
in 1878, when I was living in Ottawa, I
had occasion every day to see the Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie, who was at the time Prime !%inister of Canada. It was duringa bis recreation period. He used to send for me to
corne and play quoits with him on the spot
where the Queen Victoria monument la
erected. Three or four months before the
elejetion of 1878 lie asked me what w-as my
opinion as to the result. I said: " Mr.
Mackenzie, I will give you rny opinion, but
as I do not apeak English very fluently,
perhaps I had better write it out." I wrote
out for himn what I thouglit, namely, that

if he went to the people, especially at that
time, which was a period of financial crisis,
he would be defeated, and 1 gave him my
reasons. When I met him I handed him
the paper. The following day, when we
were playing our game of quoits, he said:
-I read your letter, Mr. David. It is not
«"Well," I said, ««I told
encouraéing."
He asked me:

surnptuous enough to tell you what you
ought to do." Two or three months after
the election I met him. He was very sad,
do
poor man. I said: -"I not presumne to
think that I was alone in giving you the
opinion I did." '<But," he said, " you offered yourself as a candidate." «'That is
quite true, Mr. Mackenzie," I said. «'I ran
as a Liberal protectionïst in a Liberal
county, and I would have been elected if
on the last Sunday before the election the
county had flot been invaded by the most
eloquent speakers of the Conservative party, who told the people, «If you want protection, it will not be suffliint to elect Mr.
David or two or three Liberals; you must
change the Government.' And the eletors were convinced that they were right."
I had corne to the conclusion that my delest wvas the resuit of that. At that time
it was said, "Oh, the farmers and the
working-men will vote for a free-trade
policy." Do you know what happened?
When the elections came, the farmers and
the wvorkingmen were easily convinced that
a protective tariff would benefit ail classes
of society; that it would give to the farmers the best mnarkets possible, home and
worknational markets, and to the
ingamen work at remunerative wages.

working-men employed in the numerous
nianufactories which would. be unable to

ufacturers'
know that they are opposed to reciprocity.
They would close their doors, and we would
leave ours open to their products. What
would be the result? If the balance of
trade against us it so great now, what
would it be if they could dump their products upon our mnarkets? What would
become of ail those thriving towns and
villages in the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, which, as I have said, to a great
extent owe their prosperity to the tariff,

enough to protect our manufacturers? If
we had absolute free trade. perhaps I would
flot take exactly the saine position. But
even if there were reciprocity, I think a
good number of our industries would not
be able to, compete wjth American industries. But we know very well that we can
have rio reciprocity now. Look* at what
toei< place in 1911, when the Reciprecity
The
'Treaty was laid before Parliament.
Laurier Governrnent thought it would be
accepted by the manufacturers, because it
applied only to natural products. But it
was- rejected by the manufacturers, and the
Government. flot being able to have it
adopted by Parliament, appealed to the
people, and the people voted against the
policy o! the Government.
Later on, I arn sure that we will have an
opportunity to express our views, and then,
1 will say what I think of that important
question. As I have said, henourable gentiement, I arn sure that the province of
Quebec will do its duty on that question or
on any other question. The province of
Qu.ebec is proud ef Canada, and is convinced that the progress o! Canada depends
upen the progreas of each of its provinces
and the development of its natural resources. The province et Quebec knowB
that a policy of selfishness will be a policy
of destruction.
Hon. ARTHUR BOYER: Honourable gentlemen, I arn glad, following the custom,

I would have liked te have sEýen a cheerful word in the Speech from the Throne

MARCH 9, 1920
to say that by proper economny the country
would pull through-that the country, owing
te its resources and owing te the people in
it, is able te face any over issue et notes
that may have been muade. El have asked
ail my banking triends how we are teo over-cerne the over-issue, to meet the enormoue
payrnents that had te be muade during t.he
wa.r. I have seen three or tour cierks go

$60,000, and ask for 10,000 ones, 10,000 twos,

We had 6uch. enornieus wage bis to pay
that the only way te pay them was by
paper me.ney backed by -the people and the
enormeus reseurces et Canada. We have: an
over-issue granted; but even in better times
we neyer had more security for eur paper
money than 50 cents on the dollar. If the
security is esomewhat iew te-day we have
the people behind it, .and Vhey wouid neyer
ailow Canadian money te go te protest. We
have nerve eneugh in Canada to defend our
own, and sin-ce we have done our duty
during the war, I think te the st penny
we own we will see that our currency goes
at par, and that every cent et our liabilities
is provided for.
Coming te another point. To meet this
obligation we have te save our reseurces.
We are always using the words "unlimited
reseurces." Axe our resources s0 uniimited?
I would like te draw attention to the faet
that one et the great resources ot this
country, when first it was conquered, was
its fur-bearing animais. What hbas become
et theru' At first they were te be found
at the very doors et Quebec and Montreal?
Gradually expansion Look place and they
were killed off, and new What do we see?
No later than February last, at an auction
sale of furs in St. Louis, 1,500.000 skins were
sold. How long wouid the resources o! any
country stand such a slaughter? How long
are we going to allow such a 'state of things
to continue? I amn sorry te say that aimost
one-third, if net one-haît, et the turs that
were sold in that enormous sale wvere provided by the Dominion et Canada. How
long is the enorinous resource et our turbeaning animais geing te la.st if we do net
put a stop te this slaughter? A tew years
ago we passed a law in this House prohibiting ladies froru wearing feathers on their
hats; why? Because the birds et every
known country were being destroyed. What
is the trouble te-day? They are actually
destroying- every tur-bearing animal, net
only in Canada, but in the United States
and the rest et the wiorid; and the rena.rk

was muade, after that enorinous sale in
St. Louis, that those 1,50l,000 skins
amounted. te haif of the skins of the furbearing animais throughout the worid.
Then, what do we see? You reniember thehumble skunk that was taboc and frei
which everybody flew. To-day it is popular.
And tJhe poor muskrat which was so neglected in bygone days-to-day its fur is one
oi the most popular you can possibiy set
your eyes on. As Brother Jonath.an said
te his daughter going -te a bail1, "My dear,
you must have a dress on; but you have
a fox-skin around yGur neck -- and it was
in the mniddle of the aummer.
In this country we have a Conservation
Commission for which we pay $42,500 a
year. Have they taken a single step towarde drawing the attention flot oniy ot
Canada but of all the civiiized werid to the
enormous destruction of fur-bearing animais? Some fit teen or, twenty years ago 1
used te go to 8ome lumber camps in
northern Quebec, where fur-bearing animais were very pientiful. Not later than
iast year I made the sarne trip. I went
even t arther north, and neyer met even a
squirrei. When I asked the shantymen,
"Do you ever see any fur-bearing animais?"
they said, "No, we don't know what bas
become of theru; we very seidom come
across a mink, a martin, or a squirrei; they
are ail gone."
Another thing that we are wasting, shamefully wasting, is our timber resources.

that come into your hands go unread. When
you take a paper of 42 pages, you simply

servant, "What are we going to do with
this pile oi newspapers?" There is no way
of getting rid of theru. Then, they are se

appointed, and they made a thoreugh study
of the questien. What was the report?
There are five different kincis of salmen frequenting the rivera ef British Columbia;

you, bonourable gentlemen, a word ef warning, coming from tlbe fariner:
For sound common sense on this subject,
probably the declaration of the Pennsylvania

69

State Grange is the rnost convincing that lias

bee thus far expressed. This was appreved by
the farmers present at the Convention In
Philadelphia on the 14th Inst. and was as follows:
"The farmer la neither an object of DltY nor
a subject for charity. He la net asking for
special favors nor class legisiation. He lias

The' Grange seeks the 'greatest good te the
greatest number,' and believes that this principle eniglit well lie fellowed by our lawmakers.
It Is neither riglit nor just for our national
Cong-ress te enact iaws for a few at the expense
of the many. Arbitration la the only fair and
just means ef settlUng disputes when the parties
therete cannet agree. No legisiation should lie
enacted that even tends te create class feeling
or widen the breach whieh new existe between

Gevernment te even attempt te fix a wage scale

"Should the law be applled te agriculture -or

This was said by the Pennsylvania State

been badly treated-rudely answered. But
that was the only answer ta the very impudent request that the Government stop
the export of ail agricultural products so
that one class might benefit ta the detriment of the other.

There I draw the line. It bas been a great
surprise tbrougbout the world ta see. that
such a small country as -Canada could passess a fleet of 30 or 40 mnerchant vessels
fiying the Canadian fiag. It hias been
displayed as far away as Brazil and
lias attracted. tbe admiration af a Brazilian
wVhom I have seen. He said, "\Ve had no
idea that Canada possessed such a fleet."
One vessel camne back from Brazil with a
cargo of sugar on which tihe ireight paid

get's the -money-amounted to $380,000. Part
of t.hat cargo was discharged in the city of

01 course, this fine fleet is well manned.
Accidents wili bappen in the best regulated

fali, whlen two brand new vessels on their
inaiden trip were sent out from Quebec late
in December, one of Vhem as late as* the
20tb, and the ather -in the 23rd. What was
the consequence? Whereas none of the aid
shipping- campanies ever dared ta send a
ves6el out o! Quebec later than the 4th or
5th ai December, these vessels loaded witih
their valuabde cargoes were despatchied fromn
Quebee nearly three weeks later. Tbe consequence was that one o! them, with a
cargo wblch, I arn taid was valued at threequarters of a million dollars, ils now lying
high and dry on the rocks at the entrance,
,or a littie east of the entrance, of the
Sagfuenay river. It is compieteiy lost, body

thiree weeks, the crew as weil as the vessel
and the cargo in danger of being lost. The
ice-breaker MÙontcalmý, by sheer piuck and
endurance, managed to break a way throughi
ta the vessel and got hier 6afely into Pictou
or Sydney, where she couid coal, and then
into Halifax. The whole cargo had ta be
unloaded and the vessel put into drydock,
and it was only on the let day of February
thai the cargo was being- re-shipped. Two
or three months' loss of time, at an enormous
cost to the country. 0f course, we must learn
by experience. The oniy way to prevent
those things is not ta take the risk.
There was anather marine loss to whieh
I would draw the atention of this House.
For the last forty or fifty years the Canadian Government has had a marine agency
in the good old city of Quebec. 0f course,
the good aid city of Quebec has one great
quaiity which my friend on the other side
would cail a great fault: It ils a great Liberal city. It had to be punished in same
wav or other. Almost three-quarters of the
business that agency did in supplying lighthouses tbroughout the guli of St. Lawrence
wvas taken away from Quebec. We neyer
said a word. You are welcome ta it. Let
the poorer neighbours have it. It was transferred ta Charlottetown in Prince Edwçard
Island. A very fine vessel called the Arranmare, which. supplîed the lighthouses, was
sent from Charlottetown loaded with a most
valuable cargo, ta replenish the different
stores in ail the lighthouses in the straits
of Belle Isle and east of the gulf of St.
Lawrence. Through misfortune-or was it
lack of knowledge on the part of the captain?-for some reasan or another, the vessel' ran aground. A wireless message was
sent ta the Montcalm, and it came, but the
captain declares that it took a fool ta get
inta such a position as the captain of the
Arranmore was in. -"Let hirn get out,"~ he
said; -"I will not risk my vessel.-' The
consequence was that part of the cargo had
ta be jettisoned. The vessel was pulled
out and towed ta Harringaton, where it wvas
beached. Harrington is a sm-ail port in the
straits of Belle Isle, I believe. It is not
an the chart. That ils where the Arranrnore
is lying to-day. The consequence was that
eight of the most valuable lighthouses in
the gui! of St. Lawrence had ta be closed.
In past years the crews were always left in
those lighthouses, so as ta be ready for the
opening of navigation in the spring. Owing
to the wreck of the Arranmore and the loss
of bier cargo, the Government had ta send
another vessel from St-. Johns, Newtoundland, away out east into the Atlant;c. ta
work lier way into the straits -of Belle Isle

MARCH 9, 1920
and rescue the crews, and, as I say, close
up eight of the most valuable lighthouses
in the straits of Belle Isle, and at the entrance of the gui! of St. Lawrence.
Honoiirable gentlemen, if you consuit the
archives of the Department of Marine and
Fisheries, so far as the Quebec agency is
concernied, you will find that neyer in the
history of the department has such an accident happened. The Quebec agency aiways took the bull by the horns. They saw
that the provisions were sent out in time s0
that the crews should be arnply provided
for for a very long and severe winter, and
so that the lighthouses might be kept in the
very best state of repair.
0f course, those are accidents. I siinply
mention tihem casually. They wil. happen
even in 4he -best-r.egu.lated Goverrnent. But
we should t.ake no risks in the future. Ships
should hoe propexly manned and properly
coxnmanded. We should see that they geV

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN:- Honourable

gentlemen,
The leader of the Government is usually
very good, and, ii 1 were allowed unt-il to.morzow, I might have some very nice things
to say about him in my speech. But he will
now have Vo miss Vhem.
The time-honoured custom is to congratu.
late at the very outset the proposer and
,the seconder of the Address. I think that
is very fitting and right. But along with
the congratulations we must remember that
the speeohes o! the mover and t.he seconder
are a sort of amplification of the Speech
say, the gentlefrom the Throne. That is Vto
men who move and second the Address are

71

supposed Vo explain more fully the things
said, or left unsaid, in the Speech from tbe
Throne.
The proposer o! the Address, the honourable gentleman from Goderich (Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot), is an old parliamentarian. Anyone reading his speech would know at once
that ho had been making speeches for a
long time in the halls of Parliament. I
forione welcome bim niost heartily Vo this
Chamber. He was an old Liberal coming
in, tbough here, forsootb, we have no
politics. The honourable gentleman bas
been a Liberal all his life. Ho was a Liboral when the convention assembled in bis
county and chose bim as the candidate o!
bis party. Ho defeated the Tory candidate
and went to the Ontario leg-islature, wbore,
during many sessions, ho provod bimself
Vo bo an exceptionally good man. When
our esteemed friend, the Hon. Newton
Wesley Rowell, ef t that legislature-wbere,
I must say, ho had not achieved so very
much-and came bore, it becarno necessary
Vo find a leader for the Liberal party in
Ontario, and iA was tbougbt that no botter
man could be found tban the bonourable
gentleman from Goderich. Consequently
ho Vook that position. If ho bad only kept
the position o! leader of the Liberal party,
well and good. But thore was a moment
wben ho faltered in bis Liberal faith,
when ho sort of backslided, as it wore, and
abandoned the policy o! bis old leader at
a moment when that policy was not popular througbout this country-aV ail events
in eight out of the nine provinces in the
Dominion.
Wben the imo came for the Liberal
party to select a new leader, the bonourable
gentleman was passed over, and my good
old friend, niy brilliant friend, Hartley
Dewvart, was selected as leader o! the Liboral party in the grand old province of Ontario, and my bonourable !riend opposite
becamne a candidate as an independent Liboral in bis county, but ho was defeated by
a farmer. The Liberal party, headed by
Mr. Dewart, was almost victorîous, and if
my bonourable frîend had remained in the
faitb there are many who believe, in view
of what bas taken place, that the bonouraie entleman would bave been the Prime
'iinistex of the province from wbich ho
cornes. But ho had losV the leadership of
that party.
The reward of Mr. Dewart was well deserved, because, during the last campaign,
when Sir Wilfrid Laurier left Ottawa to
travel across the continent, many of us knew
that ho was figbting for a lost cause.

SENATE
The (lear old chieftain took us into bis
confidence, and when we were saying
that there was good iiews here and there,
he reinarked: "With such a Franchise Act
as we have, it w'ould be a miracle if the
Ge)vt-inmnent were flot sustained by a large
xiajorý*ty." But that did flot prevent Mr.
Dewart froin accompanying his chief.
Then there was the Hon. Walter Mitchell,
Provincial Treasurer of Quebec, a gentleman who, ever since he has held that
office, has shown great surpluses. notwithstanding the many great 'improvements
made in that province, such as good roads,
which are the envy of every other province. In Quebec we have to-day over 2,200 miles of macadamized roads, and many
other good roads which, if flot up to the
main standard, are better than those in
most of the other provinces. Mr. Mitchell
accompanied Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr.
Dewart. When we think o! that tour and
of the ovations that the old gentleman received in ail parts o! the country, we do
not regret for one moment that we were
with him, even though it was a losing
fight.
In the great convention that took place in
this city last suinmer, the greatest convention that any political party bias ever held
in this country, with delegates from the
Yukon to Prince Edward Island. right over
the stage from which the speakers addressed
the meeting wvas a portrait of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. There was his smiling countenance, and it looked as if he were smiling at
every one in the convention. What was the
result of the convention? One wvho bad
been faitbful and true to the o]d chief, the
Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie King, was
~unanimously elected leader of the partv.
and hie now sits in the place w\herc the
grand old chieftain sat for se inanx v.ears.
Who is this Mr. King? Honourable gentlimen miay rememiber that Mr. King was
for some vears in the United States. Hox
did he ha[?pen te be there? It m

The be-t -student that ever went throuffgh

States and thiere he made geed for those
w-ho empluYted him for se inany years.
Later on thiere w-as a meeting in the ity of
Noew York, at which four hundred cenomnists were present, men selected

as great

captains of industry in the.United States.
This meeting was presided over by the
president of a great industrial corporation,
with whom I have the honour of being
pei'sonally acquainted.
The chiairman, in
presenting Mr. Mackenzie King te the
audience, said: "Gentlemen, I will now cal
upon Mr. Mackenzie King te address yen.
the man that 1 consider to be the greatest
ecenornist in America."
The Liberal party of this country have
been very fortunate indeed in securing the
services of a man of the strength and the
knowledge of economie questions that MAr.
King bias; and, although it ineant a great
personal and financial sacrifice, that did
net deter hlm when the Liberal party selected him to lead theni, in the belief that
ne 'matter how bigbly he might have been
paid in the United States, ne muan was tee
geod te fill the place of the late Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. I ask this honourable Huse, and
if I w'ere in the other House 1 should ask
the saine question: is there in Canada a
inan better fitted te deal wîth the burning
question of the day, the labour problem? 1
de net believe there is. Mr. Mackenzie King
hias devoted mucb time and study te this
preblem. I heard him in the city of Montreal address an enormous meeting on the
righits and privileg-es o! labour and of capital. He spoke of the four partners te industry-he has written a book on the question
-- and that audience, which. atfirstwouldnot
allow him even to mention the word capital,
whien he had explained, was convinced that
capital had sonie rights, and that labour
could ne more do without it than capital

could do without labour.
The proposer of the Address made a very
good speechi. As I have said, he is an old
parliamentarian. He spoke of the cevenant of the League of Nations. Last year 1
speke at length on that subject, and it is
net mny intention te cever the sanie greund
agaîn. However, I may say that 1 do net
thinlc anything bas cbanged since I made
iny speech. I think Canada is still a colony, and, as a colony, had ne right te ho
directly represented. We are stili a dependent part of the British Empire, thahik
God, and we have ne vote in the counicil of
the Leag-ue of Nations, se mucb the wverse
for us. My opinion on this point is entertained by manx' people, and, if the time
were net se short, 1 could quot(, a good

MARCH 9, 1920
miany authorities whio would support my
view. But. though we have flot a vote, we
have to assumne large obligations. We have
nothing to say as to what those obligations
are to be. We were flot consulted, and it
might as well be admitted that wvhen the
five great Powers-Great Britain, France,
Italy, the United States, and Japan--were
negotiating, our representatives, wvho were
in Paris for sonie months, knew what was
taking place only fromn what they read in
the newspapers. That being so, they haid
naturally no voice in deciding anything, and
our people, and the people of Australia,
New Zealand, and South Africa, knew about
it as wvell as anybody else. Anyone could
buy Le Petit Parisien and read it.
I
challenge anyone to say that the contrary
is true. Our representatives might have had
a littie chat in private with Mr. Lloyd
George or Mr. A. J. Balfour, but that did
flot entitie them to know what wvas going on
behind closed doors. They stayed at a very
nice hotel, and waited there for news.
The honourable gentleman -,%ho moved the
Address spoke about Canada'e relations with
the world, and ver 'v properly so, because
now that we have signed the covenant of
the League of Nations, we thînk we are,
although wc are not, a world power, and
that we have a right to have relations with
other nations. A child qualifying for diplomacy in the very first year w'ould know
that that was impossible, because no
munication whatever can be had by comthis
Governmnent with any other government,
except through the British ambassador.
It would be almost a casus belli if anyone
were so, bold as to attempt it. They say that
Sir Auckland Geddes, who was to be the
principal of the University of McGill, is to
lie the British arnbasador at WVashington,
and is to receive a salary of £20,000 a year.
If he was to he the principal of McGiIl, hie
niust know something of Canada, and evidently it is thoughit that he can represent
Great Britain and ail lier dependencies, including Canada.
The proposer of the Address goes on to
,say that hie feels confident that British
statesmen in their wisdom Nvill soon be
establishing equal citizenship for ail subjeets under the Imperial Crcown. These
are the very words that the honourable
gentleman used. What does "equai citizen-,
ship"' mean, and in what wav shahl we
have equal citizenship? Can you have
equal citizenship when you have no vote
and the people in the British Isles do all
the voting' The only way to have equal
citizenshiÎ, would be to establishi an Jm-

73

perial parliam'ent in which the 13,000,000
*white people outside of the British Ilies,
constituting at least 33 per cent of those
coming under the Ixnperial Parliament,
would be represented. Mark you, it would
be a parliament for Imperial affairs only,
and the people might -have as many local
governmenta as they wished. I hear there
wvill be two for the people of Ireland: one
foi the north, wrhere they may worship
King William, and one for the south,
,where they inay worship the Pope. Very
well: if there vvere also a parliament for
Wales-where the Anglican church hias
recently been disestahli8hed-and one for
England and one for Scotland, that would
make only five, and there are 40,000,000
people in the United Kingdom. It must be
remembered that in this country, with a
population of less than 8,000,000, we support nine provincial governments besides
a Federpl Government. If we can support
ten, surely the people of the British Empire,
can have as many as they like. But for
Imperial aff airs, if we are to give our sons
and to contrîbute our money and to take
part in this League of Nations, surely there
should be an Imperial parliament in which.
our delegates, even though they rnight be
voted down, would at least have the right
to express our opinion. There are eminent
persons in England, such as professors of
law, professors in universities, students of
political economy, etc., who say that the
position of the Dominions to-day la quite
unsatisfactory. However, I will flot anticipate. for 1 may corne to that question tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does the hon ourable
gentleman say that we have no representation in the League of Nations? I understood hlm to refer only to the Council; but
that la another matter.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps I amn
speaking a little too fast or too loud. What
I did say was this: that we have no vote
in any Imperial matterHon. Mr. FOWLER: I thoughit you were
discussing the League of Nations.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN :-and tliat, although we belong to the Empire-for my

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, but there -will

Spain wil have a nomination, and possibly
a Spaniard will be elected as one of the
four. Weil, since we are going to discuss
this 'League of Nations, and we have plenty
of time anyway, let us get right down too
the bettomn of it. I xnow somiething about
it; I have been studying it ever since it
was first mentioned. There are 50 or, to
bie exact. 51 o! what we may cail independent nations; but, as you are aware, there
are only eight nations in the world that
count fer anything: -there are the five great
powers; then there are Germany and Russia
and Austria as it was before it was dismembered. Austria to-day is a very small
country.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do flot ag-ree with
that.
Hon. 'Mr. .CASGRAffN Well, th.at is the
fact. There are only eight big nations in
the worild, and they represent over 90 per
cent o! the people of the earth. The other
nations represent about 10 per cent, or, il
you ivant te be exact, il per cent. 1 have
ail the figures in this book, right here, but
I will not take the time to quote them now.
1 -will perhaps read from it to-morrow if 1
do not finish to-day. The.se eight nations
ruie the world. 0f course, there is China,
which is a vast country; but China is flot
active in politics, and the population of
China is rather doubtful; and China is
left out of the question. But, even if you
added China te the other nations outside
of t.hose eight great powers, tbey would
not constitute 20 per cent. Taking fromn
the totad of 51 the eight large countries,
there is *it a total o! 43 smali countries.
In the League there are te be representatives
of the five great nations, and the other
countrie-s are entitied t.e appoint four rnembers, each representirig a particular group
of small nations. The suprene Council wili
then have a membership of nine. 0f course,
there will have te be a change if Germany
cornes in, or if Ilussia enters when it

becomes sane. The constitution wiii probabiy have te be amended se as te make
roorn for them. That is exactly the situat.ion. As 1 have Gaid, those eight great
nations gevern the world, and they represent the immense majority. I can give to
the honourable gentleman (Hon. '-\I. Few1er), if hie likes, the populations of those
countries. The British Empire bas over
400,000,000; the United States bas over 100,000,600; ]Russia 175,000,000; France 42,000,000 new; Italy about 30,000,000; Japan about
45,000,.000. Il you add these figures together,
vou will find the total population of those

talk about a "nation" when they mean a
state. May I be allowed te quote this:

a citizen of a state.

We in Canada are members o! a nation,

King of the Hedjaz, and has in his

much stronguer race than those o! the southern part. Those 67,000,000 Moslems rule in
that country, which contains altogether a
population o! 313,000,000. The Viceroy cf
India cannot refuse te hear that petition
o! the Moslems, and to send it to
the home Government, because it would
never do te antagonize 67,000,000 o! the

have allies outside o! Afghànistan, outside

Troops bave to be kept there. Lord Milner
has been sent out, but he bas not accomplished much; and to-day the power and
.sovereignty of England in Egypt is weaker
than it has been for sorne time. Then,
passing from Egypt into India, especially
into Afghanistan, what do we find? lni
that country the natives are just waiting to
see whether anything is done to the Father
of the Fai-thful. So England cannot supply
,all tihe soldiers necessary to frighten the
,Turks, who, by the way, are flot so easily
frightened. Then there is a place flot far
fromr Exigland where tihere is at present
plenty of trouble, and where, according to
the staternent of a minîster of the Crown
made in the House of Commons within the
last 48 hours, there are 200,000 people ready
to commit murder night and day. So we,
being a partner in tl'ie League, rnay be
called upon to send soldiers to Constantinople.
What is this military dernonstration for?
It is to regulate the internai affairs of Turkey. I amrnfot here to defend the Turks but 1 may say there are two side.s to the
question. Not very rnany years ago it was
my good fortune to meet a naval attaché of
one of the big powers, who had spent several
years at Constantinople. He had just returned frorn there, having been made an
attaché at Washington as a reward for the
services he had rendered. It appears that
the Embassy at Washington is the prize or
the plumn of the service. I could give the
narne of this gentleman, but perhaps I had
better not. As I say, he had been living in
,Constantinople for several years; he had
been in communication wit~h Effendi Pasha;
and he explained the cause of the Armenian
massacres and how they were provoked.
Uusually the first step in tihese uprisings
,in Turkey is the outraging or ravishing of

of Allah and the fountain from which
springs forth the sons of the prophet, and

cry of the holy war. It inay appear very
strange to us that this should start a
massacre. But we have flot to look very
far, -only to the Sout'hern. States, to see what
happens when a white woman or girl is
outraged by a negro. The wlhole community
rises, and lynch law is in force for the
time being. Very often, if the offenders are

77

not lynched, they are burned at the stake.
We do not take up our guris and say to the
Yankees, -"You must stop this." The Arýnenians, for some reason or other best
known to English politicians, have been
held up to us as a much-abused people; but
sometimes they get no more tihan they deserve.
There is another featuie to this question.
Tgrkey is flot subdivided into farma. If
there is a fertile spot in the country the
Turks will move there andplant their crops.
It appears that when the crops ripen the

and realize meney on thern at once. But
they do *not go very far with the money,
because the Greeke corne along and take it
frorn them. The Turks, however, wreak
their vengeance on the Armenians.
If We are going to police Turkey and the
Balkan States it will keep us busy, and
with no results, because we cannot change
these people. If I had my choice I do flot
know that I should prefer the Armenians
to the Turks. I have just read a book by a
professor who conducts a-very large university in Turkey. He says that the Turk,
provided you do not rouse him, or do anything to cause a religious war, is a very
peaceable man. One of my sons, who was on
the island of Lemnos in the Gulf of Salonika
duriflg fine rnonths of the war, said that
the Turks were the fairest and best fighters
that could be found. He said that when
our troops were leaving the shore of the
Gallipoli peninsula the Turks could have
slaughtered and killed every one of them.
But evidently they said, "«If you want to
go, you can go;" and 200,000 men left the
shores safely. Do you think the Germans
would have done anything like that? No,
they would have slaughtered every man.
I could name men who have been prisoners of the Turks. They were treated wvell,
especially the officers. Why should we be
called upon by this Leag-ue of Nations to
send men to regulate the internai affairs of
Turkey? That is what we have corne to by
our meddling with things that do flot concern us.
Now, what about Russia? During the war
Great Britain had a special department in
the War Office to look after Russian affairs.
The men in that departrnent knew more
about Russian affairs than the British Cabinet did, because it was their particular
business. They were men who spoke the language, and who were in constant intercourse
with the Russian people. They sent memorandumn after memnorandumn to the British

the Session.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, in speaking yesterday without
preparation I gave sorne figures as to the
population of the world. I was quoting
from memory. If I may be permitted I
will read a few linos fromn a book entitled
'The Bulwark of Poace " which is written
by Heber Hart, 'who is a Doctor of Law of
the University of London, and the recorder
of Ipswich. After reading in the London
Times an a.ccounit of a speech which I made
in this Senate, he sent a ccpy of bis book
to me, saying that I might find corne argument in iL. It says:
There are etill. it ta true. over tIf ty eeparate
states with more leue free and uncontrolled
governmente of their own. But of the 1,73 4
million people, or thereabouts, who constitute
the total population of the globe, about 1,450
millions, or five-sixths of the whole, are governed by the sovereign authorities of the eight

Powers and China.

and that of the Powers without China about

time had resigned his judgeship, and who
hms since resig-ned from this body to aecept
another judgeship.
Granville is probably the only division
which, since Confederation, had always
been represented in this Chamber by a
man of the Liberal persuasion. The electoral batties hetween the Honourable Mr.
Chapais,the father of the present incumbent

for
Letellier de St. Just are legendary in the
province of Quebec. Many years after
these two great men had disappeared from
the political arena the electors o! the county
wvere stili calling each other Letelliers and
Chapais's. I remember that in 1872 in
Kamouraska-it was open voting thenan old man was brought in to vote and was
asked, -"Whom have you been brought in to
vote for?" H1e would say, -"Chapais." He
would be told, -"Heis flot running," and the
man would say: " That does not make any
difference; if he is flot running I ar n ft
voting." The elections were so hot, that
Karnouraska was actually disfranchised
upon the pretext o! riots in the county,
which I suppose is the only example o! the
kind in the records of Parliament.
In his eloquent address the othefr day the
honourable gentleman spoke at length of
the r.e-establishment o! the soldiers on the
land, and instanced a case of more than
two hundred years ago, in 1667, when Talon,
'«ho was then governor o! New France, demobilized the regiment of Carignan Salières

As there are 365 days in a year, the deficit
of $30,M0O,0OO means that we are losing
every day $82,191.78. In other words, stating it in hours, we are losing because of the
pleasure of being railway operators, S3,424.65 an hour, or $57 a minute. That is
only on the Canadian National railways as
we own themn to-day. What will be the loss

refer to Hansard, you w'ill flnd that xny
estimate of the deficit on the Canadian
Northern Railway systemi xas S30,0OO,OOO.
It may have been luck, but my estirnate
appears to have turned out right. But how
much would it be for betterments; for the
necessary rolling stock, which is becoming
obsolete every day; for repairs; for stations
and sidings and workshops; for locomotivçs; and, last but flot least, for the upkeep of the hotels-the Chateau Laurier in
Ottawa, the Fort Garry in Winnipeg, the
Macdonald in Edmonton? If there is a
place where there can be a leakage, it is
certainly a hotel. But those hotels are
going to be dry, so 1 suppose there will
be no leakage. I have always been told
that dry hotels did flot pay; that the great
bulk of the money made in hotels was
made over the bar by the sale of strong
stuif. Well, there ought to be a large deficit, then. If private individuals cannot
run dry hotels without a loss, what will the
Government do?
I heartily approve of Mr. Hanna trying
to keep the railways out of politics, but
how will fie do it when Parliament has to
provide the necessary funds to meet the
deficit and for additional capital? The othier
day Mr. Hanna, in the city of Ottawa,
made a most interesting speech before the
Canadian Club, in which he said that if the
rates prevailing in Australia were applied
to the National railways of Canada, there
would be enough profit to pay the interest
on the war debt, and over and above that,
there would be a surplus of $1OO,0O0,O00
Well, honourable gentlemen,

that shows us wbat Government operation

to that extent. .Hiowever, Mr. Hanna gives
the figures and makes comparisons, etc.,
and I think be arrives at the correct conclusion. If the farmers of the Northwest.
with their long haul, wanted Governiment
operation, they now have what they wanted,
and they must not whine. If they are going
to pay for what thcy have got, they must
pay much hig-her than at presenit. That
is what the people of Australia have been
doing, and you will notice that the population of Australia has not been increasingI
but has been almost stagnant, under government ownership, because there bas been
no incentive in governiment operation to
open new territories. However, now that
we have government ownership we must
make the best of it. Without going as far
as Australia in respect te, rates, Mr. Hanna
might increase the rates so as te, meet at
least the cost of operation and the interest

on the fixed charges. Then, and only then,
will the railway be entirely out of politics.
If the Government would give me one
moment's attention, I would make what
is, 1 Vhink, a very valuable suggestion.
If the Government are sincere about keeping politics out o! the management of the
Canadian National railways, Vhey have a
simple means of proving their sincerity
Vo the satisiaction of every member on
either aide of this House and Vo the satisfaction of members in another place. ,Let
tbem give the faîmers and the Opposition
Vhe right Vo appoint their quota o! diîectors Vo the Board of Management of the
National railways. That would be a very
simple matter. The Government would
naturally appoint a majority o! their own
representatives, but there sbould be a number of others. AfVer ail, the National railways belong just as much Vo the Opposition as Vo the Government, and they belong
just as mucli Vo the farmers as Vo the workingmen. The property of the public, representinga the huge sum o! Vwo billion
dollars, which is about equal Vo oui
national debt, should be entrusted noV Vo
the care of politicians of either one stripe or
the other, but should be administered by
joint control. If ever there was need o!
Union Government, iV is in administering
oui national railways. There is where Union
Government might do some good, by allowing the Opposition Vo nominate somne members Vo that Board.of Management, and by
allowing the farmers and the labour men
to name representatives, so that ail classes
would be represented on the Board; but let
the Goverument in power keep a majority,
as it properly should. Then the control
should be lefV with Parliarnent, noV with
the Cabinet, just as in the case o! the
Auditor General.
There is one little detail that 1 omnitted.
I was asked about Roumnania. Honourable
gentlemen will remember that this country,
in a moment of generosity, or !ol]y, actually
furnished $25,000,000 Vo send varions articles
Vo Roumania. I arn informed that out o!
the. $25,000,000 some $20,000000 is gone.
Where is it gone Vo? Who got the money?
IV wvas supposed Vo be for Canadian goods.
WVho got the $20,000,000? IV would be interesting Vo know. Another thing that would
be very interesting Vo know would be, wbat
security has oui country got for that $20,000,000 that went aIl the way across the Atlantic and almost ail the way across
Europe? What was there Voguarantee repayment Vo Canada of that sum of money?
WVas it ]Roumanian bonds? If so, at wvhat

8

discount were those bonds taken? I should
like Vo see anyone go into the market of one
of our great cities of Montreal or Toronto,
or even into the New York market, and try
to seli Rournanian bonds at present. How
much would he get? This is a question
on which. I hope we may get some enlightenment this session. Twenty million dollai s
is quite a large sum, and why should it be
spwnt without our knowing what was obtained with it and who got the money?

very able speech, as he generally does. 11e

the Senate were as industrious as the honourable gentleman the Senate would prove
its usefulness even more than it does. But
in bis remarks with regard Vo the Northwest, I think he must bave slipped a cog
when hie stated that the average yield in the
province of Manitoba was only 10 busbels
per acre. H1e wvent further and said that
the farîniers in Ontario and in Quebcc were
not nearly as well off, but better off.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Will the honourable gentleman excuse me one moment?
He misunderstood me. I stated that the
average of wheat in the Dominion 6f Canada, not in Manitoba, was ten busheis per
acre in 1919.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1V is the average
in Canada? The bulk o! the wheat is grown
in the Northwest; so I take it that that is
about the average in the Northwest. Could
the honourable gentleman tell us what
was the average in Manitoba in the last two
years?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Last year the
average in Manitoba was the best average
of the three provinces.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAJN: How much was it?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It was an average of probably 12 bushels.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Other provinces
were flot s0 good?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: For Canada, as
I said, the average was 10 bushels. 1 think
that is correct.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Anyway, honourable gentlemen. I was correct in saying
that the honourable gentleman stated that
the f ariners of Ontario and the farmers of
Quebec were noV merely as well off but betVer off than the farmers in those western
provinces. If that is so, why did we spend

Government sbould continue to accord
them a protection whicb gives them special
advantag-es over the rest of the population
of Canada and which makes of tbem public
beneficiaries and a priviieged class.
Wiii you permit me, bonourabie gentlemen, to give you some exaniples in support of iny contention. Take, for instance,
rice, an article of consumption used in alI
families.
For the year ending the 3lst
March, we.imported 15,373,2S6 pounds oi
cieaned Tice, and 50,428,411 pounds of uncleaned. The duty on cleaned rice is 75
cents per hundred pounds; uucleanied rice
is free of duty. We have three riue factoriein the country. The Goverrument coilected
in duties $111,639. The protected industry
hiad the advantage of a protecton of $3
for every dollar collected bv the Goveriiment.
Let us next take cloths anid ciotliii..
There exists a duty of fromi 30 to 40 per
cent on imported goods. The importer addto the purchase price the duty iiiposed by
the Government, and lie puts his percexitag-e both on the duty paid 10 the Goveriument and on the price of the goods theniselves. The wholesaler to whoin lie sells
does the saine thing-. The retail inerchant
w-hio buys fromn the whoiesaier lias to pay
ail the accumulated percentages: as well as
the net cost of the goods themnselves. se
that the ultimate consumer often finids

price.
Hon. Mr. LEGRIS.

WVe
imported last year 545,000,000 pouiids
0f that amount 2,000,000 pounds
was refined. The duty on reflned sugar is
one cent per pound.
The Goverument,
therefore, collected on this article duties
to the amount of $20,000; but the refiners.
of whom there are nine in Canada, enjoyed
a protection which enabled themn 10 realize
profits of about $7,000,000 from the consuw2ers. Why maintain a duty on sugar
when raw sugar is bought in the countries
where it is produced, and the total cost
of refining cannot be higher in Canada than
it is in the United States? Is it that the
workers in the Canadian refiners are flot
as capable as those in the refineries of
the United States and other countries,.
Why this priviieged class? And, remember
it is the ciass of the prosperous, the millionaires, while the people are subjected to
duties as unjust as they are useless.
We have in this. country other great indus'tries which derive enormous and even
scandalous profits at the expense of tbe
people. I may mention the Patton Marnuf acturing Company, of Sherbrooke, whicIn
realized last year a profit cf from 72 to 100
per cent upofi its invested capital.
W'e
have also the Canadian Cottons, Limîted,
which, after providing for all 'the expense,
of the year, declared a net profit of 32 per
cent upon its invested capital. The Domin.

recognîzed, and the future will render the
fact sf111 clearer. If was a polîtical question on which people had the rîght f0 differ
in opinion. Conscription was net necessary, because voluntary enlisfment was proceeding success!ully, and was securing
more soldiers for the armny than did conscription. Moreover, the conscripts, after
the law h.ad been applied with the slowness inevifable in sucb circumsfances, had
not time to reach the front; and, the w'orst
o! it was that this conscription measure
cost the country $6,000,00 for ifs enforcement, and perhaps even more te individuais, te say nothing of the trouble, the
anxiety, and the confusion wbich everywhere resulted from if. But the hope of
the Governmenf was to arouse the indignation o! the Engiisb-speaking provinces
against the province of Quebec always for
the same end, thaf of winning the elecfions. These gentlemen of the Government have returned te kindie the fires of
civil discord in the country for the contemptible advantage of their parfy interest.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier would not thus have permitted his friends te raise the cry of race
and religion.

Rowvell we have had the innuinerable commissions nominated by the Governmenf,
which have cost the country millions of
dollars, and have done practically nofhing.
The most regrettable means have been emplo;red by these gentlemen for the purpose of hanging on to office: disu-nion, prejudice, race cries, the most cruel accusations against the French C;nadians, and
particularly against Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
As I saîd a moment ago, the French
Canadians have nlot been f00 sensitive because of these attempts te humiliate them,
nor too much hurt by the nîeans employed,
and to-day they are well avenged and rehabilitated. The French Canadians and
the province of Quebec will flot vote against
the Government for these reasons. They
will vote against the Government on its
merits. I sincerely believe that they will
vote against the Government because the
Government lias, under the excuse o! the
war, committed errors wbich. are unpardonable. It bias established in the country
an autoçrracy with ifs Orders in Council
frequently unjustifiable, and with its commissions, witbout number, which have cost
the country millions, and which have been
without any real value; and during al
that time the ministers continued to evade
their responsibility. The French Canadians
and the province of Quebec will vote
against the Government, because if is incompetent f0 repair its errors, incompefent
te diiminish the unreasonabiy high cost of
living, incompetent te allay the prevailing
unrest, and finally because if is in the
hands of great capitalisf s wbo are making
millions at the expense of the people. The
province of Quebec will vote against the
Government, because it is without a head
and witbout cohesion. and because, as 1
have said, wbile one after another of ifs
meinbers are deserting it, they dare not
throw open a single county f0 elect their
successors, because fhey know well the
state of public opinion regarding their administration. The Governmenf and the
Unionist party are falling to pieces. They
inspire confidence in no one, nlot even in
a great number of their friends. The electors of the province of Quebec will vote
against the Giovernment and the Unionist
party because of the enormous debf which
they have heaped upon the country, because of the disquieting condition of our

tion. The electors of the province of Quebec will vote against the Government because of their inability to devise means for
collecting revenues sufficient for the country's needs; because of their extravagant
expenditures; because of their unjustifiable
borrowing; and because of the scandalous
deals 'which took place in connection with

JOINT COMMITTEE APPOINTED.

Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED rose to
1move:

That a message be sent to the House of
Gommons to request that House to unite with
the Senate in the appointiflent of a Joint Cornmittee consisting of an equal numnber of mnembers of both Houses to consider and report
upon the desirability of uniting certain branches
of the two Houses performning similar duties,
and particulariy the Law Branch. the Law
Translation Branch, and the Debates Translation Branch, and, If in the opinion of the
of
committee, it is desirable to unite any or,
the branches, to submnit a schemne theref
andi that the Honourable Messieurs Belcourt,
Fowler, Foster, Sharpe and Thompson be appointed as members of such Comnmittee to act
on behaif of this Hlouse.
He said: With the permission of the
House I should like to amend the motion
by adding the name of the Honourable Mr.
Dennis, who has înterested himself in the
subject with which it is proposed that the
committee shouid deal.
Hon. Mr. ËBOSTOCK: May I suggest that
the name of the Honourable Mr. Dandurand
also be added?
The proposed amendments were agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -Honourable gentlemien, I notice that lis Honour the Speaker
mentioned my name as seconding this
motion. I do not want in any way to oppose the motion to the extent of preventing
its adoption, but I should like to--say that
while I appreciate the desire of the Government to examine into this matter, in an
effort to bring about a réduction in the
expenses -of carrying on Parliamentary
business, stili I think that mernibers of the
committee, and members of thîs House
itself, should be exceedingly careful in
dealing with any proposai which might tend
to eradicate the distinct line of separation
between the two Houses. The Senate has
a very valuable work to do for the country.
It was formed to act as a revising body
to revise the legislation of the country, and
it is very important for us that the work
of the Sonate should be kept as distinct
and separate as possible from the work of
the House of Gommons. The position of
the Law Clerk is one that I think should
be very es'refully considered in this connection. Being a revising body we have to
look at the legislation which. comes before
us fromn the Commons in a somewhat
critical manner to see that it is in the best
interest of the country. It occurs to me
that a number of instances may possibly
arise in the future, as they have arisen inthe past, in which the point of view adopted
by the Senate may not exactly coincide
with that of thé House of Commons, and
where it may be necessary for honourable
members of the Sonate to take the advice
of the Law Clerk of the Sonate in regard to

It wvill then be for the House to accept

friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the honourable leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Bostock) as to the
desirability o! having our own independent
Law Branch. I think that it is very necessary, and I have no hesitation in saying
that unlesa very strong arguments and very
strong reasons were brought forward to
show me the desirability of uniting the
Law Brantches of the two Houses, I should
be against it. It will take very strong and
very cogent reasons to change my opinion
on that point. But I do thing that there are
services in which a saving can be effected
by amalgamation, without interfering wvith
the important privileges of this House. Although a new member o! the Senate I
should be the last man to consent to the
Senate allowing itself to be sheared of any
o! its privileges or any of the fights which
it now enjoys. I am strongly in favour of
upholding all the ancient privileg-es that
appertain to this Chamber, but I think this
is a stép in the right direction. As I say
all arguments can be brought before the
Committee for consideration, and the Comnmittee can make a digest report to the
House, and it xvill then be for the Chamber
to decide which o! the different services
they desire to have amalgamated. So I
do not think there is any necessity for any
change whatever in the motion as it niow
appears.
BELCOURT: May I ask, my
Hon. M-Nr.
honourable friend if a similar resolution is
being adopted in the House of Gommons?
Hon. Sir JAMES
will be.

LOUGHIEED:

There

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I takze it that
this motion is broug-ht !orward by the honourable leader of the Government in this
House after an understanding bas been
reached with the honourable leader in the
other House that a similar resolution will
be passed there; so our action would not
be interpreted as my honourable friend
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
seems to fear. This is really joint action
on the part of the twvo Houses. It is supposed to be done simultaneously, although

we are taking action to-day and the House
of Commons may not do so until next week.
This is not a question on which we are
making a decision. As 1 understand, it is
simply a matter which by arrangement is
being taken up by both Houses.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, the time when we are movina into these buildings is opportune to
mlke Parliament as efficient and as economical as possible. My honourable friends
apparently have sounded a note of warning
that we are about to abdicate certain privileges that we as a Senate enjoyed in times
past and hand thema over to some foreign
body that might disregard them. Nothing
of the kind is in view. The Government
has already taken steps along the lines that
have been discussed. The Law Branch is
only one of several subjects to be taken
into consideration. In the past the Law
Branches of both Houses of Parliament
were unsatisfactory, and three or four
years ag-O the Governmnent intervened and
appoînted a Parliamentary Counsel for the
two Houses of Parliament. This House has
consulted that counsel just as much as bas
the House of Gommons, and I will venture
to say that honourable members o! the
Senate have consulted him to a. very much
greater extent thanHon. Mr. ÇASGRAIN:

Who is hie?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Mr. Gisborne. They have consultcd the Parliamentary Counsel on matters of legisiation very
inuch more than the Law Clerks of the respective branches of Parliament.
Now, is there any good reason why Parliament should not be placed upon as businesslike a footing as any establishment in
the countrv-? Are we not as desirous of
havinga our machinery just as efficient as
that o! any large commercial enterprise?
W'ould any large business undertakin- in
Canada have practically three institutions
for advising upon leg-al questions? 'Ne have
the Law Branch of the Commons, we have
the Law Branch of the Senate, and we have
the Parlianientary Counsel, common to
both Houses, who practically does the work,
of both Houses; and you and the country
are paying the expenses o! maintaining
three separate establishments for the purpose of advising us in regard to the few Bills
that come up to Parliament from tirne to
time. If we are looking for efficiency, if
we wvant to put Parliament upon a modern
basis, then let us consider this matter from
a business standpoint. The Committee is
not char.aed with altering in the slightest

SENATE
degree-not in the slightest degree-any of
the rights or privileges or traditions which
we have held in the past. Ail they are
asked to do is to consider and report how
Parliament may be made miost efficient
along the lines indicated in the resolution.
It seems to me, honourabie g-entlemen,
that in having a committee of the Senate
meet from time to time with a like committee from the Gommons to consider the
administration of public business with a
view to the adoption of the b»est machinery
for the doing of it, we reflect credit upon
ourselves and it is of advantage to the
country.
Take, for instance. the Translation
Branches, as referred to in this motion.
That is ail rig-lit.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
three or four translation branches in Parliarnent; we have a translation branch for
the Debates; we have a translation branca
for the Bilis: and it is the samne in the
other House. Those different divisions are
eachi presided over by a senior member or
some officiai whoce standing ;s superior
to that of the others. Would any business
institution be organized on a basis of that
kind? Not for a n'kîutent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAJIN:
with the Deba tes.

It is the sain4

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
also the subjeet of the Debates. lhere is
the Post Office. Is there any good reaison
why the post offices for Parliament should
not be under the Post Office Department
and administered just the samne as the post
offices in the city of Toronto, the city of
Montreal, or any of the other great centre:,
of Canada? Is there any reason why -%ve
should multiply offices and mnultiply machinery, ail of which contribute to inefficiency, when we may overcorne difficu1tiPE
of this kind?
If this should resuit in the di7lurbance
of any officiai, his interests wvill be fully
considered. As long as 1 have been in
Parliament I have neyer yet seen an officiai whose interests have not been very
sympatheticaliy considered and deait with.
So we need have no**tpprehension on that
ground.
We have already established a joint
restaurant. I remember the time when w_
had two restaurants, both verv inferior. I
do not say the restaurant as it is to-day
is a very superior one.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

That is a bad illus-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We had
twvo restaurants; now we have one.
lon. Mr. CASORAIN: And two bars.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend says we had two bars at one
time.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Give us one now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
morality of the Senate became shocked on
one particular occasion, and tbey abolisbed
their bar; and a like movement was made
in the Gommons. The resuit was that both
hars were abolished.
H;on. Mr. DOMVILLE: I made the moetion.
HonHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
ourable gentlemen, this committee is simply
a committee to consider and report to this
Senate; and when they do report the matter will be absolutely in your hands, and it
wvill then bie for you to determine whether
the report is good or bad.
Hon. Mr. CAjSGRAIN: May I ask, just
one question? This is a matter for lawyers,
I understand. I have nothing to say at
present with regard to any of the other
branches, but may I as', thie honourable
leader of the Government: If the Senate
is to revise legisiation, and if the solicitors
and attorneys and barristers- ail the gentlemen well learned in iaw-connected with
the House o! Commons have passed upon
and approved of a certain measure. and if
we in the Senate have not lav yers quitoý
independent of those people, how are we
going t-o revise? If there- is a joint Law
Branch, the lawyers would ho silnp]y sitting
in revision upon themselves, asz fa r as 1
understand it.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: If it had not been
for w-hat xvas, I think, the unhappy illustration the honourable leader of the Gov(Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
ernment
brougýht forward in advising us to unite
certain branches, I should not perliaps have
said anything. 1 remember the old restaurant which the Senate had. I used it several
times, and I must say that I always came
off clear, without any ptonmaine poisoning.
But the two restaurants have been joined

MýARCH 11, 1920
into one parliamentary restaurant, and the
last tirne that 1 took a meal there I got
ptomaine poisoning. «I do not intend to
take any more meals there until there is
very considerable improvement. 1 understand the same thing happened to another
member of this Senate anly a t ew davs ago.
1 feel somewhat diffident in talkinga about
the question of the Law Branch, because I
arn not a lawyer, but I think there is a
very great difference between the Law
Branch and the other branches whieh are
mentioned in the motion, such as *the
Translation and Debates Branches. There
can be no two opinions about the translation frorn French into English and vice
versa; and the same ia true with regard to
the Debates. But there is niuch rooni for
difference of opinion with regard to points
of law, and I think it wvould be very foolish on the part of the 'Senate to throw away
the privilege -which we alrea.dy bave of having aur own legal advisers at aur disposai.
In regard to the Law Branch, 1 think it
would be better to leave it out of this discussion altogether. 1 must say that mny experience of joint committees of bothi Houses
does flot lead me to favour tbern, and I fear
the placing of aur rights and piivileges iii
Ilicir hands. 1 think it is safer foi us tý
deal with aur own concerna in our own way
r.nd keep cuir independenice s0 lanz as vre
are able to maintain it, and not of our own
accord and pleasure put thern to one side
and allow aur rights to be gradually
taken from us.
These opinions are given with diffidence.
because I arn not a lawyer, and arn not so
welI posted in legal matters as other gentieiiien here; but it strikes mie that we vwold
te ve-y foolishi to tbrow away any o! our
pTescrit privileges, and that we oughit to be
indf-pendent of the other Charnbe -if tbe
legisiature.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Ail that 1 Nwould feei
ready to concede ta the honourable leader
of the Government just now would be one
re.staurant and one bar. I amn willing to let
the House of Commons have oiie-hiali of
the control of those departments. and onehait w'ould mean that they would have tivothirds control. But I wvould advise rny
colleagues to go siowiy in the niatter of relinquishing our old-time and honoured
privileges. 1 believe we made a mistake
in allowing the Civil Service Commission
to step in and take upon thernselves the
nomination and appointinent o! our employees. This motion, though only lentative, suggests action that should be

95

adopted only atter very mature conaideration. The honourable leader of the House
likened the two Houses to a commercial
concern. While that is the view taken by
the experts who presided over the classification of our employees, the Senate is not
a commrcial cancern. The Senate ia a littie
higher than a commercial enterprise. It
enjoya privileges, and in my opinion we
shopild continue to enjoy ail the privîleges
that have been le! t to us.
Hon. M'fr. DOMVILLE. As I understand
it, this ia only a motion to appoint a committee to look 'into these matters. We are
all the timeu kicking up a row with the Goverrnent because tbey do not practise economy; but now, when they suggest sornething in that direction, there is opposition.
I cannot really understand it. I was glad
to hear my honourable friend talk of the
bar in the House of Commons. Wben I
was leading the temperance party in New
Brunswiek-and I led themn well, though
they knew I took whatever I wanted, but
their own men had lef t themn in an hour
of weakness-I pledged myself to close up
the bar in the Commons, and I did it absolutely, as you will find on the records of
that House. But they got around and made
a hole in the wall on the Senate aide, which
resulted in their getting ail they wanted
tram the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: What a pity!1
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: I think it is a
pity if we cannot get something here; 1
think it a mistake to have those sumptuary
laws; but you are playing to the public,
you are playing to the gallery. I have
drink in my bouse, and temperance people
corne along, and it la ail right; sick people
corne along, and the parson cornes along,,
arnd the result ia that I arn cut down in
rny supply, which. is very bard to get, in
order to help them out of their difficulties.
Not that I begrudge it, but I do not like the
trouble of getting it. I do not know what
may resuit from the proposed motion. I
amn certainly in sympathy with the leader
of the Governrnent in looking into this
matter, and finding what the other House
will do.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The tact that
the honourable leader of the Opposition
moved ta add one name ta the liat o! mernbers led me ta believe that hie wauld have
no objection ta second the motion. H1owevel, as he does not perfectly agree ta the

He said: In mioving tbis motion I have
no intention of criticising the Goverament
or the Civil Service Commission, but I wish
to draw the attention of the Government
and of this House to a very important
matter. Some time ag-o I received from the
Canadian Mining Institute a circular on
a subject which to my mind lias a great
deal of importance. This circular referred
to the great numiber of resignations wbich
have takzen place anmcngst the mining
engineers and miembers of the Geological
Survey of Canada. This question is of vast
importance, because the future prosperity
of Canada -will dcpend upon the development and utilization of its natural resources. We have been accustomed to consider our resources as unlimited, but events
of the last decade have taughit us our error.
There lias been a decrease in flic average
production of our wbeat per acre, also in the
catch of some of our fisheries, and there vi'll

necessarily ýbe a decrease in the output cf
our lumber industry. In our iron industry,
there bias been an annual decrease
in the ainount of native ores used, ai-d a
corrcsponding- increase in the consumiption
of imiported ores. Our miineral resources
sbould be utilýzcd te the be-t advantage of
our nianufacturing. industries, and the
preservation of our ag-ricultural -industries
depends upon adequate supplies of minerai
fertilizers. It is, then, obvious that the
future presperity cf Canada is in a very
large areasure dependent upon lier reserves
of mca bighly trained la tlie special
sciences that have te do Nvith tlie study and
utilization of our national resources. Thiese
mca are needcd, and their services are a
necessity, because we cannot afford to wait
until new mea are traiaed to the various
kiada of work required. This aecessity cf
keeping goed men bias been

realized

in

Great Britain and la the United States;
and, judging by wbat lias taken place, we

course la some uaiversîty, which is followed

hy ,practical experience. Ia the Geological
Survey Branch of the Department of Mines
a period cf at least twelve years is required
to enable men to occupy the higher positions. Within the last few months not Iess
tban eight mea have resigned from the
Geological Survey, represeating a loss to the
country cf more than ainety years intensive
training. Five or six other men, students
la training for wvork la this braach cf the
public service, have left to enter private
service. In the Departmeat cf Trade and
Commerce, eight Government analysts la
the Food and Drug Braach, eut cf a total
cf thirteca, have resigned to enter private
service. There have been other resignations
cf scientists in other branches cf the public
service. The Department cf iMines is the
largest organizatica in the Goverameat service devoted to investigation cf our natural
resources and development cf our indus-

tries. During the last ten years I am told
that this department has lest forty-nine
aiea by resignation. The Geelegical Survey bas lest twenty-six men by resignation.
During the last two years there have been
elevea resignatîcas in the Geological Survey and twelve in the -Mines Branch.

MAROR Il. 1920
allow tlue adjourniment 'o! the debate, because I have received several documents,
1 do not know from ivhoii, asking me to
look inito this matter.
Hon. -Mr. DOMVILLE: I object, as one.
Let the discussion go on: we cannot de! er
the business of this House for the honourable gentleman's study. This question is
one of vital importance to the country. As
a scientist, or pretending- to be one, I xvant
to retain the very best intellect we have to
assist in developing this country. It is
very true that men are leaving Canada because they do not get the psy they require,
whereas if they bad had enough salary to
live comifortably and prosecute their inquiries. we mnight have retained themi. The
salaries paid here have muot been conmensurate with what they could get on the other
side o! the border. This discussion %vill
bring up the question in the departments
concerned as to whether some plan cannot
be instituted for classifying these technical
men and raising their salaries by degrees.
\Ve lieed technical mien in Canada, who can

This is a very large subject, and I knout
the honourable leader o! this House %vill
look into it. I have no desire to enibarass
the Governmnent, rather I wish to help thiem,
beuause 1 can see how difficuit the problem
is. I have hiad experience. and in the line
that I have been invezstizating I have
had to bring- scientists from England. This
cost a great deal o! nioney; but in our case
it met. the case. We cannot expect capital
to coine into this country until our resources are explored and reported upon by men
who have special knowledge and intelligence,
and whose reports inspire confidence. Merely
the name of being- a geologist is not sufficient.; the capitalist wants to see wliat kind
o! gcoods he is dealing with. We need technical men in many departmnents, now that
w-e are going to have a fleet we shahl need
a sea-lord. 1 am very glad to be able to
aid one mite o! thought to help the departments whose problems have been brought
before the. House.

Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: This matter is
really one of very muchi greater importance
than appears on the surface; but I arn at a
loss how to approach the subject, as the proposed motion deals wvith a matter which it
is not within the province of this Chamber
to determine. It is a fact, and a most important,-fact, that the natural resources of
ont country are very largely dependent on
the supervision and technical knowledge
and ability of employees of the Government
in those departments. It is a f act that those
men have been underpaid, and it is also a
fact that they have been given very much
larger inducements to leave t-he service of
the Government and enter private employment. We had a case at the last session
when the question arose as to the value of
coal-mining in a section of the Northwest.
It was believed that certain parties had acquired a mining lease for the benefit of
private parties, for littie or no financial
consideration, without the Government having had sufficient knowledge of that part of
the public domain that was being diverted.
Our resources are very often referred to as
illimitable-erroneously so; but unless Parliament has a very large number of technical men among-st its members, or some
officers on whom they can depend not only
because of their technical knowledge but
their absolute reliability, 1 arn afraid that
the country miay in the long run lose a
thousandfold more, or ten thousandfold
more than the difference betiveen an adequate and an inadequate salary for ifs
technical nien. I had no intention o! addressing the House oni this inatter, but it
occurred to nie whîle the debate wvas proceedinga that this inatter, while apparently
simple, is fraught with far graver consequences than perhaps mnany members of
the House may realize. W7hile I have no
idea that we are in a position to alter the
situation, it is possible thiat the honourable
leader of the House miay be able to inform
lis Whether the Government have full knowledge o! -%hat is transpiring, and wvhether,
having that knowledge, they are taking- any
steps to mnitigate wvhat rnay develop into a
very serlous condition of aiffairs.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Casgraîn, the debate wvas adjourned until the Oth day of

to, the deaths of some of our members since
last we met. During the recess we have ]ost
two of our mrembers, both of whomi were
closely identified with the activitios of this
Chambor. I ref or to the late Senators Talbot and Landry.
For two years the late Senator Talbot was
a membor oi the Rouse of Gommons, and
be became a meniber of this Chambor in
Marcb, 1906. He was one of the pioncer
farniors of nîy own province. I bad the
pleasure of bis friendsbip for a great nuinber of yoars, and it Nvas with the deep regret and sorroNw of a personai friend that I
learned of his death. He possessedpeculiarly
a friendly and attractive personaiity, and
numberod bis friends as numorously among
bis political oppononts as among those with
whom lie associated in the political party to
which he belonged. His temporament was
of that peculiar character that made it a
pleasuro to meet humi, and to grasp his hand
was to feel that the humanities were streng
within hum. Although ho did net idontif y
himsclf as actively with the business of this
Chamber as some of its members, yet bis
prosence was always welcomed and to-day
we deoply regret the loss of Peter Talbot, as
hie was best known to those wvbo enjoyed bis
intimate acquaintance.
The late Senator Landry n'as for ovor forty
years active in the political life of Canada.
Ho entered the House of Commons as one
of the reprosentatives of bis native province
in the year 1878, and was appointed te the
Senato under the Conservative Administration of 1892. He wvas a man of whoin it could
ho said, probably with greater force than
of most men, that lie bad the courage of his
convictions. To hlmi- it was his meat and
drink, to be in the front rank of the battie
wbere the fighting was the hardesf. Ho rejoiced in the stormn of political life rather
than in its calin. Life itself would be monotonous to miost o! us if it were ail sunishine and calin. Nature lias ordained that
there shouid be storin and the tumnuit of the
elements. Likew'ise w~e find buman nature
divided between thoso conditions, alfbough
mest of us would prefer to pursue the serene
and quiet o! life rather than to live in the
elements of the storin. As ho ]oved contreversy and conflict, circuinstances furnished
hum witb his desires in this respect; and yet

possibly bard to reconcile, yet hie p]a,.ed the
gaine openly, and wve had more or less te
admire the courage and the figliting power
which. ho displayed in advancing bis cause.
He wvas one of the active members of this
Sonate, and owing to bis temperamental qualifies we shall miss bis militant activities
and the interest %wbichho created in the
Sonate tbrougb the assertion of the views
wljich. he espoused. Now that hoe bas gene
te bis long rest, we may ail say ovor bis
grave: «'Requiescat in pace."
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not know tbat I can add
mucb to what bas been se ably said by the
leader of the Government in reference te,
theolbas which this Chamber bas sustained
in the death of the late Senators Landry
and Talbot. Fromt timo to timo we are
called upon to refer to tbe losses by death
which occur amongst us. It la a matter of
great regret that we bave to part with
thoe wboma we have known se well, and
with whom we have asseciated in this
Chamber.
Senator Landry, as rny honourable f riend
bas said, was a man wbo thorougbly enjeyed bis parliamentary life. Ho was a
groat worker. I undcrstand that as a young
maan ho was in a financially good position,
that he did net have te work for bis living, .and that ho entered public life fromn
choice, desiring te do bis best for bis couantry rrid te make himsolf useful te hiý
fellow mon. His activities in various walks
of life wcre considerable. Ho entered into
evorytbing ho undertook with great zest,
and always acquittod himiself wvith credit.
As a membor opposing the Governinent in
this Chamber ho was always indefatigable
la his work., and always a source of information te bis frionds. Ho bad the great
ficii1tv o! gatbering- data and collectinginformation; se much se, indeed, that
amengat bis frienda the remark, hecame
commen that if they roquirod any information they bad only to refer te Senator Landry. Ho tboroughly enjoyod bis work, and
thorougbly enjoyed making trouble for the
leader of the Governinent, if ho could do
se. The work tbat he bas donc will ho long
remembered. We ail very mucb regret bis
doparture from amongst us, and join in extending sympathy te bis relatives in the
heeavement wbich they have suffered.
Senator Talbot, as my honourahie friend
baq said, was a membor of this Chamber
for somo yoars. Ho was recog-nized as a
pioncer by ail wbo knew bim. particularly
in the West. Until ho went -te the West

bis wvhole training had been in the worid

those who came in contact with hirn by
his hionesty of purpose and bis desire to do
the best he could in whatever position in
111e he occupied. Frorn the principalshîp
of the high sehool he went te farming, and
ef that be aise made a success. I thinik
that ail %vhoknew the late Senater Talbot
would probably agree with me that he
ceuld be best described in the werds of Sir
Walter Scott as " a man steady o! heart
and steut ef hand." I arn sùre we ail feel
the less that this Chamber has sustained
by bis deatb, and desire te offer our meet
sincere sympafhy te bis widow and famflly.
Hon. THOMAS OHAPAIS: Honourable
gentlemen, I had net the honour ef knowing the Honourable Senater Talbet, but I
arn sure that be wvell deserves the eulogies
te bis nernory just new voiced in this
Heuse by tbe leader of the Governrnent
aud the leader of the Opposition.
But I feel that if is iny duty te share in
the tribute paid te the lafe Senator Landry.
I bave been moat intirnately connecfed
wvitb hirm for over thirty years; I bave
gene with hlm through. many a polîfical
campaign, snd I can say with fulil knewledge that be wss a inan of sterling quaIities, a deveted friend, and a loyal fee.
The honeurable members of this House
know perfectly well that be was s strenueus fighter, always true te bis principles
and stubborn in tbe defence of what be
deemed right. His death bas been a great
sorrow for bis friends. He was a credif te
himself snd an ornanient te the publie life
of tbis country.

sentences; yet it is imipossible to have real
uniformiity because the circumstanceS surrounding each individual case leave the
judge to make the sentence long or short,
as ail crimes in the samie category are not
of the sanie magnitude. The circumstances under which a crime is committed, and
the causes leading up to it, very aiten determine whether the crime is heinous or
not, apart from what the statute may say
about it; so there cannot possibly be uniiormity in the sentences. I suppose that
is the reason why the law-makers originally gave to the judge trying the case a
range from a certain minimum to a maximîum punishment. I arn very conservative
about matters of this kind. I would dislike ta see our judicial system operate as
it does in the United Btates, so that when
a man is convicted it is otten the case that
more years elapse between the time of the
firat conviction for the crime and the time
he entera upon bis punishment than would
be occupied in serving a proper sentence.
We do nat need that sort o! thing in this
country, and every appeal afforded lengthens the litigation, and makes it more easy
for the guilty person to escape. My experience, alter thirty-five years' practice at
the Bar-and I had a very large criminal
practice in that province, as I specialized
along, those lines-would be that in ninetynîne'cases out of a hundred men char-ged
with crimes are guilty; and thus by multiplying appeals you shlow a great oppartunity for guilty men to escape the juet
punishment of their acta. I am opposed to
the principle of the Bill.
There is one
Hon. -Mr. DANDURAND:
feature of the Bill ihich displeases me. I
arn a littie afraid of opening the door to th ý
posaibility of a higher tribunal increasing
the penalty. 1 recognize the argument of
îny honourable friend who promotes this
measure when he says that we allow a number of appeals in material and monetary
affaira, ssfeguarding the property interesta
of the individual to that extent, yet inake
light of the honour and liberty of the subject. There is aomnething that appeals ta
oxie when the argument is presented in that
wvay; and 1 arn not mucb opposed ta allowing some kind of recourse ta the accused
w'ho feels that hie has been uni ustly condemned and will have that blot on bis record and on his reputation for 11f e. 1 have
not yet heard from my honourable friend
an argument that satiafies me as to opening
the door for an increase of the penalty. 0f
course, hie miay have advanced such an
argument in iiy absence. The ideal in the

administration of criminal justice under
British law la the protecting of the accused
from imputation of guilt before conviction;
giving, him considerable latitude for bis
evidence; rather allowing a chance for ninetenths of the accused persans to escape than
risking one o! them being condemned unjustly. Whatever the sentence may be,
even if it be ligbt, tbe magistrate may have
a reason for that; he bas had the whole
case before bim, he bas seen the witnesses;
ha may have inquired as ta record o! the
accused; bence I arn somewbat diffident
about allowing, an appeal ta ana wbo bas
been convicted. 1 feal this ail the more
hecause our statutes at present gîve to
mnagistratas a chance to temper justice to
(hose wlio bave been convicted. We have
now a ticket-of-leave system, by wbieb, if
it ia fait that a man bas been unduly convicted, or santenced for too long a period,
ha may ask and obtain relief by securing a
ticket-of-laave. In view o! that I sbould
lîke to ask my bonourable friend who promaotes thia legisiatian what argument ha bas
for allowingc to the Crown Prosecutor an
appeal witb the view of increasing the penalty.
Hon. Mr. McME.ANS.: I may say in reply
ta the hanaurable gentleman that, wbile I
am not very anxiaus ta retain the clause as
ta sentences being increasad, it was suggaated by one particular case wbicb I have
no doubt honaurable gentlemen knaw of.
It was tbe case of a achool teacher in the
province of Manitoba who was accused of
a saxual crime againat ana o! bis pupils,
and the sentence imposed was six montha
in jail. There was sucb a furore througb
that part of the country, and indeed
throughout the Dominion, that the women
sent in petitions ta the Minister of Justice,
and even talked about taking proceedings
againat the judge. The uproar made in regard ta that case suggested ta my mind that
if there had heen a clause of that kind it
could have been said to thase wamen,
'"There will be five judges sitting in the
court of appeal, and they can look into
the matter.-' That was one of the reasana
why this clause was inserted. Anothar
reason was that in the western country we
appoint niagistrates who are not lawyers
and have had no experience in the administration o! justice.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: Justices of the
peace?

in this House in two conszecutive sessions

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I did not happen
to be present when it was passed last year,
or I certainly would have opposed it. Hovever, I make my motion.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIH: Befoie the motion
is put, 1 wish to make a fewv remarks. I
desire very briefly te state the reasons why
I supported this Bill last year and intend
to support it again. It does not seem to
me to be sound argument to contend that
the Court of Appeal cannot properly review
a judgment by a criminial court because
they do flot hear the witnesses and are perhaps not possessed of a knowledge o! al
the circumstances of the case. That does
not seem to be sound reasoning. If it were,
it would eliminate entirely the right to appeal in civil cases, in which the Court of
Appeal, with nothing before them but the
evidence, can modify or reverse the finding
of the jury who have heard ail the evidence and had ail the circumstances placed
before them. It seeiis to nie that there is
Hon. Mr. DANIEL.

Just- as much reason n hY tho Court of Al)peal should have the right to review a
criminal case, in which a inan's liberty
and honour are involved, as that they
should have the right to review a civil case,
where there is really leas at stake. Every
day civil cases are brought to the Court
of Appeal, and when that court ait they
have nothing before thema but the written
evidence. The court examine the evidence
and may grant an appeal. They may change
the judgment. They have alrnost unlimited
powers. Why should not the court have
the saine powers in criminal cases? That
is what this Bill provides.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Does the lionourable gentleman understand the word
"ýappeal" to mean an appeal fromn the decision, or simply an appeal as to the amount
of the punishment imposed? That is what
I understand the Bill to mean.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIlI: Yes. The Bill in
îuy opinion does not go far enough. I think
it should go the length w'hich my honourable friend mentions. The Enghlish Act goes
the full length; that is to say, there is an
absolute appeal just as in civil cases. In
the United States there are almost unlimited poivers o! appeal in crîminal cases.
Surely those two great centres of jurisprudence would nlot have gone se far astray
in a xnatter of this kind ais seine honourable
gentlemen sem to suggest. This question
ivas widely and f ully considered by a conimittee appointed hy the House o! Conimens in England. They made a thoroughi
study of the matter for several years, and
finally recommended the establishment ot
a Court of Appeal, with powers very much
ivider than this Bill provides. Surely that
must be a very strong argument in faveur
of this BillI, which does nlot go as far as the
British law, or the American law.
Any person who has watched the sentences that have been imposed from tinie
to time by magistrates and by judges cannot but be struck by the fact that there
does not seem to be any uniforrnity, such
as would very likely be attained if we
had a Court o! Appeal. I cited a case last
yearHon. Mr. FOWLER: Does my hionourable friend think there should be absolute
uniformity in sentences?
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I think %ve should
endeavour to get as near as we possibly
can to uniformity.

Hon. M«\r. GIRROIR: The honourable
meniber froi Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
spoke a few moments ago o! the British
Court of Appeal and how they bad been
endeavouring to lay down genierai rules
and had attained greater uniformity iin the
imposition of sentences than had obtained
in England previensly. In Canada flot only
is there a lack of nniformity in siimilar
cases between judges sitting in different
-courts, in different parts of the province
or dîfferent parts of Canada, but you find
individual judges varying their sentences
to an alaring degree.
I cited a case last year to prove, as I
thou..,lit. the neuessity oi tliis proposed Act.
I do not thînk that the jndge to whomi I
refer-I wiii not mention his namne-was
anr weaker than the average judge in the
country. Two Young boys, about eighteen
years o! age, who had always borne a good
reputation, were out one niglit about the
town and imbibed a littie too freely. As
tbey wvent along they saw sonie overcoats
hanging out in front of a store. They
picked up an overcoat apiece, put the overcoats on, and walked down street. They
ruade no effort to bide the coats or do
anything like that. They walked into other
stores and gossiped around. It w'as only
a very sinaîl town, and there was really
no0 opportnnity for conceainient, unless they
took, the coats off and hid them somewhere.
They paraded about with those coats on.
It was a foolisli thing. The boys, as 1 said,
had been drinking. 1 was asked te defend
theni before a judge. I did se. The judge
imposed a sentence of three years in the
penitentiary.
Honi. M-Nr.FOWLER: Perhaps that ivas
becanse yen defended them.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Possibly.
Hon. '-%r. TH'OMPSON: A poor defence.

been in the penitentiary, wvas stamped wvith
criniinalitv-h-e was a marked man. He
liad been in the penitentiary for steaiinfor sucbi a trivial offence.
Now, if there had been a Court o! Appeal with a proper Act hehind it, a motion
could have been made for a stay, and the
appeal could have been taken. The boy
inight have stayed in jail for a monthi or
so, but at any rate there can be no question wbatever that the sentence would have
been reversed, or at least modified to such
an extent that the boy's future would not
have been affected.
1 really think that this Bill does not go
far enough-tbat if there is an appeal in
a civil case,' where there is less involved,
there is no reason in the world why there
should not be an appeal in a criminal case.
-So far as 1 can learn, the experience of
legal minds in England and in the United
IStates bas been very bighly in favour of
the establishment of Courts of Appeal in
criminal cases in both those countries. You
wiIl find that in certain localities judges,
and especialiy magistrates, are sornetimes
inclined to go te extremes, either one way
or the other, and the farther they go in
one direction, the greater is the danger of
their going to the opposite extreme. Sometimes a person is let off altbough he bas
committed a very serions offence, and at
'other times for a trivial offence the
character of the accused is ruined. I cannot see, for the life of me, wbo is going to
be burt by tbe establishment of a Court of
Appeal. If the sentence is right, the Court
of Appeal wilI confirin it. If the sentence
is wrong, who can urge a single reasoni why.

FIRST READING.

A message was received from the House
of Commons; with Bill 36, an Act for g-rant-

ing to bis Majesty certain sums of nmoney
for the public service of the finnnciil vear
ending the 3lst March. 1921.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
seond reading of the Bill.
Hoe said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
mnakes provision for voting one-sixth of the
estimates for the year. I need scarcely
p)oint out to the House that we have been
passing similar Bills for eorne years, particularly when the fiscal year has expired
before the Estianates have been broughit
dow-n. Notwithstanding the vote which is
nowv asked for bv the Government, as was
pointed out by th;e Minister of Finance, Parliament wvill continue to exercise its fullest
control over the estimates, and rnay deal
w-ith the v-arions items of which it is proposed under this Bill to vote one-sixth. So
Parliarnent wvîll be in no way handicapped
hy reason of the vote in question.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY. What does onesixth amount to'
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It was said in
another place that if the amount had been
spent it would ho too late to remonstrate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 0f course,
one-sixth of any particular item would flot
be of very much service to the Government,
if it lacked the right to expend the other
five-sixths. The total amount asked for is
$62,900l,986-in round figures, $63,0OO,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose that,
as we have the assurance from the honourable gentleman that we may cut down the
remainder of the estimates when the Supply
Bill cornes before us, we need flot move to
refer this one-sixth to the Finance Committee for examination; we may do so w-heu
the main Supply Bill cornes down.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, I had that question in mind myself;
but, after the explanation of the honourable
leader of the bouse that the passage of this
B3ill would not interfere in any way with the
consideration of the main estimates, I have
no objection to the second reading of the
Bill.
bon. MJr. CASGR'AIN: Except what has

The motion m-as agreed to, and the Bill

lion. -G. D. ROBEIRTSON (Minister of

D. an Act to amend the Industrial Disport - Investigation Act, 1907.
He said- Honouurahle gentlemen. tiee propesed amîendmients do not conteinuplate auiy

I

APRIL 6, 1920
gentlemien express a degire that that should
be done.
There are five amendments of a 1tinor
nature suggested. The first refers tc boards
being established where several emiployers
in the same industry are affected. Perhaps
I might indicate the necessity or desirability
of the change by citing a specific case. Numerous instances have arisen o! -workmen in
the employ of perhaps hait a score or more
o! employers having disputes with their
respective employers, and desiring t1hat the
differences be referred to a board o! conciliation. It was necesary *to obtaini the
consent o! each individuai employer to the
establishment of the board; other%çise a
separate board wouid have had to be ecstabiished for each employer. We had an experience o! this sort in the coal industry in
Nova Seotia within the past two nionths.
Six applications lor board.- of conciliation
were received, and At was nccesary to establish four boards, though one board might
have done the work o! the four jost as Nveli,
and saved considerable money, and the Tesuit wvould, I think, have been more satisfactory to both the emiployers and the
workmen, because the recommendations
would have been uniform. and therefore fair
to ail. I may add that recently a number of
emnployers have expressed a desire that this
should be done. Only a iew days ago I
received !rom one o! the associations of ernployers, in what is perhaps the iargest industry in Canada apart trom transportation,
a communication that suggests this very
thing. -I believe, therefore, that it is desirable to amend the Act so that one board
inay be established to deal with a dispute in
which there are several employers, mnenbers
of an association, so that the employers'
association may be cailed upon to act in the
same capacity as xvould the individual employers.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: How areý those
boards appointed?
Hon. iMr. ROBERTSON: Either an employer or ten or more workmen in the eniploy of any employer may make an application for a board. If a dispute exists in
which they are unable to agree or reach an
adjustment, each party seiects his own tepresentative upon the board. The two niembers so seiected have the opportunity o!
agreeing upon a third, who will aet as
chairman of the investigation commnittee, or
board, as it is usualiy termed. In the
event of the two members o! the board appointed by the respective parties being unable to agree upon a third mnember. it then

hecomes the duty o! the Departrnent of Labour to appoint the third member, who shall
act as chairman of the board.
The second suggested amiendment to the
Act refers to a question that seerns to mie of
some importance, as a resuit of observation
and experience, and particuiarly in view of
the attitude taken by somne labour organizations recently. As the Act now stands, it is
possible for a relatively smail minority of
nembers of a labour organization to make
application for and be entitled to a board.
The offieers of the departmen't feel, and I
concur in their view, that a substantial
number, probably -a majority of the memnbers o~fthe organ4ization, or, il -the men 'are
unorganized, a majority o! the men affected
by 'the dispute, ought to be obtained ibefore
the board is established. Therefore it is
suggested t1hat the two clauses of the Act
referring to the procedure which iworkmen
must pursue before they are entitled to
have a board estabLshed should be a.mended
so as to guarantee, -more f ully at ieast than
is t'he- case eat the present time, tha.t the
application for the -board iis concurred ini
by a substantial numnber, or a rnajority,
o! the men affected. I amn sure that eauployers will agree thaIt that is desirable.
It is proposed 4,o smend section 34 o!
the Act, because of the inequality and the
lack of! uniformlty lihat .now exist. Eve'r
one of the other sixty-three sections applies uniformly throughou.t the Dominion,
but section 34 does ziot. It refers to t~he
fees of witnesses who mnay be cai.led by a
board to give evidene ýbefore it. At present
the tees are governed by the fees paid in
the province where the inquîry may be heid.
In some provinces the tees are as low, I
thînk, as 75 cents a day; in others I think
they min up to about $3; and the resuit
ha.s been nu.merous difficulties. 'much correspondence, and considerable dîssatisfaction. I't is 'proposed to inake a fiat rate
of $2 a day, 'whiclh is about the average
t ee paid at the present Urne under the
v-arious provincial laws.
It is proposed 40o«rnend 6ection 57 o! thie
Act t» provide against an interpretation
tha't was placed upon it la.st year, and
which caused u great deal of unneessarv
.nconrvenience and hardship to a large nuniber o! people. The Act, which was .passed
in 1907, provides that atter a 'board has
been esta;blis'hed there shall be no lock-out
upon tlhe part o! the employers nor any
strike on the part of the employees, pending the rendering o! the report by the
board. Up to iast year nwt.hing but la tessonably broad interpretation w'as ever p[aced

In 191S, by mutual censent. at a meetingcallad for the purpose cf discussing- ways

APRIL 6, 1920
and mneans to prevent any interruption of
transportation, particularly during the war,
the railwvay employees through some seventy-nine reliresentatives. and the railroads
through soute twenty-four officials, agreed
that there should be no strîkes or lock-outs
They
during the continuation o! the w%%ar.
set up a tribunal on which each side had
equal representation, and they agreed that
any dispute which might arise between any
individual organîzation and a railroad
which could not be adjusted by direct negotiation should be re!erred to this tribunal,
consisting o! twelve men. and that the decisions o! the tribunal should be accepted
as final by both parties. Regulations to
govern the operations of this adjustuient
board were drawn, and notwithstanding
that the war bas been over for about a
year and a hal! the arrangement stili continues with marked success. To date sixtysix cases have been desît with by Adjustment Board No. 1, as it is called, on which
each side bas six representatives, and in
every case a decision bias been reached.
Sometimes they have been niajority decisions, but in each case they have been
made unanirnous. That happy solution o!
their difficulties was brought about only
because, through years o! negotiation and
conference together, there bias grown up in
each a spirit o! confidence in the other
that un!ortunately does not exîst in many
of oui industries. 1 arn deliglited to be able
to state that a number o! the associations
o! the employers, such as the building
trades in our large cities-, have discussed
similar arrangements among themiselves.
and even with their enîployees through
their organizations, and in sorne cases experiments have been carried on %vith succesé. I arn hopeful that as time goes on
that spirit o! confidence mnay be encouraged
by ail concernied, and that iiany o! the
labour difficulties which now exist will be
avoided.
Hon. Mr. McM'E-NS: Is there not some
provincial legislation to that effect?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This Act, honourable gentlemen, applies to what is described within the Act as "public utilities." The Department o! Justice, I think,
are inclined to the view that the Act cannot be applied to an individual industrial
plant in a given City or province except
with the consent o! both parties to the dispute; neither cari it be forciblv appl.ie.d to
establish a board as between a municipality and its employees. Many representations have been made to the Department

of Labour urging that the scope of the Act
The Trades and
should be extende'l.
Labour Congress at its convention in Harnilton in September o! last year, at which.
900 merubers w'ere present, went on record
as being in favour o! extending the scope
of the Act. Soîne employers or associations of emiployers in communications to
the department have gone on record as
being in favour o! widening the scope o!
the Act to cover ail industries. I arn inclined to the opinion, based upon the views
o! the Department o! Justice, that that is
not practicable or perhaps possible, except
with the consent of the provinces concernied. It bas been proposed that a conference should be held in Ottawa about the
end o! this month, at w,ýhich there shail be
a representative of such provincial Government, a representative of the employers of
each province, chosen by the employers,
and a representative of labour from each
province, chosen by labour, in accordance
with and agreeable to decisions arrived at
by the Industrial Conference which met
here last Septemnber, and that they should
deal with the question of the provinces
either permitting this Act to be extended
in its scope or themselves passing legisiation whereby workinen engaged.. in industrial life or eniployees of miunicipalities niay
have access to machinery somewhat similar to that which I have outlined. The
particular purpose o! the meeting is to endeavour to co-ordinate and make uni!orm
the labour laws o! the variou-s provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURÂN-D: Can the hionaurable gentleman tell us what view~ labour
takes o! the Industrial Disputes Act, and
thie working of the Act? In the past some
hostility seeaus to have been shown to it by
sonle associations. Have those prejudices
dis appeared?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Trades and
Labour Conguress o! Canada, which has
been the recognized legislative mouthpiece
o! labour for probably 15 years, did for a
number of years, at each o! its annual conventions, pass a resolution requesting the
repeal o! the Act. That attitude was changed
last year, and the Trades and Labour Congress is now asking- for a general revision
and extension o! the Act. It bas been invited by the Government to subnîit in concrete forms its vie'v' as to what changer
should be made-, but owing to the president
o! the Trades and Labour Congress having
been in London and not having yet .retuTned, the Congreass lias not been able. to
bring down its sug-gestions; so 1 anticipate

SENATE
that they mnay not be brought before us at
this session. But the attitude ai the congress indicates, I think quite clearly, that
the opposition to the Act itself that xvas apparent for a nurnber ai years has ta some
extent passed away; and, froin evidence
received, I judge that that is due somewhat
ta the fact that less delay has occurred
during recent years than occurred ariginally. Some ai the red tape, 'as we might

being exch.anged by mail as between here
and British Columbia, are frequently exchanged by telegraro. As a result ai the
prampter administration ai the Act, the abjections that farmerly seeied ta be insurmounitable have, ta saine extent, been removed; and to that fact I attribute the
change in the attitude ai the Congress tawards the Act itseli. That, I think, answers
the honourable gentleman's question.
Hon. '-\r. MITCHELL: Are we ta understand that when this Act is passed it cannat
be put inta operation without an application iroin the different labour unions where
the troubles occur-that they must ask the~
Federal Gaverninent ta apply it?
Hon. Mr. ]ROBERTSON: No. The sug.gestion that it is propoéed ta subinit ta the
g.athering ai representatives froin the vanious provinces, ta which I alluded, is that
one ai twa thingas ought ta be done: either
the province should give consent, if that is
possible, ta the scape ai this Act be'ing extended ta caver classes ai men in private industry which perhaps nmay not now praperly
corne within the scope ai the Act; or, if tiie
-provinces do not feel that can do that, they
themselves should pass legisiatian along
lines similar ta thase ai this Act, in orde i
that workmen in private indu-stries, and
municipal and provincial emiployees, might
have ýaccess ta machinery for the impartial
investigation ai their gnievances, just as
employees cngaged in publie utilities no".'
have, under this Act.
Han. FREDERIO NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, may I ask the honourable
minister if hie bas given consideration ta
any proposed amendinent wvhich would look,
towards canstituting the board ai conciliation in a somewhat different way? To-day,
when a board ai conciliation is agTeed upon,
the émployer appoints one member, the
representatives ai labour another, and the
two ai them are supposed ta confer and agree
upon a third member, who shall act as
Hom.

Mr. -RORERTSON-.

chairman. In the event of their failure t)~
agree upon the third member, the appointm7ent of the chairmnan rests absolutely -wýitli
the Labour Departinent. I have had considerable knowledge -of a number of boardý
of con ciliationthat have been appointed, but
I have failed to learn af one single case in
which the two parties have been able to
agree upon a chairman. I may as well
state that as a rule the labour representative
will not agree to any chairman that may be
suggested by the employer, and thus the
anus of the appointment cf the chairman is
thrown upon the Labour Departinent. The
Labour Department usally appoints a county
judge. The board ai conciliation rarely
awards the entire increase demanded. In
the great majority of cases it is a question of
splitting the difference. That is ta say, an
excessive amounit is asked for by the eniployees, then a board of conciliation is appointed, and the resuit generally: is the
splitting ai the differenco. which may nïean
a very heavy burden an the employer.
The suggestion that I chould like to make
-it may or may flot be feasible-is this:
that instead of the Department ai Labour
selecting for appointinent ane out of a riumlber of caunty court judges, there ehould be
for one province, say the province of Ontario, a permanent judge, like a judge ai
the Exchequer C-aurt. That judge would be
independent; hie would nc4 be looking forward ta receiving in addition ta his salary a
large amaunt ai remuneration accordîng to
the number ai chairmanships af boards of
conciliation that hie might be able ta secure
during a -year. An independent judge like
a judge ai the Exchequer Court ivould learni
in the course ai vears to weigh evidence
thani it
pro and con much better
mnight be done by a judge appointed
only accasionally; and, his appointinent
being permanent for life, like that oî
every high court judge, he would flot ini
any sense be plavîng ta the gallery; he
would feel that hie was immune froin criticisin and that ail hle had ta do was ta decide the case that came hefore him, as any
bigh court judge -would decide a case, aècording ta the evidence and without fear
or favour. I do nat know whether the suggestion is a practicable one or not, but in
practice there are objections ta the present
method ai appointing chairmen of boards
ai conciliation dealing with eminloyees and
employers in individual industries, because
the third member, the chairman, always
awes his appointinent ta one source, and
that is the Labour Department, and he is
not as indeiuendent as a p)ermanent chair-

APRIL 6. 1920
nian w oul be, apnointed in the saine manruer as a judge of the high court. While
this inatter is under discussion I would
ikie to ask the honourable the Minister of
Labour if any consideration has been given
to anyv such suggestion as I -have advanced.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In answer to
the inquiry of the honourable member frorn
Toronto, I am happy te inform hini that the
point that hie has raised has froin time to
tirne during years past, to my knowledge,
received consideration.
I assume that the honourable gentleman.
in mentioning that so far as he knew the
niembers of boards selected by employers
and workrnen respectively had al-ways failed
to agree upon a third memnber, ivas statiug
the result of bis own experiences, perhaps
as an employer; but I beg to assure hiîn
and the House that that is not by any nieans
alwvays the case. 'In years gene by it fell
to niy lot on several occasions to serve on
boards of conciliation, representing Norkmen, ai-d in no single case did I fail.to
agree with the emiployer's representative as
to the chairm an. The records of the department indicate that in the case of a substantiai nuinher of boards the chairnian bas
been selected by the other two niembers,
chosen by the respective parties.
Als to the other point raised by the lionourable gentleman, rnay I call attention to
this disability that would naturally arise
if bis suggestion were adopted. Legislation
soxnewhat similar to our Industrial Disputes
Investigation Act wvas in eifect in Australia
for iiîany years. Australia had flot only a
pe~rmanent chairmnan, but a permanent
board. and the lawv finally becaîne a dead
letter because the board could not keep pace
with the work that came to it to be doue. It
hiad two years' work ahead of il. and neither
é.-nployers or workmen cared te wait two
-,ears for their turn to have their case heard.
We had in Canada during last year, if I
reniember correctly, 95 boards. There were
oao lîie. T think, 17 boards in session in
ýAt
variotis parts of the country at the saine
tilaie. It wculd, therefore, in uîy humible
opinion, be quite objectionable to have to
postpone the heariug of a dispute just because the permianent chairman happened to
be busy with other cases. It would create
the very discontent that the departrnent has
beeni studiously and persistently endeavouring to overcome, and that caused orgauized
labour to object to the Act îtself for years .
"If a dispute exists," they said, "«we wvant
it inquired into promnptly." And I think,
they are entitled te have it iuquired into

promiptly, if it is to be inquired into at ail.
Therefore, while there is iiuch iiient, froni
one point of view, in the suggestion miade
by the honourable meniber fromn Toronto
(Hlon. Mr. Nicholls), I respectfully subiiit
that there are also objections to the plan.
Hon. JOHN MILNE: Honourable gentlemen, I would like to ask the honourable the
Minister of Labour how the international
unions are going to be aiffected by this. The
international unions of America have control -in Canada as well as in the United
States. In fact, labour has now reached
such a stage that there is no stoppîng it,
and you cannot tell anything about what is
to be done. In nîy own business alone, the
inioulders have been out for four rnonths.
The emiplovees of our shiop were out three
weeks, and they were given what they
wanted. XNow they corne back at us agaîn
and they sav: "We wvant our castings shaken
out arnd taken ont on the niash, and the
sand cut over." We havc to comply with
their deniands, wbich mean about 75 cents
a day added to the Nvages. They are making
$8 a day now, and they are noFt satisfied.
Ail over this country labour is in a fearful
state of tiffheaval. Every one isks for more
inoney, and you have to give it to himi for
certain reasons. Takze our.own case. We
have agents in Mtontreal, in Toronto, and
ini Vancouver. Wc must supply them, besides our customiers, and if we do'not do so
our profitz wvill be eaten up by municipal
taxes and other expenses. We mnust kcep
going. and in order to keep going we nmuet
give labour what tbey want; otherwise
we lo.e our connections and lose business.
There is no doubt it is a good thing to have
these boards of conciliation, but you must
keep in mmiid that the international unions
of America have to do with Canada as well
as the 17iited States. As I understand.
thiere are agitators in every trade organizing unions, and those agitatrirs are paid
large sumis and do not suifer anything. If
they can get the men te stnike. of course
the men suifer, and their wives and children
suifer. The moulders wvent out on strike
and stayed out for four montbs. The agitators who induced tbem to go ont did not
suifer at aIl. because they wlere paid their
I
salaries by the international unions.
would likie to ask the Minister of Labour
just how the question of international
unions is goinga to be reconciled with the
proposition that hie now m-akes regarding
Canada. We can deal wlth Canada, but
we must remember that we have to deal
wvith the United States as well.

queiZstion of the honourable gentlem-an froin

Milne), inav 1 point
Hamilton (Hon. M-Nr.
<ut first that the industry in whichi he is
eng-azed as a suecessful business man is
not one that cornes within the scope of this
Act at ail. It is one whicb would corne
within the scope of a similar Act if the
province of Ontario sa%- fit to set up machinery of this sert, wvhereby an impartial
investigation migbt be had in the case o! a
dispute existing in a private industry; but.
inasmucli as this Act appiies only to workmen engaged in what is known as publie
utilities, it would flot in any way affect
the employees in the industry to wbich rny
honourable friend refers. and in wbich hie
is eng-aged.
Answering bis question as te what bearing this would have upon the activities of
the international unions, I would simply
point out to him and the Honse that the
workmen in every public utility covered by
this Act are nienbers of international
unions; that se far az I knoxw -ani I arni
pretty familiar with thieii-ý-e i v international union bas its separate and distinct
Canadian unit, and that the nmenibers of
international unions in Canada exercise
local autonen•'y and independence in the
handiing o! their own business iii this
country, to just as great an extent as the
Parliament o! Canada bandies its business
witbout interference by the Britisht Governiiment.
May I briefly point out somne of the
benefits that have accrued te this country
by reason of the fact that the Nvorkmnen on
our railroads, for example, are miembers of

what is known as the shop trades. It Nvas
set for a certain Tuesday in August of that
year, if I remiember correctly--or possibiy
Julv. It was only through the influence
exerted upon the Canadian menmbership by

tue executive beads of the international
organization, together with the action of
ther interthe Canadian niernbersbip of
national raiway erg-anizations. that the
strike was averted.
The very fact that the Canadian railways

whicb locked the door upon strikes on rail-

in each of the railway organizations could
not decline to accept what the majerity of

in the United States. Iherefore the verv

wvas
absolutely the cause cf preventing the pessiltilitv of strikes on our railroads during the

in effect existing rates and conditions until
such timie as a new a.-reement wvas made in
the United States, which would not be untii the United States Senate had ratified the
Peace Treaty, or not later than April 1, 1920.
Soine of the workmen have attempted to
repudiate that arrangement. Some dispute
of a minor nature arose which provoked a

strike last summer.
Workers attempted to carry out their obligation under the agreement, and finally succeeded in re-opening or re-operating the

attempt was made by a considerable number of the men, whio hiad affiliated themselves with what ha known as the One Big
Union, to repudiate the agreement unider
which they were working; and at some few

the Act provides that not more than 25 per
cent of the Government appropriation in
each province shall be used for that purpose; but, as the Act now reads, in a pruxince like Nova Scotia, where there has
been just one institution in existence for
years, even the 25 per cent could not be
applied by way of assistance; and the repeal of this section is suggested.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I should like to
ask the minister if this Bill does not very
considerably change the whole working of
the Act? It seerns to me that when we
put the Bill through it was especially provided that this money should not be used
for buildings or for any work done before,
but that the money the Government supplied should be used for the purpose of
technical education, and, I presume, for
buying necessary appliances and that sort
of thing, from that time on. As I understand the honourable gentleman, that is
,,oing to be entirelv changed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is not retroactive; but as it stands at present, it would
prohibit even future additions or improveiiients.

TREATY 0F PEACE WITH

BULGARIAý

RESOLUTION APPROVING IT AGREED TO.

The Sena-te proceeded to the consideration
of a Message frorn the House of Commenls
with a ýResolutien approving of the Treaty of
Peace between the Allied and Associated
Powers and Bulgaria, and requesting the
6enate to unite with that bouse in the
said Resolution.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hon ourable gentlemen, in rnoving the resolution
which stands in my name on the Order
Paper, it probably -%ould be correct for
me to say that within the four corners of
the Treaty before us for consideration, with
a view te ratification, namiely. the Bulgarian Treaty, there is nothing of rnaterial
interest to Canada except in the general
way in which Canada is a party to that
Treaty, and in the recogntion which bas
been given by the Imperial authorities te,
the advanced status of Canada at the Conference. Be far as the Treaty proper is
concerned, it partakes largely lof the geiieral provisions which enter into the treaties
we have already ratifled.
Some of the sections and articles in the
Treaty deal of course with local subjeots
peculiar to Bulgaria. I may direct the attention of the House to some ef those local
considerations. For instance, under Parn
Il of the Treaty, in Article 27, there is a
provision dealing exclusively with the trontiers of Bulgaria. Those wvill be to a very
large extent altered upon the ratification
of the Treaty. In one of the former wars
in which Bulgaria was engaged it secured
a very large acquisition of territory belongProvision is
ing to ad.joining nations.
made in this Treaty for the renunciation
of the territory, or seme of the territory,
then acquired by Bulgaria, and its boundaries are very much restricted. I would
simply invite the attention of honourable
gentlemen te Article 27 of Part II of the
Treaty dealing with that particular phase
of the subjeet. Honourable gentlemen will
observe that special attention is given te
the delimitation of the trontiers aftecting
the new iSerb-Croat-ýSlovene state, Greece
and Roumania; aiso the frontiers on the
Black Sea. Provision is made in the
Treaty for the appointment of a boundary
commission which will hereatter more
closely delirnit the boundaries ireterred to
in the article et which 1 have spoken.
There is also, under Part III, Section 1, a
subject of some interest to Canadians o4! a
cosmnopolitan turn of nîind, in regard to the

.XPRIL 7, 1920
attitude which. Bulgaria will hercaiter tie
compelled to take in regard to some of the
adjoining states. For instance, Article 37
makes special provision for the renunciation in favour o! the Serb-Croat-Slovene
state of certain territory over which the
Bulgarian monarchy in the past has exercised authority. This likewise would apply
to Greece and Roumania. On page 23 of
t.he Treaty, honourable gentlemen will observe that there will be a TenuTiation of
territory in favour of Thrace, Greece and
Roumania. The comumission to be appointed
wilI protect Bulgaria s0 far as that countr'y
on the Aegean Sea is concerned.
Special provision is made on page 40,
under Part VII of the Treaty, for reparatien to be made by Bulgaria to the Âllied
Powers. An indemnity o! two and a quarter billions o! francs, payable in gold, is
being imposed upon Bulgaria, payable to
the Allied Powers. That is only a fraction
o! the penalty which Bulgaria should be
called upon to psy, but owing to ber financial condition, which is recited in the
Treaty, the amount is fixed at that reasonable suni.
There will be found also on pages 42 and
43, further penalties which have been im'ntributions to Greece,
posed in the way of co
Serb-Croat-Slovene
Roumania, and the
state, within a fixed period of time, o! a
very large quantity of live-stock, consisting
o! halls, milch. cows, herses and mares,
mules, draught oxen, and sheep. The coal
mines o! Bulgaria aise have been assessed
with a very substantial contribution, which
will have te be made on account of the incursions which Bulgaria made into adjoining states. On page 45 will also be found
provisions for payment of the army o! occupation. That, and soe of the other provisions to wbichi I have re!erred have been
embodied in the treaties which we have already ratified. The general provisions of
the Treaty are. in !act, a reproduction of
the other treaties. For instance, there has
been embodied in the Treaty the Covenant of
the League of Nations; also the general provisions regarding- financial subjects which
must necessarily be adjusted between the
Allied Powers and Bulg-aria. The econornic
clauses are also found in this; aise provision for aerial navigation, for ports, waterways, and railways; aise the elaborate provisions contained in the other Treaty dealîng with labour. and which, I mav say,
have already been set in motion by the AIlied Powers.
These are the chie! features of the Treat.y.
I need net enter upon the rather interesting

features of tlie Peace Conference, which
were discussed at very great length in the
House of Cninmons wvhen this Treaty was
before that House, as 1 think no good purpose is te be served by entering upon an
academic discussion of the constitutienal
status of Canada with reference to these
Treaties or the advanced recognition given
to Canada by the Imperial authorities. This
of course, may be said to ha the first occasion on which Canada bas entered into anvthing like an international treaty, such as
is emibodied within the four corners of the
Treaty which wve are now considering. Suffiee it to say-and I say this with every confidence, touching the relation of Canada to
the Empire and the status accorded to this
country-that there neyer bas been a time
when it did not rest with Canada alone to
request from the Iniperial authorities, or
frorn the Empire, whatever recognition Canada thought should be accorded to it. I amn
satisfied that to-day that is the position that
Canada occupies in regard te the Empire.,
We do not look at this for one moment as'
a concession on the part o! the Imperial
aut-horities te the attitude of Canada at the
Peace Conference. It has simply resolved
itself into a question as to the relation
which Canada wished to have established
as between this country and the Empire.
Upon that being stated to the Imperial
authorities, they were at once only too glad
te accede to the request; and when honourable gentlemen dîscuss this subject from
time to time I only desire that it should be
kept in view that the sentiment of the
Imperial authorities towards Canada has
always been, and is to-day, that whatever
relations Canada wishes, to have established between herseif and the Empire, that relation will be recog-nized by the Imperial
authorities.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Here.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I desire ta congratulate the
Gavernment an having deaît with this matter in w-hat I might terni a more reaszonable
way than that -in whichi this House Nwas
asked ta deal with the questian of the German Treaty. Honourable gentlemen wvill
remember that a special session was called
at the end of last year for the purpase a!
dealing with the German Treaty, and muat
at that time the Governinient thought it
advisable ta proceed by way of a resalutian ntroduced inta bath Hauses at the
saine turne. I think honourable gentlemen
will. recolleet that I toak exception ta that
procedure at the turne as flot beinL, the
proper method of procedure, inasmuch as
it did flot seem reasonable that either
House should commit itself ta a resolution
without knowing what the atier House had
done in connection with it. I amn glad ta
see that in this particular case the Governinent has proceeded in wvhat would seem
ta me, at any rate, ta be a mare logical and
parliamentary methad of procedure, nainely, by having the resolution moved iu one
House, first a! ail, and sent up ta the ather
Hause for their concurrence.
Another point accurs ta mie in regard ta
this Treaty. In this case wveare asked ta
agree ta the Treaty with Bulgaria. but if
honourable gentlemen will reinember, at
the beginning of the Session the leader of
the Governinent laid on the Table a! the
House the Treaty withi Czecho-Slovakia,
and that Treaty was assented ta by Order
in Council. We hava had nio explanatian
front the Goverument as ta why that procedure was adopted in that case. It seemis
ta me that if we are ta deal with the Treaty
,with Bulgaria as we are asked ta deal with
it, we should deal withi aîl these Treaties
in the saine way. If it is necessary for the

able ta understanl wxhy the Goveriineft
pursued the particular course whichi they
did with regard to the Czeclio-Slovak Treaty,
and, so far as I kilo%\. there lias been no
explanation in regard to that inatter.
My honourable friend lias deait with certain terras of the Treaty %which is before
us, and, of course, lias pointed out that the
termis of the Treaty are very largely the
saine as the ternis of the Treaty with Gerrnany, which we have already agreed to.
The clauses of the League of Nations are
identically the saine in each case, and by
signing this Treaty we have beconme a party
ta the League of Nations. W~e have, as rny
honourable friend hias said, assumed or
taken upon ourselves responsibilities with
regard ta the Leag-ue of Nations, anîd I (Io
flot think the people of the country qiiite'
realize what they may be. Honoural>le
gentlemen who have followed the course of
events in the world since the Gerînan
Treaty was signed -%iIl realize, I think, that,
since the signing cf the Treaty with Gernmany, conditions ini Europe have heroime
worse, if anything, instead of letter. The
press froin day ta day gives us information as ta insurrection and trouble, and
it would look as though the League of
Nations, if it is ta be of any effect at ail,
will very soon have ta take saine very decided stand in regard ta what is happening in Europe to-day. To my mind, conditions in Germany a7re very seriaus, and
1 doubt very xnuch whiether the people of
Canada realize the responsibilities that they
have ta face and the undertakings they
have made in becoming a party ta the
Leagne o! Nations. Honaurable gentlemen
know that at the present turne an the frontier between France and Germany the
Biitish Governinent is maintaining an army
of occupation, and that the French (3overnment is also maintaining an ariny of occupation. They will have seen froin the
newspapers of the last day or twa that in
order to preserve the position that the
French Governinent considered necessary
they have had ta advance their troops fv
ceitain points in Germany, and ta maintain law and order in that country. Thoi-appears ta be considerable friction betweeîî
the German Governinent and the French
Governinent in regard ta the situation existinga hetween the two cauntries. In one
of the morning papers appeared a statement
which reads:

Canadian Parliament ta show their approval of these Treaties, every Treaty tîjat, is

the troo!)s are being recalled to their stations
on the western bank of the Suez Canal. No
letters are arriving fromn Palestine.

That, in a very different part of the
world, will show to honourable g-entlemien
that the state o! unrest at the present tirne
is a very serious one, and that the condition that we xnay have to face in the near
future may possibly bie very onerous. As
one o! the members o! the League o! Nations, Canada must assume considerable
responsibilities, and I think that in acceptin- these we have to bie prepared to take
our stand as part of the British Empire
and to do our part in upholding the League
of Nations, and trying to make it a force
to niaintain the peace of the world. The«
great danger that I see at the present time
is that the feeling generally seems to bie
that the League of Nations has not accomplished anything-that it is more or less
of a dead issue. The action of our neig-hbours to the south has no doubt militated
considerably against the work o! the League.
and consequefltly we miust bear in mind
that wve rnay have to assume very serions
responsibilities in connection with carrying out the duties o! the League of Nations.
My honourable friend bas talked about
the status o! Canada, and the position that
she bas assumed.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: WVould my honourable friend allow me to ask hlm. a question
before he goes into another inatter? Do I
understand xny honourable !riend to bie
opposed to Canada joining in the League
o! Nations?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No. I do not think
my honourable friend bias understood my
remarks, because in what I have been saying I have not in any way indicated that
I arn opposed to Canada having signed
the Leaguue o! Nations; but I think the
people of Canada to-day do not realize
what the responsibilities are that they have
assumied by the action that they have
taken in signing it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then idoes the
honourable gentleman assume that, if they
had, they would not have signed it?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Speak for yourself,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The remarks which
îuy honourable friend, the leader of the
Government, made with regard to Canada's
position in the League of Nations were, as
1 understood them, to the effect that it is
recog-nized by the British Emipire generally
that the Dominions shall from this time
on bie made parties to agreemnents that are
ontered into between the British Empire
and other nations. I do not myseif think

lu carry out the clause dealing with the
enlistinent of troops; that they find il is a
very expensive malter for them 10 obtain
the kind of recruits that they want by
voluntary enlistment, and that the clause
in the Treaty dealing with conscription
which absolutely forbids them from conscriplirig men for military service, is going
10 interfere very seriously mith their cuslomary method of carrying on. In clause
65, page 27, it is stated:
Universal conl)uisory military service shall
be abolished in Bulgaria. The Bulgarlan Armiy
shaîl in future oniy be constituted and recruited by means of voluntary eaiistment.

This is apparently the clause which the
Bulgarian goverrnent now finds it very
difficult Ici carry out, and which lhey have
been endeavouring- to have amended. There
are other clauses in the Treaty NvIich, I
think, rnay possibly give rise Ici trouble,
on account of the nalionalities in lthe terrilories contained within the new boundaries. 1 understand that there are large
numbers of Bulgarians in the territory
which is now being cul off fromi Bulgaria

which the League of Nations mnay have Ici

These points occur 10 me as showing the
necessity of our studying very carefully
what may be lte resuit of the position in
which we stand to-day as members of Ibis
League of Nations., and of realizing as well
as we can what is the meaning of the responsibilities that will bie lhrown upon the
country.

This is the second time that ffhe League
of Nations has dealt with the protection of
minority rights. In the Treaty with Germany similar provisions were contained.
The League cf Nations lias therefoxe
solemnly on two occasions declared and proclaimed the right o! minorities to the free
use o! their language and their religious
helief s. They have gone further: they have
provided the means 'whereby these rights
may be fieely and without infring-ement
enjoyed. net only with regard to religion
and language, but with regard te education
as wve1l.' They have gene further; t.hey have
decreed in this case, as they have previously
done 'with regard te the counitries within the
German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, that the -minorities shaîl have a
right te a share of the public money devoted
te educational purpeses. They have gone
further than that again: they have declared
tha;t Uùhs question of the protection of
minorities le a question of international
concern. They have provided that if any
o! the parties to these Treaties-and Canada
is ene o! themi-has any complaint te urge
of infraction, or danger of infraction, of any
law or regulatien relating te such rights,
the Council wvill take the matter up and
will, te use the words of the section, "take
such action and give such direction as it
may deemn proper and effective ini the circuinstances."

There are in the Confederation of Canada
two provinces, whichi are to-day denying the
riglt whichi they say mnust be accorded to
the minorities in Bulgaria, Gerrnany, and
Austria-Hungary. ln lhe province of Manitoba the French Canadian Cathoîjo minority, in order to be able to teach their
children the language of their forefathers,
and the religion they have inherited from
thein, must pay double taxes. In other
words, they have to pay the public school
taxes, and they have te tax theinselves for
the maintenance and support of their oxvn
schools, in order to have their children
taught their language and religion. In the
province of Ontario, in regard to language,
the saine difficulty exista to-day. In the socalled English-French schools-and what a
parody it is to cali 'thein by 'that naine!

flac, and are -we in Canada going to be

mninority in Ontario of rights which we declare nmust be given to those f ar-away

that, but by theee Treaties it has been given

are you going to allow the men who have
been trained for years and years to leave
yonlr service because you w-ill not pay them
enough to keep tbem here, and let theïm
depart in order to earn a little more elsewhere? I amn glad to see the leader of the
Government in his place at this moment,
and I would ask him if bie would be good
enough to caîl the attention of the Cabinet
to the fact that these delays are unhearable
to these men, and that a decision should
be given. If there is no intention of classifying them in a better class, they might as
well be told at once, and their services
would be retained by people who were willing to give them a better salary. Or, if

there is going to be action, it shoffld be
now. These menl are in a position of great
uncertainty.
I do flot want to detain tiie House on this
question. I thought, before wve took, recess,
the question would have been decided
one way or the other. We corne back, after
four weeks and nothing is done. I-do flot
know whether the Civil Service Comîrmission is to bi-ame, or whether there is some
one who is saying that there is no hiurry
about this thing-that it cani wait until
the session is over. But 1 think it is an
injustice to these officiais, who know so
much of this country. It would take years
and years for a new staff to find out al
that these men know. Are we going to let
those who have the knowledge go? I hope
the leader of the Government will see that
something is done in the near future to relieve the doubts of these gentlemen.
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 want to add a
few words t-o whiat the honourable gentleinan has said. because the position withi
regard to the Geological Survey affects- very
considerably the province of British Coluroibia fromi which. I corne. The nuinber o!
resignations within the last year or eighteen
months in the Geological Survey bas been
causing a great deal of agitation amongst
the people interested in mining in that
province. To show hon-ourable gentlemen
the feeling with regard to it, 1 maight possibly - be perinitted to read a resolutioîi
whidh. was introduced into the British
Columbia House by the Honourable \Villi-am Sloan, -Minister of Mines for British
Columîbia. It is as follows:
Whereas, under the terms of union off this
province with the Dominion of Canada, it is
incumbent on the Dominion Governmlent to
maintain in British Columbia the geological
survey;
And whereas fromn the pioneer work of Dawson
to the present day the services of the geological
survey have been of intestimable value to the
minerai industry of this province;
And whereas recent advices show that. out off
a total number off twenty-one geologists available for field work throughout the Dominion,
elght already have tendered their resignations.
and others are likely to do so, thus leaving very
fewv fleldmen for the whole Dominion;
And whereas the six years prior to 1914 the
geologîcal survey maintained an average of
nearly twelve geological and topological field
parties In British Columbia alone. it hecomes
evident that it will be impossible for the survey
to provide for work in British Columbia trained
geologists from the remaining staff to continue
the geological work so necessary to the minerai
development off this province.
Be It resolved, that this LegisIative Assembly
of the province of British Columbia expresses
Its appreciation of the great value off the wvork
of the geological survey of Canada as ass!sting
the minerai development off this province. and

survey staff, especially at thlis time. wvhen, wvith
the xvorid entering upuria perîod of reconstruction. it is most important to Our miniflg

And be it further resolved, that this Legislative Assembly 0 f the province of British
Columbia does strongly urge the Dominion Gevernmelt;
(1) To take seme Immedlate action to prevent further depletiOn of this mest valuable
branch of the Civil Service.
(2) To off er adeqtiate Inducements to engineering and sclentific students of Canadian

And be It further reselved, than an humble
Lieuaddress be presented te His Henour the pretenant-Goerfler, praylng that a copy ef the be
set eut
ambles and resolutionS hereinbefore
of
transmltted te the honourable Secretarv
State.

I have net been able te get information
as te whether the resolution was passed or

net, but I think honourable gentlemen wîll
see !rom it that the Minister o! Mines of
British Columbia, at any rate, considers
that the condition of things is serieus.
As honourable gentlemen may know,
there is a considerable mininga development
geing on in British C.olumbia to-day, and
a great deal o! prospecting is being done,
especially in the northern part of the province. 1 regret te say that, in confirmation of the resolution which 1 have just
read. a gentleman frein Britishi Columbia
the other day told me that an officer o! the
Geoleg-ical Department, a '\r. McKay, who
had preven hinisel! te be an exceedingly
valuable officer along certain lines of Work,
with regard te placer mining in the northern part o! the country, particularly around
Barkerviile, a man who had worked eut an
original system of his own, of the possible
geelogical formation of that Country, which
apparently had neyer occurred te any One
1)efore, had leit the service. He had put
his ideas te practical test, te the great
benefit o! the people who were mining in
the Barkerville district, who had been enabled. by follewing up bis theories, te carry
on their work te the best advantage. As
I say, this gentleman has unfortunately le! t
the service, and, as I understand, is geing
inte the service of some company operating
in India. It will be impossible te -replace
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

this man. because, so far as I arn inforrned,
there is no other man in the service, or, as far as I know outside
o! the service, who bas followed up
this particular uine of work and is capable
of taking on the kind of work that hie has
been doing. His work Nvould be valuable
in the Omaenica, Tulameen, and other placer
mining districts in British Columbia, and
it is inost unfortunate that the services o!
this gentleman should be lost to the country.
1 maie these few remarits to bring this
matter to the attention o! the Government,
becauEe 1 think at the present time, when
we desire to do alI we can to increase the
production o! the country, it is a very
serions matter indeed that this condition
of thing-s should have arisen.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: The question under discussion is no doubt a most important one; at the same time I consider it absolutely impossible for this or any other
governmreflt to retain ail the civil servants
in their positions irrespective o! what outside parties may do. We know that occa,sionally we, get in the Civil Service men
o! extra abilîty, and those men receive very
good salaries. My honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain), who spoke just before the
honourable leader of the Opposition, seemed
to think those men should be retained at
any cost; but if my honourable f riend was
out with a party of surveyors, and a chainman said hie was offered twice as much as
the ordinary pay given to chainmen, 1 am
sure my henourable friend would replyt
" Weil, I am very serry, but 1 am paying
you the highest price that chainmen are
getting, and therefore I cannot pay you any
more, so you will have to go and get double
salary with somebody else," and my honourable friend would get another chainman.
In regard te the case cited by the honourable leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Boetock), I have neyer in my lifetime
known a man te drop out from any position,' even the highest position in the land,
who could not be replaced right thiere and
then; somebody else can always be secured.
If the man referred te by the leader o! the
Opposition bas developed some new system
in connection with placer mining there will
be a lot o! n-Wn who will know something
about it, and who could take bis place. The
trouble is that if we attempted te keep in
the service ail who are in it, irrespective o!
what they are offered from the outside, by
giving such men an extra thousand or two
thousand a year, there would be five hundred or a thousand men who are getting the

APIRIL 7, 19-20
Saame salarý- -vhmo wvould coliplain that the '
should get. sirniilar increases. XVhen a nian
can do better outside of the Civil Service
than in it, I think hie ought te get eut as
sean as possible, for I do net believe the
Civil Service is a good place for sncb a
nian. The Governinent cannet begin te
give that man such a salary as would keep
humi in the service, simply because they
would have to apply the saine rule te huindreds of ethers, and the cost of maintaining
the Civil Service has gene up te such an
,extent that any Gevernrnent will have te
tbink seriously before undertaking a pelicy
that might lead in some cases te the pay,ment of double the present salaries. I
know of men in the service wvbo get offers
of twice as mnuch as they were receiving- in
the service, ai-d they went eut and took
positions; but I have known o! these sarne
inen wanting, te cerne back, and willing te
return at their eld salaries; for it must be
remembered that they do net ail get the
'bic salaries for a long turne, and even
thougch thev may get a larger sary for a
turne, it is net in Gevernment service. which
seme ni therr weuld prefer. Dnring the
boom in the West many bank clerks left
the banks and were rnakinmg bic meney eutsaide; but within three or four years hundreds
of thei were applying tei get back te their
old positions at their old salaries. The
question of payrnent te the civil servants is
a large one, but I think we rnay as well
make up our ininds that it is impossible for
any Goverirent te keep every inan in the
service, 'because in that case effers would
be made te scores of men in the service for
the purpese of increasing t.heir salaries. It
cannot be dene successfullv unless we simiply cnt loose and psy ne attention it ail tn
the fact that the Civil Service is costing
quite enough now.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I suppose that
dees net apply te senators?
Hon. Mr. TURIFF: Yen can applv it
te yeurselves if ven wish. It is a vexed questien, ne doubt, but I do net see how it is
Possible te deal with it aleng the lines sucgested-giving large increases te a certain
number o! men-because that wonld cause
dissatiafaction frein one end e! the service
te the ether, and would accomplish ne goed.
I think we can rest assured that wvhen a
rnan gees olLt there is somebody in his departinent who can take bis place. No*doubt,
as the leader ef the Opposition bias stated,
at a time like this, wben we need a great
development in tbe natural reseurces o! the
country, we sheuld bave geod geelogists and
S-9

;0hlc jitn vlîÔ know the country wvell, who
kriom about the deposits that May be dfound,
and how thev could be developed; but te
mvi inid these can be developed just as well
iiiider the present systein as by a method of
increasing salaries of individuals in ordei
that they should always reinain in the departirients. Good men can get good salaries,
and if they cannot get them in the departnients they are quite justified in going out;
but I do flot think tbey are justified in coinplaining to the Governinent that they are
flot getting enough salary where thev are.
If they are flot content, let thein go wvhere
they can do best, because if they go to
private companies their services are flot lost
te the country. I remember cases vdiere
ilon wvent froni the Northxvest te private
cemipanies%r.
Hon. -- CASGRAIN: But tbey are going
to the United States.
\r.
Hon. -- TURRIF'F: Yes, but we get any
number of men frorn the United States te
coule bore. Yoin cannot stop the AngloSaxon iromi travelling ail over the world;
that is wbat lias made the Empire; the men
ef the Britishi Isles %vere flot content to stay
at home. but -vent aIl over the eartb and
took the best of it, and they are still doing
that, and will always do it. Hence our men
will go to the United States under any and
ahl circuistances, and many people wilI
corne into Canada from the United States.
It is a fair exebange, and we are net losing
anlything on that account. I think the Governrnent should move cautiously in this
iiiatter, because it is a subject that would
easi1v lead thein ino a grcat deal of difficnlty and involve very large expenditure,
and in iiy opinion they are doing enough
iii the uine of expenditure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
io objection te the erder geing; but I might
sav that verv happilv the responsibilîty at
the present tinie does net rest on the shoulders of the Geverninent, as this is a matter
that cernes within the authority of the Civil
Service Commission. Notwitbstanding the
dissatisfaction expressed by my bonourable
f riends opposite, 1 would say, in a very
iriendly way, that they are themselves very
largely responsible, baving withdrawn from
the Governinent the exercise of any dîscretien in fixing salaries of professional men.
I recaîl that last session, when the Civil
Service Bill was before a committee of the
Senate, with the classification of salaries
attached therete, mny honourable friends
%-ere very strongly opposed to any discretion
being vesl.ed in the Gevernment, particu-

larly in adjustin.- the salaries of those who
occupied professienal positions in the emi-

that
ploy of the Governrnent. I must say
te vesting in the minister
1 was favourable
er the Government a fair amount of diacretien in fixing that particular cla-sa ef salaries, and I think it should be se.
\r.
Hon. -- CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU.GHEED: I amn net
at aIl in faveur of an arbitrary commission,
such as the Civil Service Commission, mechanically fixing compensation for the clasa
o! services invelved in the aubject now
befere us; but the Senate in its wiademi considered that it wvas inadvisable te permît
the Governmoent te ho charged with exerCising an,, sncb discretien as that which I
have indicated.
But was not
Hon. '-\r. DANDURAND:
that the honeurable gentleman's Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG'HEED: It was;
but 1 may say in answer te what my honcurable friend had said, that an amendînent
wvas moved, which wvaa very strongly oppesed by gentlemen who ait on the oCher
aide of the House.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think my lionourable friend and 1 voted on the same
aide.
Hon. JAMES LOU'GHEED: I may say, in
reference te these threatened resignations,
or those which have already taken place,
that since Confederatien. there has neyer
been a vacancy without an applicant te fIll
it, and I have ne doubt that if there should
be a general exodua of the gentlemen referred te in the motion before us, there wvill
be a genesis o! those who are quite prepared to fill the vacancies that wonld thus
be created.

Section 1 wvas agýreed to.
On section 2, new section l6-.ignatures
requisite for applications to refer disputes
to a board and for statutory declarations
accempanying thern.
Paragraphs a, b and c were agreed to.
,On paragraph d:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman tell us if this applies
te the employees of a sing-le corporation or
employer, or does it apply to a union that
embraces working men working for more
than one employer?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The amendment
to paragraph c of section 2, which the
Comrnittee have already adopted, refera to
the point that my honourable friend raises,
namely, that it is permissable te establish
boards where there niay be several eniployers involved instead of an individual employer, as the Act now provides. The proposed change in paragraph d is suggested
hecause it is desired that applications for
a board shaîl express the will of the majerity of the men affected. Instances have
corne to the notice of the department where,
under the Act as it new reads, a meeting
is called and the purpose of the meeting
announced at least three days in advance;
but a handful of men may corne to the
meeting, reach a decision, and make application for a board, perhaps entirely without the knowledge, let alone the consent,
of the majority of the men affected. The
purpose of this proposed change is that
the minister may require what wiIl satisfy
him that the application does express the
voice of the majority of the men affected,
and prevents ininority rule ameng- workmen
themselves, and the exercise of the will of
the minority upen the majority. The
amendinent does not in any way adversely
affect the employer.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: la paragraph d intended to take effeot in the case of a firm
or corporation or business where ahl the
men are nôt members of the trade union?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Paragraph e
specifically provides that applications for
boards may be made "by employoes some
or ail of whom are not members of a trade
union."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 'That is the case
you are dealing with?

APRIL 7, 19'20
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I would like to
asic the honourable Minister of Labour if
the Governrnent, hiaving taken into accounit
the advisability of action being taken by
the majority of the employees, have bad
their -attention called to the like necessity
of having a sîmilar arrangement in connection with employers? The point I wish
to make particularly is this. Suppose that
througbhout any province there are twenty,
thirty, or forty manufaeturing firrns engaged in one particular industry, and one
of those firrns is singled eut by a trade
union for attack; the others are flot notified;
and therefore the burden la thrown upon
one îndustry either to concede or to combat the demands made upon them, and
which may be very onerous. I have bad
occasion to communicate with the bonourable minister in my private capacity, suggesting that some steps should be taken to
bring about uniformity in the rates of wag-es
in particular zones throughout Canada. I
think it would roake for industrial pe2ce
and greater satisfaction, and lessen unrest,
if there were a general conference of the
majerity of employers engaged in an industry with representatives of a niajerity
of the unions that might be identJified with
that industry. As the honourable minister
bas said, of course it is unfair that the
minority of a union should foment trouble
and create unrest to the disadvantage of
a majority of the same union that niay not
be in sympathy or accord with their action.
It is equally important that, when the3- are
dealing with a particular industry, the
niajority of employers should also be taken
ix•te consideration, and any decision that
is arrived at should~be uniform. Othervise
one particular locality is prejudiced te the
great disadvantage of another. It lias been
stated, in the past, witb or without rensen,
that international unions have foniiented
strife in Canada, to the disadvantage c-f
Canadian industries and for the great advantage of United States industries. Wliether that is true or not I arn not prepared
to say, but I do say there is a possibility
iu the -Canadian branch of an international
or any other union of some official being
reached by the executive of a large manufacturing corporation and being induced to
tomnent trouble in the industry of a competiter. We know that it has been done, and
it bas been preven by the records ef the
courts (to have been done, in the United
States; and if it bas been done acro6s the
hune there is no reason to suppose that it
may net be done in Canada. I do not say
S-91

13t

it lias been dlone, but there is the opportunity of doing it in Canada, and it is quite
possible, by the method that at present is
followed, of a union concentrating on one
particular industry or one particular locality, te cause loss or destruction in a particular industry and great loss and deprivation to a particular locality for the benefit
of somne other industry or sorne other lecality, svhich m.ay or imay flot be cognizant
of the fact. I sirnply want te .bring this
point forward and ask the hionourable the
Minister of Labour if he has given any consideration to that phase of the question.,
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTSON: The point that
the honourable inember from Toronto bas
raised would indeed be very important if it
camne within the scepe of the Act. The Industrial Dis-putes Investigation Act applies
enly to public ýutilities, such as mnines and
transportation companies, as described in
the epening sections, and employees engaged
in private industries such as any honourable
friend bas referred to do not at the present
tiie corne within the scope of the Act.
I heartily agree with niuch that any boriours ble friend bas said withi respect te
the desîrability of closer ce-operation by
mneans of association -between employers and
workmen theniselves, with a view to standardizing and makîng uniform the rates of
wages and conditions of employanent in a
giyen industry -in a given lecality. Efforts
in that direction were made by the officiais
of the Department of Labour a year age,
with sonie suocess, in certain industries,
and I can assure my honourable friend that
se far as it lies wvithin the jurisdiction of
the Federal Departinent of Labour we
should be delighted to assist in prometing
the very purpose that hie bas se effectively
stated to the House to-da.y.
But, as tbe Industrial Disputes Investigation Act now stands. it is not within
the jurisdiction of the Federal Department
of Labour to interfere in private industry.
Thiat point wvas touched upon during our
discussion last night. I stated that in iny
humble opinion the scope of the .Act ought
to ýbe extended to private industries:* or
that similar anachinery ought to be set up
by provincial enactmnent, se that thoge employees and employers to whorn my honourable friend alludes might have means te
adjust their disputes, as employer6 and
workmen engaged. in public utilities now
have under this Act.
Paragraph d was agreed to.

It is not ail eatirelv new clause, as myv

upon the majority of the ernplovees concerned.

honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERITSON: M-Nv
Iriend is in error in thinking that this is
a new section. Subsection 4 of section 16
oi the presenit Act reads exactly the sarne
:v-ý îarazripli e of this ainendînient, except
that this provides that the authorization
liiiust he obtainied in wvhole or in part at a
iiieetiinL. if only a portion of the men are
present at a mneeting, the will of a small
ininority of the total înernbership or the
iotal nuier of men affected shall fot gov,ern without the consent or authority of the
inajority of the aien affected having been
oDbtaiineri.
I nia y perhap z clearly deionstrate just
xhtthis mieails by a concrete illustration.
During the tirne that there were saine diffizultieS existing in Western Canada last
year, the postal emaployees in the city of
Vancouver, for exaînple, were called to,, ther ta decide wbether or nat they should
-participate iii a synpathetic strike movemet-nt. The niajority of the men affected
w'ere preserit and they voted the proposition
dowîî voted against gaing on strike. At
.eleven o'clock that niglit a portion of the
mnen, kaiown ta be syniipathetiec to the proposai to go on strike, attended a special
mneeting rwhicli had been called, and to
whic4i only somle of the men had been in-vited. It was proposed by that back-alley
rnethod. to get the necessary authority
-whereby ail the postal employees in Vancouver would be called out. Fortunately
the men were alive ta the situation. They

to deal with trade troubles that do niot come
within the purviewv of public utilities. Probably the honourable ininister can tell us
how large a proportion af boards of conciliation, or how inany, have been called
together to consider trade disputes that did
not corne vithin the Act. He rnentioned
yesterday, as an evidence that it w~ould flot
be feasible ta appoint a permanent chairmaan, that sanie seventy-niae cases, I think,
hiad been considered during the year, and
I believe that a very large pr-oportion of
those cases were of trade disputes that dîd
not corne under the Act. Therefore, the
point that I macde yesterday is ahl the more
signifioaat, that, in order ta preveat unrest, in order ta coaced-e every possible
opportimity for the ernployees ta be favourably and properly heard by the proper tribunal, a great rnany employýers and others
hlave consented voluntarily, althaugl their
industrv did not corne -within the. Act, ta
thle establishrnent of boards of conciliation.
Thes-e boards of conciliation have met. but
la îny judgrnent their Iinding-s have lieeni
alinost altogether in ifavour of the enmployees and not in favour of the employers.
As I pointed out yest-erday, there is a demand made for a certain percentage af increase, and if aay one wvill take the trouble
to irivestigate the nuinher af awards that
have been made and the ternis oi those
awards, he will find that in the great majarity ai cases there rnight as well have been
no0 chairman at ail; it was just a question
of splitting the difference. Each side put
forwvard its own case, but the employerand 1 arn perfectly frank about it-is under
this disadvantagae. Hie norninates one board
member and the workrnen norninate anothier. Thev fail ta agree upon a chair-

spread the news, attended. the meeting at
Il o'clock ait nighit, and again def-eated the

atteîpt ta have thern go out on strike when
they hiad no g-rievance of their own.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. -Mr. NICHOLLS: Honourable gentlemen, the honourable the minister stated
that the Act applies only ta those eig.aged

quite aware of that filct. But it is witliia
miv knowledge that a very large nuinber of
boards of conciliation have been appointed

APRIL 7, 19-20
man, and tlierefore the chairmani is mail-

datorily appoinited-by whomn? By the
Minister of Labour, or the Labour Departmuent. The Labour Departmnent have a certain numiber of judges who might almost
be called professiona'l chairmen of boards
.of conciliation, and I assume-I think it
is natural to assume, honourable gentlemen
-that as týhese chairnien may have a
number of cases during
the
year,
for ail of which they receive a remuneration in addition to their salaries
as county judges, they aire naturally anxjoua -to keep in good odour wîth the powers
that be. Now, in spite o! themselves, with
ail their desire to act impartially and fairly, what they consider to be the wishes
of the powers that be mnust have, intuitively
perhaps, sorte effect upon their mental attitude towards the case over which. they
are presiding. .My idea. in proposing a
peimanient chairman was that hie would be
immune fromn criticîsm; he would gradually, froin year and fromn case to case, becorne better -able to sif t the evidence: lie
would naturally, froni lis constant practice, becoane acquainted with ail the varied
technical conditions that surrouid. the different industries of the country.
The honourable minister pointed out,
quite frankly and fairly, that it would be
beyond the power of one permanent chairmaan to handle as many cases as hie would
be called upon to do, and, as despatch or
time was o! the essence of the settlemient
o! these disputes, they had adopted. the plan
o! appointing a chairman in each case,
who might be selected at random. But I
amrn ot aware that there is only one Juclge
to handie ail the law cases in Ointario-.
As the cases coniing before the courts multiply. more judges are appointed. The matters dealt withi by Boards of Conciliation
involve enormous sums of mioney. The cutcorne inay mnean tremendous losses. not
only to the individual employer or to the
employees, but also to the country at
large, because the action inay result in
destroying the Canadian trade and sending
the busineIss to a foreign country. Therefore I claimi that it would not be unireasonable to have a sufficient numiber of permianent chairmen appointed to deal with industrial disputes.
Let me take a case in point. I know of
several concerna that pay upwards o!
S5,000,000 a year iii wages. Nobody will ùbject to a fair increase, but an unfair increase, that has been given because the
chairman wam not conversant with the
technicalities o! the particular case, ni'ght

133l

mlean S750,000 a veai-. Noîw, whiat industry
Cali stand up against an increase of $750.000
a year to its workmen, when the workmen
enigag-ed in like industries iii different localities hiave flot been subiected to that treniendous loss? The 'business is destroyed.
The owner loses his orders. Either they go
abroad or they go to some other locality
in this country which has not been subjected to this industrial unrest. I consider
that in the acgregate thîs question involves
,annually hundreds o! millions of dollars,
and very o!ten it is dealt with in such a way
that much of that money may be diverted
from the trade of the country and the consequent employment of Canadian workmen..
If the amount involved were only a few
thousand dollars a year, one chairmnan
rnight be sufficient, but if the amounit involved is tens o! millions of dollars a year,
I submit, honourable gentlemen, that it is
not too much to expect that the Department
of Labour would appoint a sufficient numnber of permanent chairmen to handle the
cases. In my business, in your business,
in anybody's business, if it grows to such
an extent that a department has to be
subdivided into two departments, you have
to appoint a new departmental head. Those
two departinents may*have to be subdivided
ag-ain, as is the case in some o! those great
departmental stores that have done so,
nîuch for the credit and prosperity of Canada. They may have to be subdivided
into fifty departrnents, and do you t]iink,
that the head oi the concern will sa.y, - Oh
well, we cannot afford to increase our business, because w-e have only one head of a
department~" He wvill appoint newv heads
of departnients, and lie will appoint a sufficient number-whatever nuinber is esseritial for the prosperity o! the concern. I
claimi tlat there is no question before this
House that cleals with vaster sums than the
question o! labour and capital, the question
o! the aniount paid by the employer to the
eniployee. I tliink the honourable the Minister o! Labour wilI -ive nie credit for lîaving done everything possible in mv own
business, since hie lias been appointed. to
inaintain peace and satisfaction as between
the employer and the employed, but my
experience of Boards of Conciliation is that
uxiless there is a judicial mind that is free
froui bias, that has only the one purpose
in vien-, that of holding the scales of justice
ini balance, wve shaîl neyer have that deg-ree
of peace and satisfaction hetween the two
classes which we should have.

amalgamation o! two offices. Is there anv

of the Cominisioner o! the Royal Canadiani
Mounted Policýe or o! pavineg hlmi two salaries on a(croint of bis holdiriL two offi-e-'

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I wvould
not think so. The legisîntion of last session
aboli.shed the office o! Commisioner o! Dom-

inion Police and vested in the Commissioner o! the Mounted Police the administration of the entire body. My recollection
is that the salary fixed by that leg-islation
would probably not rapreserit what hie was
drawing as Commissioner o! the Northwest
Mounted Police, because he had certain
advantagaes, such as residence, rations, and
that kind of thing, for wvhich provision was
not made in the legfislation which 've
passad. My impression is that the salary
fxad would not represent more than the
equivalent o! ýwhat hie had been receivincg
previously.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, I noticed to-day, for the first tinte

is under whose command the policemen
la this Parliamient building are acting.

Formerly, as I understand,

the Dominion

Police were under the control of Col. Shierwood, w-ho w-as the chief coinmanding officar o! that body; but now 1 presumne thay

Mounted Police. I think it is perhaps riglit
that the 'Senata should know what duties
they have te perform, what orders they re-

ceiva, and under whose direction they are
acting. I presume they are, in a -sensa, for
the purpose of keeping order in the building. They inust be under somahbody's control; they ninst receive orders and direction-.

question of the hionourable gentlemanii froiin
St. Johin (Hon. Mr. Daniel), could perhaps
tell us whether the -Government intends to
liiiit the -activities of the force to those
fields which have heretofore been covered
by the Northwest Mounted Police.
Hon. Sir JA.MES LTJOUHEED: MyIhion1
ourable fniend is familiar with the constitution and knows that the Northwest Mounted
Police could flot interfere with provinoial
authority. There is certain Federal authority to lie enforced and rnaintained in the
different provinces of Canada, irres)ective
of provincial considerations, and the jurisdiction of this body of police can he exercised only withîn that particular sphere of
(luty. The intention is not in any sense to
interfere withi provincial authority unless
by mutual arrangement between the provincial and Federal Governments such as
formerly existed in the provinces of Saskatchewan and .Alberta, whereby the police
acted for both governiments. But the organization o! provincial police renders that
arranguement unnecessary. and il is no
long-er effective..
The Northw-est -Mounted Police, beinz the
larger body of the tw'o, and havinff been
administered for niany years by the President of the Pnivy Council. the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are naturallý. attached to his departrnent. Wherens the
Dominion Police were forrnerly under the
administration o! the Departnment o! Justice, the arnalgarnated body is now administeredl by the President of the Privy Cotîncil. The instructions referred to by m- hionourable friend from lSt. Johin (Hon. LnI.
Daniel) would naturally corne and do corne
froai- the Comnissioner of Police. He is
responsible for the placing o! flie men on
dutx- and for 'vhatever distribution o! the
force rnay be inade, and the police natturally
report to huaii just as anv qnilitary or police
body would report to their coiimiaiidingoffi cer.
Hon. Mr. DAýNIEL: That does not make
the iatter quite as clear as 1 woul like

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: HIe lias no control

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is what I wanted to find out-whether this House or the
other House lias any control over the
actions of the police who are on duty here?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: No.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend whether it is the intention of the Government to have those serviceswhich were previously performed by
the Dominion Police outside the capital in
the provinces, performed in future by the
Dominion Police or by th.e Royal Canadian
Mounted Police?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no distinction betw-een the two bodies; they
have been merg-ed in one body, and tlie one
body wvilI perform ail the duties that were
fornierly performed by the Dominion Police, and will likewise perform all the duties
that were performed by the Northwest
Mounted Police.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there to be but
one unifornm?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
niav be some distinctiori between the
nîoùnted and the unmounted bodies. My
recollection is that the Act tnakes provision for a distinction between the two
branches of the police. The mounted body
will be practically the same as the old
Northwest Mounted Police; there will lie
one force, administered by one head, and
it Nvill perform all the duties which, were
formierly perforrned by both.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
fniend miglit perhaps tell us what were the
services performed in the past by the Doininion police outside.of the Capital-with
regard, o! course, always to Dominion matters.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED: 'rhey
were enmployed chiefly on public works and
public buildings; and if any police services
had to lie rendered in connection with the
enforcement of any Federal laws, they were
elitrusted wîth that particular duty.
Do they have

Hou. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; they

coîîld be detailed for duty on any public

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They were under the direction of the Department of Justice?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And they were
utilized for the enforcement o! the excise
and customs laws?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Where there was any threatened violation
-o!
any o! those laws, they were entrusted
with the duty o! en!orcing theni.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: New that they
will ne longer be under the jurisdiction o!
the Department o! Justice, will they still
be to a certain extent arnenable to the
orders o! that department for the enforcement o! those laws?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
orders ivould corne through the departrnent
te which they are attached, nainely, that
of the President of the Privy Council.
They are entirely removed f romi the Departmnt o! Justice, but the Department of
Justice could readily set thern in motion

PRIVATE BILLS.
SUCOND READINGS.

Hon. -Mr. PROUDFOOT inoved thie second reading af Bill 7, an Act ta incarparate *The T. Eatan General Insurance Company. H-e said: The Bill, as stated on
its face, is ta ixicorparate The T. Eatan General Insurance Company, with a capital of
$50d,000, with the right ta increase it ta

$i,ooo,ooe.

It might not be'ont of place ta

mention some reasons why the T. Eaton
Company des-ire ta have en Act cf this kind
passed. A numbeT of years ago the Coinpany formed wvhat was called a welfare
departiment, for the purpase of assisting
their emplayecs, when necessary, on accourit cf illness or any other oatise. In

uonnection with that departmnent certain
aetivities were forrned. amiong thern a girls'
chlb, a b)oysc' club, a choir, a surnîiner camp
for bovs. a dental clinic. X-rays, nurses,
and services in other lines. Then, in order
to coninllete these varions -%orks, it becomes
necessary to adopt whiat is called sickness
and accident insurance. thus supplementiîîg the work done by the welf are departnment. The Comnpany hias at present about
20,000 emiployees, one of its largest establishmrents being lin Toronto, and another

also desire to provide old age pensions and
life insurance to assist those who rnay be
left behind by the death of the wage-earnier.
Tliey now «provide retiring- allowances for
mren and women; but no0 definite plan hias
yet been decided on, and it is for the purpose of placing these on a definite 'basis
that the company now desires to secure this
insurance. Under the arrangements a maxi
will be enititled to retire aud receive a pension when ihe reaches an age anywhere between 60 and 65 years, though it inay not
be coînpulsory on hini to retire. Female
,workers wvill also be able to retire. at a
soinewhat earlier age than the miaIes.
Hoin. '-%r. FOWLER: Why?
I-Ion. M-ýr.PROUDFOOT: It is thoughit
that probably they may flot be quite as
strong, and for that reasoxi may desire to
retire at an earlier age than the inen. The
retiring allowaxices and pensions will be
arranged at no cost to the emploýees. Then
there is the life insurance branch. We are
ail aware that people as a rule do flot carry
sufficient life insurance, and hence when
the bread-winner is taken away sorte fatmilies are lef t without the incorne they should
have, particularly in the case of young men
with growing families. For some considerable time past the T. Eaton Company have
had a mode of insurance for their employees, knawn as group insuraxice, which w-as
put on by the conmpany at no0 expense to
emiplovees. It hias been found, however,
that that insurance is not sufficient; hexice
they desire ta, be enabled to form a regular
insurance cornpany in which employees may
be insured. The ixisurance that employeeis
take li the company would be supplernentary to 'what they already receive under the
gron'p system. lIn coming under the prol)ased, Act it wîll be necessary for emîployees
ta pass a medical examination, just as they
would for insurance in what we cali an
aid-line company. Tbey wonld also be
able ta take out endowrnent policies,
straight life policies, and aIl other classes
of insurance that the regular old-line com-

panies give at present. TIhe proposeh coini>any would be under tlhe Tnsurance Act.
and would be obliged te mnake returns to
the Governmeflt just as ail other comparies
do. The scheme should be a success, startîng out as the company does with 20,000
employees, and we ail know that many ceinpanies which have been carrying on business for years have net 20,0M0 miembers.
Another feature of the new plan is that
while under the general insurance as it
exists to-day, policyholders are obiiged to
pay the ýfirst and the yearly- premniuns in
advance, the proposed company, desiring
to benefit the ernployees, would not require
the 'whole year's premium te -be paid
at once, fbut could se arrange miatters
that premniums might be paid in monthly
instalments. The scope of the Bill is
therefore wide in that respect, and it is
desirable that the company should have all
the rights and privileges of the ordinary
insurance cempany, particuharly as it
wvouid be broug-ht under the ordinary insurance law of the country. I cannet say
te what amount the crnpany will issue
policies, but they say the insurance will
be for a reasonable suni. The head office
of the company is te be in the city of Torente. Under section 6 of the Bill it -i
provided that the cemipany may make
contracts covering sickness insurance, accbient, guarante - , burglary, inland transportation, plate glass, automobile, sprinkand steam bolier

with the desire te carry eut the work that

Hon. Mr. McSWSMEENEY: The honourable

tbiere is flot a single word about that or
about group insurance in this Bill; al that

as it goes, but what do the eniployees of
the T. Eaton Comnpany want with guarantee insurance. burglary insurance, inland
transportation ilisurance, automobile ilisursuce, sprinkler leakage insurance, tire insuralice, steami boiler insurance? Tlhere is

tuatter there.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: WhVlen I referred

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable

APRIL 8, 19*20
Hon. Mr. N--ICHO&LLS -I fail to -ee any
difference between this Bill and anov otlwr
ordinary priv-ate 1i11. I read that a certain
number of directors or incorporators are
applying for an Act, and I undcrstaiid they
have complied withi all the provisions of the
Insurance Act. The mere fact that the T.
Eaton Comnpany are connected Nvith it is
neither here nor there. They are org-anizing
a separate insurance cornpany.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: That is ahl.
Hon. Mr. XIOHOLLS: They have certain
incorporators, they subacribe a certain
amount of capital as required by the la,
and they have to comply with the ternis of
the Insurance Act; therefore why bring in
the T. Eaton Company at ail? Without mentioning the T. Eaton -Comnpany they mnight
have called it the Royal Insurance Gompany
or the Ontario Insurance Comnpany, or an
insurance company by any other name, and
the miatter would not have been questioned.
We wvould have asked the Insurance Departnient if ail the requirements of the Act had
been complied with, and the Insurance Departirent would have said yes, and the Bill
wouid have gone througlh without question,
because there are no special privileges asked
for; therefore I tbînk it is a mistake to bring
in the question of the T. Eaton Comnpany or
any one else. We should consider this as an
insurnace Bill pure and simple, and deal
with it on that basis.
The motion wvas agreed to, and the Bill n'as

Hon. Mr. PRO'UDFOOT moved the

to incorporate the T. Eaton Life Assurance

may be increased to $1,000.000. It provides
for certain directors, and also that the coinpany is to corne under the purview of the

CURRENOY BILL.
SECOND RIEADING.
Hon. Sir JAMES L'OUGH'EED rnoved the
second reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend
the Currency Act, 1910.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill
bofore us proposes to arnend the Currency
Ac t in order to reduce the proportion of
silver that enters into our currency to
800 parts. The present proportion is 925.
England is about to adopt a standard
for silver of 500,
and the United
States of 800 parts.
It is of course
manifest to honourable gentlemen that this
change is necessary.
There is no good
raason why Canada sbould adopt a higher
standard than other nations, and we have
to take into consideration the value of
silver at the present time. Silver bas advanced, since the present legialation was
passed, by over 100 per cent. There was
one period when silver was $1.41 an
ounce. I cannot say with authority what
it is to-day, but it approximates that
aniount. This reduction in standard will
place our coinage, so far as gold and silver
are concerned, upon a satisfactory basis.
With the standard wbich we have been
using., particularly in coining silver, the
Government bas been losing a substantial
amount. It is therefore felt that this legislation is absolutely necessary under present
conditions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is the alloy?
It will b-e ten per cent.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEID: 1 do not
sec how rny hion. friend views the subject.
Lt would îiot affect existing annuities, or
annuities heretofore issued, because the cost
o! the annuities is based upon the present
age.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I understand that a
person whio purchased an annuity some
ycars ago would not get the benefit of the
change in the age.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no benefit. The cost o! the annuity is based
on the age at which it is purchased, so there
Nvould be ne particular change in that class
of annuity. That is to say, an annuity at 55,
after this legislation cornes into effec±, would
cost practically what it cost at the tirne
it was purchased. Like a premnium. o! insurance, it is governed entirely by actuarial
tables based on the age of the applicant or
the holder.
Hon. -Mr. ROCHE: It is just the reverse
of insurance. In insurance you have to psy
higher as you are aged; in the annuities you
pay higher as you are younger.
-Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What I
have in view is the fact that the premium
of insurance is based upon age; so will the
armuity be based on age.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE- No, upon youth.
Hon. lir. POWER: The other question
is whether the person who has already acquired an annuity will get the benefit of the
increase from 3 to 4 per cent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- There is
a certain class of annuity that is deferred.
Certain payrnents are made and the Government credits those annuities with a certain
percent-age, and sone o! them corne into
play and some do not. The payments are
repaid where the annuity does not issue, and
it is in that case that the increased interest
xvill apply. It will provide for the return of
contributions te the estate of an annuitant
dving. before the annuity is entered upon,
at a rate of interest of 4 per cent instead of
at 3 per cent, as at present. 1 think there is
also, a class in which, although the annuitant may bc living, the annuity bas net
been issued, theugh the payments have been
made previously.
Hon Mr. THOMPSON: Any one having
an annuity taken ten years ago and who was
proscrihed from taking more than $1,000l
could not enlarge the arnount.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Could hie not pay
the back premiums?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He could

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is an
element of risk that no longer exists. The
risk is past; that is why hie is no longer
in a position to purchase greater insurance at the rate at w-hich hie bought it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: H1e would
have to corne in in the same way as a
policy-holder who wants to increase* the
amount of his insurance.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I should like to
ask the minister, in connection with clause
4, increasing the rate of intere-st from 3 to
4 per cent, and referringa to Bill 17 in whichi
there is a provision increasing the rate of
interest from 4 to 5 per cent, whether the
Government have in contemplation the
raising of the rate on savingês bank deposits
to 4 per cent? No doubt sooner or later we
will have to raise another Victory loan for
a large amounit. If between now and the
time when it is necessary to issue another
loan, on which the rate of interest will be
5 or 5i per cent, depositors could be encouraged to deposit large suma of money
for the use of the Government at the rate
of 4 per cent, instead of 31 per cent or 3
per cent, as at present, there would be very
many millions o! dollars available for the
Government at a much lower rate of interest than they will be called upon to pay
when the next Government loan is issued.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGTHEED: I cannot
answer my iionourable friend. I do not
know what the intentions of the Finance
Department are. There, is a distinction between this legislation and the other legislation to which my honourable friend has
referred. The other has to do with Civil
,Service superannuation. This is largely
maintained by grants from the Government, and the Government can therefore
exercise their generosity, or assume a risk
more readuly than it could in reference to
a matter of what you might terni insurance,
because annuities are on practically the
same basis as insurance. I cannot teli the
honourable gentleman what the policy o!
the Government will be.

Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: The fact romains,
honourable gentlemîen, that we are paying,
and will have te continue te pay, a great
deal more than 4 per cent on any Government loan that may be îssued for sorte time
te corne; and in my judg-ment a great deal
of interest could be saved if the Government encouraged the small depositors te
deposit in the Post Office savings banks
by paying interest at the rate of 4 per cent
instead of at the rate now paid. There
would be saved te the Governrnent the
difference between 4 per cent and the rate
they would be obliged te pay on the next
bcan.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That would compel
the ordinary banks te pay 4 per cent also,
would it net?
Hon. Mr. NIOHOLLS: I amn net holding

CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION
AND RETIREMENT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED meved the
second reading cf Bill 17, an Act te amend
the Civil Service Superannuatien and Retirement Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the object of this Bill is te increase the interest
allowed on sums in the retiremnent fund
frorn four per cent te five per cent fromn the
lst of J.anuary, 1920. The provision as te
the retirernent fund for civil servants applies te two classes: (1) civil servants appointed on and after July 1, 1898, and (2)
civil servants

of superannuation. The amount of the retirement fund as at January 31,, 1920, was
$6,254,000; and it in-ay be of interest to the
House te know that the number o! civil
servants cont.ributing Wo the retirernent fund

about 16,500.
increased sin-ce that date Wo
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Has rny honourable friend the figures of the number of
civil servants under the superannuation
fund?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The number of civil servants contributing to the retirement fund at the present time is 16,500.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: What percentage do they contribute-2i per cent?
,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
it is five per cent.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Suppose the rate of
inter-est should f ail?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Governrnent would have to corne down with
further legisiation to reduce it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Could there not be
a sliding scale, se as to provide for a possible decrease in the rate of interest?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
know that it inakes very much difference.
The Government has to augment the fund
by making substantial contributions to it
for its maintenance.
In answer te what has been asked me, I
may say that the deductions for the superannuation fund fromi the officials' salaries
are as follows: Deductions are applied at
the rate of three and a hall p>er cent on salaries of $600 and upwards, and three per
cent on salaries of less than $600. These
deductions are to be refunded, and the Gevernment adds to the fund a sumn sufficient
to inake the amount of the fund equal to
the value of prospective annuities.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What class ef
officiaIs are getting less than $600?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
the new classification that class will have
disappeared.
Hon. Mr. lMlSWEENEY: Six hundred
dollars is the minimum now, anyway, is it
notP
Hon. Mr. Mc.MEANS: Eight hundred dollars.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My impression is that under the Civil Service
classification $50 a month is the minimum
that any one can receive, no0 matter how
youthful he may be.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Sixty dollars, I
think it is.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED: No. As 1
understand, they are paid by the Imperial
authorities, and heretofore the Governmnent

between this Mint and their own in GTeat
Britain. 1 do flot know, ibut it may work
out somnewhat in that way. But if honourable gentlemen desire it, I will read a copy
o! a letfer I have in my hand, from Lord
Milner to His Ekcellency the Governor
General touching this particular subject.
He says:
Downing Street,
November 18, 1919.

My Lord Duke1 have the honour to request Your Excellency to inform your Ministers that the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury state that It
appears to them to be desirable, and it is
uinderstood that the Canadian Government
share their view, that a fresh .Act should be
passed by the Canadian Parliament to increase
tlhe annuity at present sanctioned for the maintenance of the Ottawa Branch of the Royal
M.int to a figure commensurate with present
and prospective expenditure.
2. Their Lordships etate that some of the
temporary excess expenditure which during the
war, and more recently in connection with certain staff proposais. has been sanctioned with
the approval of the Canadian Governmnent ln
excess of the present Mint Annuity, may not
continue. On the other hand, it Is certain that
the normal expenditure at the Mint wlll considerably exceed the grant at present sanctioned of $110,000 per annuin.
3. With regard to the amnount of the revlsed
annuity Their Lordshlps state that it Is difficult at present to forecast with a-ny certalnty
the exact amount of the future expenditure,
which will depend partly on staff proposais ai
present under discussion, and stili more on

future coinage requirements. The staff Proposais at present before thpin. to the majority
of which they have already assented, are estixnated to raise the charge for salaries to $145,000 per annum at the maximum. in addition
.to which provision must be made for pensions.
On the provision for incidentaI- expenses, which
were $82,327 la 1918, and $27.S60 In 1919, a

opinion that it would be preferable to fix the
annuity at a figure sufficlent to obviate the
need of a further revision in the near future;
and they suggest that in ail the clrcumstax'ces
$200,000 would perhaps be the appropriate
suin. The Ânnuity Act, of course, merely fixes
a maximumi which cannot be exceeded without
parliamnentary authority; and If the amount
suggested were decided on the balance not
spent In any year would as at present be returaed to the Canadian Government.
4. Their Lordships would be glad to be furnished with the vlews of the Canadian Governiment on this proposai.

Hon. Mr. I)ANDU'R-AND: Who built the
Mint here? Was it built with Canadian
money?
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUGH7EED: That I
cannot say.
Hon. Mr. SCHA.FFNER: Yes, sir.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Canada built it.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: It n-right bie of interest to know out of wvhora the $6,500,000
was made. Was it a transf or of money from
one pocket to another? The Government
of Canada made $6,500.000, but the people
of Canada pay the piper.
Hon. Mr. DiANDURAND: This situation
reminds me of that which used to prevail
with regard to Canada, London, and Washington. A few years ago, when we wanted
to have something done in Washington, we
wrote, to London, and our correspondence
finally succeeded in reaching the Washington authorities through the British Ambassador. We have at our very door a
Mint which. we could admînister directly,
and apparently we are sending our money
to London to, pay employees who are within a stone's throw of us. Why could flot
the Canadian Governiment arrange to
handle its own business and show that we
have grown to a higher statua than that of
minora, instead of haTing our affaira, right
under our eyes, administered froni Lodn
It seema to me a mo-st extraordinary situation that 'this Mint la not administered by

we flot now be able to handie this matter
Hon. Mr. FOWLEiR: I may say we have
the advantage lof having a very distinguished and capable man as deputy master
of the Mint at present. I know this gentleman very well, and hie is certainly versed
in ail the business of minting; 1 do flot
suppose there is a better man along that
line. He wvas appointed frorn England.
But it does seem to me that there is a great
deal in the contention of the honourable
gentleman from DeLorimier (:Hon. Mr. Dandurand). XVe built the Mint, and I remiember that we paid $50,OO0 for the fence
around it, and there was a great deal of
talk at the time about its exceedingly hi.ah
cost. Therefore why should we not control it?
Hon. Sir JA'MM LOUGHEED: As I have
said, the Mint depends largely upon the
minting wvhich. it is doing- for Greit Britain
itself. For instance, in 1919 the Mint
milled for the Royal Mint alone 1,563,340
blanks, and produced in 1918 for the Royal
Mint not leas than 4,435,000 shilling blanka;
s0 that the minting we are doîng for the
Royal Mint amounts to almost overwhelming" figures. Il the Government of Canada
established its own Mint it is doubtful if it
would do this business which. is being- donc
by the Imperial authorities.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But most of that
minting which is credited to the Royal
Mint wvas done for New Zealand, Newioundland, Jamaica, and other parts of the
Empire, and we would get that just the
sanme.

Hon. Sir JAiMES LOUGHEED: I presume those orders would corne in through
the Royal Mint in London. 1 ain unaware

its o! oil shales-in fact, hundreds of square
miles o! them. There are also a great many
of them in the United States; and I muay
say that only a few days ago I read in a
scientific paper that, notwithstanding the
ver-y great find o! oul that has been made
in Texas, where, judging from the reading
and the pictures in the prospectuses of
those selling oil, as they are in Montreal,
the oil wells seemn to be so close together
that you would think there was nothing but
oil rushing out of the ground-notwithstanding that and the great oil discoveries that
have been made since before the war in
Persia-and that is one of the reasons why
Eng-land w-as anxious to get in there-in
Baku, on the Caspian sea, and in Roumania,
ail of which are very far away from us, we
are at present getting it fromn the United
States. Not only that. but we are dependent upon the United States for anthracite
coal and for a great part of our soft coal.
If we can develop this industry at once.
it w-ill be a great thing.
Oil is flot extracted from the oil shales
as easily as one mighit think. As I understand it, it is only when the shale is submitted to a very high temperature that tlie
oul oozes out. I do flot know wîhat is done
with the residue, which must be considerable, because I undierstood that the figure,
cf 40 or 50 gallons to the ton, which~ wcere
given hy my honourahie friend. are co'rrect, and the oil would flot weigh more
than water, since it would not float on top
o! water, and would therefore be only about
eight pounds to the gallon. So the residue,
must te used.

Hon. Sir JAMAES LOUGHEED: I cannot

strength sanctioned by the legisiation of
last session. Whether we have yet reached
that stren.,th or not I cannot say, but the

proportions would remain very rnuch the
saine. I arn under the impression that that
branch of the work which heretofore ivas
perforrned by the Dominion Police will be
performed by the saine numnher o! men;
but the rnounted branch would of course
be increased very substantialiy.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: How are the
squads iocatedl in the different provinces?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My recollection is that that has been fixed by

Order in Council.
Hon. Mr. BQSTOCK: The reason for my
question is that I sec by section 4 of chap-

APIL 9. 1920
ter 69 of the Statutes of 1919, which aniended section 8 of the Nort.hwest Miounted
Police Act, it is provided:
The Governor in Couneil may. from Urnmeto
tirne, authorize the Commissioner of Police to
appoint, by warrant under bis hand, such
nuniber of constables as the Governor in Council thinks proper.

The number is not fixed by this Act, as
I understand. it. The Government can appoint as many as they like.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
tbink the strengatb of the police is fixed by
the Act. The section my bonourable friend
bas read I think deals only with special
constables. I arn satisfied that the strenzth
of the police is defined by statute. I cannot put mny bsnd upon the statute just at
the moment. I shahl get that information

Hon. Sir JAMES L0OUGHEED: -is entitled to consideration along that uine.
There are many cases in which judges who

Hon. Mr. DANDURANDI: That is a correct principle.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As to the
15 years, 1 would say to my honourable
friend that the interpretation of the Judges
Act, as to a judge being entitled to his retirement allowance after 15 years, is beyond all question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I think the

Act says -"may
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The word
"may - is perhaps used in the statute. but
it is interpreted not in a permissive sense,
but as mandatory. I know the opinion bas
been given by the Departaient o! Justice

fact o! his having served 15 years-to bis
retiring, allowance; and that is the case
here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But if my hionourable friend will permit me, I would
draw his attention to this difference: that
a judge may serve 15 years and may he entitled to retire, if that is the interpretation of the Department of Justice, but hie
is generally appointed w-ben hie is 45 or 50
years of age, and after 15 years' service
bas heen completed hie is past 60. That is
the general rule. But I am speaking- now
of the case wbere a young man enters the
M\ounted Police at the age o! -20. There is
a difference between granting hini the riýght
to a pension if hie becoies incapacitated
and granting hirn the absolute right to a
pension when bie bias passed 40.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
obtains in many classes of employaient in
tbis country. A policeman. after lie reaches
40 years of age, is very largely unfitted for
the duties of a nîounted organization sucb

fair and judicious way of handling the

Hon. Mr.- DANIEL: I think these clauses

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The teny-ear period does.
Hon. Mr. DANEDURAND: The ten-year

Hon. Mr. POWER: As I understand, the
honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurandl finds two diffienities in this clause. One is that lic bas

thiat tie man must be incapacitated before
1%ecan lie pensioned, even after twenty

says. The clause says if hie bas completed

iic.t suppose any one would quarrel withi
that. If a m."n is physically or înentally
disqualified, hie can be pensioned after ten
years' service. Then the honourable gentleman thinks that twenty years' service
sbiould not entitle a member of the mounited
police to a pension for life.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AiND: If hie is flot
incapacitated.
Hon. Mr. POWER: If hie is not incapacitated, certainly. As to that, I do not
undertake to express any decided opinionv;
only I think there is a great deal of force
in w-bat the honourable leader of the Goxerament has said, that whatever ânay be
the case o! a judge, in the case of a policeman whose duties are of an active character, calling for energy and spryness, so
to say, perhaps the 20 years' service is long

age limit. It sbould be provided, for instance, that he shahl have reaclîed the age

Hon. Sir JAMNES LOVGHEED: Would

witbout. laving any capiital, and it is but
easonable hae shîould have a smiall allowance. Tfhe fact of the miatter is, this bias
been the law ever since tha organization
of the police. As lionourable gentlemen
know, the police were organized shortly
after we took over tbe Northwest Territories.
This is the old law that n~e are riow aniendling. For instance, ionou-able gentlemen
will find iii the Revised Stataites thiis saine
provision. The only change that %ve aie
making iii the law as il lias st<îad. for vears
is that -ie ara wipin.- out the 15-yea.r periid
iiientioned ini the existiine law. 1i nler tlPe

ibb

exi.stiiinc law, the policemen had a righlt at
the expiration of 15 years to ask for a limiited pension, to which he was entitled. We
have nio% strieken out the 15-year period
and ive have inserted in lieu thereof a tenyear period, but that ten-year period can
be invoked only in case of physical infirillity.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is ail right: 1
agree with that.
Hon. Sir JAiMES LOUGHEED: As to
the other period, we are simply allowing
the law to stand as it was.
Hon. '-%r. FOWLER: The antiquity of
the law, I miay say to the honourable leader, does not give it any virtue in iny sight;
because, if that antiquity gave it any virtue. we would neyer make any change.
My honourable friend cites the fact that the
law lias been unchanged for twenty or
thirty years. It would almost look as
though, according to the modern trend of
thought, it was about time for a change.
But my contention is that the man could
enter some other occupation. There are a
hundred other things hie could engage in if
bie were clever enough, and bis earnings in
the r'ew occupation 'would be enhanced by
the pension which hie gets. Besides that.
you are losing a servant who is much mnore
valuable that he was when he enlisted.
Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOUG'HEED: Not at
f orty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You have spent
nîoney to train him and get himr perfected
in his work, and if bie is a good man at 40
and is stili in the fuli possession of al
bis physical faculties, with the benefit of
tw-enty years' training in the police bie is
an invaluable servant. You ought to put
restrictions upon bis gîving up bis job,
instead of facilitating bis giving it up, as
you do by this. There would be no objection to a provision declaring that lie night
be pensioned aiter twenty years' service,
if lie lias reached the age of fifty, or fiftyfive. wlien'he is not as spry as bie mnight be;
for it is necessary for a man to be physically fit in order to hold that position.
So far as 1 arn ccocerned, 1 believe iii
paying the police more. Their duties for
a long time may be very slight, and then
may suddenly, owing to an outbreak of
somne sort, become very arduous and very
dangerous. They should ha paid well, but
I thinkl that in the interest of the service
this limitation should not be as it is.

CURRENCY BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COM.MITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Commùittee on Bill 15,
an Act to amend the Currency Act, 1910.
Hon. Mr. Murphy in the Chair.
On section 1-standard for gold and silver
coins:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What is the present standard for gold coins?
Hon. Sir JAM-\ES LOUGHEED: The standard for it-old is the samie as it was before.
We are sinip]y changing the standard as to
silver. En-land is adopting for silver a
standard of 500, and the United States is
adopting a standard of 800, so that our sulver would be the samne as that of the United
States. At t.he present time the standard
is M2, and we reduce it to 800.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 do not think there
is any objection to that, but we should not
interfere with the gold.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
not înterfering with gold.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Has any consideration been aiven to the advisability of usiing
nickel?

Hli. Sir.TAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
sav as to that. Last session we legislated
as to col)per coins, but we made no proviSion as to nickel. Canada has no nickel
coins at present, but 1 see no reason why
we should 'hot have thcrn. They have them
in the United States.
Section 1 was ag-reed to.
Section 2 was agcreed to.
On section 3--silver coins heretofore
struck to continue current:
Hon. bir. BOSTOCK: Can my honourable friend give us any information about
those Orders in Council? This -arrang-ement has been made before under Order in
Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My recollection is that when the rapid rise in silver
took place, Parliament was not sitting, and
silver coinage was being minted at a loss;
but an Order in Council was passed to
cover the înterim between that time and
the adoption of this legisiation.
Section 3 was agreed to.

It was at Antwerp on the Scheldt that

Stevenson thus tells how a new sensation of

'«On the other aide of the valsy a group

the afternoon musical on a chime of belîs.
There was something very eweet and taklng

after some sucb measure that the spinners and

with windmills and villages hldden in masses

1 have read these quotations fromi this
author. honourable gentlemen, for the purpose of conveying to the House somne idea
of what wonderful results can be obtained
from a çarillon of the proper kind and
properly constructed, and I have no hesitation in saying that I believe it would be
in the interest of aIl concerned to have a
carillon of this nature installed on the
magnificent tower which it is proposed to
erect.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: How many beils are
there in the carillon?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY.- There are a great
many different kinds and sizes o! carillons.
A first-class carillon contains as mnany as
52 belîs. The carillon installed in the
tower at Bruges bas, I think, 46. In the
towvn hall of Ypres, which. was destroyed
by the Germans, there was a carillon, I
think, of 48 belîs. At Louvain there was a
magnificent carillon containing over 40
belis.
The cost of a carillon is not perhaps as
great as one might think. 1 arn told by
this authority that an ordinary carillon of
48 belîs could be installed for about £4,000, or about 820,000. 1 think it would be a
good investment for Canada to make, to put
a first-class carillon on top of the great
tower which we hope is going to be erected
here. I arn satisfied it would attract hundreds and thousands of tourists, who would
corne to hear these bells. Moreover, it
would be a magnificent thing for this great
city c! Ottawa to have such beautiful
music sounding over the whole district. 1
arn offering this suggestion in the hope that
the House will see the advisability o! asking the Government, through this resolution, to takze some action in the matter.
Honourable
DOMVILLE:
Mr.
Hon.
gentlemen, I was very much pleased to
hear the academic address of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Bradbury). It bas
been prepared with a great deal of psdîns
and trouble. Wboever supplied tha'- information bas certainly been doing b5ood
work; wbether he had any ulterior motive
or not, 1 cannot tell. My honourable friend
bas spoken o! the chirnes o! Normandy, and
the chimes in the Royal Exchange in England; but, like Gog and Magog, they are
ahl things of the past-medieval history.
The belis in the tower o! this building

know he will agree that these are not days
for experimenting and exploiting. I know
I arn stating the views of the Governmnent.
Their wisb would be for us to show the
country that we are not going to spend
money upon ail sorts of frilis. We may not
agree aa to the manner in which the country's money has been spent, or the policy
whjch. has been followed, but we are not
going to invest to-day in the chimes of
Norrnandy or a bell ta be rung for the
people of Ottawa. The tower of the Parliament buildings is not yet built. Why not
leave this inatter until the tower is coinpleted? Then the Government will be able
to decide. Personally I do not care which
Government is in power; I have got past
that. Let us give the Government time to
consider the question. Why should it be

this HouseP Is it not for the Government

isters who believe in the beauties of Ottawa? Do you want to throw them overboard
now? Do you mean to say they do not
know what they are doing? Would you suggest to themi that they do not understand?
I have more confidence in the Government
than that. There is no need for me to take
up the time of the House, and, if 1 may be
permitted, I would move the adjournment
of this debate until we have more particulars regarding the tower.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Six months.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: What is the reason
for adjournîng the debate? We may as well
get it through.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Wbat do you want
to get through?
Hon. Mr. BOYER: We may as well settle
the question one way or the other.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: I cannot see how

The motion for the adjournment of the

161

APRIL 13, 1920
Hon. Mr. BOYER: 0 f course, every bell
has its sound. We heard firet the merry
belle of England and the chimes ai aid
France. Then came the paîl whichi my honourable friend from New Brunswick (Hon.
Mr. Domville) cast avec aIl by hie motion.
"le there anything sweeter than the sound
of belle?" said Edgar Allen Poe. And in
the oid world the .prettiest girl in the village
could be christened anly by the name ai
Belle. What my honaurable friend from
Selkirk '(Hon. Mr. Bradbury) praposes
would really b e an ornament. I cannat concur, however, in the exaggerated idea that
everything Canadian is the niightiest in
the world. We may have the biggest building in the world, and we have one of the
biggest debte in the world. But why, should
shauld not we, as a Senate, do sometbing
for tur countcy and furnish that carillon?
There are 80 ai us. Suppose the cost is $30,000; epread the expenditure over 3 or 4
yeare; say that each year we chip in $100
apiece; and the Senate wvill live farever in
the memary ai Canada as being a useful
body. If we do nat make a noise in politics, we shall at least with aur belle, whicb
will draw publie attention ta this Hause.
Why should we not do that? A few yeas
ago the members of the House ai Lords
naticed that the 'walls ai the House and
those of the corridors leading ta it were
bare ai attraction; and everybody chipped
in, and they had magnificent mural paintinge put in.at the cost ai their Lardships.
The expense ai the praposed belle would be
smal compared with their usefulnees. The
matter has ta be decided naw an account
ai the solidity ai the tower-what size af
belle we may require, how big the tuning
bell 'will Ihe, and aIl sucb questions which
the architect muet decide; but let us as a
Senate underts.ke ta do thie inuch for aur
country, and for the ornamentation ai these
parliament buildings, by subscribing whatever the cost ai this carillon may be.
Hon. iMr. TURRIFF: I think, it would
be very necessary ta have a good dlock in
the tower; but a chime o! belle would be
rather in the nature ai icills. It may be
very fine and .may be advisable, but I do
not think we should be called upan ta recom'mend ta the Government a large expenditure without having more information
than my honourable friend is able ta give
as ta the cast ai these belle.
Hon. Mr. DOMViILLE: RHear. hear: you
are right.
Hon. tMr. TUJIRIFF: It is ail very well
ta say that a cli me oi belle cast $20,000 in
8-11

the old country before the war, but 1
venture to say that a chirne of belis on the
tower of this building would cost between
$ 100,000 and $2000.Iefore recommendiug
the Government to undertake such an expenditure 1 think we oughit to have an
estimate from the chiel architect af the
building.
Han. Sir JAiMES LOUGHEED: 1 would
suggest to rny honourable friend from Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbury) that he do not
press his motion to a vote. It ie flot desirable that the Senate should commit itself to a recommendation of this nature
until we have information before us as ta
the cost which may be involved, as ta the
constructive features of the tower, and
If my honaurable

friend wishes ta pursue the subject, I
would suggest that a more practical way
would be to have a cam.mittee to take it up
either with the architecte or the building
com-mittee. The Senate has a reputation,
which. it desires to maintain, of nat committing iteelf to any important subject of
this kind rwithout having ail the information
which would warrant an intelligent mind in
caming ta a satisfactory conclusion.
Hon. -Mr. IiQKVIIJLE: Daes flot that
caver the ground of my motion asking that
the 'matter be put aside for the moment?
Hon. Mr. BRA.fl'BURY: I arn quite stisfied ta have a coxumittee. I may eay that
I wauld be willing ta accept the suggestion
made by my honourable friend on the other
side af the House (Hon. *Mr. Boyer). I do
flot agree .with my honourable friend frora
Saskatchewan (Han. Mr. Turrifi) Vhat the
belle would cost anything like $200,000. The
coet ai 32 belle installed in England only
three years aga, the largest of themn weighing 6,40)0 pounde, was £4,400. The cast of
the proposed belle could flot much exceed
that, though it would noa doubt be eomewhat
larger. I am eatiefied thst the suggestion
oi my honaurable friend opposite wauld be
very acceptable ta the people ai Canada.
It would be a splendid thing for this Senate
ta contribute this set ai belle, and I would
be quite satisfied ta accept that proposition;
but, as the leader ai the House bas suggested, I would be prepared ta have a emal
committee appointed ta investigate.
The motian was withdrawn.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
done away with the age limit. The age

reason why we should not seli an annuity

Beaubien in the Chair.

Hon. '-%r. BOSTOCK: What is the ohject of this subsection? If it is necessary
to reduce the rate of interest, wouid it
flot be better to do so by arnending the
Act? Everybodly would then have notice of
what was being do-ne. Apparently it will
be done by Order in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It simplv
,-ives di.scretion te the Governniient to reduce the rate of inteî est if rnoney should
hecome of less value. There is no reason
wvhv that should flot he done. It seems,
in fact, unnece-ssary to corne before Parliament in a case of this kind, because it is
mianifestly in the interests of both the Gevernment and the civil servants. It is not a
case in 'which the Governinent can take any
advantage of the situation.

THIRD READING.

Hon. Sir JAM-%ES LOUGHEED moved the
third reading of Bill 17, an Act to arnend the
Civil Superannuation and Retirement Act.
Hon. WILLIAM ROCHE:- Ho'nourable
gentlemen, I wish ta xnake a remark on a
subject along the line of the present Bill.
I understand t-hat the employees of ;the
Geological Survey have superannuated
themfelves. by resigning in a body. I think
it is a pity that so, valuable a body of public servants should be allowed ta disperse~
anid that their services should be lost to
the country at the present time. It would
be difficuit ta reassemble so large a number of experienced servants, well aoquainted
with the business. I do flot know whether
the difference between thear demiands for
increased pay and the present salary is
very great. I understood that the increase
demanded was not very large, and I only
reiterate what I have already said that I
think it would be a great loss to the country at the present tîme, when so much is
required for its development along the line
of geology, -to be deprived of the services
of -inen so experienced and to so great
an extent acquaînted vith the mineraI deposits of Canada. I only make the remark
that -perhaps attention may be given ta it,
and that the Government may be able ta
ineet the demands of this large and influential and most valuable body odf men,.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does the honourable gentleman say that we can pass Bills
here for one province which vili nlot affect

Hon. W. B. 'ROSS. Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-6TAUNTON: What is
the honourable gentleman's authority for
that?
lion. W. B. ROSS: It is the sovereign
power of Parliament.
Those are the reasons why I have le! t out
the province of Quebec. The law under
which the province o! Manitoba has jurisdiction in divorce is chapter 33 of the
Statutes o! 18M8, and the particular section
reads this way:

bave pover to grant divorce for adultery
and( power to annul Inarriage wvhere the
im-rrîage is contracted by fraud or on the
Li-mind of bigamy.
The rcst of the Bill is, of course, mere detail. Section 2 provides:
The Superior Court of the province shallhave
jurisdiction for ail purposes of this Act.

Section 3 says:
This Act rnay be cited as "The Divorce Act
<Ontario and Prince Edward Island), 1920."

Section 4 repeals certain laws of the province of Prince Edward Island.

dealing withi a subject that is of v-ery first
imiportance-a subject ini whieli every one
in the country whose opinion is Nvorth conI
sidering would be deeply interested.
would of course regard it as a very serious
state of things in thfs country if a Bill of
this kind were to lie treated as an insignificant matter. Divorce touches not only
religious convictions but. also the persons
and the properties of the inhabitants of the
country. From any point of view it is a
serious thing-. I would therefore inveterately oppose enaeting anything like what
miglit be called a divorce code, that is. a
large body of legislation in regard to divorce. It is better to start at the point at
which we are starting in this Bill. Tlue Iaxv
of Eng-land lias been tried out for a great
many years, and if any change is to be
made in it. tlie change should deal with
one thing, at a time, and due notice should
be given to every person concerned. Furthermore, every person dealing with the
subject sliould endeavour to be absolutely
candid. Any legislation vou have ou.-ht to
be as definite and dcear-cut as it is possible
to make it in the Englishi language.
I have done my best with regard to this
Bilt, and I exanmined the Bill that wvas liefore the lower House, which was really in a
way, alrnost a code witli regard to divorce,
and it of course raised a great many questions on whicli you could not expect anything like unanimity either in this House
or in the lower House. It must be remembered that the divorce law is exceedingly
teclinical. I do not know any brandi of
law in which there are more pitfalîs than
in the law of divorce. I need flot enter
into an exposition of what these things are;
but I can ssy that after a good many
years' experience, I found that to be true.
Divorce affects not only religious convictions, it affects children; it no>t only affects
tie status of the parties in their own country, but it lias an international aspect. Lt
is a very serious thi.ng for a wonian to get a
divorce in one country, then go to another
country and get married, and afterwards
have tie question raised whether lier
divorce was valid or not. The subject is
a big one, and for this reason I think that
any changes that are to be made in the
divorce law o! Canada should lie nmade one
at a tirne. or as nearly in tiat way as possible, so that every question miglit be thoroughly tlireslied out and the whole subi ect
dealt with in a conservative spirit. I for
one amnifot at all in favour of any great
extension.

I do not knwthat there is anything else
that I want tou say on this matter at the
present tiie. There is another Bill that
1 w'ill of course speak to when I corne to
it. Lt mvili of course have sonie relation to
this Bill. 1 have interfered as littie as
possible with existing institutions. Ail the
provinces, have ibeen left exactly as they
were, except Ontario, whîch has no divorce
law.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. OA.SGRAIN:
gentlemen, I have listened very carefully
to what the honourable gentleman (Hon.
W. B. Ross) lias had to say, and, so far as
I have heard, hie hias not advanced any good
reason why this law, whicli he evidently
thinks is a good one, should not also be
nmade use of by those in the province of
Quebec who -believe in divorce. If it is a
good law, why ahould. the people of Quebec
whio believe in divorce lie deprived of it?
The honourable gentleman lias said that lie
does flot want applicants fôr divorce coming
to Ottawa any more,-that it is better that
the cases should bc hieard before a court.
I suppose that is the purpose of the law.
I thought lie would advance some good
arguments rwhy he would not allow the
people of Quebec who ýbelieve in divorce
and want divorce to have that law apply
to them. Why miake bone of one and fleshi
of another? I thought ail the provinces
liad equal rights. I arn speaking for the
Protestants of the province of Quebec, and
I think they are entitled to equal justice
with the Protestants of the other provinces.
God knows they get it.

Hion- Mr. M.NURPHY: I do0 net que-tien
thie intention of rny good friend froii
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross). I helieve
that hie thinks what hie is doing is for the
betterment of our divorce laws. 1 do net
think, very muchi of our divorce laxs, and
I do net believe in divorce, 1 have sat in
the divorce chamber, and have listened to
the evidence, and I believe the commrittee
have been doing everything they could to
deal with this matter preperly. If my goed
friend had net introduced Prince Edward
Island into the matter, I xveuld have alhowed the Bill te pass without any objection. But Prince Edward Island lias a
divorce court under a statute of William
IV, and therefore is perfectly capable of
deing the work that the henourable gentleman wants te give us the authority 'te do
by a statute ef the Federal Parliament.
Under this Bill Quebec is placed in a different position te the other provinces- I
feel that it is a slight on the province of
Quebec ýthat it sheuld be sig-nalized by
being le! t out. There is ne special reason
why mny good friend should net have made
the people of that province arnenable te
the ordinary loews. 1 think the memibers

If honourable gentlemen subscribe to the
principle that there is reason for divorce,
they should make the law reasonable. I
want to circurnscribe divorce. I do not know
what the feeling- of rny honourable friend
from Souris (Hon. Mr. MeLean) is in regard to this Bill, but I say as wve have a
court in Prince Edward Island, leave the
uquestion to us. We do net want the Fed-eral
Governrnent to override our authority.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: If I rnay interrupt: The honourable gentleman will remember that we had a big struggle here
on the tenuperance question, and gave prohibition to Prince Ed-ward Island, and what

Hon. 'Mr. MURPHY: We were the first

I amn surprised at rny good friend fromn Middileton sFiyiii, tliat the province of Quebec

The province of Quebec lias been a thorn

province of Queibec in the next five years

part of our Confederation, and we do net
want to put it in an anornalous position by
auy law that is passed; and knowing the
breadth of view of my good friend from

we were to enact such legisiation, and I
would suggest to him that he withdraw the
Bill.
Hon. L. G. POWER: 1 have always been
very strongly opposed to divorce, and have
been consistent, I think, in my action with
respect to the cases that have corne before
this House. But it strikes me that we have
really got to a stage when the matter lias
to be considered. When, eight or nine
years ag-o, we had four or five divorce cases,
the Divorce Cornmittee was quite cempetent
to deal with that number. I will say of that
coînmittee that it bas always deait witb
the cases that came before it in a most satisfactory manner. 1 do not think there is
any court in the Dominion which could
have discharged the functions assigned to
that comnmittee better than tbey have been
discharg-ed. But, honourable g-entlemien.
look at the position to-day. As I understand, there are over one hundred applications for divorce. That just means that
if the coînmittee aie to try ail thuse cases
and give proýper attention to them, the cornmittee and the House practically wvill have
almost nothing to do except to deal with
divorce cases. I think we ought te consider
the position. I do not mean f0 say that I
arn in favour of the Bill, but I think there
is that point to be considered.
The honourable g-entleman froi Mid-ileton (Hon. W. B. Ross) spoke of the disapproval by the House of Comnions of the
action of thle committee in the past. 'Now.
every honourable gentleman here knowS
that, although we are supposed te be a crýi;c'zing and examining body, thie Houze oi
Commons do criticize-I do not say in an
unfriendlv, but at any rate in a not verv
friendly spirit-ahl the actions of the Senate which are susceptible of criticisrn. Consequently I do not myseif pay miuch heed
te what the Commons and their friends sav
about the Senate's actions in connection
with divorce. I have already said that the
Senate court wvas a very good one.
With respect te the province of Prince

read the Bill first, to suggest to the honourable gentleman from Middleton that lie
should not inake the Bill apply te the province of Prince Edward Island. The hionourable gentleman from Tignish (Hon. Mr.

cost of getting a Bill througlh the cominittee
is really flot -any greater than the cost
of getting a judgment through a court.
I feel that, at any rate, we, should flot be
unf air to the honourable gentleman fromn
Middleton. Looking at the views that hie
,entertains, I think that the Bill which hie
bas presented is. exceedingly fair and reasonable. But, if the honourable gentleman
will allow me to xnake one other suggestion before 1 sit down, it is this. In the
second clause of the Bill it is stated that
the Superior Court of the province shall
have jurisdictio>n for ail purposes of this
Act. In the provice of Ontario there is a
special court known as the Superior
Court.'
It is 'the saine in the province of Quebec,
as 1 .understand.
In the provinces of New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island,
and in the Western Provinces, there is no
court known as the Superior Court. I think
that instead of "the 'Superior Court," this
should read, " a Superior Court."
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: With the consent
of the House, I would like to say that we
have in our province a special court which
can be constituted at any time and which
is similar to the committèe that tries the
cases here. 1,\ow, why sbould iny good
friend from. Middleton (Hon. W. B. Rosa)
want to foist on us another court of his own'?
We do flot require that court. As the honourable gentleman fromn Souris <Hon. Mr.
McLean) will tell you, we have full authority, and have had that authority since the
days of William IV, to try these divorce
cases in our province. I protest against
this Bill on these grounds.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honoura hie
gentlemen, this question is one to which
the honourable gentleman fromn Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Rosa) bar, given a great deal
of attention and consideration, and I want
to congratulate him. on the work hie has
done on this Bill and the folhowing one.
Owing to the way our Minutes were printed
this morning, I did not think these Bis
had been printed. for there were no letters,
- E, F," after tbem. Therefore, I did flot
realize that the bonourabie gentleman was
going on with these Bills to-day, and I have
not had time to give as much consideration
to themn as I otherwîse should have done.
This question is a very important one,
and one that I think we in this Chamber
should thoroughly discuss. From the remarks of my honourabie friend from Middleton I judge it is hie desire 'that there be a
full discussion. Although at the finie of

173

173
14, 1920
Confederation it wvas considered tbat divorce
ought to ha ieft in the banda of the Parliament of Canada, conditions througbout
the wvboIe Dominion bave considerably
cbanged, and it is onhy right that the present situation sbould be considered. As hionourable gentlemen are aware, the oniy provinces in which divorces are not granted
to-day are Ontario and Quebec. In all the
other provinces there is some form. of court
for the purpose of deaiing with divorce.
The trouble is, I understand, that provinces
like British Columbia and Aiberta are under
ail old law of England wbicb is out of
date and not altogether suitabie for the
conditions under which tbey are working.
Therefore I tbink it is very mucb better in
the interests of the Dominion that se
legislation of the kind now proposed should
be passed by this Parliament for the purpose of bringing the divorce law of the
Dominion up to date, and for the benefit
of tbe litigants. Every one in Canada who
considers the question of divorce must regret tbat sucb a tbing is necessary at ahi
in this country, or in any part of the world.
Tbe marriage tie is a very aoiemn tie, and
we are ail taugbt that the contract shouid
be binding for life; but unfortunately buman nature is so constituted that it is somnetimes considere"d advisabie, in the interests of the country and the people generally, that some dissolution of that contract
should be made possible.
Consequently
tbrougbout the. wboie of the Britisb Empire
to-day there are laws permîtting of divorce.
If this measure is passed, the situation,
I understand, wiii be that the various provinces will bave courts for the dissolution
of marriage, and tbe people of those provinces may go to those courts for the purpose of obtaining divorce; but at the saine
time no one wiii be prevented fromn coming
to this Parliament for a divorce if bie so.
desires. A very similar situation exista in
England at the present time. There have
been divorce courts in England for a
number of years, but in the case of a
divorce application fromn Ireland the parties
bave to go before the House of Lords. The
samne procedure appiies in the case o! a
divorce between British subjects in India;
it ia deait with by the House of Lords.
'My honourabie friend (Hon. W. B. Rosa)
bas deait wîtb the objections that may arise
in regard to-cases com.ing before the coinmittee. Every bonourable member of this
.House muet realize that the large number
of cases conhing before Parliament entail

gentlemen, I am not going to vote one way
or the other on the second reading of this
Bill; but, for the edification and possibly
the enlighteninent o! honourable gentlemen,
I would like to translate a description of a
divorce court which appeared some years
ago in that great French paper, Le Figaro,
of Paris:
The F-ourth Chu niher ojf the Tr-ibunal of the
Seine held a hearing w hich lasted four hours.
during whJeh limie it granted a )1ttl,ý over one
divorce a minute. Ali this was done wlth the
utnlost decorum by means of three gentlemen,
ail well robed. who mumbled the proceedings,
one cranky gentleman supposed to do the petltionlng. and a fifth gentleman who took notes.
This social ante-rooni of hell. occupied by grave
men ivho are breakzing u!) socletv bv means of
the law and under the in'age of Christ-

Honourable gentlemen will remember
that in ahl the French courts there was a
crucifix over the tribunalseems quite reqpectable. However, aIl this
will have to be pald for, you may be sure.
Every thlng has to bé Daid for. By the fault
of the legislator, wlth cornplicitv and almoat
temptation on the part of the courts, free love
is gradually replaclng marriage. It is destroylng
the family. It delivers the husband to aIcoholism, the woman te prostitution, and the
chlldren to precoclous vice. Facts Ilke these
throw a very disquietlng llght upon the whole
social state.

I am flot going t0 make any comment of
my own, but I xvould ask honourable gentlemen whio are going to facilitate or permit
in Canada wviat is descrihed here-1 would
ask them to consider seriously hefore passing- legfisiation of this kind.
HonHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTO'N:
ourable gentlemen, I arn going- to vote
against this Bill. I arn not going to vote
against it siînply because, being- a Christian,
I believe it is flying absolutely in the face
of what our Lord and Saviour laid down as
a law binding upon ail Christians; for I
knowv that the wvorld, nearly every country
in the world, have seen fit to amiend His
iaw. But I amn going1 to vote against it
because I believe it is not righit for any
Christian people to facilitate divorce in any
possible way. I quite recognize that it is
flot logical to sit in this House and allow
Bills to pass, as they have been passing
year after ycar, without entering a protest

again st thein, and afterwards to sut ou
to oppose the niere transference of the ilîrisdiction froin one tribunal to anotiier. I do
not purpose justifying my conduct on log-ical reasoning. 1I have listenied attentiv ely
to the presentation made by the author of
the Bill (Hon. W. B. Ross). He pointed
out that the reason why he excepted the
province of Quebec was that the people of
that province have imbedded in their
statutes a law which allows only the declaration of nullity of a marriage ceremony, and
does not allow the dissolution of marriage
The honourable gentleman of course reallv
means to say that hie knows that the overwhelming opinion of the people of Quebeec
is aguainst divorce. He believes that the
opinion of the province of Ontario is for it.
That is no0 reason why any man should cast

question to be determined by any man in
deciding whether to cast his vote for or
against a measure is whether it ought or
ought not to be the la-w. If the great mass
of the people wish for somnething, which in
my conscience I believe is wrong and
ag-ainst public policy, the desire of the
people is no0 argument that appeals to me.
Now, wha.t are the, reasous given for the
establishment of this court? The reason
given first, by the man on the street, is
that tihis commilttee la a rich mnan's court.
I quite agree 'with the author of this Bull
,that that is an unsound reason, because
divorce will cost quite as much in a pro,vincial court as before the Senate. If that
is not so, you can reduce the cost of a
,divorce b:efore the Senate, by not charging
anything for introducing the Bull, and 8o
forth.
Another reason *why I shaîl vote against
this Bill is just this: the nearer you hring
the înill to the grist the more grist there
wvill be. In Engl.and, lstely, divorce was
i.ade easier, and ast year there w'ere
10.000 cases on the list waiting to be tried.
Such legislation la encouraging the peo'ple
to apply for divorce, and no man, no0
niatter whait 'his ibeliefs may be, if hie hias
any right notions of morality at ail, 'will
dispute 'the staternent that we should so
far as we can discourage the dissolution of
the niarriage tie. I was toid the other day
that in th-e United States there are a million
cases of divorce a year. 1t is simîply dreadJul. Whereas -people used to shun divor.cees, 'to-day they think no more of welcom.ing themn into society ithan if they were
legitimately, virtuously married people.
ýApparently rwe 'have lost ail idea of adultery

.that cwhich is 'the founidation of society.
So long as I arn a meniber o! this House I
shaîl neyer do anything to facilitate divorce.
.Tbe honourable the Chairman o! the
»ivorce Oornrittee -says that there are more
divorces than ever -before. Well, I think
there are for the time being-, while the
prorality of the 'world i.s up-side, down, as
.it la at present. But I do not think this
iwill con'tinue. -I do not 'think that in years
po cSene iwe shall have any more divorces
in proportion to the population than ive
have liad in years gone by. If you estabuiali
court.s. and cases are tried in Hamnilton,
London, Tororto, and so on, what are you
doingP You are advertising the fact te the
people that 'ill they have to do is to go
to a lawyer and apply for'a divorce. The
Senate Cornmittee, Io the great mass of
people, la a rnysterious body. The people
think it is liard to get at. What is the
result' Tliey recýoncile their differences. I
coimsider that thiscounitry is the most virtu-

ous c'ountry on the face of the

earth.

I

consider that the people o! this country
are better rnorally and have less scandai
in 'their lives 4haîn the people of any other
country in thie 'world. In any State in the
Union, where five or six 'are gatliered together, you cannot speak to anyone lin disparagernent o! divorce because one of them
is almost sure to lie a divorcee.
Wliy establisli a court? It is adinitted
,th-at it is no»t more expensive to corne here
for a divorce than it would be to go to a
court. It is admitted that the people who
corne here get a fair trial. The only rea.son
the honourable gentleman lias advancedand hie lias had years of training and o!
experience-is thalt under tlie new practice
we shall have a decree niai whicli ray be
reversed in six rnontlis. Under existing
conditions why could not cases be heard in
one Session and the passing of the divorce
Bill be allowed to stand over until the
next Session? The lionourable gentleman
wiil not deny, I think, that -the facî-litv o!
the process will increase the number of
appliostione whicli will be made. This la
interfering witli the most sacred relations
between man and -woman. It is interfering
with the rights of -children. It is dissolving
marriage, and not only those who are leading improper lives, -but those 'who will lie
brouglit into this wrorld, ç%viii ble affected b>y
it. We shouid not deal with this question
un-til we find that there are stronger and
more important reasons for doing- so.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY J1 would remind the
honourable gentleman that, in one case in
which a divorce was refused last year, the
parties wvent back and lived together.
Hon. 'Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I have
known of many such cases. Many people
have corne to me concerning their family
troubles, about the infidelity o! the hiusband
or the infidelity of the wîfe. Âny ilawyer,
in any kind of practice, knows that there
are many sucli cases. But I have seen case
after case reconcjled. I have had the pleastire of reconciling such people, and telling
themn that for the sake o! their families
they should overlook that which in thîs
country is considered the only ground for
divorce. If tbey go to a lawyer, and lie ià
keen to issue a writ, the case cets into the
papers, and under this Bill away it goes.
I say, ini ail confidence, that if we allow the
provincial courts in Ontaltio to deal 'with
this matter, we shail break up many families which, if they had to corne to Ottawa,
would not lie broken up. I dare say that in
twenty cases it will lie far better to save
one family than to pass a law facilitating
divorce for those whom we cannot save.
The honourable leader o! the Opposition
has said that if we paso this Bill we shail
bring our law up to date. I cannot see any
reason on earth for doing that. In the
United States persons can get a divorce if
they have cold leet: ail they have to do is
to possess fifty dollars. If that sentiment
grows in this country we shall have the
public saying that we should give a divorce
for somet.hing less, and something less, and
sornething less, and there will be honourable gentlemen in this House who wvil
stand up and justify it, absolutely ignoring
the question of morality, to bring our law
up to date. As Carlyle says, it is a mess
o! wrong and sentimentality to argue that
it is wrong to prevent divorce between
people who disagree. People have told me
that when they were married they agreed
that if they did flot get on together they
would consent to a divorce. That 'is a coinmon thing in the United States and it will
be a common thing here. I have no doubt
that in many cases brouglit here there is
collusion, and I have no doubt that if sucli
cases were tried in the assizes there would
be double the number of divorces that there
are at present.. I cannot see any evil that
lias resulted from allowing people to corne
to the Senate that is going to be remedied
by passing this Bill; but I do think that by
facilitating divorce we shaîl increase the
nunvber of cases, and therefore I arn going
to vote against the Bill.

SENATE
Hon. '\r. 13OYER: Honourable gentlemen.
it strikzes nie that this mnatter of divorce
might be very nmuch simnplified and the nunber of cases diininished considerably if the
comninittee made a point of decreeing that
the person found guilty of causing the
divorce should flot be allowed to rnarrv

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: You cannot do that.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes, you
cen.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: W7hy should the comnrnittee thrust into a new family a rnan or
a wornan guilty of the only act for which
a divorce can be granted? If what I Euggest wvere made part and parcel o! the decision of the committee, people would think
twice before they would corne here askin,for a divorce. There could flot possîbly be
any collusion. Why does not the coinmittee give it a trial? After ail, if a man
or a wornan is found guilty of an offencE
whichi justifies thern in not living together,
whv should hie or she be allowed to marry
another and bring into existence a newN
farnily, and perliaps make it as bad as the
first one? It was only the other day, I
think in a New York divorce court, that
one of the judges threw up his appointrnent
in disgust. The cases brought before him
were so trivial, and the rea-sons given for
askingy for a divorce so infamous, that hie
would preside no longer. One case cited
was this: Mrs. Brown carne before the court
and complained about Mr. Brown's conduct. Mr. Brown was surnroned hefore
Judge 6o-and-So, and the wife was there.
Each of the parties had a lawyer. When
the wife was questioned about what grievance she had against hier husband, she did
not answer. So the judge pressed the question, and what followed was sornething like
this: "Are you not treated properly?"
"Don't you get ail the care and
"Yes."
food and dresses you require?" "'Yes."
"Does not your husband allow you so rnuch
rnoney every rnonth?" "Yes." "For God's
sake, what do you require a divorce for?"
And do you know what the answer was?
"Kind of lost mny taste for hiirn."
Snch are the reasons given in the divorce
courts of the neighbouring country. Are
we going to catch the contagion? 'Make it
a rule that a person found guilty before the
Divore~ Comrnittee shahl fot be allowed to
rnarry again, and try that for a few years,
and see the eff eet.
Hon. iMr. McMEANS: Can the honourable gentleman tell us if the lady hoe referred
to got the divorce?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTONZ.

Hon. "--\r. PROWSE: Honotirable gentlemen, the reason that 1 asked for the adjourrnent o! this debate ýn-as because I saw
iii the Bill Ihiese words:
The law of England as to the dissolution of

marriage and as to the annulment of marriage.
1 do not know what that law is, and I
do not suppose that there are ten honourable gentlemen in this House xvho do know.
This Bill refers to Prince Edward Island
and to Ontario. My honourable friend frorn
Hamilton says that he does not ibelieve in
divorce, and I arn glad of it: he is a happy
mnan. I cail tell you of a case in Prince
Edward Island, %vberethe people 'have not
got too much rnoney, of a returned soldier
who came to me and wanted to know hiow
hie could get a divorce. He returned frorn
the front after spending three years there,
and fighting hard and well. He was married to à good wornan. He wired from
Halifax that hie was corning home. He
arrived home that night, and she took the
train the next rnorning and went awav.
That poor chap bas not got a chance in
the worid o! getting a divorce. He has to
bring a lawyer at twenty-five dollars a day
and wîtnesses to Ottawa, whereas, if there
were a divorce court near, all that bie would
have to do would be to apply for a divorce
and prove his case. It is an utter impossibility for a man wvho has not got the dollars
to corne Up here and prove his case. There
are arguments that rniÈht be used both
ways, and that is the reason I rnoved the
adjourniment of the debate until we rnight
look into this question and see wbat the
resuit ofthis Bill -,vould be.
Hon. Mr. DN L:Honourable gentlemnen, I think ive rnight ail very fairly
congratulate the honourable gentleman
(Hon. W. B. Ross* who moved the second
reading of this Bill on the clear exposition
which hie gave of the %vhole niatter. and
his reasons for bringing in the Bill. I take
it that there is no other member o! this
body who is so well acquainted with the
subject matter of divorce in this country, in
its various provinces, as the honourable
gentleman froui Iliddleton.
I should flot care to enter into a discussion as to the mnrts o! divorce as a proceeding moral or immoral, because I take
it that for ail purposes a large rnajonity o!
the people of this country, outside of the
province o! Quebec, have decided that they
desire to have divorce under certain ci:curnstances.

times already this aflernoon, and hie might
allow other gentlemen to have their turn
The numnber of cases that are coming in at
this session is such as to tax the time ai
the disposai of any committee to attend
to them, and I think every one must have
noticed often in the press of Ontario, and
particularly the Ottawa press, an expression
of the desire to have this malter taken out
of the hands of Parliament and piaced,
like afl other civil and criminal cases, in
the hands of properly constituted courts of
justice. There is a great deal to be said
for that. Courts are established and judges
are paid for the purpose of adniinistering
justice, and they have ail the necessary appurtenances to carry on sucli business as
that.
There is another thing which 10 my mind
is a serious objection to divorce beingc
granted by Parliament, and that is that
every now and then cases occur in which
an unusuai degree of interest is taken by
different members of this or the other House,
and there is much canvassing- going on,

cases o! that kind it is, i think, a serjous
objection thal these mnatters are left to a
body coniposed, as Parliament is, of so
many different members who are susceptible
to influence. So I think it would be better
10 have this Bill become law, and to establish in Ontario a court which could deal
with nearly ail the cases which are coming
before Parliament now. Let them dispose
of their divorce cases without troubling
Parliament. With regard to the province
of Quebec and whatever cases may arise
there, application may stiil be made to
Parliament 10 deal wilh theni. For these
reasons 1 intend bo vote in favour of theBill.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not know that
I can add anything to what bas already
been said; but I desire t0 point out 10 this
honourable House just one f act. The right
of the province of Manitoba to grant
divorces was flot known in that province
until quite recently. Fromt the lime that
Manitoba entered mbt Confederation up 10
six months or a year ago it was generally
assumed that Manitoba had no right 10
grant a divorce. Some enterprising lawyer
iooked into the question and came to the
conclusion that the province had that right.
A test case was sent 10 the Privy Council
and il was decided that Manitoba always
had the righl bo grant divorce. Bo fair so
good. But I want to point out thi-s: that if
that lawyer had been wrong, and if Manitoba
and Saskatchewan had no divorce courts 10day, the Senate, instead of slruggling with
100 divorce cases, would be more likely 10
have 500. W'e know thal these numerous
applications for divorce are a direct result
of the war. The vast majority of cases
that have been brouglit before the Manitoba court and before the CGormittee of the
Senate have been directly traceable 10 the
war. Would my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynchi-Staunton) wanl
ail the divorce cases .brougaht from Manitoba
and tried here in the Senate?
Prior to last year innumerable cases in
which people were anxious bo obtain
divorce were tried on the other side o! the
line. Men or women went bo Dakota or
Montana or Nevada, stayed there three or
four monlhs, oblained a divorce, remarfied
Ihere, and then came back 10 Canada 10 live.
In thal way there was raised the question
whether any issue o! the second marriage
,,ý,ouId be legfitirnate or nol.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, it might possibly be more
discreet for me flot t0 projeet my views
into this discussion, but, having pronounced
views on the question, I feel that, entirely
irrespective of the element of discretilon, I
should flot hesitate to express myself upon
a matter whkch appeals so 'strongly t0 my
common sense, however it may appeal to
others. This is pecuiurly a question as to
which tribunal is the better able f0 try
divorce cases-the high court in the province of Ontario or the tribunal of Parliament. It rmIoves *tseif into that simple
question. We have always been accustomed
wi'thout any hesitation to pronounce the
highest enloguies that we could express upon
the courts of the realm. We have been necustoined, and very properly so, to place
the greatest confidence, flot only in the
honesty and the honour of the courts, but
also in their ability f0 deal rmith complex
~questions of civil and oriminal law. Reasoning along this line, would any honourable
member of this Senate for one moment advocate that Parliament, i preference to the
courts of the Dominion, should be the tribunal for the trial of cases of contract'
Could any honourable gentleman be found
wlho would urge that a parlîamentary coinmittee, made up o! representatives o! both
Houses of Parliament and afterwards sanetioned by both Houses, should be the tribunal to decide questions o! criminal law:
Why, if is unthinkable that any one wvould
advocate any such proposai.
That being the case, and our mninds bein,«
absolutely clear as to which isz the more

Ivhat is the question to be tried. Not only

we are living, marriage ia regarded as a
civil contraet and flot as a sacrament. 0f
course, honourable gentlemen are at liberty

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman is losing sighit o! the Church o! England.
Well,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
that may be; but the views which may be
held by the Church of England, or thé
views -whicli may be held by the Roman
Catholie Church, or the Presbyterîan or the
Methodist Church, do flot necessarily constitute the views held by the State on this
question and which from time f0 time are
crystallized in our laws. We are here, flot
at ail for the purpose of considering what
may be the traditions, or the prejudices, or
the sympathies o! any particular church or

or limited in our action by any political
or religious prejudice or sympathy. Honourable gentlemen can well appreciate the
position in which Parliament would be
placed if we adhered to any other doctrine.
If we adopted the attitude taken by honourable gentlemen wvho have an anfipathy,

against divorce, and if we adopted a similar
attitude withi regard f0 the other duties
which fal upon the shoulders o! members

of Canada the night to lezislate in divorce.
and that the Panliamient of Canada lias beeii
leg-islating from Confederation down to the
present time, and xvili continue to do it,
either by giving jurisdiction Vo the courts
or by exercising that jurisdiction in Parliamient.
Noix, honourable gentlemien, permit me
to direct your attention to another consideration. I fancy every honoureble gentlemaan hiere is an adberent of one of the greet
relig-ious bodies of this Dominion. I fancy
that no honourable gentleman here has a
riglit to -say that he is more religious than
bis neighbour. I believe that we arc al'
equally interested in maintaining the great
principles of Christianity and the great
principles of morality; and we are liere for
the purpose of crystallizing those great
principles in the leg-islation for which, w-e
are responsible. But let me say this. thant
wme
have long passed the stage in our
civilization when religions prejudice xviii
triumph over civil riglîts and civil law. In
tlie intenest of tlîe great religaious bodies
to which we belong, in the interest of the
-reat edifice of Christianiti- which we have
hýeen engaged in building 'up to the nagnificent proportions bi
it bas attained.
we nîust realize tiiet at its base lies the
principle of liberty of thouglît and action.
It is of no use to project religious prejudice
iiîto thiese great questions which have been
tlîreshed out long ag-o, which have been
established as belonging to civil freedomn,
and which must necessarily advance as
tiime progresses.
There is anotlier consideretion, and it is
more immnediate, prohably. than any other
to whiclî I have directed attention: is this
Senate, which is a co-ordinate branch of
Parliament, Vo occupy the greater part of
its time in dealing with questions which in
other countries are dealt with by the courtsý1
Durin.- the present session, applications for

APRIL 14, 1920
divorce closely approxiniiate '200 iii numiber. Members of this Chamiber have been
sitting from marninga tilI night dealinge
with the question of divorce, and they are
overwhelnied withi the work which is involved. It was neyer contemplated for a
moment, when the British North America
Act was drafted, and this authority was
gaiven ta Parliament, that the time of Parliament should be occupied in dealing witli
cases which, ta any ordinary mind, must
present themnselves as being capable af
being deait with more advantageously by
the courts.
We ail pride ourselves on the dignity of
the Senate. It ia entitled ta this position
in the parliamentary life af the Dominion,
and it should not be charged with dealing
with this class of civil business. By reasan
af the Senate being charged wîth the administration af divorce it has te meet a
measure of ridicule in the public press, and
ctherwise, which is net in harmony with
the dignity which we desire ta ruaintain.
Honourable gentlemen can scarcely take up
a newepaper without finding remarks, made
by t-hase in high authority, in reference ta
the Senate which are inconsistent with the
position which wve should insist upon maintainTrg.
Furthermore, instead o! the best minds
in the Senate sitting day after day, week
alLer week, dealing with this class af business, which should be disposed af by the
courts, the members o! the Senate should
be engaged in larger and more important
If honourable
questions af public duty.
gentlemen o! this Senate have a conception
that this class of business should be disposed af by the Senate, and not by the
courts, then they hold an entirely different
conception of the duties of the Seiîate ta
thiat which I entertain.
Honourable gentlemen, mnay 1 further
direct your attention ta the !act tlîat in
Great Britain, which is the fountain of
our jurisprudence, and 1 might say o!
miost of aur legisîstive ideas and principles,
we find a broader outlook obtaining upan
this question than has ever been entertained
at any previaus tinie. We in Canada mnust
keep pace withi progressive thouglit in regard ta the best way of dealing with this
subject.
Since risingc I have not said a woTd in
advooacy of divorce. 1 arn not discussing
that question at. al. It is a condition, not,
are not
,a theory, that iz- !acing us. WVe
here for the purpose o! dealing- in theolagical refineinents and discussing the question
as ta w'hiether in the public initerest divorce

have arrived at a
z-hould be granled. W%,'e
point in our civilization when this -question is regarded as one of the great problems of the age, and it must be deait with.
You cannot block the wheels of progressive
thought in regard te this subjeet. You
must deal rwjth it. Let us cast to the winds
any religicus prejudice or any theological
refinements whièh -we may enterbain upon
this subject, and deal with it purely as a
question that is facing us every hour of
the day while, we are meetinlg in Ps.rli-ament. Let us discuss, as men poasessed
of common sense, the best way of dealing
with 'the question, rwhether by Parliament
or -by the courts.
As ta the anticipated, abuse which nray
-arise frein this question being- deiegated
to the courts, let me point out thait hionourable gentlemen -who have in'timated that
it would result in a greater number of
divorces being granted cast a reflection
upon the courts. In the first place, the
cause of divorce is limited to 4-hat of adultery. WVill not the higher courts safeguard
the morality, and, if you like, the Christian
principles which may be jeopardized in the
exercîse cif this authority or duty rwhich
we seek ta place upown. them? They are
in a very much better postion to hear the
evidence, 'te weigh the evidence, and to
corne ta a proper conclusion than a coinmittee of Parliament. It is unnecefary
for mie ta labour that question, because I
feel saitisfied. that there la net an honourable gentlemnan sittîng -within reach of niy
voile who will nlot at once coneede that
the rnost satisfactory machinery that can
le applied ta the solution of this problein is ta be found in the courts ci Canada.
I have to apologize for thrusting these
views u'pon -you, honourable gentlemen,
in the wvay in which I have. But I have
a very strong feeling on the subject, the.
this is a coinmronsense inatter and should
be dealt, with in a comimonsense way, and
that, the only way ta do it is ta relegate
it ta the courts.
Hon.- JAMES J. DONNELLY: Honourable gentlemen, after the remarks of the
leader af the Government, I feel it niy
duty 40 say a word or Vwo on this question.
I wish te say first t-bat I Jeel it my duty
in the public interest es a representative
of Ontario ta oppose this Bill. The honourable gentleman referred ta such niatters as
religiaus prejudice. I do no>t knoi% that
he meant it«in that way. The result of this
Bill will be ta establisi -a divorce court
in the province of Ontaria. We -have heard
a numiber af speeches in support of the

SENATE
Bill, but so f:îr 'Xe have not heard a gentlemian f roi Ontario supporting blhe Bill.
It is surprising that other gentlemen
shotild býe sa over anxiaus about the welfare of the people of Ontario. My view is
that as soon as you have a divorce court
in Ontario you add a certain arnount of
respectability ta a divorce, and theneby
strike at the family, which is the foundation a! ail society.
For many years, I have understood that
we had no divorce Iaw in Quebec or Ontario. True, people have made a practice
of eorning ta Parliament, and have had
special Acts of Panhiament passed whereby
marri a ire Nwere dissalved. Parliament has
prectically supreme power, if it is so disposed, ta pass an Act in regard ta any contract. Although the practice has grawn up
of the Senate doing( this work. it is under no
obligation ta do so. A divorce Bill rnight
as well e intnoduced in the Commons as in
the Senate.
I appose this Bill on the graund that we
arc no, admiinister-ing- the law, but enactingthe Iaw. You may say that if %ve do nat
pass ibis Bill we will impose great hardship
upaxi suine people. But I do not think you
can follow that line of arg"ument We have
the prohibition mneasure, which certainly
limits what many people think is a pensonal
righit. Thene has got ta be some suffering,
some handship, perhaps, but it is for the
public gaod.
I do not w'ish it ta be understaod that

THE LIBRARY 0F PARLIA3MENT.
THE SELECTION OF LInRARIANS.

Hon. PASCAL POIRIER inquired:
If it is true that both the general and the
parliaientary
librarlans
are about
to be
retired on their superannuation. And, if such be
the case.' that lie wll cal the attention of the
Seriate and et the Government to the necessity
of having well trained and competent librarians
appointed in their place.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I mnay
say to my honourable friend that in his
absence a few days ago I brought down an
answer to that question. I cannot put my

APRIL 15, 1920
band on it at the moment, but my recolleclion is that the answer was that the librarians would be entitled to retire on superannuatien, but had not yet done se. That
is to say, tbey are stili in office, but tbey
'would be entitled to somte superannuatiofi
upon their making application. I msy say
furtber ta my bonourable friend that I
tbink it is their intention to do so.
-Hon. Mr. POIRIER: In that case, honourable gentlemen, I sbould like to be allowed ta say just a few words. There is
It
nothing personal in the question put.
is entirely an objective one. I understand
that ithe twe parliamentary librarians have
completed long years of service, and that,
'whetber they have asked to be retired or
net, tbey are to be retired.
This question concernEs the qualifications
of the future librarians. We are about to
move into our new library. I will not say
that the arrangement, as least ta xny fancy,
is an ideal one, but I suppose it is the best
to be bad under the éxisting condition of
aif airs. Tbe removing of tbe library means
a new classification. The books will have
te be classified as tbey are classified in
European libraries, or in the libraries o! the
United 6tates. That work of classification
is in itself a science. It is most important
that the classification should be well made
at the start. That carnies with it the necessity of appointing librarians who are
acquainted witb that sort of work, and who
wvill do it propenly. The public librarian
wbo is up ta bis business should also know
bow to handle bis staff; that is to ssy, bie
sbould bave certain men appointed for certain work. For example, this being a parliamentary lihrary, it is often resorted to
by us for information. Tbere should be
some specialization; there sbould be employees wbese duty would be more particularly, for example, te attend to la"' questions, others te bistory, and se on. T.hat
again is a performance that requires a previeus training at the bands of the librarian.
New, bave we such a man in the Domninion? I 'believe we bave net. Therefore the
Government will be called upon te appoint
gentlemen witb.out adequate previous trainI
ing. What is 'the Government te do'
bave ne candidate of my own for the positien, and care very little wbo is appeinted,
provided he is cempetent. Very likely tbe
Gevernment wvill put in some old faithful
servant who will get b is reward in that
way. I am net concerned with that, but I
arn concerned witb bis competency-. As "'e
bave ne competent man in that line. I

would suggest to the Government that the
two librarians wbo are going to be appointed
should be given at least six months' travelling expenses. Let tbemn be sent to the
United States, wbere the system of running
a library bas reacbed a fair degree of perfection. Let then' go to Washington, to
Boston, to New York, to Chicago, and get
fromn the librarians in those cities ail available information. Then let them cross over
to the old country. Let them go ta England,
to France, and to Italy, to pursue for six
or nine months the study of what is required in a library. Then they will corne
home, I will flot say fully equipped, but as
well equipped as Ihis or any Government
could equip them under the circumstances.
The position of librarian bas became se
important in the United 6tates that no petson can be appointed as librarian to a public
institution unless he bas served two years
of apprenticesbip or bas been at least two
years in a library learning bis trade. In
Belgium they have, I tbink, a school for
that purpese, and in Germany I know tbey
bave. In England and France competence
is required in public librarians. What I
ask. and earnestly ask, of the Government
is tbat tbey do not appoint a green man,
no matter how intelligent or how well iiiformed bie may otherwise be, for tbe removal
of our library to its new quarters, possibly
its eternal quarters. We hope this building
will be like tbe poet's metal-tbat it will
We want
be eternal-"aere perennius."
tbe foundation work to be done in such a
way that it 'will not have to be done again.
That is true econemy. There is no ecenomy in baving- a library in whicb tbere are
no employees wbo have specialized for such
work. I bope and pray earnestly that soine
preparation will given ta the librarians whe
are to be appointed in the place of Mr.
Griffin.
DeCelles and M.Nr.
Let me add just one 'word. I heard a
rumour, in wbicb I place ne credence, and
I hopé tbere is .notbing in it. It is necessary, in iny view, that tbere sbould be an
English and a French librarian, for the
sake of ecenomy. The library is granited,
I believe, $10,000 a year for the purchase of
books, and if wve enlarge our library wve
may bave to grant more money. It is essential tbat the purchasers of books, either
English or French, or both, sbeuld know
what books to select. Il tbey do not, there
is a squandering -of public money. Now, I
submit 'that a Frenebroan cannot do justice to English literature, bistory, and
science, nor can an Englishman do justice to French literature, history, and

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I -%vould sug-gest to the Government to leave to t.he
Civil Service Commission the appointment
of a committee of the best men who ca~n be
found in Canada to examine into the qualifications of applicants for the position of

can surely find men who, whiie not themselves perhaps f ully qualified to fill the
positions, could yet examine the applications and decide upon what matters, and they are -nurnerous, the canididates should be tested. I arn convinced

the library. Thieir naines have been mnentioned by the honourable gentlemen who
spoke before me. These two gentlemnen at
the time o! their appointment were men
who hnd special dlaims on the Governmient
o! the day. One o! them had been acting
as t.he editor of a very prominent and influential paper for several yearé, and his
health had failed. He had really either to
give up the editing or drop out, and the
l-eadere o! 'the Governqnent of -that day-I asisume Sir John Macdonald and Sir Charles
Tupper--decided that Mr. Griffin should
be a librarian. This was when the position
becamie vacant by the death of t.he late. Dr.
Todd.. We know, honourable gentlemen,
some o! the things that politics bring
about; and il happened about the time when
thi-s appointnient was to be niade that thiere
was what is nowadays called a strike
amongust the members !rom the province of
Quebec, and that the gentleman who n'as
then Secretary* of State insisted on the appointmnent cf a person who iva- to represent the provincýe of Quebec, amI '-%r. De
Celles -%vas -appointed. I think it would be
very difficuit to find two gentlemen who had
strong-er dlaims, both on aecount o! their
ability and their literary achievements,
than Mr. Griffin and Mr. DeCelles.
But how is it now? So far as I arn aware,
there are no gentlemen accupying anything
like the relative positions that Mr. Griffin
and '-%r. DeCelles occupied, and the question is, what action are we to take when
these two gentlemen retire? Honourable
gentlemen, my humble opinion is that there
is not the slizlhtest occasion for appointing
a deputy head in the library at all. cert.ainly not two deputy headis. The whole staff
o! the librarv, including the two deputy
heads, nuihers only 18, and the salarip>*
eamount to Qomnething over $37.000 a yea r.
The two deputy lieads drawv $1-2.000 a year.
If you 9trike of the salaries o! the tWo deputy heads, you find that a ssviing- will be
effected inuch larger and in a much more
satisfactory way than the savine, which it
is supposed wvould be effected bv the consolidation o! our law departmeit ithi thlat
conteno! the House o! Comimons. «Mvý
tion is this, that if we are to look for
efficiency, the gentlemen who are in the
library at present, in a subordinate cepacity, are quite suitable. Thiere is one
English- gentleman who bas spent a if etime there. There is a Frenclh eentleman
who has been there nearly as long. Any
outsiders that you can get will not even
after six months' travellin., be as welI
suited !or the position as the two chie!
clerkzs. I mysel! do not see anv rtason why

187

the country should flot save this $12,000 a
year and appoint no successors to the present librarians as deputy heads.
The honourable gentlemian f rom Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Poirier) spoke of the classification as heing important. Well, classification is important; but surely the men who
have spent their lives among the books in
the library and have naturally considered
possible improvements would be better
qualified than any gentleman who could be
picked up outside. I have heard the nameE
of two gentlemen mentioned as probable
appointees, and I am safe in saying that
neither o! them has ariy special qualification for the position of librarian, and we
would simply be spending $12,000 a year
unnecessarily if we appointed outsiders as
X
librarians.
The library is an important branch of
our staff, but it is not as important as some
honourable gentlemen seem to think. I
find that in England the librarian o! the
House o! Lords is paid £1,000 a year, and
lie really counts as on.ly one o! the clerks
on the staff of the House o! Lords. The
clerk o! the House o! Lords receives a salary o! £2,500. The clerk assistant receives
a salary of £1,500. Some of the inferior officers receive salaries o! £1,000. In the
Huse of Commons the librarian's salary
is from £1,000 to £1,200; the clerk's salary
is £2,000; the salary o! the assistant cierk
in at
iýs £1,800; a.nd the librarian coe
fromn £1,000 to £1,200. So, in the country
whose example we are supposed to be glad
to follow, the librarians are treated not as
under-secretaries or deputy heads, but as
important clerks; and 1 am satisfied that
the gentlemen who are now in the library,
if continued as chie! clerks, will do everything that can be done by an outsider, and
wvill do it in a more effective and econoluical way than it can be done under t.he
schieme indicated by the honourable gentIeinan froan Acadie.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, 1 appreciate the action of the
hionourable gentlemean fromn Acadie (Hon.
Mr. Poirier) in bringing this question forwnrd, because I think the administration
o! the library is a very important matter
in the interests o! Parliament. As bas already been stated, we have been very fortunate in having had competent librarians.
I will not take up time in expatiating further on the work o! these gentlemen. And,
previous to their appointment, we had in
the library a very capable librarian: I refer to the late. Mr. Todd, who establislied
a reputation !or Canada in the work that

SENATE

188

he wrote on (onstitutioflal Governrnent. It
îs recognized as a standard work dlrougheliut
the -%Vhole British Gorumoniwealth. Ou*ly the
other day I received a letter from a gentleman who pointed out that on several occasions representatives o! other parts of the

Blritish Dominions, on their visits te this
country, had made a special point of bearing testimony te the valuable work that
Mr. Todd had done, flot only for Canada
but for the whole British Empire, in the
book that he wrote some years ago, and
which has been ever since, as I have said,
the standard work in regard te constitutional government.
To draw the attention et the House to the
necessity at the present tirne of having- really
competent men appointed to these positions, I shaîl read an èxtract from the report of the librarians which was laid before
Parliament at the beginning of this session,
and which wiii be found at page Il of the
Minutes of this House. It says:
"The librarians understand that some space
for the use of the iibrary wiil be spared in the
new building.
"As the crowded state of the library has
long been known, and has been reported on
yearly for many years, it Is hoped that the

space to be supplied wiIi be, at least temporarily,

In 1919 they again reterred to the subject as
follows "The librarians understand that some space
-for the use of the library will be spared in the
new building. As the crowded state of the
llbrary bas long been known. and has been
reported on yearly for rnany years, it ls hoped
that the space to be supplied wiii be, at least
temporartly. sufficient.
"No information bas been received during
the year. from any source, regarding any proposed plans for increase of space. Blut the
librarians still entertain the hope that the
plans for the new building will include more
roorn for the convenience of niembers and for
the sterage and consultation of boolks."

such a character that it requires a nuxuber of
years of training before a mnan is competent to fill the position.
In regrard to the remarks of my honourable friend from De Lorimier ('Hon. Mr.

Dandurand),
satisfactory if the Government took upon
themselves the responsibility of appointing
a small committee to select men for this
puinpose rather than delegating the selection
to the Civil Service Commission. Personally I am flot enamoured of the work done
by the Civil Service Commission. I think
the Government would be muchi more capable of selecting the best men for these
positions, and we should have more chance
of getting competent men to f111 the positions if the Government proceeded in that
manner.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I wishi to veice my
regret that advanced years have rendered
necessary the early retirement of the two
librarians of Parliament. They have certainly filled their positions with great satisfaction to thos.e using the library.
I listened with attention to the speakers
wlio have al.ready spoken. and I wvas some,uhat surprised, in vîew o! the changed condition o! affairs in this country, that they
took it for granted that two men would be
appointed te these positions. WVe have in
this country inany literary ladies, of very

great ability, and it seems to me it was
very ungallant on the part of the senators
who have spoken to have entirely neglected
the idea that ladies should be appointed to
the positions, or at least to one of them.
The wolnen of the country now have the
vote, and are on a basis of ecjuality with
the inen alonga every line. I arn surprised
that the hionourable gentleman froin De

Hon. Mr. DOMNVILLE: I arn very much
pleased to see this question of the Parliamentary Library in the past and in the

the future %ve want more scientiflo books,
and less of the lending library system. Only
to-day I hiad to send for something that

anything tth-at one wantc, Ito get out of the

I t.hink iny honourabie, frienci is right
about the ladies. You know, he once referred to "wine, 'wounen, and graft," end he
was flot far wrong. He is far-seeing. His
perspicacit.y is great. He sees to-day the
ideal that the ladies of this country should
have an opportunity of filling one of these
positions. The ladies are coming to the
front, in Eng-land and in other countries;
and should flot we in this country give the
ladies a chance? We ail agree on thaf. 1 reinember, when I was in the House of ComMons, when the sugar question came up,
and certain statements were made. I asked
where a certain gentleman got bis authority.
Fie said his authority was first-class. I insisted upon an answer o rny question, and
he finally said, " I got it from the cook."
We are very much in thaf position now.
I think there should be a different system in the library. I hate to have f0 go in
and see whether I can gef a book or whether
I cannot. Things seem to be ouf of joint a
bit, and this iniatter should receive some
consideration.
Hon. MNr. LAVERGNE: Honourable gentlemen, I do not see the need at the present
moment of appointing new librarians. We
have two librarians. Mr. Griffan and '-\r.
DeCees bath very able mien. We cannot,
find nien good enough to replace them.
Later on, wvhen they are not able to do their
work, the Government may replace them.
They have given satisfaction to everybody
in this country-senators, memhers of the
House of Conimons, men frorn the universitiesHon. Mr. TESSIER: Ladies.
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: Ladies, too; and
I hope the Government will ]et them keep
their positions as long as they are able to
do the work properly, as they have done for

iS£

the last twenfy-five or thirty years. These
gentlemen were appointed by iSir John A.
Macdonald's Governmient, I think, and have
been able to give full particulars to ail
desiring information, and I trust the Government will allow them f0 remain a while
long-er.
Hon. M'ýr. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen, in addition f0 the qualifications which
the several members have represented
should be possessed by the librarians, there
is one which. I arn going to mention which
they have not possessed in the past, or
which they have flot been allowed to exercise, and that is the qualification of being
able to get back the books which are loaned
from the library. I remember not very
long ago aftending a meeting of the Library
C'onnnittee, fut whioh lit was said thait tho'usands of volumes that had gone out of the
library had neyer been returned. Information wvas given which went to show that in
many places throughout Canada volumes
belonging to the Governmenf were to be
found in second-hand shops. If I remnember correctly, that stafement was made by
the librarian. I took occasion after that f0
visit the library ait Washington, and also
the library at Boston, where I found a
system in force whereby a receipt was given
by the members of the respective Houses
for every volume which they had obtained
in the library, and for 'which they had f0
psy if the volume was not returned within
a certain finie. Additional space within
this building is being asked for for the
books. If the information f0 which I have
referred is correct, the space which is to
be used for kecping books would not be
large enough f0 hold the books faken out in
the past and nof returned. If I arn not
mueh mistaken, the value of such books
ran mbt thousands of dollars. This is the
time to niake a change in this respect. Sonie
system should be adopted to enforce the
return of books, or f0 collect for thern if
they are flot returned. I ani sorry to say
that at the particular meeting to which I
refer thiere appeared to) be only two or three
gentlemen who were willing to follow the
matter up in the way wvhich I suggested,
and the matte *r was dropped. To my mind
the loss of books is a serious matter. For
alI I know the saine thing rnay be goîng
on yet..
I hope thaf in connection with
the change that is to be made ia the staff
a real system will be adopted by which the
country will not suifer any further loss in
this respect.

who require to use them, this country will
rsuffer a very much greater losa in a vear
than the $37,00>, or the extra amount of

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I arn sure the House hias

which have been made upon this subject.
It la of interest to the Government, but
probably of greater interest to the present

however, illustrates the dificulty facing the

ibis kind. 1 do not think tbat anv tw o hionourable gentlemen xvho have spoken upon
this subject have ag-reed. The honourable
gentleman frein Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier>
sugges ts that the new appointee should be
put throughi a preliminary course of trainmg.-a course te which nobody can take
serieus exception. The honourable gentleman fromn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), recog-nizing that two appointments will be made, would net, I amn surprised f0 say, have sufficient confidence in
the Governnient to make the appointments,
but would sugg-est that they be made by
some independent commission. Then, my
honourable friend from Kamloops (Hon.
MNr. Bostock) lias no confidence at all in
the Civil Service Commission, provided they
are comnpetenit to miake these appointments,
but would employ, 1 fancy, a parliamentary
commîttee. Then, the honourable and gailant gentleman !rom Sussex (Hlon. 'Mr.
Fowler) would disappoint those who are
loekîng forward wvith considerable exýpectatien te the appointinents being made, and
would make his selection from.some of the
ladies of the Dominion. Some of the most
competent librarians that we have in the
Dominion belong te the genfler sex, and I
have ne doubt that the Government might
make two very acceptable appointments
flom that section of the community. However, honourable gentlemen, this illustrates
the difficulty that we have in dealing with
a subject of this kind. In as much as the
vacancies up te the present fume have net
heen created, I rnay say with ahl assurance
te honourable gentlemen, and particularly
te those who have spoken, that every consideration will be g-iven te the views expressed.

ELECTRIFICATION 0F GOVERN'MENT

MOTION.

Hon. E. D. SMITH moved:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, it is expedient and in the interest of Canada for the
Government te proceed to aubstitute electricity
for ateam as a motive power usion the Unes of
railway owned by the Government as soon as
and wherever economically practicabie.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, yeu wili
observe that this motion dees net commit
the Geverninent te any immediate action,
nor te any definite expenditure. The pro-

APRIL 15, 1920
posai is simply that when it is econornicaliv
feasible the Government shalil change some
portions of the roads owned by theni into
electric roads. 1 will now proceed to give
my reasons.
I enter upon the discussion of this subject,
however, not as an expert in any way qualifled to determine which is the more economical method o! locomotion, electricity or
steam, under given circumstances, but
rather as a layman looking around and
seeing things as they exist and drawing
conclusions -from them. 1 see, -for instance,
that -for many years past our imports f rom
the United States have been much larger
than our exports. Until lately that did not
matter s0 xnuch; but now the financial condi tions in the various countries o! the world
have put us in such a position that the
Canadian dollar will buy only 90 cents
worth o! goods in the United States. This
is attributed by financiers to the adverse
balance o! trade. It is therefore desirable.
it seems to mfe, for us to study in order to
change this situation wherever we can. We
must buy les froin -the United States and
sebi more to them.
Upon our steam, railw.ays in Canada we
use 10,000,000 tons o! coal in a year, and
that coal cost us last year about $3 a ton
at the mines, or $2.37 a ton counting slack
and ail, or about $4 a ton at the border;
and, as we have about 40,000 miles of railway, that means that we use 250 tons of
coal upon an average mile o! ra.ilway. The
railways that I would suggest miglit possibly be electrified are those that have the
heaviest traffic, and they would probably
use much more coal than 250 tons a mile;but at 250 tons a mile, and 34 a ton at the
border, 31,000 a mile is expended for coal
in Ithe United States by Ontario lines. We
rwould
would save that, and Ühe saving ci ult
helip us ito some exitent, thoughi perhaps
not a 'very l1arge extent, in our excehange
si'tuation, as I only ryugge.st elewtrification
of a îsmall 'part o! the wh<SIe. That iceoine
arlgumfenlt in davour of Qte change.
There are rnany other good reasons. A
goo-d many economies could be broughit
about. For instance, an electric road does
not require any firemen, any stokers. There
is a big saving. There are no coal tenders.
Over every mile o! railway operated by
stesan the eng-ine pulls around one car
lQaded wjth coal all the time. On electric
cars that is aaved. Then, a very large part
of the service in the operation of railways
is taken up in hauling coal froin the United

191

States to dumps -%Nhere it, is unloaded and
at which it bas to be lifted agyain into tenders. Ail of that expense'is saved.. and it,
is a huge amount. Then, the discomfort, of
coal is a great objection. Coal is a fuel
that is d.irty and that causes discommfort to
passengers. In the aummer time no one
wouid travel upon a steam train if he couid
take an electrie train at the same rate and
goîng at the same speed. because on an
electric train hie can have the windows
open and will have to suifer none of the
discomfort that arises from the use of coal.
Sa t.hat there are many argumenta in favour
of electriflcation if it is economical. These
are summarized perhaps better in an article
dealing with the results acquired by the
Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul railway,
440 miles o! whicli running across the Rocky
Mountains are electriffld. The beneficiai
resulta are stated as follows:
Marked reduction ln cost of electricity as
compared with coat of coal.
Reduction in maintenance cost of locomotiv'es.
Elimination of clelays due to coaling. taking
w'ater, oil, etc.
Etimination of dclays due to natural causes.
such as freezing o! locomotives. loss of steam
ln cold weather. bucking snow drifts.
Elimination of non-revenue trains baullng
coal and water for steam locomotives.
Increased tonnage per train.
Increased train speed on grades.
Greater reliabillty asd certalnty of maintaining scbedules.
Reduction in train crew hours per ton mile.
]Reduction ln damage to rolling stock due to
rough handling by steam engines.
Greatly Increased safety of operation on
grades due to regenerative braking.
Saving in power and reduction ln wbeel and
track wear by use of regenerative braking.
Improvement o! tunnel conditions due ta

and absence of grinding brake shoes on grades.

in railway building. It ought to he our
special aim, therefore, it seerns to me, to
make the lines in On~tario and. the western
part o! Quebec as remunerative as possible,
and to do ail wve can to prevent traffic being
taken away from them.
We can readily see what will be the resuit if the proposed system o! 1,600 miles
o! hydro-radial roads is buiît. It is said by
the promoters that these hydro-radial roads
will pay, and they adduce arguments to
that effect; but I must say that those arguments are flot very convincing to me. Looking over the situation in other countries, I
cannot find anywhere in America any
hydro-electric roads, capitalized as these will
be, that are paying, and I do not believe
that these roads will ever pay. I believe
they will be an enormous loss which wvill
be a !right!ui load for the municipalities
to carry. However, they have voted in
favour o! them. They want to have roads
o!their own, regardless o!the cost or o! the
loss, and they are going to have these
roads and operate them by electric service,
for they know how superior it is to steam.
Now, it seems to me that ifthose roads are
built. 'they oannot but cause an exctreniely
heavy loss to the government-owned roads *
If the hydro-radial roads are to pay, they
must earn from $ 15,000 to $25,000 a mile, at
the costs rwhich prevailed 'before the ~war.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Does that include the

an enorinous cost. The Toronto-Bowmanville line, 40 miles, was lately voted upon.

or $200,000 a mile.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not wish to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but
would he kindly state what is the proportion between the cost of the right of way
and the cost of construction?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: I do not know. The
cost o! the right of way would ho heavy in
these two cases.

cause one o! the lines runs through the city
o! Hamilton, and the other runs into the

entire system o! 1,600 miles would cost
$200,000 a mile. Certain parts o! the roads
would cost et that rate, and we may assume
that the remainder would cost perhabs
$100,000 a mile.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But the

Hon. Mr. SMITH.- I have not seen that
statement. Perhaps so. At any rateHon. Mr. DANDURAND: In both cases
those roads would duplicate existing lines.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes, they would
absolutely duplicate and run alongside
existing roads.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-sTAUNTON: Triplicate.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Take the 40 miles o!
line from Toronto to Bowmanville. There
are already three steam roads running
within pistol shot o! wvhere this road is to
run. From fMimico to -St. Catharines, a
distance of 60 miles. there is an electrie
road, and the Grand Trunk runs within
hal! a mile o! it. AIL over the province o!
Ontario a sîmilar condition exists. It is
proposed to continue the Uine from. Bowmanvillê down to Kingston and perhaps on
dovrn to Montreal, running right alongside
the Grand Trunk and the C.P.R. in some
cases and the 'Canadian National in others.
From Toronto westward to Guelph there
is an electric road owned by the Government, and the Grand Trunk runs from Toronto to Guelph; it is proposed to run a
hydro-radial aiso fromi Toronto te Guelph.
It i.s pro'posed te continiue the electric
line from there, parallel with the Grand
Trunk, te StraIiford and London. Bo it
is ail over ie country. As 1 îstated at
the beginning, you cannot build -an eiectrie Uine in Ontario without paralleling
at close quarters an existing st.eam road.
Therefore I can corne to no other conclusion than that if these roads are buiit they
will suck the existing steam roads dry o!
ail profit from local traffic. The local passenger traffic will nearly ail go by electrie
road, if there is good service. No one would
travel on a steam road in the aunimeir
time if he could travel on an electric road
in the same comfort, at the same rate o!
speed, and a-t the same cost. These roads
propose to carry passengers, at aibout half
the rates of the steam roads. Whether or
not they can do it I do not say, but that is

at 5 per cent that would amount ta $2,000

,do so is to propose to ele-ctrify such portions af the Government roads as can be
economically electrified. We do flot have
to electrify t.he wvhole system; rnaybe only
1,000 or 500 miles to start with. We cannot
electrify the whole sysfem now; we have
not got the power. The earliest time that
we could get the power would be when the
Chippewa schemne is finished, which it is
said wvill be in the fall of 1921, but -which
ivill more likely be in 1922. That is tbe
earliest date at whiQh the hydro-radials can

I kno-w it is almost out of the question

it is absolutely necessary to spend asome

on one cf the electrie engcines for the whele
distance cf 440 miles, and get a geod deal
cf first-hand -information froin the employees operating the trains. The saving in
cost cf operation was very substantial. The

electric engines hauled trains over tbe
whole distance cf 440 miles and it wvas net
necessary to change engines. IBut the initial cost cf construction and the cost cf
maintenance cf wires and power bouses and
staffs cennected with the plant wbvere the
electricity was developed were very heavy
indeed.
Hon. '.%r. DOMIVILLE: May I ask niv

reason: that before the time arrives %vlenl
those electrical lines can be buiit, the hig-hwavs will have been so improved. that the
railroads will have been replaced by thle

by the automobile for the transportation of
passengers. You will have a jitney service
aîl tbrough southern Ontario, on the main1
hig-hways, and there wili net be need for
more raiiroads than we have at present.
Thierefore I think it is flot advisable at the
moment for us to attempt te make, any
capital excpenditure in changing over from

APRIL 15, 1920
stearn to electric operation of our railways,
even in the territory where energy is available, for ail the avaîlable energy is at present needed for industrial purposes, and
will be for some tirne to came.
So far as the honaurable niember (Hon.
Mr. Smith) desires to avoid the duplication
of railway aines, which makes operation
unprofitable, I arn entirely in accord with
his views, and heartily commend his suggestion ta your consideration; but I wvanted
ta point out particularly that, aith the
improvesnent af highways, the motor truck
Nvill, I thjnk, revolutionize&transportation
for local purpases.
Hon. W. H. BENNETT: The point -%vhii,
a.s 1 understand, the honourable gentleman
irom Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smith) was
einphàsizing vas this. that,. in view ai the
engagements wvhich are about ta be entered
into by certain mnunicipalities in the province af Ontario, it is desirable that, in any
cases where such undertakinga would invalve the duplioating or triplicating of
existing roads, the Government of Canada
manifest its intention to substitute electricity for steani. For the benefit of honourable
gentlemen who do not corne fromn the province af Ontario and may not be conversant
with the conditions existing in this province
in respect ta the so-called bydro-electric
roads, I would like ta make a few remarks.
In the first place, these undertakings are
flot initiated by the province at ail; they
are initiated by municipalities, which issue
debentures or bonds upon which the roads
xnay be bujît, and which in turn ask the
province ta giýarantee the bonds. Without
the provincial guarantee the bonds could
nat be profitably sodd. Fortunately for the
province of Ontario, the present provincial
government bas taken a determined stand
%vithregard ta the manner of dealing« with
these hydro-electric railways-a more determined stand than was taken by the political parties in the last House. Let honourable gentlemen look, at the map or consider
the province of Ontario. Let us take the
case referred ta by the honourable member
ironi Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smith)-that ai
the railroads running alang the noith shore
ai Lake Ontaria. There are places where
the Canadian Netional, the Canadian
Pacific and the Grand Trunk run parallel
within a stones throw of each other. Yet,
voluntarily, the municipalities have pledged
their credit ta establish, in apposition ta
those three existingc svsteins. a line ai
electric railwvay. On the face ai it, it is
inadness. Nevertheless it is heing done.

19,

I amn not positive, but I have always
understaod that under certain Acts of the
Legislature it is guaranteed that in the
event ai lasses on the hydro-ýelectrie railways the province will pay a portion oi the
lasses. I have nat read the Acts and will
not state that for a fact. I have asked menibers of the îlegisiature about it, and have
had answers bath pro and con. It is rather
alluring to the anunicipalities ta be assured
that in the event of loas they will not have
ta bear it ail. Then, another inducemnent is
beld up, particularly in the case af the
line which runs from Hamilton ta Toronto,
and that is that the assessrnent would be
on the large property owners in Hamilton
and the municipalities through wvhich the
line passed, iand îthere would be an enormous capit-al exopenditu're cd mnillions of dollars. The proposition was defeated in the
city ai -Hamilton an the first vote, but on
the second occasion it was carried, although not by a very great majority.
The -London and Port Stanley road was
originally a steama railway. It did not succeed in making maney as it has been operated. Consequently it passed inta the
bands ai the city ai London, I understand,
and is naw owned by that city.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT. There had been a
big development in the trafflo of that railway owing to a large quantity cf coal being
irnported froan the United States ta Port
Stanley.
That importation created an
abnormal increase af traffic over what had
obtained when the road was being operated
hy steam. Moreover, owing ta the favourable price at which it was purchased, the
bine was able ta make a very creditable
showing. Another factor that entered into
the increased profit ai the road was the
developrnent ai Port Stanley as a summer
resort, which greatly increased the traffic.
These and other factors, together with the
general development ai the country and
particularly the city ai 'London, increased
the revenue.
There is the Metropolitan railway running out ai Toronto northward ta Newmarket and diverging ta Lake Simcae. Any
honourable gentleman who is conversant
with the conditions knows that were it not
for the enormaus summer traffic that is

Wonderful te relate, the Hydro people contemiplate buildinig another line alongaside of

of railway. 1 have seen an occasional car
on it. It was formerly owned by the Canadian Northern, and has now been acquired
by the Government. From ail 1 have ever
been able te learn, the operation of that
road seems to have been regaarded as more
or less of a joke, and it w-as maintained by
Mackenzie and Mann only for the purpose
of enabling thein te retain their riglits te
certain bonuses or some arranigemient they
had made with the inunicipalities.
Now the people of those municipalities in

the roads? Every person wbo bas read
articles on tbe use of motor trucks and
vebicles of that sort, referred to by the honourable Minister of Labour, knows very
well that in the province of Ontario a large
trade bas already been developed in this
respect. The province is now spending, or
contemplates spending, millions of dollars
in the bettermient of reads, and it is to be
expected that a great deal of traffie will

Moreover, 1 believe that the Dominion Governament at the very earliest day should

Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: Honourable gentlemen. being engaged in the hydro-electric
power business, I arn somewhat famailiar
with the subject now before the Senate;
but I will not detain the House longer than
is necessary to make a very short staternent.
The honourable Minister of Labour made
just such a speech as I would have made on
this subject, and wbich it is flot necessary
for me t-o repeat. 1 wan't., however, to make
a statement in regard to Galifornia wbich
rnay he interestingc to members of this,
Chamber. In that state there are 11,113
miiles of cernent roads, and more are being
rapidly built. The internai traffie of the
state, both passenger and freight, is carried
on alrnost entirely by means of motor trucks.
The railroads have veiy littie to do in the
way of local operations in the state.
One great miseonception seems to exist
as to electricity and its development for the
use of the Canadian people. It will be
very many years before it can be used
efficiently and economically for transportation purposes. Electrical energy can be
successfully applied to cooking, and any
person wvho lias electricity available can
effect great saving in that respect. So far
as lieating is concerned, although there la a
general idea that electricity can be used
economnically for that purpose, and that
Canada wvili have nothilig to fear, even if
the coal supply becomies exhausted; that is
not the case. Electrical energy can neyer

On motion o! Hon. W. B. ROSS, the Senate went into Cammittee on Bill I, an Act
ta provide in Ontario and Prince Edward
Island for the 'Dissolution and Annulmnent
of Marriage. Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
(Sections 1 and 2 were agreed ta.
On section 3--short title:
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: Honourable gentlemen, I would not have spoken on this B;11
but that reference has been mnade ta the
one divorce granted on an applicati.'mr froni
Prince Edward Island. I would 1.1<e ta explain the circumstances. There wvi,:; in that
province a man who married when hie was

in poor circurnstances and was living on an
ordinary

farrn.

Later

hie

took

anather

woman ta live with hirn, and sent his wife
away. By this other warnan hie had seven
or eîght children. -He went inta business
and rnade a great deal of rnaoney, p1 obably
haîf a -million dollars. He built a splendid
place for himself and continued ta live
apenly in adultery with this wornan, ta the
knowledge of every anc in the province.
When hie made applicatian ta the Government, it was feit that this man wvas not
entitled ta a divorce fromi his wife. She
was not asking for it, but hie %vas.and the
Governrnent refused ta entertain the mnatter
or ta apen the court at ail. Under those
circurnstances hae applied ta the Senate,
and I arn tald that hie paid bis wife $1,000
nat ta appose his petitian for a Bill af
Divorce. If that man had applied ta the
Supreme Court af Prince Edward Island ha
wauld certainly nat have obtained a divorce;
but th.e Senate here was flot suppased ta
know the circurnstances, and a divorce was
granted him. I arn quite in sympathy wvith
the iBill as introduced by the honourable
gentleman irorn M1iddletan. I think that
the Supreme -Court of Prince Edward
Island is the proper place for matters of
this kind.

that it ref4ers to the la'w tha-t existed

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED mov'ed the

He said: Honourable gentlemen, lin deallit- with the resolution which came UI) iroru

I made such explanations as I considered
necessary and was able to mnake as to the
contents of this Treaty. 'This Bil1 is simpiy

0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

Hon. '-\r. BRADBURY moved:
That a Select Committee be appolnted to in-

(ujre into the cost of the Installation iu the
Tower of the Parliament Buildings a first class
cirillon ln connection with a dlock, the said
cornmlttee to be composed of the Honourable
Messrs. Boyer, Belcourt, Girroir. Michener, Foster amîd the ruover.

Honi. Mr.- POWER:

Explain.

Hon. 'Mr. BRADBURY: Honourable gentlemnen. I do not intend f0 take up the time
of the House. I spoke on a similar motion
a iew days ago. I feit it was in the interest
offOtta-wa, and in the interest of Canada as
a wliole, to place on the tower of the newv
Parliament Building' a carillon. 1 may sa,,
iliat since addressing this House on the
qluestion I hiave icarned that in Washington
thiere is a siihiar movement to-day. The
musical interests of Washington are takingtîme nmatter up. Not only are they urging
that a carillon shauld be piaced on the
buidigsinWashington, but they are sugusialmen o! the district

su,-ested. A carillon would certainir be a
delightful thing to have on these buildings.
There is no mnusic ever invented that is
equal to a carillon if properly played. Honourab]e gentlemen who have heard the carilions in the Low Countries will agree wvith
that staternent. There are over 100 carillons
scattered over Belgium and the Netherlands.
Any one who has ever listened to the belîs
of Bruges. Brussels, or other places would
say that it is the sweetest music that was
ever heard. There is no reason whv we
should flot have a first-class carillon on top
of this.great tower we are building. I know
there are certain -ciriticisms as to tihe cost. I
ar n ot prepared to state, honourable gentlemren, whiat the cost will be. I know that
previous to the war first-class carillons had
heen installed in different parts of Europe
for about $22,000, or £4,400. The cost would
doubtless be a good deal more at the present
time. But let us say it would cost $50.000.
That expenditure in connection with a
building that is costing $8,000,000 or $ 10,000,000 is a mere bagatelle, if it is what we want,
and I believe it is. The consensus of opinion in this great city and throughout the
country, wherever this matter bas been
given proper consideration, is that the placing of a carillon in the tower would be a
fitting finish to the building. However, 1
arn askîng for a committee for the purpose
of investigating the question, and I hope
that the committee ivill be appointed so that
it may be able to present an intelligent report to the House when it has secured the
necessary information.
Hon. '-%r. WAWfON: Is it the intention
to have chirnes that will strike every hour?
Hon. -'%r. BRADBURY: There wvill he.

lion. ý1r. BRADýBtUIZY: The striking of
the honîî need not he invthing nicrc- xlan
the striking of the c,oâk. A carillon is
played in two different ways. It is adjusted i-nechaiîically like a large music box.
and it can 'be mnade to strike every hour or
every haîf-hour, or every quarter of an
,hour, and to give a chirne, if desired. In
addition, it is fitted up so as to be plaved
as an ordinary pipe-organ. If "'e had a

mani trained and able to play the chimes
the music produced by a properlv attuiied
carillon would be superior to anything that
we have in Canada to-day.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mrn Webster) suggests that the musicians night go
on strike. There is danger of anybody going
on strike. Even the Senate may go on
strike sorne day.
Hon. Mr. DOIWVILÀLE: Are these 'belîs
to ring after Parliament bas prorogued?
WVhat is to be done with the belîs? WilI
they be taken away?
Hon. Mr. IWRADBURY: I would not like
to suggest that we take thern away.
'Hon. fMr. DOMVILLE : Are you going
to annoy the people of the whoie city of
Ottawa? Why, they are trying to stol) the

Hon. tMr. BfRALDBURY: I amn very sorry
that the honourable gentleman bas not a
little miore music in his soul.
Hon. Mr. DOMIVILLE: Oh, I hear plenty
of mnusic aIl the time. In the olden days
the bell was rung in the tower in order to
give warning of the a'pproach. of the enemy,
or to rouse the people in case of fire-to

the Canada Shipping Act (Certificates of

lHe said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is to modernize, so to speak, the Canada
Shipping Act, in respect to the issuance
of cerfificates to masters and mates. As 1
understand, under the Shipping Act of taday, a man cannot secure a certificate as
a master unless he wvas sailing previous
to 187d0, or as a mate unless ho was sailing
previous to 1883. This Bill providts that
he shall have been qualified during the ten
years provious to the present year. If furthormore makes provision for incieasing
the tonnage as at present provided undor

masters and mates to sailing vessels of 750

CRIMINAL

CODE (FRENCH VERSION)
-MENDMENT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. P. E. BLONDIN mioved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act to amend the
Criîninal Code (French Version).
He said: Honourable gentl4emren. notwithstanding its titie, this Bill dees not, makce
any amendnient to the Criminal Code. Its
abject is to correct certain errors, and in
some instances very important errors,
which have been made in the translation
froin the English version of the code to the
French version. The Parliamentary Counsel has prepared a new edition of the
volume containing the Criminal Code and
other selected statutes, putting in the
amnendments in their proper places. In preparing the French edition of this, it became necessary to compare the English
with the French, and it was discovered that
there were a large number of mistakes in
the translation of the Revised Statutes.
Some of them are of quite a serions character. For instance, the punishment would
be different in the Enghlish version froîn

APRIL 16, 1920
what if. would be in the first Frenchi version. In some places whole sentences xvere
lef t out. The Revised Statutes were tirst of
all prepared in English and were afterwards
t.ranslated into French by the late 'Mr. St.
Louis. It was a task w*hîch was really too
great for one man to undertake. Moreover.
there is no doubt that the Frenchi translation should have been prepared by the law
-translators of the House, who have a sufficient staff and are specially skilled in this
woîk. The present Bill is fo correct those
errors. By looking al the Bill honourable
gentlemen will see that there are a considerable number of aniendments. They
all relate only f0 the French version. If
this Bill is given the second reading, my
intention is to propose that a special committee of miembers from both sides o! the
House be fornied to examine each proposed
amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 would like f0 ask
the minister if it would not be advisable
for bim f0 amend the tîfle of thîs. It is not
proposed to amend the Criminal Code; we
intend onily to correct certain errors in
translation. The Criminal Code itself is not

this, that although you have very able
transiators on the bluebook, staff, the translation of law requires a nman who not only
thoroug-hly understands both languages,
but is a practised lawyer; because very
often it is necessary to deal with law that
has, neyer existed in France but cornes from
England, and there are expressions for
which you cannot find the equivalent in the
French dictionary.

Have you been

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: No. I do flot pretend to be a criminal lawyer, but I would

been using the Eng-lish version. WVhenever
they saw that there was an error in the
French version, tbey would use the English.

as inserted by section one of chapter twenty-slx
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

of the statutes of nineteen hundred and seventeen, the following as section 508e:
508e. (1) Every person who knowingly deals
in goods. wares or merchandise which are, In

(3) The provisions of this section shall not
apply ta dealings In any such goods, wares or

merchandise as are in Canada at the time of the
passlng of this Act.

Honourable gentlemen, this Bill was introduced at the Session before last, and
was passed unanimously by this House.
lIt failed to 'be taken up in the House oi
GCommons-I imagine, because there was
too muc.h business and îît was so near the
close of the Session. I arn reintroducing
îît, therefore, in the hope that it may bccorne law before, the close of lhe present
Session. The reason for which I introduced
this Bill I stated in parft *before. My first
xeason la that there are thousands and
thousaà,ds of persans in this country who,
like myself, have objections ta purchasîng
German-made goods, and who think that
they aTe entitled to, lcrow 'when Kthey enter
a shop whether oi not they rnay find
German goods there, in order that they
inay ibe on their guard and examine oiare,fully such goods as are presented to them
,for purchase and «nay not be, deceived. in
liaving German goods .passed off on .them.
These are perhaps personal -and sentimental
,reasons, buit they are the reasons which, in
part, animate me in advooating this Bill.
There are other reasons which I consider
,of the utmost importance. We know that
,those 'who were induced. to go volun-tarilv
into this great -war rwere told that it wa-s a
,war to end rwar. They rwere told by the
no-w Prime Minister af England and by, I
believe, his Foreign Secretary, Mr. Balfour,
and by Mr. Bonar Law, officially, that those
w'ho brought this terrible catastrophe upon
the world would suifer condign punishment
ilf we succeeded. After the war was over a
Treaty of Peace, combined with -what was
called the League of Nations, was negotiated
with the Blonde Beast. The British Empire
and ail her dependencies, with the offier
Allied and Asaciated Powers, entered
into that Treaty, and Germnany prom.
îsed. the,-performance of bher Treaty obligations. It 'was prov'ided in ithe Treaty that

the Emperor o! Germany and bis advisers,
who had Ïbeen guilty of crimes against civilization wore fo be brouglit to trial and,

The ink was hardly dry on the Treaty

up that fugitive, that hall -maniae, William,

The Allied Po-wers bowed down et once

if ever there were political fugitives.
The Dutch Gov'ernment gave them Up.
In ancient finies, when the man who

Republic, Hannibal, soughlt asylum in
an independent kîngdom, the Roman
Empire, which was no more powerful to
enforce its will than are the modern Allies,
Lad Hannibal .surrendered to if; and I have
n'i doubt that if one were te look into history
one would find many precedeints for the
demand. made by the Allies. Now the German Government has refused to hand over
the other, smaller fry, and if is common belief that no effort is f0 be made to conipel it
te do so. So one cf the grea.t principles
laid down, for which the people of the
.world 'fought, that those -who were guilty
of crine should be punisiied, and thareby
ail seekers affer war in the future ehould
ba taughf that if they broughlt on an unjust
war and failedl fhey would psy qfor it with

poiwers the world bas ever ten have abaïndoned that princîple.
1Hon. Mr. POWER: If the honourable
gentleman will permit me te interrupt him
for a -moment-perbapa hie would be good
enough to say whether legislation cM ihis

particular character bas been adopted in
England?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: 1 do not
know. 1 do flot know w'hat they have done
,in England. I 'was one of those who had
a high opinion of the sinoerity of the
Right Hon Mr. Lloyd George. 1 amn one of
those 'whose opinion bas had a terrible
fall. 1 think now that, as Canada is recognized as having an individuality. recognized as one of the parties to the Treaty,
recognized as more than a Imere dependency,
Nweshouid assert ourselves and do some.thing-that we should let even the smal
voice of Can.ada go across the world announcing .that we at lest believe that felon
nations should ba punisbed. For that reason
I bring forward thies Bill, so that other
nations may learni th-at if they cause an
unjugt war it ,will not be forgotten by those
against 'whom they warred--that they will
not enter into friendly commercial relations
with them immediately alter they have,
perhaps, stabbed their brother to death.
Some of the Allies have gone further and
given up one of the greatest and inost important and valuable rights of the people.
The Republic o! France saw the Germans
fiagrantly and publicly breaking one of the
provisions o! the Treaty concerning the
occupation by their troops o! à certain territory. Franoe proteeted, -and as -was hier
right, sent troops Into that territory to make
Germany keep lier word. The moment that
France acted in the way that I have mentioned without consultation with the others,
so far as we know, the Government of England reprobated France for trying to carry
eut and en-force the Treaty, abandoning the
righit of eaoh signatory of the Treaty te
alone insist on the performance of the
Treaty. Tt zeems te me tthat was the
most colossal blunder ,that any nation
could possibly make, because, if one
protested that
none of the
nation
oCher nations should act unless t.hey
were ail agreed, the British Empire would
have no Tight to enfc>rce any provisions of
that treaty unless Aie got the consent o!
France, Italy, and àIl the other powers engaged in it. To my mind fhat wvas a
most extraordinary attitude on the part of
the Government o! ýEngland, an attitude
which I think the British people would
flot endorse-publicly te reprobate that
great and magnificent ally. France, for lier
conduct. These actions convince me that
there will be nio effort made to compel
Germany to carry eut the Treaty; they convince mna that Germany's push or pull is as
mighty as it ever was.

212

SENATE

During the debate on this question last
session some one said that if we did flot give
Germany an opportunity to trade she could
not pay the indemnities. 1 do flot care
one snap of ýmy fingers whether Germany
ever pays a dollar of indemnity. So far
as we are concerned At will neyer do any
good, and Germany -will neyer pay it anyway, and will neyer be compelled to pay.
But if I thought that the passing of this
legislation would in any way discourage
trade with Germany in this country I would
be more insistent than ever. We must
regard this question as a very serjous one;
we must stand out to reprobate in every
way we can the conduct of the German
people.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: How long will this Bill
be in force?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-69TAUNTON: It wull remain in force il it passes, as I heartily hope
it wiIl, until this Parliament repeals it.
There are fine million mren in their
graves to-day because ýGermany sought
world power or destruction. Like Lucifer,
when he went in the face of the Almightyto rule heaven, or to go into the lowest depths,
to find still lower depths stili opening to receive him-the German people declared
that they would -have -world power or destruction. It was their election; and it is
not for us to lead them out of destruction.
They strove after the object which bas been
present in the Teutonic mind from the beginning- of recorded time. Century after
century the Teutons thundered at the gates
Of the Roman Empire until they brought it
down in ruin; until Oharleznagne was crowned in Rorne; until biis empire extended from
the North sea te the Adriatic. Their pinelibeck emperor dreamed that lie snight transcend the greatness of Charlemagne, and hie
set bis hand and the mind of his people
to the conquest of the world to bring down
the civilization of our time. And we say:
«'Oh, well, the war is over; wve will let bygones ibe bygones. The millions of mainîed
and -haît and blind and broken-hearted that
go up and down this world may look out
for themselves; 'we are only thinking of the
dollars that are in it for us." If the people
of the world allow this war to pass and
fade into bistory after having taken the
position that a new attitude towards unjust
wars should be adopted by mankind, then
for ail time men will know that there is no
sanction for .punishing those -wbo bring
themn on. We cannot do ht. We are but a
small people; we have net mucli voice in

should set a right example and tell the
world that we 'have not given sixty thousand lives and nearly ruined our country in
a war to end war, and are nov willing to
abandon all our high pretensions aud take
a ffew miserable marks as ýcompensation for
the wrong that has been done to u&.
Now, bonourable gentlemen, I purpose
preÉsing this Bill and asking that it be
passed, and that the *Government of this
country give to those wbo have suflered at
least the satisfaction of knowîng that -en
they go into the ehops of this country they
will not bave these accursed German wares
put upon them.
Hon. *Mr. McSWEENEY: I-f this Bill is
passed, I -would like to ask the honourable
gentleman how it -will be enforced. It will
*be impossible to enforce it, because England 'before the war sent goods to Germany
to be dyed, and tbey were dyed and returned to Bradford or London or Huddersfield, -where they -were sold and sent out
here. Witjhin the hast f ew months England has sohd millions of pounds' worth of
raw materials to Germany; the United
States is doing the samie; and even France
is selling goods to Germany. Look at t'hings
practicahly and forget aIl this high4ahutin
stuff about Charlemagne and Hannibal.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE-: Who are they?
Hon. Mr. 'MoSWEENEY: We bave to get
down to brass tacks, and if 've bhave any
goods to seli, and the Germans can pay for
them, it is oui business to seli to them. It
would be impossible to enforce legislation
of tdxis kind. 1 'have goods on my shelves,

do not want anybody to deceive me by
passing off German wares as honest goods.

APRIL 20, 1920
That is the point. Put up a sign and the
law will flot have to bie enforced. 1 presume that any merchant who bas sfich a
love for Gerrnany as to deal in Ge.rman
wares wiil flot object to put up a sign
stating that hie deals with the Kaiser's
subjects.
HonourHon. RAQUL. DANDURA.ND:
able gentlemen, I do flot know how any
country gould strictly apply such legislation as this. We have been informed that
a number of European countries are already
dealing with the Germans and exchanging
wares with them- A considerable quantity
o! gonds corne to this country'from the
British Isies, and I have no doubt that
through that channel will corne Gerrnan
wares that will not bear the words, "Made
in Germany." We know that only lately
Great Britain has sent ships across the
channel for the purpose of carrying 250,000
lbs. o! German dye-stuff s, with the understanding that they will be apportioned
arnong different countries; and J know that
some ,American and sorne Canadian manufacturers are very anxious to get their
share. If those dyes are used in Canadianmade goods, will the goods have to, bear
some indication that they are coloured with
German dyes? Any inspector o! the Federal
Governrnent would meet with sorne difficulty in supervising the application of this
law.
I sympathize with rny honourable friend
when hie says that it will be a bitter pill
for the Allies to, swallow to, shake hands
with the Germans and deal with thern as
if nothing had happened. lEvery one knows
that the German soul has not changed since
the llth o! November, 1918; that every Gerrnan feels rernorse, not because o! the declaration of war, but because o! the humiliation of defeat; that a large cornrittee has
been sitting- in the Reichstag inquiring, flot
into, the cause of the war, but into the cause
o! the defeat. They have examined generals
and statesmen to find out why the opportunity had flot been taken in 1916 to accept
the offer of the United States to arbitrate

is keeping her army in preparation for a
day of revenge. The militarists are stili
'watching for a chance to seize power and
organize for the day when they may go
back to the Rhine. 1 sympathize deeply
with *France in her present predicament.
We know that Great 'Britain, when the
Armistice was to be signed, required that
the German navy, which was a menace to
Great Britain, should bie brought to, a British port. We know also that another danger
to Great Britain was the air crafi, consisting of aeroplanes by the thousands, and
they were to be delivered up. But, to the
surprise of the world, although Bulgaria
had been required to, disarm on the day of
the Armistice, no such condition was found
in the Armistice of the Ilth day of Novernber, 1918, and the Gerinan troops returned
triurnphantly to Berlin with their arrns and
their guns, and to-day they are theie in
thousands.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Whose fault is that?
Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND: It is the fault
of the Allied Counicil of War, who did not
impose that condition.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Who had the task

forward to have its revenge sorne day and

As I said at the beg-inning, the sentiments expressed by my honourable friend.
are lofty, but it seems to me that they find
little application in the Bill. I regret that

may be obtained by tfiis Bill. If instead

in the world are free to deal with one another, -with enerny as well as wit.h ally,

is xny first point.
My second point is this. Is every merchant in the land to be exposed to the
accusation that hie is dealing knowingly in
German goods? How can a man know?

would vote for it witbout any hemitation;
but I arn sorry that I cannot see it in that
light.
Hon. GEO. W. FOWL.R : Honouralie
gentlemen, it is a sad and unfortunate. fact, but a fact nevertheless, that a
certain type of man, a certain type of
member of this flouse, cannot rise upon
bis feet and speak o! the British Empire
except in the most slurring ternis, in termis
of disrespect, and without making statements that are not supported by fact. My
honourable friend-my histrionic friend,
my actor !riend from thie district of Montreal (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)-is full of that
sort o! tbîng. I bave neyer heard him
make a speech in this flouse, in which the
British Empire bas 'been mentioned, but
that it bas ýbeen mentioned in terms of disrespect and dislike. The honourable gentleman may say that that is not so, but that
is my experience o! the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend allow me? Will hie cite one
occasion-one occasion?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Sit down, then.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What I have said
bas been stated by your ovin papers in my
province. But let the bonourable gentleman, instead of making a general remark,
cite just one occasion.
Hon. Mr. FOWVLER: The occasions are
so nuinerous I could scarcely pick out one.
Every member of this House knovis it to
be true. The same remark applies to the
honourable member from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but not quite to
sucli a degree as At does to my honourable
friend froin Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). It is strange that the honourable
gentleman, ça member of the legislature of
a sister nation in the British Empire, cannot speak in this Chamber wit*hout slurring Great Britain. I bave not the slightest objection to bis eulogizing what France
bas doue in this var. I say, ail honour
to France for vihat sbe bas doue in this
viar. But when the honourable gentleman
intimates that France bore the heaviest
burden in the war I throw that falsehood
back in bis teetb, and say that tbe beaviest
burden o! ail in the war was borne by the

SENATE
glorieus British Empire. It provided the
money. The honourable gentleman talks
about what France has done, in colnparison
with what has been done by England. The
very money that was used by France in
tnis war, or a very large proportion of it,"
was provided by England, and France is
to-day debtor to England for that money.
The conditions under which the Entente
was formed called upon England to perform a certain task if France were attacked.
Did England resist? Did she say that she
would only live up to the terms of that
agreement? No. But every man, and every
gun, and every dollar in Britain was at
the service of the Allies in this war. Talk
about -any country being bled white! England surely has been bled white in that regard. Not only bas she spent ber own
money, but she bas horrowed billions of
pounds from the United States, in order
to finance the war, wbereas if she had collected the amounts tbat she bas advanced
to ber debtor nations, sbe would not nave
had to borrow one dollar fro-m the United
States, and the rate of exchange to-day
would bave been different: tbe pound sterling would bave been wortb its face value
in the United States instead of being at a
considerable discount, by reason of the fact
that she advanced very large amounts of
money to her sister nations in Europe, engaged in tbe saine struggle as berself-to
Italy, to France, and to, Belgium. These
are the facts. My honourable friend forgets that these are the facts, when be juinps
at the opportunity to get a stab at the
country, the great country, that bore the
brunt of this war. If it bad not been for
tbe British navy the war would flot have
lasted three weeks, and everybody knows
it. To say that England bas done nothing.
wben she maintained that navy, whicb kept
secure the trade routes of the world in order
that this war might be fought out and that
the people of Europe might be supplied
with food! And the honourable gentleman
cannot speak unless he sneers at that great
country!
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I rise to a point
of order. I bave said nothing in my speech,
not one word, that could be interpreted as
being a sneer at the British Empire-flot
one word. I did criticise, and it was my
right to criticise, tbe conduct of Lloyd
George at that time. I think my honourable friend should bear that in mind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the honourable mnover said absolut-ely the saine thing.
Hon. Mr. FOW'LEIR.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Oh. yes, but there
are reasons wby.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is the honourable
gentleman going to, znake a speech or is he
risîng to, a point of order?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I arn Tising to a
point of order. If ten Englishmen and one
Frencbman were to rise in this House and
were to use the saine language as to the
conduct of Lloyd George, tbe one mian would
get all the reproaoh; and, Sir, tbat is wbat
you are doing: you are selecting *~at man.
Let me tell you one tbing, tbough, tbat it
will produce no result at ail. Se far as 1
am concerned, I bave notbing te Teproach
myself for, and I will not change my conduct, but will speak my mind wbenever I
think I sbould do so.
Hon. Mr. FOWiLER: You were speaking
your mind, but I do not think the workings
of your iind are of sucb importance as to
make any difference to anybody, ne matter
how you speak it.
My bonouTable friend reierred to the
conduct of Lloyd George only since tbe war.
Let me say to bim, and I have pleasure in
saying it, that if there is any one ffan to,
whom the winning of the war is due, it is
thiat great mnan Lloyd George-the greatest
man in the world to-day, the man Who took
bold of matters wben the situation on the
continent was nearly desperate. I was over
there at the time, and knoow somethingwhereof I speak. He is a man of dynamic
energ&y, of wonderful power, The moment he
assumed the helm of state one could see the
difference in the feeling of the people, the
difference in the response o! the people, the
difference in the army, the difference in
every way-Lloyd George, the man whoni

But, further, what is the policy of the
British Government in Europe? They do

'Hon, W. H. THORNE: I want to state

I have been in trade and merchandise al
my if e. The object of the promoter of this
Bill is no doubt to prevent the consumption of German goods in Canada. W-ill it
have that effeet? Sentiment will not prevent the consumaption of -German goods.
In a few years the sentiment created b.y
the war, the feelings opposed to the use and
importation of -German goods, 'will die out.
Hon.

Mr. DOMVILLE:

Ail the worse.

Hon. Mr. THORNE: It is proposed to
penalize any one who may buy these German goods; but I noticed that immediately
alter the armistice was signed the British
merchants were reaching out to trade with
Germany, and xvere re-creating the business
they had lost during the war, althoughi the
sentiment is probably as strong in England
as it is in this country. My feelings in regard to the war and its resuits are very
strong against the Germans, but as a iierchant I realize thaât that sentiment will
soon die out, and that if people can buy a
jack-knife made in Germany that suits them
better and is cheaper, they will buy it. If
the objeet is to prevent the consuniption of
Germail goods, I would suggest raising our
tariff barriers or prohibiting the importation of German goods. If this Bill is passed
the resuit will simply be that rnany Canadians, backed by Germans who are strong
commercial -men with strong commercial
sense will find that there will be sale
throughout this country for their goods if
they can be placed here cheaper than the
American or British. They will open up
bouses of their own, ivili put advertisements
in the papers offering German goods for
sale, and will put signs over their business
places announcing "German goods dealt in
here." I know enoughl about trade in this

219

country to know that in nine cases out o!
ten people throughout the country districts
will not hesitate, as soon as stable government is established on the other side of
the water, to buy German goods if they are
a littie cheaper and as good as they can
buy from the Mother Country or the United
States.

He said: -Honourable gentlemen, in movîng the second reading of this Bill, I do not
propose to make any extended remarks.
The Bill is unlike the Bill that was before
the House the other day, which was entirely concerned with giving jurisdiction to
the Superior Court o! Ontario and the Superior Court o! Prince Edward Island in
the matter o! divorce, and giving those two

provinces the English lav as it the 15th July, h870-merely a transfer o!
jurisdiction from tbis House to those
courts. The present Bihl is a different
thing, and will apply to ail the Divorce
Courts in Canada, and it contains a number o! provisions which will make the law
a hittie more uniform than it would be
without this Bill.
In the first section, for greater security,
I intend to insert in the third line, witb
the consent o! the committee, the words.
"The province o! Quebec alone exceptedThat leaves

the Bill to apply to ail courts in Canada
having jurisdiction as to divorce.
The second section deals with a matter
of Ibis kind. A wî!e may be petitioned
against by ber busband for a divorce on
ground o! adultery, and on the trial of the
cause it may transpire tbat sbe was innocent and that he was guilty. _In England
there is a statutory provision that in sucb
case the husband's petition would be dismissed, but tbe wife wouid be entitled to
a divorce against ber husband. That is s

SENATE
gUood law, because it rnakes men careful,
and tends Vo prevent nien froin bringing
actions for divorce unless they are prepared to stand examination and cross-examination as to their own conduct.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 understand the
law of England requires that, but I do flot
,quite see the necessity for this section.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: There is no necessity
for iV as far as Manitoba, Aliberta, and Sasini
katchewan are conoerned, but there W5
fregard to British Columbia, Nova Scotia,
and New Brunswick, because they bhave not
suoh a provision, while the other provinces,
which, have the British law a& of the 15th
July, 1870, have t.bat provision. The honourable gentleman is quite right in sVating Vhat
there is no statute in the case of those provinces, but I want ail the provinces put
on the saine footing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: .How is it that
the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia have noV the English law as well as
other provinces?
Because they have
Hon. Mr. ROSS:
special laws of their own. Prior to Confederation they passed a divorce law wbich is
stili on their books.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They adopted
the English law with modifications.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No. The legislature of
Nova Scotia adopted the Scotch law, a very
wide divorce law, and later on, a few years
before Confederation, they narrowed it
down. For instance, the Scotch law grants
divorce for desertion for five years; but
that was cut out, and it is limited now to
one charge, that o! adultery.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: 1V is similar to
the others, then, because the sole ground
is adultery?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Adultery; b*utthey have
not this particular provision of the British
law.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: So this Bill is not
necessary Vo Bill I?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No, Bill I stands by itself. This present Bill will produce uniformity in ail the courts, Vo a certain extent.

Hon. Mr. BRELOOURT: This is merely

courts?
The
Hon. Mr. ROeS: Yes, that is it.
principle of section 3 is the saine as that
of section 2. In British Columbia, and ahl
those other provinces that adopted the English law, a husband is entitled to a divorce
on the ground of adultery alone, but -the
wife bas to prove adultery plus desertion
or cruelty, etc. There is a good deal of
complaînt on the part of women of the
country, and I sympathise with tbem in
their view, that the law should be made
the saine for both.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is that the law
in EnglandP
Hon. (Mr. ROISS: Yes, but this wiIl put
the wife and the husband on the samne
footing. . Under section 3 the wife can geV
a divorce on the ground of adultery alone.
-Hon. Mr. DAVID: Bill I says that the
Englisb law will apply; then the two Bills
are distinct?
Hon. Mr. RiOffl: 1 know, but this follows
the other Bill. It would repeal the law of
England that f ar, as applied to us.
Section 4 contains what I regard as an
important and very juat provision regarding
domicile. Every one knows that it is a
rule of English common law that the wife's
domicile is the domicile of the husband,
and the jurisdiction of the court granting
the divorce is settled by the question of
domicile. If a wife is deserted by lier husband in one of the provinces, and lie moves
elsewhere, it is a great hardship Vo the wife
Vo be compelled to find ont where he bas
moved Vo, and chase hiim and file licr petition in that province, or in a foreign country, as the case may be. Hence section 4
provides that a wife wbo is entitled Vo
divorce on the ground of adultery may have
a domicile of bier own. For instance, I
saw a case o! this kind in Nova Scotia. A
woman applied for a divorce, ber hiusband
baving left bier and gone Vo Western Ontario and settled there. The judge in the
divorce court in Nova Scotia disrnissed Vbe
petition on the ground that bier domicile
ywas the domicile o! bier husband, and therefore she would have Vo corne up Vo Western
Ontario. 0f course, it is an implication
o! the common law tbat wben a woman
marries a inan sbe intends Vo live with Ihi;

APRIL 20, 1920
but there is also this pretty strong implication, that wben a man marries hie undertakes to take care of hier and make bier his
helpmate and companion. For that reason
I think it is very fair that where a wife
has been deserted by the husband and is
applying for divorce she should have a
domicile as if she were a femme sole, and
flot be subject to this common law rule
that the domicile of the husband should
govern. J may say that this is the law in
New South Wales, and aithough there was
some objection to it at first by the Imperiai
Parliament, the contention about it was
abandoned after some few years, and the
married woman there has the relief as given
under this section 4. I attach more value
ta this than to almost any other section in
the Bill, and I, may say it was put in as
resuit of questions I was asked in reference to another Bill that was withdrawn.
But f refused to have anything to do with
it unless this clause went into it, because I
have seen a great deal of hardship of that
kind. 1 saw here one case in particular, one
of the hardest cases that 1 have ever seen
before the divorce courts. A very fine young
English woman who was married in England
was brought out here by her husband, and
two weeks after her arrivai he deserted ber.
It turned out that he had been in this country for about a year. He was engaged ta this
girl before hie lef t England. He got entangled witb another woman here, and, instea.d af breaking off bis engagement in
England and rnarrying ber, the dirty coward
went back to England and married that
beautiful wornan, and he braught lier out
to this country. He ran away two weeks
after bringing ber to the city of Toronto,
and left ber stranded here. She would not
go home-she said she could not and would
not; she wan-ted to stay here; ahe wanted ta
get a divorce and get into somne position in
this country and earn a living. The Parliainent dl Canada bas not beén tramelled
with regard to this question of domicile as a
court would be, and it is, in my opinion,
absolutely necessary and highly meritoriaus
ta give a wife who bas been deserted, as that
one was, a separate domicile, so that she
may not have ta go chasing after ber bunsband, witbout knowing exactiy where bie is.
In tbe case I bave mentioned, alter the busband lef t the city of Toronto, there was
hardly any trace of him.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Does my honourable
friend .think tbat it would be well ta add ta
section 3 the words, "or in the law of 'England," so that the section would read: "Not-

221

withst-anding anything ta the contrary in the
law of any province, or in the law of England.. .....
Does not the honourable gentlemnan think it would be better ta make that
reference to the English law?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I am trying now only
ta explain tbe principle of tbe Bill, which
will be taken up in committee section by
section. I hope honourable gentlemen understand tbat tbe fullest crîticism of every section is invited, for I would be sorry if.the
Bill were ta pass in any other way, witbout being carefuily examined, clause by
clause, line by line and word by word That
is what I think ougbt ta be done with any
divorce legisiation brougbt here.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will the honourable gentleman allow me a question, which
arises out of the subject be is now discussing. My bonourable friend bas no doubt
looked up the laws of the variaus provinces
in regard ta domicile. Let us suppose the
case af a woman, in Nova Scotia wbo bas
obtained a divorce from saine court in one of
the otber provinces or in a foreign country.
This question of domicile bas a very wide
application, and the question arises in my
mmnd, just what recognition wauid be given
by tbe court of Nova Scotia ta the divorce
obtained in a court of one of the other
Canadian provinces, or in one of the states
of the American Union, for instance. How
wouid that work out?
Han. W. B. ROSS: If the divorce was not
granted by tbe court in the place wbere the
woman was domiciled, the court of Nova
Scotia would not recognize it at ail. The
test of wbether a former divorce is o! any
value or not rests on this question of domicile.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Take the case cited
by the honourable gentleman, that of a woman in the country for three months. Would
that be a sufficient period ta give bier a
domicile in the province o! Ontario?
Han. W. B. ROSS: It is ail a question of
fact that cames before the judge. If she
can show the judge that she bas made ber
home in Ontario, that is sufficient. It is
not a question of wbether she bas been here
tbree months or six montbs. As the Englisb coi.frts ay, a persan may not be domiciled even after twenty years' residence. It
ia necessary ta convince the court tbat vou
bave abandoned your old home and aoquired
a new borne. It is in every case a question
of f act.
Clause 5 is a clause that makes. the bunsband or the wif e a competent and compell-

able witness. The purpose of this provision
is te brin- about uniforinity. The wife or
the hiusband can give evidence in Nova
Scotia. I do nlot know what the law is in
New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is« a clause
which requires a great deal o! consideration.
WVhile the husband and the wif e might be
asked to give evîdence, and be competent
witnesses, it would strike, me as being inadvisable to compel them te testify.
Hon. W. B. ROSS - That point can be
taken up when the Bill is discussed in detail in committee.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Very well, 1 would
like to discuss it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Then under section
6, the co-respondent is flot a party to a divorce suit.
Section 7 provides for a decree nisi. We
had some discussion on that the other day.
I regard that as an important section. It
is a mîstake to grant an absolute divorce in
the first instance; the divorce should be revokable for a least three months. I arn not
sure that six months miguht, not be better.
Experience in Eng-land shows that there are
a great rnany cases reopened during the
six months in which the decree is a nisi
decree.
As to section 8, rest-ricting the publication
of the reports of divorce suits, I do flot
think there will be any difference of opinion.
Section 9 relates to alimony. I have my
doubts about that section, as te whether the
jurisdiction belongs to this Parliament or te
the provincial legfislature; but I thought it
better to put it iii here, and il the provinces have any doubt about the matter they
can act under their owvn alimony laws. Some
e! the provinces have local statutes now.
But this is one of the questions on which
1 have neyer been able to nr)ake up my
mind, and I have not been able te find anybody who can tell me wvho has the right te
deal with the question of alimony, which is
closely related with the question of divorce.
Section 10 deals with appeals; and I intend te move in committee another clause at
the end, giving courts power te make rules
of practice. I forgot about that, but it can
-be done in committee.
This, honourable gentlemen, is just a
short statement wîth regard to the Bill.
You will see that there is in it nothing radical, and I thînk it would produce considerable uniformity in the divorce courts without making any substantial change in the
law of divorce. In fact, it would not at al

events, 1 think that ail divorce legaisiation
is of great importance and 1 invite the attention and the fullest criticismn of tbis lionourable House on every section of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It seeins to mie,
-from a reading of section 3, that it applies
to ail the provinces:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Iaw of any province. adultery by the husband shall In ltself be sufficlent cause for the
dissolution of a mnarriage.
My honourable friend, I know, has in
mind the establishment of uniform legislstien and procedure in those provinces in
which divorce can be granted, but it looks
from the reading o! that clause as if it applied to the one province which he lef t out
of Bill I.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable gentleman 'will find that section 1 will .read
in this -way:
in this Act, unlesa the context otherwise requires. "court" means the superlor court havlng jurlsdictlon withln a province, the province
of Quebec excepted.
I proposed to insert those words. But if
there ia any doubt on this point-there
ehould not be the elightest-I can deal with
the question in another way. Instead of
those 'words, "the province of Quebec excep4ted," being inse-rted in section 1, there
could be inserted at the end a clause to this
effect: "This Act shal nlot ap'ply to tihe
province of Quebec."
Hon. -Mr. DANDURAND: That will be
satisfactory.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That would. perhaps be a neater wvay of putting it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why do you cive
the wîfe a separate domicile? Is it se that
she may bring an action in any province
where £she happene to be?
H1on. W. B. ROSS- Certainly; instead of
her having to chase the husband. The husband has his domicile, and if hie wishes to
institute divorce proceedîngs he may do
so 'where he is. This gives the wîfe her
domicile and she brings her action *where
shie is domiciled, instead of chasing her
husband ail over 'the earth.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL- There is one question on 'wh'ich. I amn not clear, and it is this.
It is prorposed by tbis Bill to provide -that
aIl the superior courts in the various pro-

APRIL 20, 1920
vinces shall have authority to grant
divorces. What I would like to know is
what are the causes for which those courts
may grant divorce? I do lot see any ai those
causes stated in this Bill. In what, Act.
or under what legisiation or jurisdiction,
can the courts grant divorce, and for what
reasans? The anly reason that ia nientioned
at ail here is adultery, and tfhat is mentioned only by the way. There are no
causes put down here as statutory causes
for wiceh di-vorce can be granted, and I
wou'Id like ta learn froin the honourable
gentleman <Hon. W. B. Rosas) where those
causes are ta be found, if they are flot in
this BihP

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I may say, honourable gentlemen, wîth regard ta those causes
that they are con'tai.ned in the statute,
which will be found in volume 3 of the Revised Statutes of Canada. For the province
ai New Brunswick, they are found in the
statutes ai that province-the volume af
1886. With regard ta ail the other provinces,
they -are ta ibe found in the Enghish law.
In connection with divorce, the grounds
are stated seriatim.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Then there will be
different grounds in different provinces.
Ron. W. B. ROSS: The grounds in Bri-tish Columrbia and aIl the Western Provinces,
and in Ontario and Prince Ediward Island,
will be a little 'wider than those in Nova
Scotia, and a littie different from those in
New Brunswick. It is not desired ta interfere with Quebec at ahl, or with the other
provinces any more than we can help. If
Nova &cotia desired ta have a change made
regarding the -rounds for divorce, I have
no doubt this Parliament would put Nova
Scotia on the saine footing in that respect
as the other provinces; and the sanie applies ta New Brunswick. There is na difficulty at ail, however, in ascertaining what
are the grounds ai divorce, for they are
statutory.
Hon. THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable
gentlemen, in opening my few remarks on
this Bill, I must state that they shahl be
somewhat different from those 1 would have
feit bound ta make on the Bill formerly
introduced by the honourable member from
Victoria (Han. Mr. Barnard). That other
Bill had a wîder scolpe. -One afi ts obviaus
consequences would. have been ta break into
the civil law ai a great Canadian province,
ta deiy one ai lier main relîgious and legal
principles, ta upset a very important part
ai bier civil code, ta put hier judiciary in

2r3

the inost painful and dangerous position,
in a word to create a situation pregnant
with trouble, i]l-feeling, friction and endless
dissension. Clauses 2 and 3 of that Bill
airned at inaking divorce lawful within the
province of Quebec, at introducing the
principle of divorce in the cammon law of
that province, contrary to this fundamental
enactmrent of ber Civil Code:
185. M(arriage can be dissolved only fby the
natural death of one et the parties. During
their lifetime It la indissoluble.
That clause is the embodiment af a doctrine held as unassailable by our forefathers, and juridically asserted -by our old
French larws, which are a rfnost important
part of these "civil rights" guaranteed by
the Quebec Act of 1774.
It was neyer intended to invest the Federal Parliament with the power of subverting that doctrine, and of giving an adverse
meaning to the words '"Marriage and divorce," introduced in clause "91" of the
British North America Act.
To support
that contention, allow me to make a brief
quotation from the "Debates on Coniederation."
The Solicitor General of Canada
made the following declaration in the naine
of the Government, on the 21st Fehruary,
1865:
Let us now examine the question of divorce.
We do not intend either to establish or to recognize a new right. we do flot mean ta admit a
thing to which we have constantly refused to
assent. But at the conference the question arase
which legisiature should exercise the different

powers which aiready exist In the constitutions

of the different provinces. Now, among those
powers which have been already and frequently
exercised de facto Is this of divorce. As a

member of the conference, without admitting or

creating any siew right in this behaif, and while
declaring, as I now do, that as Catholics we
acknowledge noa power of divorce, I found that
we were ta decide in what legislative body the
authority should be iadged which we found in
aur constitutions. After mature consideratian,
we resoIved ta leave it ta the central legisiature, thinking thereby to Increase the difficulties of a procedure which Is at present so easy.
....We found this power existlng In the
constitutions of the different provinces, and flot
being abule ta, Cet rid of 11, we wished ta banish
It as far f rom us as possible. (Debates on Confederation, 1865, p. 389.)

This important and authorized declaration gave the true nieaning af clause 91 of

into consideration; I ain sure the honour-

able members of this -House, caming fromn
our sîster provinces, would have expected ta
see their colleagues af the province ai Quebec join issue on that point, and make a
strenuous effort to resist the intended invasion. Fortunately, we have been spared
I must
that unwelcome necessity. .And

SENATE
pay my most sincere tribute to the noble
and wise inspiration which has led to the
withdrawal of the Bill previously introduced.
But we have got now to deal with a new
Bill. And though it does in no way challenge our convictions and feelings, as far
as we represent specially the province of
Quebec, it involves a general principle that
for my part, as a Canadian legisiator, 1
cannot see submitted to Parliament wjthout raising my humble voice against it.
What is the object of this Bill?
Undoulbtedly it is to facilitate divorce.
Last
year, when a Bill of the saine nature ivas
introducerd into this Parliament it was
stated very frankly and very plainly that
"in the interests of tliis country soxnething
should be done to facilitate divorce." This
quotation is taken from the Debates of hast
cession, page 3772. To facilitate divorce is
then the avowed and admitted object o! the
present Bill. And, should it become law,
we all know that its airn would be attained.
If, departing froin the present regime of
restriction and o! special and exceptional
jurisdiction, you should enact that, in
eight of the nîne Canadian provinces, there
shall be courts vested with the power o!
gra.nting divorce, you would surely take
the best means of dissernînating divorce,
o! encouraging it, of laying the temptation
at the door o! every citizen of this country.
That cannot be denied. Should reasoning
fail to prove tihat proposition, experience
wou.ld corne to the rescue.
The honourable inenbers o! this House
know what took place in England. Until
1857 iimmemorially there was no such thing
as legal divorce in the United Kingdom.
No better proof can be given in support of
that assertion than the following statement
of Blackstone, the great .English jurist. He
writes in bis celebrated "Commentaries":
The canon law, which the common law foiIowa in the case, deems so highly, with such
niysterlous reverence. of the nuptial tie. that it
will flot allow it to be unloosed for any cause
whatsoever that arlseth atter the union Ismiade.
And this ls built expressly upon the revealed
law. With us, in England, adultery Is a causa
oniy for separation froin bed and board; for
which the best reason that can be given is, that
if divorce were allowed to depend upon a matter within the power of either of the parties,
they would probabiy be extrernely trequent.

That quotation is surely decisive; it cannot be controverted that, before the legislation adopted in 1857, legally the marriage
tie was indissoluble in England. But froin
the middle o! the seventeenth century the
practice was introduced in Parliamnent to
grant divorces-to pass Bills of relief, as
[Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.]

they were -styled. This regirne of privileged
divorce, by way o! special legisiation, lasted
for about two centuries. Then towards 1850
a campaign was launiched to abolish parliamentary and organize judiciary divorce.
A commission was appointed to study the
question, and, atter two or three vain attempts, a law was passed in 1857 te give
divorce a legal statua in England and to
create a Court o! Divorce and matrimonial
causes. With that piece o! legisiation,
divorce became part o! the common law.
What was the result? A renowned hisLorian, Mr. Justin MeCarthy, will give us
the answer. We read in his "History o!
Our Own Tirnes":
The Divorce Act, judging by the public use
made of it. certainly mnust be held te have justified itself In a merely practical sense. It seerns
to have been thoroughiy appreciated by a gratefui public. It was not easy after a while te get
judicial power enough to keep the supply of
divorces up to the ever .increasing deniand. <A
History of Our Own Tuimes, vol. III, p. 27).

The following figures fully support that
statement. During the first thirty years
after the passage o! the Divorce Act o!
1857, 6,381 decrees absolute for dissolution
o! the marriage tie were granted in the
English Court, while during the preceding
t'Io hundred years 317 only had been granted by Acts o! Parliament. (Gemmili,
"Parliamentary Divorce," 1889, p. 258).
A few more figures wi]l not be here out of
place. In the United States divorce -is
granted hy the States Courts. In Canada
until lately, for five provinces out o! nine,
it was granted only by Act o! Parliament.
Statistics compiled for a period o! twenty
years show that during that time, froin
1867 to 1886 the American courts had
grant-ed 328,716 divorces (The Encyclopoedia of Social Reform, Bliss and Binder,
New York and London, 1908, p. 397), while
in Canada the total number o! divorces
granted had been only 116. "The ratio, of
divorce to population in Canada, on the
basis o! the census of 1881, for the above
period, was 1 to 37,983 -versons, while in the
United States, on the basis o! the census o!
1880, for the saine period, the ratio was 1
to 150 persons.(GemTnill, p. xxii.)
Let us now make a comparison between
the regime o! divorce granted by courts in
our own country and the regfine o! divorce
enacted by way o! special legislation. Statistics compiled. for 'the first twenty years o!
Confederation show that the number o!
divorces granted by Parliainent during that
period, for the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, where there were no divorce courts,
was only 26, rwbile in the provinces of Norva

225

Scolia. iNer'w Brunswick, an'd British Columibia, where sucli courts wvere iii existence, the numnber of judiciary divorces was

of the census taken in 1881 was for Quebec 1 to 194,146, for Ontario 1 te 101,222, for
Nova Scotia i to 8,472, for New Brunswick
1 to 7,648, for British Columbia 1 to 3,297.
The disproportion can be seen at a glance.
A similar result is obtained if you compare
figures for a later period. During- the last
session of this Parliament the following
statisfics were put before the House of
Commons. From 1906 tô 1918-thirteen
years-the number of divorces granted by
way of legisiation for the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Manitoba was 244. For the sanie period the
number of divorces granted by the courts
in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and British Columbia was 380. The population of
the former wvas 5,849,215 and the population
of the latter was 1,236,707. Therefore the
ratio te populo' ion for the first five provinces was 1 te 23,992 wvhiie it wvas for the
three iast i to 3,254.

Our present system of easy divorce is ln some
respects less moral than the systemn of polygamy. Under the system of polygamy a man
remains in responsible relation witb the wives
whom be marries. Easy divorce allows any
number of successive wives or husbands te cast
loose upon society, with cessation of aIl mutual
responsibility as soon as the divorce is secured.
From my own ministerial and pastoral experlence, I amn coflvinced that If the divorce courts
were abollshed, the overwhelming majority of
those whe now seek divorces would find It possible to live together with reasonable contentment and that many ef them would find the
tull happiness and reward of faithful married

It was from such cogent motives than one
of the greatest public men of England in the
lait century, Mr. Gladstone, made a desp.erate fight against the ill-advised Divorce
Act of 1857. His biographer, the Rt. Hon.
John Morley, tells us that he took the floor
twenty-two tirnes during that memorable
debate which, through the different phases
of the measure, lasted eighteen days. Let me
iquote a few passages of the powerful speech
delivered by him on the l3th of July, 1857.
1 may be mistaken, but it seems to me that
they ad'mirably fit the present debate. Mr.
Gladstone said:
Wbat is mny honeurable triend going to do?
He ia gebng te give you a law under which
divorce is to be made accessible to ail classes of the community. leaflot that a new law?...
The fact of .the occurrence every year ot one or

the mass et the British people than If no divorce
Bill had ever passed. I arn mest anxieus, Sir, te

thus stated what was the purpese et the Bill
and what weuld be Its natural outcerne. Mr.
Gladstone went on te point eut Its logical and
fatal consequencea. He said: "AIl Englishmen
-and aIl EnglisbwomTe-all Irishmen and al

quoting his w.,rn words) that it would be
much better to retain ail existing inconvenlerices than to make divorce so easily obtained. To do that 'would be to hold out- a
temptation to adultery."; CHansard's Parliamentary Debates, 2nd series, vol. 24, p.
1287.)
In 1857 !Mr. Gladstone had flot yet atthat immense prestige which
tained
crowned his older years. HEe was defeated
in that great parliamentary battie. But
eighteen years later, Sir John Macdonald,
Prime Minister of Canada, declared in the
Canadian House of Commons that in bis
mind, "amongst the moral triumphs which
Mr. Gladstone had achieved, there was none
so great as his defeat when he protested
agaînst the establishment of a divorce court
in England." (Debates of the House of
Cenmonts, 1875, p. 859.)
Sir John Macdonald made that declaratien in 1875. Later on, in 1888, when a
prominent member of our House of Cornmons was urging that steps should be taken
to remove from Parliament the duty cf
granting divorce, Sir John made another
statement on the same subject. He said
he was opposed te a divorce court, because
if one were established the number cf ap-.
plications would greatly increase. That had
been the experience cf England, and cf
those who once strongly opposed the establishme.nt of the divorce court and the
transfer cf the trial cf divorces from the
legisiature te the court, very many had
seriously repented their advocacy cf the
measure, because the number cf divorces,
the corruption cf society . . were increasing
te the annually increasing degradation cf
the public mmnd. He preferred our systeni
which offers very considerable impediments
te the granting cf divorces, to the systems
-hiech prlevqail else'where. (D-ebates of the
House cf Confinons, 1888, vol. 2, p. 1414.)
This* was a settled opinion in the mind
of Sir John Macdonald. We find the following lines in the interesting «"Mernoirs"
of .Mr. Pope on the departed leader.
Speaking one day on this subject (the Senate's jurlsdiction ln the matter of divorce), Sir

John observed that the late Lord Westbury had
toid hlm that, when hie eat in the Hanse of
Commons. hie had rather a stlff encounter wlth
Mr. Gladstone cn the establishment of a divorce
court in Engiand, against whlch Mr. Gladstone
took strong grounds. "And Gladstone was right,
toc," observed Sir John, "fer of thi I arn convinced, that the establishment ef the divorce
court ln Engiand bas been productive of much
mischief. In former times, the procedure wlth
respect te divorce was the samne as ln force ln
Canada to-day-that Is, It couid oniy be ob-

tained fram the Upper Hanse of Parliament. In
those days divorces were rare, expensive. and
bard ta get, and the marais cf the community
were spared the coiumns of scandai with whlch
the English papers are occasionaiiy filled. The
oniy objection was on the ground cf expense. It
was urged that divorce was a iuxury, accessible
aniy ta the rich. The establishment of the divorce court ln Canada wauid mean cheap and
easy divorces, which wauld iead ta great laxIty in the marriage relations. . . . They are
beginning te see that ln the aid country. I hope
It may be long befere we have anything of the
kind in Canada." (Memolrs of the Rt. Honeurabie Sir John Alexander Macdonald, by Joseph
Pope, Vol. Il, page 235.1

and decisive part in the framing cf cur

aise the opinion of another eminent Canadian political man and jurist. Speaking
in the same strain as Sir John Macdonald,
the Henourable Mr. Mulock, later on Minister cf the Crown and now Sir William
Muleck, Chief Justice cf the Exdhequer
division cf tlhe Suprenie Court cf Outarde,
made this declawat-on:
I think the faciiity wlth which divorces are
grantedl ln England sud in other countries dees
go a long way ta Interfere with the sacredness
of the marriage tie. . . There la ne reasen that
justifies, In xny opinion, the establishment of
a divorce court for the province of Ontario. Divorce courts do exist ln certain other cf the
provinces. If It Is seught te harmonize logislation, that may be a reasan fer ail. these casep
being breught before Parliament. but It does net
supply a reasc-n for adapting the suggestion
made by my honourabie friend for Queen's.
<Debates of the Hause of Commans, 1888, vol.
iL. page 1416.)

these po'werful arguments against the dissemrinatien cf divorce, which would be se
detrirnental to, t.he moe'als of our people,

character; hie should bave a fair and open
niind; bie should ho a man wbo entertains
a respect !or ail the institutions of the
country. He sbould have a respect for tbe
very position which lie holds. In the great
rnajority of cases our judges fuifil the conditions and qualifications tbat I bave laid
down. I bave had an experience o! tbirty
odd years in the courts of one of the provinces o! this country, and, speakîng of that
province, I may say that almost every man
whom I bave known on the bench bas had
the qualifications which I bave laid down
as -beina necessary for a good. judge; and I
believe the saine is true o! the rest of Canada.« But tbere are mnen who, by sorne
stupid blunder on the part o! an unwiso executive, have been elevated to
tbe bencb of this country and. who
are unfit to wear the judge's robes;
who' forgetful of their own dignity and the
dignitv of the bench to which they belong,
have laid aside the robe*of the king's judge
and have cssunmied instead the cap and belîs
o! the kin .g's fool; 'as Shakespeare says, in
order to tickle the ears of the groundlings,
in order to win the cheap applause o! the
hangers-on of the courts, that guttersnipe
type whom puerile curiosîty 'brings to tbe
courts to listen to the cases being tried; 1
say judges have been known -who, for the
sake o! -winning the applause o! that type
o! -men,
have indulged in ribald oriticism
rog.a-rding this institution and regarding individual inenîbers o! this institution. Sncb
mien aire elevated to the benchi, not by
reason of the possession of brains or by
reason o! having- an intimiate knowledgýe
of the law, but sometimes for racial or religions reasons. I amn glad to kiiow that 'the
inembers of the courts of this country are
in the -main such nien as litic-ants in divorce
cases miay sa!ely trust thieir future to; and
I may say, wbile I amrn ot in favour of indiscrimiincte divorce, I arn in favour of
striking the shackles frorn the slave, and
of giving persons who have been led into
an un!ortunate inarriage an opportunity ta
achieve in a second niarriage the happiiiess which tbey may have rnissed in the

iâterest in divorce cases, because 1 have
been desirous of seeing that ne divorces
were granted by this Chiamber that should

conimittee inquiring into those divorce
deal
cases are entitied to a great
o! thanks fromn this House and frorn
the country for the very able manner
in which they have deait with thein. I
know o! only two cases coming before tbis
Chamber, or before Parliament, on wvhich
a division was taken. In both cases I voted
against the divorce. One wvas afterwards
tFirown out in the Cornmons. The otiier, I
arn sorry to say. xvas net thrown out; that
wvas the Eastcott case. You wiil reineinber
we divided on that case. That was one of
the occasions on wbich I feit that the granting o! the divorce was not as fair as it shouid

doubt there -was a very strong c:xnv.a>s
ma de on thiat occasion. Moreover, I saw
a numlier o! bonourable gentlemen leave
the Chamber w"hîen the vote was about te
be takeri. I was disappointed at that divorce being granted.
However, iA is said that this is a rich
man's court. Now, rny experience in watching and examining th_ý different cases bas

One reasen why I feel opposed te this

plenty of funds, the coinmittea sometimies
refunds a portion of the $200; but I notice

lion. Mr. CRiOSBY.

That is one tliinz
that may perhaps have a tcndency te deter
persons freiii seeking divorce. 1 have reason to believe that, becauso rnost of thie
cases that corne befoie the Sonate Coinîittee are cases of persons tlio are already practically divorced, by virtue of the
fact that they are living apart. Eitber the
wif e has le! t the husband and gone to live
with soniebody else, or -the husband has
le! t the wife and gone to live with another,
and usually rnontlis have elapsed before
the divorce application is made. That indicates to me, honourable gentlemen, that
there are rnany persons ilho are living together, althougb they are flot getting along
,well, and who migbit perbiaps try to ohtain
a divorce if the method were easier-if they
could go to a court in the vieinity in which
they live, and if the law-ýyer's fee were
anialler. The result rnigbt he a greater
number of divorces in thie different provinces.
One thing 1 would point out, hionourable
gentlenien. Mirriaffe is too easilv effected
in this country. We ou.aht te 'beg-in by
putting more r-3strictions on marriage. Any
inan can go fromn the rnunicipality in which
hie lives ovler to anuther municipality, buy
a license, and go with some lady and gel
married straig-htway, without asking anybody's leave or license, or without any other
restriction. I think, as 1 have said, that
marriage is too easily effected. The provinces sbould get rid o! the idea that al
they need lie concernied with is te obtain
the few dollars charged for the license, or
that the more persons who, get married the
better, se long- as they add a few more
dollars te the coffers of the provincial treasury. That seems te be the w'hoie principie o! the license bureau-to grant a license
without ascertaining whetber tlhe muan bas
been married or niot, wbetber lie is a
widower or net, or whether bie bas already
a wife or half-a-dozen wives. Licenscs are
granted witiîout any besitation.
,A few days ago, when 1 was in Newv York,
one of the leading papers tbere gave an
account o! 261 marriagce licenses thiat bad
been granted on Easter Saturday rnerxingibefore 12 o'ciock. The newspaper statcd
also that the deputy clerk had rnarried 84
persons that morning. If tbat is so, 'as-suming that the deputy clerk of licenses arrived at his office at 9 o'clock and stayed
there until 12, a period of 3 hours, or 1'20
minutes-as nobody gees te wvork, nowv much
before 9 o'clock, altbougbh a few, but v ery
or more, for lus share.

APRIL 21, 192023
Hon* -Mr. POIRIER: Are you sure that
three hours are equal to 120 nminutesý
Hon. '-\r. CROSBY: One hiundred and
eighity minutes.
If I had any doubt I
would apply to my. honourable friend, but
hie did flot give me time. WVel1, if you take
180 and divide it by 84, you will see that
the marriages were disposed of very quickly
and without much ceremony; that there
was flot the sacredness that there should
be in the surroundings. I think it would
be a good thing for the clergymen at the
head of the Christian bodies in this country
to form a union and insist that they should
perforin ail the marriage ceremonies ini this
country, instead of having thein performed
by magistrates and every Toixi, Dick and
Harry. They should insist on that safeguard, because it is needed. I amn told that
some of the Christian bodies are flot paying
as mùch attention to the clergy as they
should pay. Why do flot the clergy combine in a union, as every other class is
doîng. The workingrnen have tlieir unions;
the lawyers have their union-and it is
one of the bigg(est and strongest in the
country; the engineers have a union; so
have the doctors and other professional
men-ail but the clergymen. It would be
wise for the clergymen to get together and
see if they could not bring about such a
situation as would compel persops desirous
of marrying in this country to be married
before some Christian minister. And let
the clergymen protect each other, so that
an Ottawa man wanting to get niarried
couid flot run down to Montreal and obtain
a license without difficulty and get sanie
one there to marry him. If the person belongs to Ottawa lie should be married in
Ottawva, or should have a certificate from
some one in this city, which hie could present in the other municipality for the purpose of obtaining the license there. That
wouid be a very necessary safeguard. I say
that if we started better, we inighlt have
better resuits.
Nowv, 1 trust I have made my position as
clear to the honourable gentlemen present
as it is in my own mmnd. We are dealing
with an evil, and I have decided that it is
perhaps better for me to vote for our retaining controI of that evil here rather than
for handing it over to some other court or
courts, thus perhaps affording a greater
opportunity or greater inducernent for mnarried persons to go into the divorce court.
I cannot vote agaînst Bill I at the moment,
as it lias already been read; but I dlaimi
the riglit to vote against it w'hen it cornes

233

up for the tiird reading. Now, I do not
want to be misunderstoodà. I do not want
honourable gentlemen to feel that I arn
going against this Bill because I think
divorces should not be g-ranted at ail; I arn
voting against it because I want to vote
for wthat I believe vwill offer the least inducement to applicants for divorce, and will
prevent as much as possible the increase
of divorce in our country.
Hon. Mr. BOYE2R: The honourable gentleman was talking about a union of clerg-ymen. Would that include the clergymen of
the church to which hie belongs?
Hon. .Mr. CROSBY: I thiink they are al
pretty well united. They take good care
that they inarry ail tlieir people.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Then why preach to
others? Can they not take care of themselves?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Well, I always like
to help the weak.
Hon. B3. C. PIROW SE: Honourable gentlemen, I would like ta say just a word or
two on this question of divorce. My hionourable friend f romn Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Crosby) could have made his whole speech
in one sentence, and ve would have under-"1 am against distood it thoroughly:
vorce."
Now, we have no lawyer from Prince Edward Island, and the reason I asked the
other day to have the debate adjourned was
that I had not seen the Bill. But I ivish
ta compliment the hionourable gentleman
from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) for
sirnplifying the situation so far as Prince
Edward Island is concerrned. We do niot
often have a divorce case in Prine Edward
Island. So far as 1 can remnember, we have
had only one. But I do not see any reason
why we should not have a divorce court on
the Island, in case wve should need it, so
that a poor man as weil as a ricli man
might take advantage of it.
Hon. I-TFVIITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, the honourable senator from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch"Staunton), when
discussing Bill 1, referred to some remarks that 1 have made and rather took
exception to my saying that I was in favour of bringing the divorce law Up to date.
I infer from the honourable gentleman's
remarks that hie may have thought that I
was in favour of larguely extending the
causes for which divorce should be granted
in this country. 1 desire for a few moments
to explain to the House the present posi-

SENATE
tion of the divorce law in British Columbia,
for it was wvit.h reference to the law in that
province that I spoke of the divorce law
being brought up .to date. We in British
Columbia have been working under the
law of England of 1858, and divorces have
been granted in that province both before
it entered Confederation and since. For
considerable time divorces were grant-some
ed without any question, 'but a few years
ago Mr. Justice Clement took exception to
the manner in which. they had been granted
and raised the point that British Columbia
was flot justified in granting divorce at ail.
I should like to refer for a few moments to
the remarks which he mnade on this question. Dealing with the case of Sharpe v.
Sharpe, hrought before the Supreme Court
of British Columbia, Mr. Justice Clement
used these words:
If I do not discues at length the views expresaed by the learned judges In Sharpe v.
Sharpe (1877), B.C.R. 25. it is not because I
have not carefully consldered themn. When first
called upon to exercise jurisdiction In divorce, I
was at once struck by the fact that the jurisdiction, if It existe, is unhapphly In one way so fet.
tered and In another so0 unfettered as to placŽý
a Judce In a very unenviable position. Tled
down to the Iaw of 1858, he bas none of the
safeguards which now obtain In England agalnst
collusive actions--I mean the grantlng in the
firet Instance of a decree nisi and the reference
of the case to, the King's Proctor for Investigation and, If necessary, Intervention; while on the
other hand. as the full court lias heid in Scott v.
Scott (1891), 4 B.C.R., 316, there is no appeal
from bis decision to any tribunal in this provInce.
I think the two reasons stated by the
judge in that particular case are very good
reasons why we should support this Bill
that my honourabie friend from Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) has brought before the
House. That judgment states the position
of the law in British Columbia to-day, and
it shows that at the present moment we
have not the power to investigate cases to
theextent we should do. The Bill that my
honourable f riend has introduced should
have the effect of preventing sorne divorces
rather than increasing the number which
several honourable gentlemen in this Chamiber seem to think would be the resuit of passing thîs measure. I think it is in the interest
of British Columbia at any rate, and probably of the other provinces, that this Bill,
which bas been so ably defended by my
honourable friend from Middleton, should
become law, and that it will not tend to
facilitate divorce, but will, on the contrary,
have the effect of deterring applicants froni
coming to the court as much as bas been
done in the past.
Hon. Mr. ROSTOCK

Hon. RiAOUL DANDUIIAND: 1 have no
objection to the Bill as presented by my
honourable friend froni «i\idd]etoii (Hon.
B.
WV. IRoss), provided it is inade clear that
it will affect only those provinces which
will have divorce courts, and I understand
from hlm that he intends to make it clear
that this does not apply to Quebec. If I
had been present when the Bi was explained, 1 would have challenged the affirmation that no principle was involved in
it, and that it was but a transference of
jurisdiction, inasmuch as Ontario and Quebec have not hitherto, had an absolute right

Quebec had no settled or clear right to

could corne here and petition Farliament
for legîsiation, which could, however, bc
refused. Even if a case was made out, a
majority might be found in this Chamber,
or in the other, to reject the Bill. So the
people had no absolute right to divorce.
Now, by virtue of Bill 1, if it passes and is
sanctioned, any citizen of Ontario will be
entitled to apply to the court for a divorce,
and, if he establishes his case, the judge is
bound to, grant his application.
I was in.coniplete accord with my honourable friend froni Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) yesterday regarding the danger of extending divorce legisiation to such a large
province as Ontario; but 1 feel that if Ontario desires this legislation it is not for
those froni another province, which is not
affected, to refuse by their vote to grant
what Ontario asks for. We are a Confederation, and it is understood that each province may enjoy whatever advantages it can
dlaim under the constitution. We mnust
recognize that principle, and at the sanie
time see to it that no legisiation that may
be desired by one province and granted to
it shaîl be extended to a neighbouring
province if it is contrary to its custorns and
religious tenets. We applied that principle
quite clearly in 19M6, when a Bill called the
Lord's Day Act was introduced by the Government of the day. That Bill purported to
cover the whole of Canada, but I know that
certain. of the provinces, particularly Quebec, objected to certain of the restrictions
contained in it, and fought strenuously ta
have the autonomy of each province respected, and we succeeded in having inserted in the Bill a clause which reads as
fohlowB:
No action or prosecution for a violatbDn of
this Act shaIh be commenced wjithout the leave
of the Attorney Generai for the province in
which the offence is alieged ta have been corn-

frnm the timne of the çommrission of the alleged

Under this clause -we feit that eacis provin-ce would he able Vo adamnister Visat
Act accordingy to ite own habits and ideas.
That law ias worked, I think, satisiactoriiy. Those provinces wisich have felt
tisat their own laws in that respect were
flot sufficient have been able to Vake advantage of tise Federal Act; but tisose provinces to wisics Vise provincial legislatiori
has been satisfactory have noV invoked
this Act, and for tIsem it remains inoperaVive. I think we should be guided by the
saine principle in tise matter uow hefore
us, and I tisauk the isonourable gentleman
frons Middleton for isav'ing recognized. that
principle and for isaving excepted thse prooperation of this
vnoe ci Quebec from the
Bil. If thse Confederation paot la Vo endure, and if harmony and peace are Vo
prevail in thia country, we should not do
violence to the habits and customas of tise
people, especially to their religious convictions.
Hon. WM. ROOHIE: Honourable gentlemen, I listened yesterday with a great
deal -f pleasuTe Vo the essay of xny honouralble f riend from Quebec (Hon. Mr.
Chapais.) A great deal of it I agree witis;
but rwth sonse of the points in iV I amn at
varianca. I will state these as briefly as
I can. Iu tise firat place, my honourable
frîend drew a rather unfavourabla contrast between tise province of Quebec and
the province o! Nova Scotia and some other
provinces which ha uamed, on thse ground
that tisera were a much greater number
of divorces in the province o! Nova Scotia
and tisese otiser provinces than there were
Iu the proin tise province of Quebe.
vince of Nova Scotia there is a great influx
o! strangers. Many o! thein contradted
hasty marriages, perhaïps on the other aide
of tise -Mter, and perisaps on this aide,
and sorue of them have obtained divorce
in the courts. That la noV chargeable upon
the native inhabitants. On tise oCher hand,
it does noV follow because offenoces are
not brougist 'Vo judgment that a great number of them. have flot been committad.
Perisaps, if the aame facility had exigted
in the province of Quebec-as existis in Nova
Scotia, the nuinber of divorce cases in
that province would be very much multiplied. The number od criminals who appeaLr in tise police court iu one place o1
anotiser may indicate that crime is noV
more prevaleut in that place tIssu in
aisother, but simply that the detection of

in the other.
ràther dwell upon the saneBut I %vould,

or whatever it xnay ha'. I think that with
a litle patience and forbearance a good
many cases of divorce might be avoided.
But I have known -instances of xnarried
people dragging along- a miserable existence when, for the benefit of their familles
and the benefit of society, they ought Vo
be apart.
Tisera is anothsar feature of tise case wisicIs
I think has noV been mentioued by anybody, and I would like Vo allude Vo it. At
tise present time I believe that cases from
Ontario are iseard by the Committee of thse
Senate. I saw by 'the telepisone book that
the areopagus where the trials are held is
rooni 651. Il that is no>t a difficulty in tise
wvay of kecuring divorce, I do noV know
wvhat difficulty mav exist; and the proceedings are heard comparatively in private.
I think the committee sit around and listen
carefully and judicially Vo the evidence,
without any outsîde interference. Most o!
the cases that come before thîs court are
fromn the city of Toronto. Most of the divorce cases that I have listened to in the
Senate have been either from Toronto or
from Hamilton.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

I do not perhaps lay 50 much stress upon
the binding force of a religious ceremony.
I think that any ceremony that would add
importance and deliberation to the act of

an old institution, because we have it upon
the bost authoritv that there xvns a marriage

Noah enteied the Ark. It was not even the

Hon. GEORGE McHUGH: Honourable

ili
that you cannot establish a court that xx
deal better with divorce than the committees of the Senate have done since I caine
to this House. They have performed thîeir
xvork well. If anything- w'ere require'I te
induce me to vote agýainst establishing a

xvould be the reinark of my limounible

THE STAFF 0F THE SENATE.
PLA-ýN

Or 0U(ANIZATION ADOPIRD.

Hcin. Mr. DANIEL inoveti the adoption
of the Second .Report (-.f the Stan4liii( Coininittee on Internal Econoniy anti Contingent Accounts.
H-on. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would draw attention to the second paragraph of this
Report, which reads:
2. That the word "and"

be inserted

immiie-

diatel-y before the words "Clerk of Statioiîery'
in the title of the Deputy Clerk.
This refera to the item Àn the Minutes
of March llth, page 47, which read:
J. Chas. Young, Députy Clerk and F;' et
Clerk Assistant. 'Master Iu Chancery. C!eric of
Routine and Proceedings, Cierk of Stattonery.

I , understood that in the committee the
word " and"- between "Routine"- and
-"Proceedings" as struck out, in order
to make the Clerks desigrnation agree with
the heading used in our Minutes, " Routine Pl.oceeciiig, ;' but tbis report does tiot
caver that point.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think it is a mere
matter of taste to use the titie "Clerk of
Routine Proceedin-s"- instead of "Routine
and -Proceedings."
Hon.' Mr. BOSTOCK: It is a matter of
keeping things in proper shape and order,
and in accordance with the heading used
in our Minutes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The Assistant Clerk
lias alwavs beeîî designated as "Clerk, of
Routine and Proceedinge :" but if there is
any reason for strikiuc out the w'ord "sund,"
th re would be no objection to the honourable gentlemnan so înoving.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In that case 1
would miove that the word '' aud " be
struck out, so that thc titie of the Assistant
Clerk %vould be " Clerk of Routine Proceeding-s."
The anîendnîient wt:s agreed to, andi the
report, as so aliiendeti, was adopted.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL moveti the adoption
of the fifth report of the Standing Coinmittee on InternaI Economny and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. POWERl: I think that this
report, recomrnending that the nunmber of
pages employed by the Sonate be increased
to eight, changes tlue decision of the comnmittee. It seerna to me that four pages
are quite sufficient for this Chamber. I
nnderstand that the ground taken iq that

237

tile nzigez bave to run erraiitis in varions
'parts of the building; but it seems to mie
the ri-lit thing to do m-ould be to appoint
two or three additional inessengers if they
are deemied to be necessary. I gather froin
conversation, however. that the proposcd
plan is to appoint only one additional page,
and that hie is to have specified duties.
If that is the case the better way would be
to increase the number of pag-es to flie.
Hon. '.%r. DANIEL: I mav say that the
application carne to the commnittee from
thie Clerk of the -Senate. We have now
four pages, and one is wanted imTned.iatelyý
for the Debates staff. The honourable gentlemian froîn Halifax thinks it would be
better to eniploy a messenger, but a page
can do ail the work, and hie is only paid
as a page and not as a messenger; sa I
think the memibers of this Chanmber will be
quite willing to pass a recommnendation s0
far as that one page is concerned. The other
three are flot required t'his session, but they
wvill be îteeded next session, andi this recomniendation, if passed, uvill give authority
to the clerk ta engage those additional pages
and have them ready for work next session.
This is an immense building, with large distances and great floor space, and 'more
assistance in the way of messengers and
pages is required than were iound necessary in the building we have lef t. Tbese
additional employees are not necessary nov,
while wor-kmen are in this building, and
we ha.ve to put up ivith a good deal of inconvenience, dust, and unpleasantness,
which will be absent next session; but the
idea is ýta lave at least one page for each of
the three or four floors available for the
inembers as inesseug-ers, anti service of tlîat
kiud. Su far there have beeni rcquests for
additional miessengers, -but it is more than
likely that before the end of this session
snch a request will be made with a view
ta next sessian's neetis. This recommundation was carried 'without a single opponent
or dissenting voice -in the committee, -which
liad as full an attendauce as I have ever
known since I have been connected with it.
The report vwas adopted.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL 'moved the adoption
of the Sixth Report of the Standing Comnmîittee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I notice in this repart a recommendation or resolution that
the employees of the Senate, in addition to
their actual duties, are charged with the

SENATE
execuition of any orders that are given them
by the Clerk of the Senate. I would like
to know just what that mean s.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That clause was inserted for a speci-fic purpose. In carrving
on the work o! the Senate there are occasiens when somne particular employee is
overworked, while others are doing nothing
at ail. The idea iïs not to give authority to
the Çlerk to change the regular duties of
the employees in any way; but when occasion arises, if one is not doing anything,
and there is work fur him to do which cannot be accomplished by those whose duty
it is, the Çlerk inay have discretion to put
him on duty. For example, at present the
Divorce Cornmittee meets every day in the
week, and our Clerk o! Committees, '.%r.
Hinds, must be present every day, which
makes it absolutely impossible for him to
attend any other committee. Hence it is
to have somebody else to
necessary
do bis work whiie two or three coinmittees may be on duty at the saine time.
At the present time the Clerk has no authorîty for that purpose, and honourable inemnbers of the Internai Economy Committee
will rernember that at nur meeting the
Clerk of the Senate had to act as clerk of
the committee because there was nobody
whom he couid order to do the work. This
clause is intended to give the Clerk authority to place on duty some one who is competent and is not otberwise eng-aged. To
give an instance, our Law Clerk bas a
great deal o! leisure, and I understand that
formerly he did soîne work as a clerk o! the
coimrittees.

Your commlttee further recommends that, In

is not the intention.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I only say that I do
not think the wording of the paragraph is
very happy. I think, furtber, that if a
little more inquiry had been made, it would
have been found that the Senate on more
than one occasion adopted reports of the
Committee on Internai Econoniy which directed that the Clerk o! the Senate should
have authority over ail subordinates. There
must be some head, and the Clerk of the
Senate has charge o! the executive work of
the Senate. 0f course, I quite understand
that there wouid *be no disposition to make
the Law Clerk a messenger; but, as I say,
I think that the wording is a little wider
than it sbould be. I have no objection to
the substance of the recommendation.

Now, I fancy I hear some honoureble

strearn of water and that complications between Canada and the United States are
bound ta arise. Let me say ta that honourable gentleman Ihat the people who reaide in thel district aver in New York state

ta an imp)ression that they have that, if *h~

free ta admit thal navigation and transportation on the St. Lawrence muet be paramount; but we are told by the mast enimnent engineers of to-day that, by Ibis development, and the construction a! the
nececsary lift locks, and proper dams, transportation would be improved, and thet e
sufficient revenue would be obtained frorn

that il takes about 250 tans o! coal per mile

into the pockets of the mine owners of the
United States. This one item alone would
be equal to an annual revenue of 5 per cent
on an inves-tment of $12,000,000, to say
nothing about the other revenues to be
derived frorn the sale of power. With this
developrnent -there would be no further
necessity of radial railways paralleling the
lines of steam railways in Ontario.
1 do not wish ta take up the trne of the
Hanse further just now; but, when it is
so difficuit, nat only in Canada but alsoa
in the United 6tates, ta, obtain coal, it
seemed ta rat, opportune ta bring ta the
attention of the people of tbis country the
great waste of power that ie going on from
day to day and frorn year ta year that
s'hould be conserved for -the benefit of aur
people.
Hon. Mr. ROMHE: I would ask the
honourable gentleman, for the information
of some like myself who know very littie
about the subject, if he bas eany estimate
of the expenditure that would be incurred
in carryiflg out the project he bas outlined?
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: I have neyer
heard the figures given. I know that bath
the Government af Canada and the Governmnent -of the United States have engineers making a study of plans and estimating
the cost of this work now.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable gentlemen, I do not intend ta take up -the time
o! the Hanse et any greet length. There
bas -not ibeen any objection raised in this
Hanse ta my motion, except those of the
hononrable Minieter o! Labour, 'whîch. he
did not press very strongly. His objections
were: First, that we could not do this now
because we have not the power; and second,
that, in hîs opinion, we could not econoinicafly electrify the railweys of Ontario at
the present time.
In regard ta the first objection, I stated
clearly, in My Temarks on Thursday lest,
that we Ïhad not the power now, and therefore could not undertake the electrificetion
o! the gavernment railways or any portion
of them until the Chippewa development

would flot be until the end o! 1921, or passibly 1922. I nnderstand that when these

Then, in regard to the belief of -the honcurable minister that the electrification of
steam railways is not economical at the
present time. When I introduced this matter 1 stated that I was net an expert; but I
have since had placed in my hands the
Teport of a very important meeting of
eminent engineers which took place in this
city on the 19th of February last year. This
-report may be -found. in the Journal of the
Engineering Institute of Canada af May,
1919. That meeting was held fer the purpese
of discussing railway electrificatien. There
were many eminent engineers present, and
I tlhink it might be worth while te read
'their opinion. I shail take oniy a few extracts here and there, as the report of the
meeting is semewvhat lengthy.
The firet paper read. at .the imeeting was
one by John Murphy, M.E.I.C., head cf the
electrical section of the Railway Depart.ment o! the Dominion Government. He
said:

other fuel-saving apparatus-to say nothIng of
its better ioad factor-can produce power at
the switchboard, whlch can be transmitted electrically to.the wheels of the locomotive in such
an efficient manner that from one-haif to twothirds of the railways' present coal needs cao
be saved by electrification.

That, you will observe, is with a stea:m

plant producirig electric'ity.
No argument la required, 1 think you will
agree, to support the contention that eliminating
the need for coai at a considerable distance from
the mine la a greater mneasure of relief. and
of true conservation, than Increasing mine production and thereby adding more load to the
already overburdened railways. lteducing coal

itself from some of its congestion.
Sa eminent an authority au Mr. E. W. Rice,
the president of the American Inatitute of Electricai Engineers, addressing that body In New
York in February. 1918, made the following
statement:
IlIt Io reaily terrifying te realize that 25 per

have been reduced. From an engineering, an

value ef regenerative electric braking they went
on to say:-' The use of the air brake is practicaily eliminated, It ls only used to stop trains;

The next speaker was Mr. W. G.* Gordon,

yeu may Bey, was an interested party, but

whose argument, nevertheless, is worth listening te. In the course of bis argument
he Baya:

Mr. M~ W. Rice stated at the June convention of the American Institute of Electricai Engineers last year :-" Eiectric locomotives have
been no lmproved and simplified that tbey are

Where a trunk line la eiectrically eperated

taken up. In many months the electrlcs were
not delayed a minute; the latter can do more
work in cold weatber. Many ef the delayed
steam trains were deuble-headers, but neyer

The figures for electric operation are averaged

years, the figures do not show full credit to
the benefit of electrie operation.

Where mountain divisions are electrically

by regenerative breaking. This Ia obtained by
exciting the fields of the motors on the locomotive on down grades so that the counter

this action retardlng the train to whatever extent desired wlthout the use of the air brakes.
as wvell as supply-ing power to other trains
running on the level or up grades.. This action,
of cour'se, reduces the total demand on the subIn the
.stations with consequent reduction
power demand on the primary source of supply.

I presume that is the reason 'why the
honourable minister on Thursday said it
was more econoTnical on mountain sections
than on the level. There is a great desi
of evidence which this eng-ineer adduced to
prove the econorny of electrification. I shall
just Tead one more short extract.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does this gentleman give the primary cost of electrification?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: No, I do not think
that was takzen into a.ccount. But, as regards that, I amn referring only to roauds
that were already built. My motion is for
the electrification of the s'team roads.

Gordon eaays :
This mneans that, over any line, trains of
heavier tonnage can be hauled at a much better
schedule speed than with steam locomotives. In
the case where a single track steam Uine bas
reached its capaclty and would have to be
double tracked to handle Increased ton mileage,
electric operation will obviate the necessity
of double tracking and permit of a large expanse In ton mileage handled.

I 'will not weary the House muoh more.
The next speaker was Mr. F. H. Shepard,
Director of Heavy Traction for the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturinga Company. Another interested party, it may be
said; but bis evidence is worthy of our
attention. He says:
The growth of traffle on the Norfolk & Western caused s0 great a congestion on the Elk-

horn Grade as to limit the output ef the celebrated Pozahontas coal fie'd, fromn ,wh;ch a great
part of the revenue of the whole railroad is
derived. The topography of this section is
revision
such that either additional tracks or
of line wvas practically impossible. Electrification has doubied the capacity of this division
nnd, duing, the past severe winter, the freedom
of movement of traffic over this section was
markedlxv the easlest. of the wvhOle railroad. A
noteworthy feature of this operation Is the large
size of trains and the expedltious manner in
which they are handled. On the lesser grades,
trains of 5.008 tons are operated. and on the
2% grades, trains of 1,25.0 tons, at twice the
speed of former steamn operation, with three
large Mallet eng-ines per train. Traina are accelerated to a speed of 14 m. p.h. on the 2%
grade In a Ilttle over a minute-in fact to quote
a brakeman on one of lus first trips: «"these
trains st art like a trolley car."

APIRIL 21, 1920
The next speaker was Mr. H. H. Vaughan,
M.E.I.C. Mr. Vaughian wss in the employ
of the Canadia-n Pacifie Railway Company
for a numiber o! yesre, but at the time this
meeting occurred lie had not been in their
employ lfor three years. He gives a great
deal of evidence in regard to the efforUt
-which were made by engineers to induce the
C.P.R. during the time he was with them
to change some sections of their line to
electricity. One was the Connaught tunnel;
another 'was the line from Smitli's FaUls to
Montreal; and anather 'was a portion of
their line in the province o! Quebec. But
on each occasion the dîrectors of the C.P.R.,
after careful investigation, decided Ghat at
that time electrification was not economical
and abandoned kt. Mr. Vaughian, however,
sumB up his remarks in this way:
1 do thlnk, however, that our rallway men
and financial men do not look at this electrification problemn In the rlght light. They look at It
altogether fromn the dollars and cents point of
view now. That la the natural way, and In a
sense, Is the proper business way to look at
any proposition. 1 would firmly agree wlth that
proposition when It cornes to a question of substltutlng, for the steamn locomotive, a steamn
power plant, and using coal for generatlng electriclty, but in this country, where we have such
a magnificent supply of water power, I belleve
It would be wlse foreslght for our railway people to invest money in electrificatlon and to
utilize that water power, lnstead of burnlng Up
the supply of coal whlch. In the days to corne,
wiUl be needed by our descendants and -who, If
we consume it now, wll bltterly regret the
wastefulness of whlch we have been gullty.
We can justify electrification If we takre Into
account its contingent advantages and give It
credit for aIl the saving that It can make. I
believe, If that was done, the rallways and railway engineers would find that It would pay to
go ahead with the work of electrification.
Electrification Is, of course, a major change,
and Involves a large lnvestment not unlike that
invnlved In construction of termninaIs, second
track. and npw Ulnes. The justification of these
latter is almost neyer determined by the prospect of immediatae return, but rather by that
determination whlch governs the expansion of,
and provision for, facilities for a first-class railroad.

It seemns to me Mr. 'Vaughan lias there
struck tlie right idea, thaît we must take
into consideration the contingent advantage. and in the cases whicli I have drawn
to tlie attention of this House that contingent advantage is of enormous 1proportions. It means the difference between
profit and loss on the railways owned by
tlie Government. I am eat.îsfied that il
the 'hydro-radial. enterprise that lias been
staýted in ithe province of Ontario is carried out-and il, will be carrîed out if the
wisheis of those 'who voted for the by-laws
prevail- it -will mean tlie takzing- away from

2~4à

our steax railways of enougl o>f their traffic
to inake it unprofitable.
I do not intend to take up the timé of
the House any further on this question,
though it Ls a very interesting subject
and very much more might be said upon
it. But I trust the Goveriment will take
it inio very serjous consideration, and as
1 eaid before, if that is done, I shail feel
that I have accoinplished something in
bringing the matLer to the attention of the
House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Did the 'honourable gentleman, in his first remarks,
abtte 'the cost per mile lor the eleotrifloation
of steam railways?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Yes; I gave the cost
of the eleotrification of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railway, 440 miles.
It was' $ 18,000 per mile of track, or $27,000
per route mile, at that time; that is, in
1916. 0f course, costs have increased very
greatly since then. At the present time it
would cost perliaps $40,000 a mile. I give
that just as an estimate; that ie about
double what it cost in 1916. But these costs
may increase in the future, or they may
decrease. But as these costs increase or
decrease, everythîng else does the same,
apparently.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I have ng intention to speak at
length on this proposition. I rise simply
to say a word, which the honourable gentleman may answer. If I construe the proposition aright, I have no objection to adding my vote to that of the honourable gentleman. The motion reada:
That In the
pedient and in
Government to
for steam as a
railway owned
and wherever

opinion of the Senate it is exthe lnterest of Canada for the
proceed to substitute electricity
motive powver upon the lunes of
by the Government as soon as
econornically practicable.

This is so modest a proposition that I
suppose anyone would agree with it-Hon. Mr. SMITH: I should think so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: - if it implies
that the Government will choose its own
time for the financing of the enterprise.
Considering the proposition by itself, it
might -be decided to-day that it is economically practicable; but with the formidable
obligations which the Government of Canada has assumed and is facing, it may not
be able to finance the proposition for a number of years, althoug-h economically the proposition would lie practicable.
Hon.' Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, it might be iniexpedient for

SENATE
tbe Senate to pass a general resolution of
this kind witbout having more definite information before tbemn, toucbing tbe cost o!
the undertaking, and the financial position
o! Canada fo enter upon so greaf a responsibility. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Smith) introduced :the discussion in order
to, direct attention to fhis important subjeef; and, as be bas already fulfilled bis intention, I would suggest thaf no great purpose is served by absolutely committing
the Senate in this very general way to
s0 important a proposition. I am sure, not
only thaf every honourable member of the,
House bas lisfened witb much pleasure to,
what my bonouîable f riend bas said upon
the question, 'but also lbat the attention of
the Government will be directed te if, and
in that way as much will be accomplisbed
as if we absolufely commiffed ourselves f0
the proposition.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I was going te suggest, honourable gentlemen, thaf if inight,
be well f0 refer this motion fo the Finance
Committee of the Senate.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not,
object f0 thaf.
Hon. Mr. SM.ITH. I am quite satisfied
wifh the suggestion of the honourable leader
that the question will be drawn fo the attention of the Government. That is my
object: to draw if te the attention of the
Governinent.
The motion was withdrawn.
OTTAWA AGREEMIENT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the second readinga of Bill 28, an Acf to confirma an Agreement between His Majesty
tbe King and the Corporation o! the city of
Ott awa.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the object, o! this Bill is te make provision for
increased payments f0 the city of Ottawa
on account of the services rendered by the
city f0 the public buildings of the capital.
My recollection is that formerly we were
paying about $ 15,000 a year in consideraf ion
of those services. That was afterwards,
some yeaîs ago, increased by an addifional
contribution of $ 100,000 a year fo the Oftawa Improvement Commission. Lately the
subjecf bas been reopened, and the Governmenf has aîrangaed to increase tbe $ 100,000 te $150,000 and te make the paymenf
$75,000 in lieu o! $ 15,000, thus makîng a
total contribution of $225,000 annually.
This city will fo some extent profit by
the new arrangement, inasmucb as tbere
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHI)

bas been eliminated from the contract which
had previously been entered into the exemption of civil servants from payment f0
the city of certain taxes on incomne. Thbe
city, very naturally, bas made even larger
demands, than the Governrnent bas conceded, but the arrangement is regarded as
an equitable one. It has been sanctioned
by the House of Commons, and 1 have
no doubt this Gharnber will approve of wbaf
the Goveniment, and likewise the House of
Commxons, have done as fo the agreement
befw4en the parties. /
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: What does the Government get fiom fthe city?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose the city would say the Government
gets exemption from taxation, for one
thing. The city bas claimed that Government property should be subject to taxation, the same as privtately-owned properfies. The Governiment is supplied directly by the city with wafer for ail ifs public
buildings,~ witb the exception, I thinlc, of
the water furnisbed f0 the different departThe payment
ments for consumption.
sgreed upon includes, for instance, the
supply of wafer for sewerage purposes, for
parks;- and, 1 fbink, for flue protection. The
Goverrnment will pay wafer rates for tbe
otber purposes f0 which. I have referred,
on the basis of 13 cents per thousand galions "foi such quantity of water as it may
use in any year up te, 200,000,000 gallons,
and for water used in excess of 200,000,000
gallons in any year at the price or rate of
10 cents per tbousand gallons."
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Is ail governmentowned property in the city of Ottawa exempt under this arrangement? Is ail the
propeîfy befween the river and the norfh
side of Wellington street now exempt from
municipal taxation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; 1
undergtand thaf would become exempt.
The contract would not permit of property
rented by the Government being exempt.
Property would be exempt if it were in the
control or tbe possession of tbe Crown;
but it is conceded that property rented
from other parties and occupied by the Governmenf would flot be exempt from taxation.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: But ail tbis newlyacquired property is exempt?
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: Ail property the title of wbich is absolufely vesteci
in the Crown is exempt.

APRIL 21, 1920
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: 'I think the time has
corne when the city o! Halifax should bie
considered lu connection with a vote such
as the one that la now before us. In the
city o! Halifax there is about $20,000,000
worth of property on 'which not one cent
of taxes is paid. The greater portion of
that propertybas been handed over to the
Dominion Government by the Imperial
Government. The Goverument have the
streets kept dlean for them, and they get
They

get everything free. The time bas certainly
corne when reome consideration should bie
given to the city o! Halifax.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: What about WVinnipeg?
Hon. Mu. CROSBY: Winnipeg is out o!
Nobody knows anything about
sight.
Winnipeg, and nobody cares. The Government have no public buildings there.
Hon. Mr. 'MeMEANS: Oh, yes, they have.
'Hon. MuNI. CROSBY: My honourable
friend may have to be-looked after. I suppose the police have to take care of hîrn.
That does not cost anything. What I -%ant
to point out la that the greater portion o!
the water frbnt in Halif ax la owned by the
Government, and the city provides aidewalks and streets and fire protection. Then,
again, we have in Hallifax the Wellington
Barracks, covering a very large area al
along up Gottigen street. The assessment
o! real estate values in Halifax would probably be somewhere between $45,000,000 and
350,000,000. Twenty years ago, 'when I was
more faiiliar with it than I arn now, it
amounted to about $25,000,000. lIt is only
fair and reasonable that Halifax should be
given some consideration for ail that property owned by the Government in the very
heart of the city. My honourable friend
<Hon. Mr. MoMeans) speaks about Winnipeg. I do not know very much about Winnipeg, but if hie has any dlaims to present
here on behaif of Winnipeg, I have no objection to his puesenting thein. But I do
know that in Halifax the Goverument
occupies the greater portion of our waterfront. I understand that sorte change la
about to take place; that the Goverument
wlll seil some o! the property there. I think
they should do so, for they do not need al
the puoperty they have there now. lIn the
mneantime I think the Goveunment should
give Hall!fax at least $25,000 or $40,000 a
year for the services they get front that
good old city. lIn Hall!fax they are given
good protection; it la not like the city of

247

Winnipeg, fromt which miy honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) cornes, where
there is trouble ail the time and no man's
life is safe. lIn Halifax everything is conducted in splendid fashion and the Government neyer suifera anything there fromn lack
of flue protection or lack of protection of
any other kind. The property is well taken
care of. I would urge upon the honourable leader of the Government that the
cla.ims o! the city o! Halifax be considered
in connection with this vote.
,Hon. Mr. BOSI'OCK: Honourahie gentle-men, the leader o! the Oovernmnent has said
that under this Bill the Governinent undertakes to pay a sumn of $225,000 a year as
against $115,00, I think it was, that we
were paying formerly. But, upon examining the Bill, 1 find that there is a good deal
more than that in it, because the Government also undertakes to keep up certain
bridges, and "to maintain and repair good
and sufficient sidewalks on the northern
side of that portion of Wellington street between Connaught Place and the western
boundary of the Perley Home property."
1 thînk that is new. I do not think the
Government undertook that hefore in the
arrangement with the city of Ottawa. Then,
on page 5 of the Bill, the Government makes
itself subject to "local improvement rates
ixnposed by the corporation under the provisions of the Local Improvement Act." I
do not know whether that is a new arrangement; but it seems to me that it inight
necessitate considerable expense in addition to the $225,000 to which my honourable
friend has referred.
Further than that, I presume the city wil
get a considerable advantage fromn the
privilege they now have of taxing civil
servants on their incomes and on their
property. I do not know whether my honourable friend has figures to shorw what the
benefit of that arrangemnent wlll be to the
city. If he could give us that information
when we go into committee it would be
very interesting. 1 thînk it la somewhat
o! a hardshîp upon the civil servants who
were aýpointed to the service at a time when
it was understood that they would not bie
subject-to taxation by the city in the way
that other people are. This change bas
been made, however, and I presumne that
question was considered.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That arrangement, it seems to me, was not based
upon common sense or reason. There was
no reason why civil servants in the city
of Ottawa sbould have been exempted f roin
taxation while those in other parts of -

SENATE

248

Dominion were not. Furthermore, the case
of the civil servants is not such a bard one
as my honourable friend would lead us to
believe. As. he knows very well, civil servants have received great consideratiori,
particularly since the war, in the matter
of salaries and.in the bonus which bas been
given tbem to set off to some extent the
Increased cost af living. However, if the
city, when the first contract was entered
into, was deprived of its rigbt ta impose
taxation upon the civil servants, there is
ne reason why that condition of affaira
should continue for ail-time.
The motion was agreed to and the Bill
was read the second time.

0F

AND

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 21,
an Act ta amend The Canada Shipping Act
(Certificates of Service). Hon. Mr. Willoughby in the Chair.
On section 1-requirements for certifi-,
cates, etc.:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: Who appoints the
board before which these men have to
appear to get their certificates?
It is
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG HEED:
done under the Marine Department.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: They bave examinations. I may say that this Bill is about
25 years behind the times. If it had been
brought in 25 or 30 years ago it would have
have been of some advantage to the Dominion of Canada, and we would ha in a
different position to that which we occupy
to-day. However, the bring-ing in of this
Bill now cannot do any harm.
In 1911 and 1912 schools were established
in the Maritime Provinces where any one
who cared to attend could get an education
in navigation. I think the first sehool wvas
started in Halifax; and there is now one in
Sydney and one in St. John. It used to be
that examiners went down there only once
we
a year or once in six months; but now%
have an examiner in Halifax who is there
ail the time. Sailors are now offered an opportunity of getting an education free, and
of passing their examinations. 1 think there
are very few ships in the employ of the Gov,ernment on which the men have not got master's and offleers' certificates. Sorne 20 years
ago we used to grant tickets for service; but
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

they were done away with. That system was
not of much use because the ships would
cross to Britain, and the* Board of Trade
there would nlot allow themn to be brought
back under those certificates. Many of the
ships had to be sold to the Norwegians, the
Swedes, the Danes, and others, and that is
why Canada was in such bad shape with
regard to shipping when the war broke out.
We had gone back in our shipping. We
built the finest ships in the world and
inanned themn with the very best men in
the world; >but the practice of the British
Board of Trade practically put Canada out
of the shipping business.
As ] say, this Bill will nlot do any harni.
But why should the certificates be limited
to ships of 750 tons, or to sailing vessels?
1 think it sbould include freight carriers
propelled by steamn if it is going to be of
inuch advantage, because there are now
more steam-propelled vessels than sailing
ships.
Section 1 was agreed ta.
The preanible and the titie were agreed

INCOME AND BUSINESS PROFITS
TAXES.
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION.
Hon. W. H. BENNETT rose in accordance wîth the following notice:
Ti'at he will oall the attention of the Sonate

and inquire :-The number of persons or corporations paying and the aggregate amount
paid by each group by way of Dominion Incorne Tax or the Business Profits War- Taz In
the town of Midiand during the years 1917 and
1918 whose assessed incorne was $1,500 and
over. showing each group, and aiso by advances
of $1,000; aiso specifying as ibetween males
and females.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, la-,t year
I either asked a question or moved for a
return to the effect that there should be
published by the Department of Finance,
or that particular branch which deais with
income and war taxes, a statement showîng the number of persons who had paid
their taxes; not giving their names at ail,
but claeeifying- theni according to municipalities. On that occasion the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) suggested that the motion
should be withdrawn, intimating- that the
government, or the Finance Department,
proposed to bring down a return, not by
individual inunicipalities from one end of
the Dominion to the other, but by larger
districts. That return, I may say, was
nover brought down; at least, I ami not
aware that it wae. Sc I have placed this
motion on the order paper. I have done
so, flot with any particular desire to know
what has gone on in the town iu which I
happen toi reside, with respect to these socalled war taxes; but rather because the

SENATE

250

Governinent intimated in another place a
disposition to give aIl publicity as to the
number of persons who have made returns
on income subject to war taxes.
I may instance the case of the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company. In answer to a
question asked in the House of Gommons
on April 20, it was statod that that coinpany had paid for the year 1918 $1,463,097,
and that, up to last year, inclusive, they
had paid $3,817,172. It may fairly bo ,Askod,
if the business of the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company is te ho made public, if
it is to be shown what war taxes they have
paid, is it not equally fair that in evory
locality thoro should bo publishod the namo
of every person who bas paid war taxes.
I will deal lator on with the dosirability of
the publication of such lisa.
But the Governmont, or the Finance
Dopartment, have gone furthor in this respect. In response ta a motion made in the
bouse of Gommons for a return showing
the numbor of persons in tho city o! Toronto who had paid income taxes or taxes
on business profits, the following statement
was mado public. As this was not in answer to an inquiry, but was in rosponso -te
a motion for a return it bas not appoared
in Hansard. Thorefore, 1 will givo the
figures as statod in tho return of which I
have obtained a copy, showing tho number
of porsons in the city o! Toronto who paid
incomo tax for the year 1918:

1 will comment only on perhaps two of

those groups. Take the case o! persans psying on incomcs from $50,000 to $100,000 or
over. In the -wholo city of Toronto only 68
persons made returns on incomos of $50,000
or ovor.
1 may say that whon the first return was
brought down in the bouse of Commons th#,
other day the nowspapers by error state
that it was indicative of the whole Dominion. That statement was subsequently corrocted, and it was shown that the return
applied only to the city of Toronto. The
first statement published, that there wee
only 13 mon in the wholo Dominion who
had an income of $100,000 or more was productive o! a great deal o! comment. In
the reading room, where several of us wero,
the question was discussed, and within a
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

few minutes there was made up a list of
13 men in the city of Ottawa alone, each of
'whom, it was agreed by those present, had
an income far beyond $100,000. To say that
in Toronto there were only 13 who had incornes of $100,000 is nothing more than a
farce in my opinion. Take one gentlemanand I arn not going to mention any names.
The municipal taxes on his residence are
$50,000 a year. The total number of per.sons in the city of Toronto who made returnq and whose income -was over $1,500 or
under $6,000 was only 4,274. The whole income-tax law is based on the principle of
honour; it is purely and simply a question
of honour whether people do or do not make
returns. The resuit is that a, large number
of persons in this country are very much
prejudiced because, while their income
may be smail, may be under $2,000,
it is rated in the most open way,
while a man 'who may have a large income
and is not an employee can a'bstain from
ma.king a return and thereby escape paying
the t.ax. 1 believe that Mr. Breadner has
done excellent work in the compilation of
these lists. I believe hoe has done a great
doal more than half-a-dozen ordinary men
'would have dono. Ho has established a
wvonderful system for collocting this information. I arn told -that, hoebas socured fromn
one end of the country to the other ahl
possible information. ffo that it will ibe
possible to see 'whether mon have or have
not escaped paying the war taxes. Let me
give an instance: this is a case that I know
of. I1 refer to the Canada Steamship Company, a number of whoso ongineers and captains live in my town. Every one of those
mon *who has $2,000, if hie is single, is
taxed on tho extra $500, and why? Bocauso
the Govornment bas gone te the company,
and has as'ked it to give thero a returu
showing what those mon are earning. Then,
in turn, 1 assume that the company bas
intimated to the men that they must ivay
their money; and that is the rule that RL
presumoe prevails with that and every othor
company.
,I boliove -the time bas arrivod when the
Govornment should not only intimate, by
bringing down roturns, as they have done in
the case of the city of Toronto, how many
poople are paying thoir taxes, but that they
should go furthor, and publish a list of the
naines of ahl in the country who have paid.
Scomo honourablo gentlemen 'will doubtless
ask what is te bo gainod by that? JI will
give you an instance. Let us assume the
case of the average smaîl town. A man is

APRIL 22, 1920
well known to have an-income of $20,000 or
$30,000. When the names are printed that
rnan's namne is absent. If the departrnent
does nat receive anonymous letters intimating that there is a man ol the name of
John 8mith, or 'whatever his naine may be,
who bas escaped .paying the tax, 1 wvouid be
very much surprised. It may be urged that
that is giving too much pixblicity to a man's
private business but 1 do flot think so.
What does the Government do with regard
to a man's private business? You can go
ta the Distribution Office and ask for the
bluebook relating to chartered banks, and
what -will yau find? You wili find the namne
of every man, woman, and child 'who owns
a share of stock in any chartered bank in
any part of the country. That is publicity.
What is dune in the municipalities? You
can go ta the proper municipal officer in
your town and ask .him to -show you the
assessment roll, and 'from it you cari find
out wha in that to-wn lias been assessed and
*wbo has not. There is more publicit.y. Let
us go a littie further. I arn in favour af
-the principle of taxing men when they are
alive rather than after tbey are dead. Take
-the case of succession duties. Under the
probate a list of ail the assets of the
deceased is made public. Why not make it
puiblie in bis lifetilue' Any man conversant
with municipal taxation knaws that men
endeavour ta escape it. In my own town
I have known persons ta be assessed for
$1,500 of income, and they have carried it
along for years; -but wben there was a hue
and cry the assessment went up ta $15,000.*
The persan taxed ]rnew that the assessrnent
list was under the. eye of every persan in
the tawn. When you have ail that publicity
for tbe assessment roll and know that people
'will not make a proper return under that
s-ystem, what are yau ta expect under tbe
systemn af the Finance -Department wbich
puts people on their bonour, sa that no
one knows 'wbether or nat tbey are paying
one cent of wbat tbey properly should pay?
To-day tbere is great need af maney in
this country. The Government tells the
returned soldiers, whose claims are great,
that it bas flot the money ta meet
their demands, which. it is estimated would
require fram $500,000,000 ta $800,000,000.
Persan ally I arn not in favour of that payment, and I arn willing ta rtate roy reasons;
but I say t.hat it is a crying sbame tbat
the muen wbo bave returned ta this country
badly wounded, and wbo are unable ta
belp themselves, the widows oi men wbo
bave been kiiled, and the mothers wbo have

bast their sons, are not receiving larg-er
pensions than they are receiving to-day. 1
will mention a case that came ta my notice
only this morning. I received a letter from
a widow, w~hose only support, ber boy, %%ent
to the war. He was killed. She had been paid
$40 a manth, and had received in addition
a bonus ai $8-$48 per rnonth in ail. She is
getting on in years, and, by reason af the
fact that she.owns bher bouse and lot, sbe
bas been informed tbat $10 is going ta be
deducted from ber allowance. Is it any
wonder tbat tbere is a feeling, wbicb I say
is a protper feeling, in favour of these
wounded men and the dependents ai tbose
who bave been killed? This marning I went
up, as I bave frequently done, ta the meeting- af the cornmittee dealing with these
claims. I heard the evidence ai a medical
man w-ho attends tubercular patients. He
tald tbe stary af a man in an advanced
stage af consumptian. His rpay for this total
disability is $720 a year. There is a man,
Whno is flot able ta work, trying ta support
a family on $720 a year, a man wbo .bas done
w-hat? True, hie has flot sacrificed his lufe,
but be bas sacrificed -bis future, and hie is
paid a paltry surn like that. If that man
intirnates that he is bettering bis condition,
or that bis health is improving, a deduction is rnade. Perbaps a tubercular patient
sbould receive more syrnpatby than patients
ai other kinds. He is pmacticaily taboo. 1
bave knawn a young man wbose services in
a bank were dispensed witb, and wby?
Because be had tuberculosis.
I do not know wbetber the Goverrnent
will adaxpt the practice of publishing the
naines of the people wbo bave paid their
incarne tax, but in my opinion it is the only
way in wbicb tbey can increase, and 1
believe greatly increase, tbe incarne from
war taxes. I know ai a man 'who, I believe,
bas an incarne of $25,000 a year, and I do
not believe be bas ever paîd a single cent.
Han. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Wby do
you not report the case ta tbe Goenet
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: In the first place, I
arn not a common informer for the Government, and, in the second place, if I made
a complaint, 1 migbt perbaps find that I
had stultified myseli, because be bad made
a return. 1 know ai another man wbo during
the war made huge profits, over $50,000 a
year, an bis own teiiing, and it was evident
that he bad been making a great deal ai
rnoney. I bave been taid that be does not
pay the war tax, and does not intend ta
do so until be is compeiied. There is sornetbing i Vhis grievance of-returned soidiers

SENATE

and their dependents, and the general
public are flot turning a deaf ear to fair and
honest dlaims when they see rnen going
around showing cheques for a return oi
100 per cent on some of their investments.
1 have seen the cheque of a comipany whicb
paid a 100 per cent dividend, while, under
the law, iA was supposed to pay 60 per cent
of that to the Gevernment; 'but no 60 per
cent bas been paid. I saïw a man with a
cheque for $5,000 who had made an investment of $5.000 in a certain company. How
is it that these things are happening? Eithei
the companies are not making the return,
or they are not being treated as they 6hould
be by the Department; and I do not believe
the latter is the case. On the contrary, 1
have beard rnany complaints that people
have been harshly treated by Mr. Breadner,
and I do not believe 'le is letting any one
that hie knows of escape.
In the ýprovince of Ontario, if a mani
holds stock in a joint stock company, if 1I
want ta see how rnuch stock 'he bas, ail 1
have to do is to go to the proper office in
the city of Toronto, and ask for the return
of the company. Then 1 see in the public
press that that cornpany paid a certain
dividend. But when it cornes down to the
question of wbo is paying the war tax and
%%eho is not, it seems te be like the sacred
ark of the covenant, we must not lay
bands upon it. Ras flot the time arrived
when there sbould be publîcîty in these
things?
1 hope that if any discussion ensiles on
this question it may result in' the Governnient taking- the matter in hand and dealing with it-first, by bringing down a
general return, by municipalities, and then
g.iving the names of the persons wbo have
paid the tax. Talk about publicity! My just
happening- to glance at a gentleman recalîs
sometbing that bappened in the ,town in
wbich hie lives. A woman in Ontario died
leaving $75,000 or $80,000 te a mnan wbo
ý,vas not a relative of bers. She bad relatives
in the States, and they were sbowered wvith
letters telling tbem wbat had bappened,
and an action in the courts bas been started. The people -are alive, and are keen to
expose any person who bas not paid bis wvar
tax. A man employed by a' company is exposedby it rnaking the return of bis income te
the Department. lle paye up to the last dollar. Butthe man witb a large income may not
be paying -et ail. Just remember the figcures
that I quoted as te Toronto. Sixty-eight
men in the city of Toronto bave made returns stating that their incomes range frorn
$50,000 to $100,000. That reminds me of a
Hon. Mr. BENNEVT.

discussion wbich I had with an honourable
gentleman in this House the other evening. He said that rny notice of motion
shýould be extended to cover some other
town in the county of Simcoe, and bie asked
what I estimated was the incorne of a certain man there. I have no doubt that hie
is a well-to-do man; hie is a personal friend
of mine i but I neyer knew that hie had an
incarne of $18,000 from a certain business.
I had neyer heard of it before, but xny hionourable friend had. There is only one way
to collect this tax. and that is to pubiish
the names. Any man in receipt of a large
income 'wIll be ashamed te see bis name
paraded through the country on the list, if
bis return bas flot been made, and truly
made. Not only that, but the juhlicity
whicb hie will get will, as'he must know,
probably resuit in a prosecution.
A short time ago I saw a Iist of men in
the city of Toronto who had flot made their
returns. I knew who two or tbree of them
were, although 1 did flot know thein personally. Tbey were men of intelligence and
standing, and it was absurd to think that
they sbould flot have made their returns
long before. There is uflrest in the country. Some people may think it is slumbering. It does na good to talk about peace,
peace, because there is no peace in this
country to-day; and the first step that
should be taken to allay the unrest that
exists-I refer 'now particularly to the soldier movemertt, as it is terrned-should be a
substantial increase of the pensions for
maimed soldiers and for dependents o! deceased soldiers, and the money should be
obtained by an endeavour to increase the
income of the cauntry by the payment of
war taxes, particularly by those who have
been sbirking . the payment in the past.
The Government should address itself to
that question witb ail possible heartiness.
Hon: Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I regret that I ar n ot in
a position to furnish my honourable friend
frorn Sirncoe <Hon. Mr. Bennett) witb the
information for which. he asks. The Departrnent of Finance bas been charged witb
the duty of adopting whatever systern seems
to be best for the collection of the income
tax. If the system which it bas adopted
bas flot met with the approval of my hionourable friend, or the approval of the public. I presurne the G'overnment wvill have te
assume the responsibility. This is a very
large question. It is a question that mal,
well be considered, whether or not it is
desirable to publish the names (o! those

253

APRIL 22, 1920
chargeable -with income tax. Speaking for
myseif, I see no good reason why some
system such as those which obtain in
municipalities should flot be applied to the
collection of the federal income tax; but
the subi ect is noV soi easy to work out as
it would appear on its face. The difficulty
which has always been met in imposing an
income tax has been in the collection of
it. That has invariably been the case, not
only in this country, but in every country
where such tax has been imposed.
I shall be very glad to direct the attention of the Minister of Finance to the remarks made by my honourable friend from
Simcoe. As to -whether or flot he will agree
with the views the honourable gentleman
bas expressed 1 arn not in a position to say.
I feel fully assured, however, that every attention will be given Voithe atatements of
my honourable friend.
In reference Vo the return which my honourable friend intimated -was asked for last
session, I amn not prepared to say whether
it was placed upon the Table of the House
or not; but I would point out to my honourable friend that the inquiry was made
last session, and that there is a good deal
of human inflrmîty on the part of some
of the departments in not charging themselves with very much responsibility once
the session is over. I would suggest to my
honourable -friend the desirability of asking, for a return during the present session,
and I shaîl expedite it in every way possible.
My honourable friend spoke of the inadequacy of the pensions paid by the Dominion Government. I need not remind
hini that there is a committee of Parliament
considering this subject at the present time.
But iit il to be porinted ou*t-and I would
a9k my hoinourable lriend not to overlook
,hi.s-that the pension soaie ss we have it
to-day bas been fixed by Parliament. The
repre-enitatives, of the people them-selves
have had the ma't-ter within theiir exclusive
responsbildty. This seale of penscion- has
bee.n fixed, noit by the Govemnment, but by
Parqiaient, and ilf my honjourable friend
disagrees. with the action cd Paria'ment as
Viot>he size of the pension~s payable to Our
retui'ned soldiers who un-ha4pily are suffexinig d.isability, he mus4 hsene Pairliament
d>-ut od place
itseif. But it wo'uid noVte
for me Vo .say in th. oaaection that the
scsieo-f ýenisions paid by Cainadu, 1 uuderstand, exceeds very -substaiitially that psid
by any of -ouT Aldies or any of the Associated
Powers in the war; and it seems tio me that
thàis dfact should redieve Canada to some

extenît, If not altogether, îrom -any criticipim
of i-ngratlu>tde te the returned. mon. The
solicitude of Parliarnent, every Session
sAnce the war, bas been exercised aloing the
line of giring moe mature coinsidieration
to the question cf penisions, and 1 think
.1 amn correct in saying that every Session
since the paymenV cf pensions has been
assumed. by tihe Glovernment of Oanada,
Pairlijment. bas mnade a ve.ry clofe in-vestigatigrn and sorutiny regarding not only wha-t
peneone Canada ehould pay, but aileo what
penionesiare paid by ot;hecr countrier,. Therefore, while my honouraible friend's, eriticism
as to the collection of the ino«e tax xnay
hiave some grouaid, it eee Vo me that the
GOveramen.t es wel1 as Parlîament bas
diecharged its f ull duty in investiga.fing and
in r.howing.propeT syxupaîthy on th-e 4uestion.

However, -as 1 have eidý, I shaM be offùy

not take any exception Vo my ho4nonrble

de-sire, but uit la a very bad practice to
renew the tiebate alter a moytiion of*thie kind
hais been discussed, and the inqu.iry has

to hleaT what my honourable f riend has;

te say, but it is very

deSirablie

thait the

practice of discuss'iing the questiion befoTe
-the GoveTnment answers sho'uld be follo,,ed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ishou1d have
risen be!fo-re my honourable f rienjd; but it
hais e.ccurred to me that there is perhaps
one point w'hich, wit.h the permission of
tihe House, I might emphasize. My honourwble f riened fr<em Simece (Hlon, MT. Benneitt)
dlains th-at there is ooniderable uneasineasr
in the co-uniry owing Vo the ftact that the
income Vax may not have been paid by al
w"ho should make returns and send in
thed-r cheques. He suggests as a remedy
t14at a s4tatement showing tihose who have
madle returns and have paid thie amnountts
thiey a-re called upen Voi pay should be
published. 1 have noît given any time or
seems. Vo me
study to the question, but LV
that the practice Vhroughout tihe woqeld has

SENATE
been contirary tao thcat suggeqtéed by my
honourable f riend. I know cd no ounitry
in which inoome tax is innpo-sed thlait. bas
es yet decided ta pub<hsh the names of thoee
w1ho do m-ake returne and do pay. There
îone objection wb.Ich oocurs to me, and
there may be *rnany oithers., There would
effect upon
undoubtedly be an injuSom~
tihe businesis commumity ifi tihere were
pubiàshed throughout the lsand tihe amounts
which variious firi Pay. The iniosrmuitin
would indiiea4e their oerercitai strength.
In d'aye cd prOsperitY businesls men would
not object tfo the publdoation cd the amourat
of ther turin-over aund their profit; but
there are aLso qean years, in whikh profits
are nOut in evidence, and the etat-ement
woq£d show that the flrm's business
was not a prOsperous one in ithe previo'us
year. Business men live on credit. It seems
to me that the publication ai the profits or
lack of profits ai variaus carparations and
business througbaut the country would
shake considerably the foundations af aur
whale commercial edifice. As I have stated,
1 have given no time or special study ta
the matter; but as it bas neyer accurred
ta ather countries. sa f ar as I know, ta
publisb lists ai the amaunts paid in incarne
tax, I would hesitate ta aupprave af the
suggestion at this marnent.
Last year I madle a suggestion wvhich
would, 1 think, -help ta clear tuhe atmosphere.
It was that the law be changed, and that, as
in rnany other countries, every persan be
required ta make a return ta the Department of Finance. At present the law requires anly those persans caming under the
Act ta make a return; sa any one can
excuse hîrnseli irom making a return
by deciding that be does not corne
under the Act. What
objection can
there ibe ta requiring the whole carnununity
ta make returns? T.hen vau wauld have
annually a complete census ai the wealth
ai the people. I see no reasan why everv ane
in the community shauld not be called'upon
ta send in a return, in aider thiat the Depaît.
ment af Finance might see at a glance, when
ail the returns were taibulated, what wua
the exact situation in the country. Until
that is done, 1 arn convinced there will be
suspicion and uneasiness througýhout the
country, because thase wha do make their
returns will feel that there are many others
wha should psy the tax but are not doîng

The discussion cancluded.

HUDSON
APPOINTMENT

STRAIT.

0F SPECIAL

COMMITTEE.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER moved:
That a cammittee of twelve of this House be
appointed ta take evidence and report at this
session upon the navigability and flshery resources of Hudson Bay and Strait, and of the
character of the parts of said Hudson Bay
wlth regard ta, their fitness as railway terminais, and that such committee shall have
power ta eall for persans and papers, and that
the said commlttee do consist of the Honourable Messieurs Bostock, Casgrain, Dandurand,
.P.C., Daniel, DeVeber, Fowier, Lougheed (Sir
James), K.C.M.G.. ]P.C., Michener. Schaffner,
Sharpe, Watson and Willoughby.

Hie said: We are ready 'with aur report,
but it is necessary ta re-appaint the committee in aider to bring it in. The repart is
the resuit af the inquiry made by the coinmittee during the iast two sessions of
Parliament.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Will the hanourlauder? I

able gentleman speak a littie
cou Id nat hear what he said.

Hon. Mr. FOWVLER: In making the
motion, I was just explaining ta the Hause
that this was simýply a farmal. matter; that
the matian was made in arder that the
cammittee might bring- in the repart,'-the
resuit of aur la~bours during the last two
sessions of Parliament.
H-on. Mr. DANIEL: I wauld ask the hanaurable gentleman what difierence there is
between this reference and the reference
ta the former carnmittee, which, sa far as I
amn aware, bas flot yet reported. Is this
exactly the saine reference?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The honourable gentleman fromi Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler> did
not speak very distinctly, but I understand
that the abject ai the appointment af this
coxnmittee now is simply ta edit, in a way,
the report made by the committee during
the -Dast two sessions. I should like ta know
whether that is correct or not, or whether
the intention is that this committee shall
be a sort ai perpetual comrnittee, ta go on,
itaking evidence
session after session,

Bill 21, an Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act (Certificates of Service) .-4-Hon.
Sir James Lougheed.
DIVORCE BILL (GENERAL>.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE AND

PORTED.

RE-

On motion of Hon. W. B. Ross, the Senate
went into committee on Bill J, an Act respecting the Dissolution and the Annulment o! Marriage. Hon. Mr. Gordon in tJhe
Chair.
On section 1-definition "court":
Hon, W. B. ROSS: On account o! a suggestion that came from the honourable
gentleman on the other side o! the House,
I have reconstructed section 1. I move that
this section be struck out, and that the following be substituted:
In this Act, unless-the context otherwise requires. "court" means the court which, in any
province has jurisdiction to dissolve or annul
mnarriage.
?a) This Act shali not apply to the province
of Quebec.
That will be clause 1.
The reason for that change is that in the
clause as it stood the words "Superior
Court" are used. That is suitsble except
with regard to two provinces, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia has a
divorce and matrimonial court, or, as it is
called, a court for divorce and matrimonial
causes; and New Brunswick has a court.
Hon. Mr.. POWER: There is just one
question which occurs to me, honourable
gentlemen, with respect to this clause: that
I do flot find anywhere in this Bill any
statement to, indicate what court in each
province is to have charge of divorce ca-ses.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Bill I provides for
that. If the honourable gentleman will read
Bill I plus the clause in the dhapter o! the
statutes 'relating to interpretation, which
defines the words "Superior Court," he will
see that it is the "'Superior Court" which
bas jurisdiction.

255

Hon. Mr. POWER: That removes my
doubt.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Ross was
agareecl to.
On section 2-relief to respondent on
counter-charge of adultery:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: In moving this section, honourable gentlemen, I do not know
that it is necessary to repeat what I said
the other day, name¶y, that it is made to
deal with a set of facts of this kind. A man
petitions for a divorce from his wife, and
she simply appears, but files no counter
petition against him. At the trial it turns
out that the wife is innocent, but the husband is shown to be an adulterer himself.
This section will give the court power to
grant a divorce to, the wife, notwithstanding that there was no counter petition
made. I think that is provided for in the
English Act, and I am desirous that it
should appýly to ail divorce cases, because
1 think from my experience here that it is
a good thing to make a mnan a littie carefui about going into a court of justice. In
other words, he must see that he has a
pretty dlean record himself before he seeks
a divorce.
Hon. Mr. DMA'DURAND: When such a
situation was disclosed in any case before
the Divorce Committee, you did not act
upon the evidence; you esimply rejected the
petition?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It happened, so far
as I know, in two cases. It happened once
before a committee of which I was a member, and in that case I would have liked
very much to grant the respondent a divorce, but we did not do so. But I am told
there was a case, away b-ack a good many
years agoHon. Mr. POWER: Yes; the Campbell
divorce case.
Hon. W. B. ROSS :-that there was a case
in which that was done.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman if the language
employed in this clause is sufficient to make
plain exactly what he bas just explained
to the committee. It may be quite simple
language to the lawyer, but it looks a little
involved to the ordinary layman.
fHon. W. B. ROSS: I may say to my
honourable friend that it is verbatim with
th, Epglish Act.
Section 2 was agreed to.

* Hon. Mr. PIROUDFOOT: I wvould like ta
have the clause remain as it is, -with the
provision that neither the husband nar the
wif e shall be obliged ta give evidence for
discovery.
Hon. Mr. LYNOfl-STAUNTON: That is
just as bad.
,Hon. Mr. PROIJDFOOT: No, it is flot as
bad, hecause you can secure the evidence
of either the one or the other on the trial
The whole object af the Cammon Law and
of the Statute Law is ta prevent people from
compelling the husband and the wife ta give
evidence against one anather. This is on
account of the saxictity oif the marriage
pact. Noyw, we are dealingy with parties
,who are at arm's length. The same thing
no longer applies; so why should they not
be placed in exactly the same position as
ather witnesses who may he called for the
purpose of giving evidence? Il you are
going to carry this matter ta a logical conclusion, and if people who are guilty ai
adultery are not gaing to, ho obliged ta give
evidence, then you shauld protect any one
who is called as a witness. Il a 'witness is
asked, «"Did you commit adultery with soand-so?" that 'witness ahould be protected.

friend would -go that f ar.

,Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I alsa take no objection whatever ta the clause being

It is generally accepted that a man in such

provision opens the door ta a great deal of
jperjury and many family troubles. The

public is interested in kno-,ving the changed
relations between husband and wife. There
are civil consequences arising irom the
separation or the divorce of which the public should be informed. I would suggest
that section 8 should provide for the publication of the divorce decree, at ail events
when it becomes final.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 think you can
trust to the newspapers to publish the fact
that there was «a divorce. The Attorney
General of the province bas power to deal
withi these divorce cases, and I think that
affords pretty good protection. I do not
see that it would be of any value to sav that
the decree must be puibished.
Hon. lir. BELOOURT: I do not propose
publishing the evidence or any of the proceedings, but I propose that the decree of
divorce should be publishied so that the
general public rnay know that so-and-so
have been divorced. There are some peopie in the community, at ail events, who do

We should take such steps as will tend to
prevent divorces multipiying. As I say,
the public is înterested In k-nowing that the
parties who have been divorced have
-changed their civil status, and that the obligations which resuit froml the marriage re'lation have disappeared. To take a very
homeiy illustration: the corner grocer. who

as rnarried people, is interested; he has
given groceries to the wife on credit because
he knows that she is married to Mr. Smith.

Hon. Mr. BrELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELGOURI: 1 would propose
striking out the words "and after such
final determination no report shall be published without the approval of the said
judge or court," and inserting-, "such final
determination shail he published in at least
one newspaper within the jurisdiction of
the court."
Hon. Mr. POWER: I hope the honourable gentleman from Ottawa tvill not persist in .moving his amendment. The first
subclause of clause 8, 1 think, is admirable- I understand that the honourabie
gentleman proposes that the evidence
should be published.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: No, not the evidence. I stated that distinctly.
,Hon. Mr. POWER: The report embodies
the evidence. My idea is that when the
case is ciosed the judge who tries the case
files a judg-ment in the court; and then
the question arises whether there should
be some special means taken to make this
filin.- known to the public. I contend that
the change proposed by the honourable
gentleman, as far. as it goes, wil simpiy
render useless the first subclause.
'Hon. Mr. BELOOTJRT: No. My honourable frîend does not understand me.
Hon. 'Mr. POWER: My understanding
may not be as acute as that of the honour-"
able gentleman, but I think I understand
the meaninga of the Eng-lish languag-e fairly

Hon. Mr. BELÇOtTRT: I amn afraid my
honourable friend misunderstood me, if he
wants it that way. I said that I did not
wish to change the section in so far as it
prohibits the publication of the evidence.
I thought I had made that as clear as possible. If not, I repeat that I do not want
the evidence published; but I want the
fact published that a decree of divorce has
been granted.
Hon. 'Mr. McMEANS: Would flot the
honourable gentleman have to state by
whom it was to be published?
Hon. Mr. BFLOOUIIT: I would substitute the following words at the end of subsection 1:

thought, in'the light of the speech hie rmade
the other day, that my bonourable friend
would probably have been the first to appreciate a reason of that kind.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I do flot believe in
divorce; but I feel that I caripot vote for
the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman fromt Ottawa, because I
think it confiicts with the earlier part of
subelause 1 of clause 8, which is intended
to prevent the proceedings becoming public.
If the proposed amendment is carried there
is nothing to prohihit any one publishing a
full report. The report includes the evidence of the proceeding as well as the judgment. The honourable gentleman from Ottawa should let subclause 1 remain, and
add such words as these: "When the final
judgment of the court or judge bas been
filed, public notice of such judgment shall
be given in such manner as may be provided
by regulation.- Âfter the final judgment is
recorded in the court, notice is given to the
public. The court would fix the regulations.
Hon. lMr. MeMEANS: I take it that the
amendrnent proposed by the honourable gentleman froïn Mîddleton <Hon. W. B. Ross)
leaves it in the hands of the judge to make
regulations. Surely that is sufficient.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The objection that 1
see to the amendment proposed by the hionourable gentleman from Middleton <Hon.
W. B. Ross) is that it does not say the judge
must do it, but that hie may do it.

this. It is quite 'well known that goods

Hou. Mr. McSWEENEY: Russian goods?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: You can

Hou. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I want ta enlighten my honourable ,friend. While in
Geneva I met a member of the English
House o! Gommons who ha.d a grievance
against the Germans. He had been delegated by his colleaguesl of the House cd

German -people instead o! selling the wine
at the rate at whieh he expected to buy itthat is, at the rate o! a mark for a cent and
a half-immediately jumped up the price,
and he had to pay a great deal more. You
cannot buy German goods as cheaply as
you think you can, if you take the mark
as your 'basis of cal-culation.
Another
reason why you cannot huy Germau goods
as cheaply as you think you can is because in many cases they have put on an
emport tax which goes up to two or three
hundred per cent.

to have some regard for the public. Legal
precision is one subject, but the wants of
a great conumunity are a very different subject, and a Bill that is absurd upon its face
ought not to pass the legishature.
Hon. Mr. THORINE: tHonourable gentie-men, I expressed my opinion yesterday in

respect for the opinions of inembers of the
hegal fraternity with regard to the tecbniicahities of the law, but I must say I have
not the saine confidence in their opinions
with regard to commercial matters. I thînk
this Blill will defeat the object in view. As
1 sad before, the only way to regulate trade
in German goods is through the customs
or by tariff reg-ulation. I behieve that is the
only practical way of settling this matter.
My sentiments are just as strong- as those
of any man in -this House with regard to
Gerinan trade and the attitude which Germany took in the late horrible war, and I
wouhd like to see some step taken te prevent German goods from being imported

if vou desire to carry out the policy of preventing- trade with Germany the only m-ay
te do so is by reguhating the tariff. If under the tariff regulations Gerruan firmns

Hon. Mr. GORDON.- Honourable gentlemen, the arguments that have been advanced against this Bill, or this clause,
might have cwme with good grace before the
war, but for the life of me 1 cannot understand how any person can coRclude that the
passage of this measure would advertise
German goods. How many men in -Canada
to-day who had any blood relation or any
friend engaged in this war could put up a
sign like this: "Dealer in Germnan goodsf"
Why. it is preposterous to think that a sign
like that would advertise Gernman goods.
How niany men in Ottawa-how many members of the Senate--would like to have a

*Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I -would s-uggest
to the mover of tbis Bill that there be added
in the second line of tbiis subsection, after
the woTd "are," the following words: "bona

would read as iollows:
The provisions of this section shall fot apply to dealings in any such goods, wvares or

'would suggest Vo my honourable friend that
as this legishation was not advertised in
advance, this amendment ought Vo be made.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentienien, I feel compelled Vo oppose that suggestion, because o! the fact that it would
only be legislating to assist the ag-ents of
retraders and merchants -who have sent
their representatives to, Germany lor the
specific purpose o! buying German goods
and bringing them here to be sold IVo the
people of Canada. I agree with the hionourable gentleman fromn North Bay (Hon.
Mr. Gordon) that it is an offence ag-ainst
the intelligence and the loyalty of our people
for merchants to have done this thing, and
those who have done it sbould suifer the
consequences of their own act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the

Hon. Mi. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What difference
does the bonourable minister find between

done that but have noV yet received the

of the offence?
Hon. Mi. ROBERTSON: The difference

Norway refused.

Now, I would like te know from the Goyernment-and I may tell the Government
that this country is in no mood to police
Armenia. 1 know it is out of order to make
a speech at this tiine; but I think the country should be reassured at once that no one
ever authorized Lord Curzon, British Foreign Minîster, to speak in the name of
Canada. In any case, the days of Orders in

Canada would be the only authority that
could authorize anybody to speak for Canada.

look at the -matter as cooliy and calmly as
possible, and -not te allow ourselves ta be
-carried away. I eannot say wbat I wish,
but what I have just read is a statement of
the principles held iby a paper of universai
responsibility for ail that it says in regard
ta political matters.
This morning's Ottawa Citizen contains
an article headed "France and the Treaty,"
and which says:
Premier

itti-

That ia, the Prime Minister of Italy-- maires it clear tilat Italy recognizes that
only by a stable Gerniany and an independent
Rusais, can Europe ratura to a seund and progressive basia.

This, honourable gentlemen. is only the
beginning ai the argument. The views af
Premier Nitti are given iairly and without
any bias.
The [Montreal Gazette of April 22nd,
under the heading "Purest Democracy,"
publishes the iollowing statement of the
Prime Minister of Italy:
Italy's forelgn policy Is Inspired by the
purent demnocratic principles. We waiged war,
not againat the German andi Austrian peoples,
but againat Imperial Germnany and Austria.
We must allow Germnany to resumne her place
in the world. Europe will neyer recover etabllity until Germany-that great storehouse of
productive energy--and Russia-that Immense
warehouse cf raw materiale--ere once more
placed in a position to progress and proaper
once more. The whole effort of Italy's policy
la direoted to this end now.

ciple contained in the Bill introduced by
xny honourable friend fromn Hamilton.
Therefore I ask that the House do flot proceed with the consideration of the matter
now, but that it be allowed to stand until
oeuesday or Wednesday so that honourable
gentlemen rnay have time to think it over,
and decide whether it .is right or wrong.'
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Honourable gentlemnen, I see no good reason why the request to discharge this motion until Tuesday should flot be accepted. There is no
great rush to crystallize this legisiation into
a statute. I regard it as legisiation of a
rnost rnischievous character. There is unrest enough now in this country, without
exploding such a bombshell as this, whieh
.will cause a great deal of difficulty, trouble,
and dissatisfaction. I arn going to move
that this Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be read a third tirne this day six
rnonths.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I will second the
motion.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: I can see that the
motion of my honourable friend rnay be
the means of killing this Bill altogether.
While I ar nfot at ail favourable to the
Bill, yet I would rather see it corne up and
be discussed on Tuesday or Wednesday. I
think the honourable gentleman who introduced the Bill (Hon. Mr. Lyýnch-Staunton) will probably accede to the very rea6sonable request that was rmade to have the
Order for the third reading of this Bill discharged, and placed on the Order Paper
next week. If the Flouse then feels like givinga the Bill the six months' hoist I shall
acquiesce; but I think an opportunity
,shnuld he given of further discussing the
Bill next Tuesday.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I intend to support the motion for
the six rnonths' hoist, and for two reasons.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN:

Louder.

Hon, W. B. ROSS: The first reason is,
as I stated yesterday, that even if you
accept the principle of the Bill the application of it is too wide. It would be an
improvement if the Bill were narrowed down
to goods manufactured in Germany. As I
pointed out yesterday, it covers a great deal
more ground than that. Any raw material
produced in Gerniany, and sold to any other
nation on earth, and there used 'in the
manufacture of an article sent to this country, would bring that article within the
provisions of the Bill. 1 thinlç the promioHon. Mr. CLORAN.

ter of the Bill would have been wise to
accept the suggestion to let the third reading of the Bui stand over until next Tuesday, to give an opportunity of considering
whether or flot it should be narrowed in
its scope.
But there is a further question. The relations bet.ween Great Britain and her
Allies and Gerrnany and her Allies
were settled by the Treaty of Versailles, which contained very elaborate provisions to guard against Gerrnany passing
*any snide legisiation with regard to foreign goods. The Arnericans complained of
-such treatruent under the favoured nations
clause with regard to oil. They claimed
that the Germans had resorted to, underhand practices, and had passed regulations
in regard to the railways, which were Government-owned, which operated in favour
-of the home article and against the foreign
article, and took away the 'whole benefit
of the~ favoured nations clause. 1 exarnined the Treaty of Versailles somewhat care.fully, and there are in it elaborate regulations guarding against that very thing. I
think my honourable friend should study
the Treaty and see whether he is not now
proposing legislation which is contrary to
the spirit, if flot the letter of the Treaty.
If this Parliarnent passed this Bll it is not
certain that the British Government rnight
not have to disallow it. Il my honourable
friend will not agree to let the Bill stand
until next Tuesday, I shahl support a motion
for the six months' hoist.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
honourable gentleman 'frorn Middleton, in
order te injure the Bill, has advanced a
number of arguments founded on nothing.
Where is there a word in the Treaty which1
is infringed upon in sny way by this Bill?
W~e have ail seen the Treaty. If there were
anything in the Treaty in jeopardy by
reason of the Bill, I rwould agree to withdraw it. But there is nothing whatever
in that contention. Neither the honourable
gentleman froru Middleton nor any one else
has advanced a single argument showing
that the Bill controverts the Treaty. Two
years ago this Bill was passed unanimously
by this House; flot a vote was taken. This
session it lhas passed the second reading
and the cornrittee stage, and has been discussed again and again, and, until now, not
one word has been said about the Treaty.
.Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I regret very much that my hionourable friend did not accede to the request
of an honourable member of this House to

APRIL 23, 192027
allow this iatter to stand until next Tuesday. This Bill was discussed when it came
Up for second reading on Tuesday last; it
was considered in cornmittee on Thursdayonly yesterday-and -was put down for its
third reading to-day.
*My honourable
friend cannot say that there bas been any
delay in forwarding the Bill. The criticism
that bas been made of the Bill has, I think,
been fair and juat criticism; and I think
the honourable gentleman, if anything,
sho-wed rather too much of a disposition,
wh'en we were in committee, to pus!h the
Bill throu.
I did not make any remarks on tbe Bill
on tbe second reading. I tbought that
probably the sentiment that the Germans
should realize the enormity of tbeir crime
in forcing war upon the 'world should be
brought home ta them as strongly as possible, and, if it rwas possible to emphasize
that in any way, I thought it vas the right
tbing to do. I did not see, however, how
this'Bill w-as going ta operate. 1 boped
that during the discussion in committee we
would have got the information necessary
to show us how tbe Bill was going ta wark.
My honourable friend. bas referred ta the
fact that the Bill went thraugh the House
two yýears ago. At that time we were at
war with Germany, and, as I understand,
tbere wvas na possibility of German goods
being brougbt into Canada. As the honourable gentleman from Middleton (Hon. W.
B. Ross) bas said, we are to-day in a different position: we bave entered into the
Treaty of Versailles,
the
terma
of
which we are bound to carry out, and
we want ta see everytbing done ta bring
about peace and barmony in the world.
My bonourable friend controverta the statement that this would in any way interfere
wlth trade, or with-the principle of the
Treaty dealing with the question of trade;
but I think he bas not studied the clauses
of the Treaty elosely enough ta see that,
as the honourable gentleman from Middleton stated, it is specially provided in the
Treaty that the 'German nation shail nat
do anything ta bamper trade between their
own country and any of the Allied nations..
Tbey bave to receive the same treatment
as Germany would give ta any of the nations tbat were allied with ber during the
war. I think we are interfering witb that
princîple.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH--STAU.NTON: Will the
bonourable gentleman allow mie ta ask him
a question? It bas been the law in England that- goods brouglit in from Geriany
8-181,

-hould be marked, "Made in Germany."
Where is there in principle any distinction
to be drawn between that legisiation and
this?,
Hon. Mr. B0STOCK: That refers to the.
goods.
Yes.,Hon. Mr. LYtNRC-6TAUNTON:
Foreign goods were marked in order that.
people might buy home-made goods. Where,.
in principle, is there any difference between,
that legislation and thisP
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: By this legisiation:
you propose to make people throughout the
whole country advertise that they are im-porting German goods.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: And what
is the difference?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think there is
considerable difference.
Hon. 'Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
slightest difference.

Nat the

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Anybody wbo bas
suffered in the war, as the people in England and the people in this country have,
will flot be disposed to buy German good-unless they cannot possibly belp it. If 1
may speak for myseif, I should certainly
flot desire to buy them unless I were absolutely forced to do so. But to make it a
crime for people to buy German goods is
an unjustifiable interference with the trade
of this country.
Hon. Mr. LYNOHSTAUNTOtN: The honourable gentleman will pardon me.
The
Bill does flot provîde that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: The Bill provides
that any man who deals in German goods
bas to state that on bis stationery, and
advertise it ta the world, and it puts hlm
under the obligation of finding out wbere
the goods came from.
,Hon. Mr. LYNJHSTAUNTOiN: No.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
Well, he would
have to trace tbem Up.
*Hon. .Mr. MURPHY: "Knowingly," it
says.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: I certainly consider
that this legisiation la not based on British
principles of justice and fair play, and that
it is a great mistake for the Senate of
Canada to pass such legisiation at this time.
Hon. Mr. CRSoBY: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot intend to vote on a matter
s0 important as this without explainingý

SENATE

why I vote as 1 do. But 1 rnust first con.gratulate my lionourable friend fromn Vic-toria (Hon. Mr. Gloran >-and I am sure
1hat in doing- so I voice the sentiments of
-every honourable member in this Chamber

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CROISBY. And I arn sure we al
jQin in liopîng and trusting that from day
to day and from week to week lie will recuperate in such fashion that we shall hear
him as we dîd in the past-but with a
changed view, of course.
This Bill, 1 believe, would flot have gone
aa far as it lias gone liad it not been for
the popularity of the honourable gentleman
wlio introduced it and the fact that we
look upon him as a man of abuhity devoting
a great deal of care and consideration to
any matter which lie brings before this
Ilouse. Pcisonally I did not at ail expect
,that this Bill would pass the second reading. I thouglit that, after the honourable
gentleman liad given expression to his
views, the Bill would have been withdrawn.
We would ail 'have liked to see sornething
done with the Kaiser and others wlio were
responsible for the war. In that we agree
'with the lionourable gentleman. But, on
the other hand, we know that there are
men wlio are dloser to this question than
we are, and whio understand it better. Lloyd
George, the Premier of the British Empire
-we might alrnost say, o! the world-seerns
to lie satisfled. I cannot state the case
inuch more strongiy than lias been done by

B.
-whorn I always like to follow in matters of
-this kind. Great Brîtain and France and
'the other Allies-wliat are they doing? My
bhonourable friend Hon. Mr. Lynch-StaunUon) saye this Bill passed two years ago,
and the lionouraible gentleman, who lias
just taken lis seat an.swers: "Yes, but we
-were at vwar at ffiat time; we have since
-adopted a Peace Treaty." We have unaniinously decided to accept that Peace Treaty.
'Are wve goîng to have the peace which wve
biave -been looking for? Are we going to cry
'«Peace, peace !" and then to declare -a cominercial war? Shall we say that we have declared peace, but we do not mean peace
and are not looking for peaceP I think, lioncourable gentlemen, tha't we iu this House
:should lie very guarded and very careful.
As I said before, I find it difficult to oppose
a Bill whicli lias been introduced by my
learned and honourable friend from Hamilton,,(Hon. Mr. Lyncli-Staunton), and I feel
-very strongly -againsit the Gerrnans, parHon. Mr. CROSBY.

ticulariy ag-ainst the Kaiser and others who
were responsible for bringing about a 'war
in Which so many lives were sacrificed
for the re-eÉtablishment of freedorn and o'
peace. But.now that peace lias been restored
we trust it will continue for rnany, many
years to. corne; and sureiy 'we are not goingto give expression to a view differing so
greatly from, the views of the leaders whom
we have followed. We followed Britain in
this war; we foiiowed France in this war.
<Jan 'we not stili follow the example of Great
Britain and of France?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Itaiy aiso.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: While some German
goods may <be brouglit by -merchants into
this country, we mnust reme-mber that, on
the other hand, we have a great many
goods -that Germany wants to buy. I might
-mention some of them. 1 think one of the
best customers we have in Europe for the
lobster trade of this country is *Gerrnany.
The Germans are also customrers for ouir
lumber and many other products. If -%ve
do not buy German goods, they are flot
going 'ta buy our goods. Whule we may flot
be particulariy anxious for Germany to put
herseif again in the position 'which she
occupied just .before the war-while we may,
in fact, take great care to keep lier frorn
occupying any position in which she can
ever give us more trouble, yet I think we
ouglit to be 'willing and ready to maintain
the peace of the world as it shouid be maintained. Therefore I întend to vote against
the Bill. I would 'have preferred to see it
held over, as. requested by the honourable
member for St. John, until Tuesday. Nobody could have been harmed. With regard
to any important Bill that cornes before
this Hlouse, when any honourable gentleinan asks to have its consideration deferred
in order that hie may examine into it further, the Bill s'hould always be held over,
unless there is sorne very serious reason
for proceeding 'with it immediately. I have
corne to the conclusion to vote for the
motion made by the lionourable gentleman
from St. John, and ta vote against the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: As there
lias been so muci -commotion aroused about
this, I would like to state that I am 'willing
that the third reading should stand until

The Hon. the SPEAKER: That cannot lie

IS6LAND1Sý SERVICE.

On the Orders of the Day:
I would like to
lion. JOHN MUcLEKN:
byring to the attention of the Government a
mnatter of great importance to a certain
section of the Dlominion. As lionourable
gentlemen rnay know, at the close of the
season of navigation last flu, the Lady
Evelyn' was unable to performi service, and
the car ferry was sent down to Pictou to release the Canadi-an Sealer, which was then
lying there. It took the freight and passengers from Pictou to Souris, and
then made an attempt to reach the Magdalen islands, but failed. The Governiment
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

then sent the steamer 'Montcalmn down to
Souris to take part of the freiglit and passengers on board. It took lier six weeks
to get to the Mag-dalen islands. I may say
that aIl the fishing supplies for the MagdIalen islands, or nearly ahl that would be required for the spring, wvere on board the
Canadian Sealer. On the 29th of Mardli I

received a telegram froin the Magdalen ilands ask-ing about the ice conditions. I
called the attention of the Deputy Minister
of Marine and Fisheries to the matter, and
lie said that the steamer would be attended
to at once.
On the 19th o! April I received the folloving telegram:
Frank Leslie arrlved Sunday In smnall schooner fiom Magdalenes and rerorts no Ica between
M.agdalenes and Souris. Understand likely
Evelyn under repairs until June. and steamer
Guide replaclng lier le now at Pictou. but waiting slip repairs. which will delay lier sorne
tirne. The crew for Sealer le not yet here, and
sorne delay will lie necessary s.fter they arrive.
Would urge that Sealer complete lier trip to
Magdalenes and avoid further expenses and delay of cargo. Wili you kindly see Mr. Johnston
and advise us by wire.

I called up Mr. Johnston, Deputy M4inister
of Marine and Fisheries, and he told me hie
hiad nothing to do with the niatter; that the
steamer belonged to the Railway Departnient. I then called up the Railway Department and was, told they liad nothing
to do with it; the steamer liad not been
handed over to them up to that time, and
I had better apply to the Department o!
Trade and Commerce. I applied to the Department of Trade and Commerce, and they
said they had nothing to do xvith lier: it was
a matter for the Department of Marine and

Fisheries. In this wvay I hiad to go ail the
rounds, and those people were without their
fishing supplies. As eévery lionourable gentleman knows the lobster season opened yesterday. The steamer is at Souris witli no
captain and no crew, with the exception o!
the engineers who were left on board o! lier

last fah. Among other things, there were
on board 120 casks o! gasoline. There is no
gasoline on the Magdalen islands and not a
boat in that place -could go out.. Tlîere are
on the Magdalen islands about 6,500 people.
most o! whom are employed in the fislieries, and without gasoline they would be unable even to get tlieir nets. I think that
whoever is responsihie for this delay and
carelessness regarding a steamer wortlî
$300»00 or $400,000, lying there without a
captain, should be taken to task. As I un-

derstand, she is to ply between Charlottetown and Newfoundland during the sumnier and should have been at Mag-dalen

an Ae to confirm an agreement between
His Majesty the King and the Corporation

of the City of Ottawa. Hon. Mr. Crosbv in

Section 1 -%as agareed to.
On the schedule:
HLon. Mr. -TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I should lik-e to ask the leader of the
Government, now that some changes are
ibeing made in respect to t.he city of Ottawa,
if it is the intention of the Government to
make the uwners of 'buildings re'nted by the
,Government pay their taxes to tihe city. It
seenis to me that ail 'the property rented by
the Go'verniment dhould ibe lef t -in exactiy
the samne position that îît would be lui if it
were rented to private individuais at about
haif the rentai paid by the Government
and that the owners should pay the taxes.
If I uwn a building and rent it to an individuai and pay -the taxes and water rates,
why, wfhen I rent it to the Government
for more than 1 could get frorn any one

honourable gentlemen, that tihere are verymany buildings rented by the Govern'ment
frosu private individuais. When the Governiment put s up.a new 'building the overflurw goes into it, 'and 'very littie of the
space previously occupied by the overflow
is released. This has not ibeen -the case
under only one governiment; .it has 'aiways
been thé case. 1 think tihe filme has come
when the owners of -buildings rented to the
Goverunent sbouid be lef t in exactly the
saine position as they would bccupy if their
buildings were rented t0 private drndividuals.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that the Government is not claiming
exemption from taxation on properties flot
owned hy the Crown. Buildings ýwhich are
rented by the iGovernment are su-hject to
taxation, the sanie as if they 'were occupied
or rented by an individuai. The only exemption from taxation is in the case of lands.

up again for consideration.
Hon. Mr. TURlUF: 1f the o'wners of
such buildings are now paying taxes, they

DEVELOPMENT 0F QIL SHALE-S IN
CANADA.
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE.

~Hon.

Mr. DOMVILLE (for Hon. Mr.
Fowler) moved the adoption of the second
report of the special committee appointed
to inqu~ire into the subject of the development of oul shales in Canada.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I have not hiad the pleasure of reading this report, and perhaps Cther members
of tihe House are in the samne position as
inyseli. Before conîmitting itsehf to the report, the House should know, at any rate
substantially, what it contains.
I have just had a copyy o!f the report
handed to me. I find that the report which
we are asked to adopt contains Udhis statemnent:
'Your comrniittee have examnined a numnber of
witnesses and in consequence would recommend

that the scotie of their inquiry be eniarged by
including therein iron ore and coal deposits;
alzo whether further and better means niight
not be placed at the disposai of the Department
of Mines for the attainment of the above ends.

If we deal with iron ore and coal de-_
posits it seems to me that -e shall be trespassiing upon the aphere of thbe Geolog-ical
Survey people; and it .may mean quite a
long inquiry and the examination o! a great
niany 'witnesses without producing any substantial result.
Hon. Mr. DOM VILLE: Oil and fuel and
iron are very clos-ely alhied. I fancy the
hionourable gentlemen inaking this suggestion have thought it advisable to cover
more ground and bring out more information. They are good enougli to give their
time. There is no money asked for.
The report was adopted.
DOMINION LANDS BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMNnITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Loughieed,
the Senate went into comimittee on Bill 55,
an Act to amend The Dominion Lands Act.
Hon. Mfr. Blain in the -Chiair.
On section 1-additionah definition:
Hon. Mr. POWER: This is a somewhat
imporiant measure, and I think, with the
heave of the House, we would flot object to
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

'the leader of the Governiient explaining
each clause of the Bill as we go along.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I said
the other day, the amendments are of a
iniscellaneous character, and do not emhody any particular principle or policy;
thev have relation more to the procedure
of the Act than to anything- else. We are
placing an interpretation on the word
"Allies" so as to include the Allied and
Associated Powers. As honourable gentlemnen know, the United States was not an
Ally with ourselves in the great war, but
%vas an Associated Powver, and the object
is simply to include the U.nited States in
the word "'Allies."
Hon. Mr. POWER: Suppose the United
States put an embargo on Canada's white
paper business, as they are talking of doing?'
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would not znake any difference to the provisions of the Act. or would not stand in
the way o! our receiving American settIvrs
upon our lands. We are very glad to have
thein, for they are axnongst the very best
,settlers we have on Dominion lands, and 1
think it is very desirable that encouragemient should bie given to them.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On sectioni 2--letters patent may issue
whiere settler has no adequate knowledge of
Engalish or French language, but has complied with other conditions:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen will remember that at the
hast session it was pointed ont that under
the Naturalization Act provision should be
made for that class of settler wvho could not
speak, Frenchi or English, but who spoke
another language, and that discretion
should be vested in the Secretary of 6tate
to issue to him a certificate of naturalizatioln.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That wouhd be

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. We
restricted hetters of na-turalization to certain
classes of aliens; but it was pointed out that
that class o! aliens had already entered for
homnestead duties and had performed their
duties upon the hand, and not 'being able
ùr get letters o! naturalization they were
prevented from obtaining their patents.
This discretion was therefore given to the
Secretary of State, to make inquiry into
such cases and issue letters of naturaliza-

their disability in that regard.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4--disposai of unsold portion
of school lands to be after valuation by
officiai of d'gpartment:
Under
Hon. Sir JAMES WÀUGHEED:
this section the minister has power to sel
as well as to, lease a fraction of a school
The present Act provides that
section.
only a certain area of the land shall be
sold; but there are cases where there may
be a fraction outside of that area, and this
section gives authority to seli that fraction.
The school lands are held in trust, and are
subjeet to certain regulations, and a certain
routine has to, be complied with before sale.
The fact is that if there is a restriction no
harmi is done.
Hon. Mr. WVIATSON 4 I assume that the
Provincial Governments will be consulted
with regard to this particular section, because the school lands belong to them, and
the Dominion Government is only holding
them as trustee.
Hon. Sir J*AMES IaOUGEEED: Yes, but
provision is made in -the Dominion Land
Act whereby the funds are placed in a trust
fund, and of course an accounting is mnade
to the Provincial Governments or cestui

qui trusts from time to time.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: This is excluded
fromn the section enabling the Dominion
Government to seil lands?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHFIED: Yes.

Hon. iMr. PROUIDFOOT: On ail the railThe
wass there was a general increase.
salaries of those engaged in the mail service were also increased, -and in that way
the cost of transportation was increased.
My information is to the effect that, although those increases were made, neyertheless the postal rates were not increased,
and that therefoie the mail-order houses
were able to carry on business at practically
what it cost them to do so prior to the increase in freight rates. If that is so, it is
unfair discrimination in favour of the mailorder bouse, and it is a kind of discrimination which should be put an end to.
%Ve must consider the eff ect it lias on business in the rural municipalities and i the
towns and 'villages. We find throughout

Another object of the motion is to enable Government is concernied. The railways are
me to deal with tbe question of postal rates,_ carrying the mail-order business at leas than

The mail-order business is one of great im- the means for carrying it at lese than cost.

localities would not be entirely rural districts, as they are being -made ',y the
change which bas been gradually brought
about in the mode of business 'by the mailorder houses. No one objects to fair compe'tition, but w-hat people do object to-and
I think they have a right to object to itis unfair competition; and the competition
is unfair when one class secures an advantage over another, at the expense of the
whole public.
The objeet in desiring to distinguish between the provinces is to ascertain what
amount of mail-order business is ýbeing done
by the various houises, say in the province
of Ontario. WVe can in that %vay ascertain
whether the mail-order business is being
carried on more extensively in Ontario 'than
in any of the other provinces; and if that
is the case, and I arn correct in rny surmise that t.his service is being carried, on
at a loss te the couintry, then Ontario is
securing an adva.ntage over the rest of the
Dominion. If the service is being performed
at a loss, the sooner the Governmentmnakes
a change in that respect the better. Otherwise the same unfair conditions will continue in the future as in the pasi.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There wil]
be no difficulty about motion No. 2.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:- I arn speaking
of the first motion.

I arn' referring to the

question raised by the honourable leader
as t-o the possibility of this being iL violuminous return which it-mîght take so long
to prepare that it would not be worth while
havîng it for this Session. If I can secure
a return within a short time to paragraphs
1 and 2, particularly No. 2, the information
will cover practically ail that is required. I
think that the report which the Governiment
bas in its possession will cover nearly al
the information that is asked for.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, but
the probabilities are that the Railway Commission wili not permit the original documents to go out of its possession and be laid
upon the table of the House. It will prepare a copy.

The evîdence subrnitted to the

commission upon this subject must be very
voluminous indeed. 'My honourable friend
can very well appreciate the unwisdom, so
to speak, of placing original documents on
the table of Parliament.

We have to rely

upon copies being -ruade. But if my honourable friend would -attend at t-he Railway
Oom-mission and look over the material, .be
would obtain the desired information more
readily than by moving for a return, par-

fâcularly one which it would take so long
to -prepare.
Hon. Mr. PROUD)FOOT: Ail I arn asking
in par'agraph 2 is a copy of -the report, flot

of the evidence. .But

I arn not particular

about the evidence if I arn given the report
asked for under paragraph 2.
The motion was agreed to.

MOTION FOR RETURN.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT moved:
1. That an order of the Senate do Issue for a
return of the minutes of the ]Board of Inqulry,
No. 158, taken under The Immigration Act, at
Vancouver, B.C., on July 3. 1919, deallng wlth
the. case of Lee Quong Kip, a Chines. student,
who sought admission into Canada.
2. The finding of the sald board.
All correspondence whlch passed between
W.3. D. Scott, of the Department of Immigration and Colonization at Ottawa, and Ping Lee
or any other person or official in relation to the.
said matter, Including correspondence wlth the
ndnister and his findlng.
4. The. order of deportation of the. said Lee
Quong ]KIP.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I desire

to point ont some o-f the circumstances

of

this particular case, which bas already received a good deal of consideration. I wish

to place before the House some of the dîfficulties that Ghinese have te contend with
in securing admission to this country. On
May 27, 1918, a letter was written by Mr.
Scott, of the Department of Immigration,
acknowledging receipt of $500 froru Ping
Lee, a brother of this young man. Aiccording to the contents of the letter, although
the young man was to be brought in at Vancouver, the case was deait with as an Ottawa
registration, the Controller of Chinese Immigration at tbe port of arrivai. sending bere

tbe pbotograph, etc., od this young man.
The $500 baving been paid by the brother,
this young man arrived in Canada on the
l4th April, 1919. On bis arrivai an objection
was taken
to
bis
entry
into
this

country on the ground that be was
within the restrictied class, and bad
therefore no rigbt to be allowed-in. An inquiry was held on the 3rd of July, 1919,
before some officer out there. .1 cannot
quite make out bis name, altbough it is
signed to this document; but I believe bis
name is A. L. Jolliffe. The evidence taken
on that inquiry wais disp)se>d of in a inost
summary way by this officiai. He says: «'I
hereby reject Lee Quong Kip aud order that

SENATE
he be dcperted, he being a prohibited immigrant uner P. C. 1202." The peculiarity
about P. C. 1202 is that that order
was passed on the 9th June, 1919,
and was net in effect at the time
when the yeung man ianded in Canada, nor
at the time when bis money %vasreceived,
and when, in view of the information which
bac! been given by bis brother, he was said
te be a proper subject te come te thîs country. This young man was about seventeen
years ef age, and the intention of his brother
and bis friends in bringing him into O0anada
was te compiete bis educatien. Up te the
tirne that he ieft China he had always been
geing te schooi. His brother, wbe lives in
Toronto and is in geed circumistances, desired te bave him eut here for the purpose
ef giving him an education, se that
lie rnight subsequentiy, on returning
te -China, be of some use in disseniinating the Engiish language in China.
The oficiai at Vancouver, for'some reason,
took very strong grounds, and, as I read
the summary of bis remarks. he declined
te aliow Lee Queng Kip te came into this
country.
I have examined with a great deai ef care
the evidence given befere that Board of Inquiry, and I venture te say that honourable gentlemen reading that evidence witheut bias-and I believe none of you have
any bias in this particular case-wili coe
te the very opposite conclusion from that
ef tbe officiai in Vancouver. The question
was net aliowed te rest there, because the
young man had friends in Canada who were
interested in having the regulation, as they
understeed it, carried eut; and, as I have
pointed eut, this was net a Vancouver registration, but an Ottawa one. Why the officiai at Vancouver saw fit te take the course
lie did, and direct that ble should be deported, I fau te comprehend. That actien
-was prevented for sanie time by a habeus
corpus having been secured fromn the courts,
and security. given, and the young man was
kept ini Vancouver on bail for a considerable time. The case went te the Court of
Appeal. but that did net heip the young man,
for that court said they had ne jurisdiction
te deai with the question, because section
23 of the Immigration Act prohibited thern
from doing se, and, as Mr. Justice Martin
expressed it, -The section says, 'Hands
off.'"We have heard se rnuch here within the
iast few days, in discussing another matter,
about British fair play, and how Great Bnitain desired te deai fairiy and squareiy
with other people, that 1 sheuid like te
Hon.

Mr.

PROUJDFOOT.

say that Great Britain has a speciai reason
for being on friendly terms with China and
Japan, and the people in the East; yet we
find that the officiai at Vancouver has seen
dit to rejeet this young man. I wouid not
care so much about the matter if it rexnained with the officiai. alone; but it was
taken up in another way. I amn counsel for
the Chinese National League for the' province of Ontario, -which has branches ail
over the Dominion of Canada, its object
being to assist the Chinese-they object to
our'caiiing them Chinarnen. It is said by
some people that they are not desirable im-migrants, and that may -be se in some re.spect8; but people from one end of this
'Dominion te the other are anxious to secure
the services of good Chinamen to look aiter
their cooking and other bousehold arranements. They are required bo pay a head
tax of $500 apiece. Many of the Chinanien
are gambiers, but that ciass does not beiong
to this league, which was estabiished for
the purpose of preventing the ehinese from
-being led away into garnbiing habits. The
secretary of the ieague for the province of
Ontario is a brother of this youngc man who
was refused admission into this province
under what is said to be an Order in'Councii, No. 1202. The matter was brought before the department, but the department desiring'no doubt to stand by what the official at Vancouver had done, refused te interfere.
1 1 have brought this matter up, not because it is going to do any good to this particular young man, but for the purpose of
placîng before this House and the country
the manner in which officiais of the Government have seen fit to deal with people
who, as 1 contend, are desirabie immigrants to this country. 1 tried to secure a
stay ef proceedings from the minister by
writing to the department, but the last
,letter, which I received on the 16th of
February, was to the effeet that the minister had given the matter consideration, but
did not see fit to stay the proceedings se fir
-as Lee Quong Kip was concerned. If matters are to be disposed of in this summary
way I thînk a change sbould be made in
the iaw, and I desire te have this information brought down by return for the purpose, among other things, of ascertainingexactly what actuated the minister in reaching bis conclusion. I think it is oniy fair
that we shouid have this information, and
that such a proceeding as happened in this
case shouid not occur again. The Govern,ment got this young man into the country.
They received bis $500, and so far as I
know they did net even return the money,

APRIL 28, 1920

although I do not know how they sent the
young many baek. Prcobab1y tbey used
some of the $500 for that purpose; but the
,balance of that $500 should stili be in the
hands of the department, and has not been
returned. I therefore move for the return.
The motion wab agreed to.

Tead a third time but that it be read this

Like thousands et other people, when I go

I de not want to be put te the bether of
stating that I do not want German goods.
I would be satisfied if ive had the goods
marked "Made in Germany," but <that is
not always done, and a far more cenvenient
and surer way is tee one proposed in this'
Bill. When I cannet get German goods
except in a store over which there is a sign
stating "German goods sold here," I will
net ha put te any bother, and that is te
reason why I will vote for this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: What will you do
when you write te a Geuiman house for
goods?
Hon. MT. SMITH: I will net write te a
German house. I do net know wheteer it
is going te reduce or increase tee quantity
of Germain goods sold in this country. We
have heard two sets of arguments--one
claiming that the putting et this sign
upon premnises where German goods are
.sold will increase the sale of those goods.

-

If that is se, then there is nothing, to the
other. argument, that we inust trade with.
Germany in order lJhat Germiany may xnake
rnoney te pay the indemnities te the Allies.
I arn inclined to the French view: 1 do not
care a hoot whether Germany is ever able
to build up or not. Germany deserves to
remain just where she is to-day, and if
there were neyer any Gerrn.an goods sold
in Canada, or in any other part «f te
British Em'pire, I wou.ld not be at ail concerned. Therefore 1 intend to vote for the
Bill.

When the Bill was up some sessions ago,
we 'were at war with Germany, and there
were resons in favour «d the Bill which
asppealed dtrongly te Canadians generally.
I must say, ho'wever, that the Bill did not
appeal very 8trongly te me. Thie situation
to-day is entirely dïifferent to what it was
then. A etate of peaoe haqs been substituted
for the state id w-ar 'which prevailed on
the previous occasion. We have entered
into an agreement, being one of the parties
te the Treaty of Peace, and 'we are in an

elaborate that argument. I juat want te
say, heiwever, that to me the Bill, both in
letter and in spirit, is in absolute oonfiict
with the covenants and undertakings which
we, as one of the parties to the League of
Nations, have made.
Hon. B. C. PRWSE: Honourable gentlemen, I listened 'witlh a ged deal of attention to xny honourable iriend from Hamilton (Hon. MTr. Lynéh-Staunton), and I
must say that every tissue in this body
vibrated, every dro'p of blood in these veins
moved, just a little faster 'when I heerd
hini, and I was perfectly satisfied that the
honourable gentleman had made his point.
But the second reading ef the Bill was
ruAhed thmrugh, and at the third reading,
when I wae ohut off, and not allofwed to
speak. I began te think there was semething
more ait the back of it. Sentiment is one

thing is loyalty-and 'there is diehoneet

but 'we have nat alsways go't it. I wil give

rightly so; but 'when saine one attempta to

I wouhd not buy an article of German

to buy German goods-because there are
German goods whicb we cannot go witbout
-I wauld not -force him ta put up a sign.
Take, for instance, German fertilizer.
Would you force a rnan selling that fertilizer ta put a sign aver bis door saying,
"«W. sell German goods"P Would you force
hum te put on bi satationery the words,
"German goods for sale." I. say it would
nat be fair. Would you ask the. farmer who
buys that fertihizer and uses it, when bie
brings bis Ioad of potatees to market, ta
put up a sign, saying, "Potatoes grown by
German fertilizer." Would you force every
second store from Vancouver to Prince Ed8-19

6

ward Island to put a sign over the door,
««German goods for sale here?" I say no.
I say that this Bill, initead of being a loyal
Bill, is the most disloyal Bill that ever
came before this Hou-se. Here is Great
Britadn with hier arma open to German
trade. and here we are, one of Britain's biggeat customers, saying, "No, we won't trade
with you." We do not go to .Germany to
buy the goods, but to Great Britain. If- a
îuan's loyalty amounts ta >anything, he
must be loyal to himaelf. If we are not
loyal ta ourselves, we cannot be loyal to our
familles and ta our country. I say thst the
firet essential of loyalty, il I understand
it aright, is that we should be loyal to the
Mather Country and should .trade with hier.
But what will England think: if we pasa
this Bill and say to bier, "We won't buy
any German gooda from you,' and cut
them. out? I say, gentlemen, it is not fair.
I might here quote Ma.caulay, who in 1846
said- -There is a mutual dependency between nations that we cannot get away
from." That sentiment bas neyer been
controverted by any o! the great statesmen
in the British Empire, or in any other country. It bas neyer been disputed until now,
when our honourable f riend from Hamilton
cornes here and says that it is ail wrong. I
say, gentlemen, that it ie ail right. If we
want to be loyal, for Heaven's sake, let
ut; be loyal to ourselvea and let us be loyal
tsb the Britjish Empire. and not pass this
Bill, because, by passing it, we would be
loyal to no one.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER:- Honourable gentlemen, before 1 express to the House my
reasons for the vote which I arn about to
give. on this Bill, I wish to say to the honourable gentleman from Hamilton <Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton> that I did not, and I
do flot now, agree with what hie esaid when
he introduced this Bill concerning the
Firat Minister o! England, Right (Hon.
David Lloyd George. On the contrary, I
disagree with every word hie said with regard to that distinguished statesman, to
wham I, and every man in this House and
ini t'his country, owe -a debt of gratitude
that I do not know how we shaîl ever be
able to repay. I do not agree with my honourable friend in his severe condemnation
-of the fact that those of the enemy who
should have been punislied have not been
punîshed. I arn not in a position, nor is

could have found legal rnachuinery to carry
out the sentence. I do not know how it
could have been done. and therefore I arn
mxt gaing to sit in judgment and say that
I condemn others who faihed to punish
them.
Having disagreed with my honourable
friend on these points, I find myseif just
,where I was two years ago. What we said
et that time was that at the end of the war
we 'would force our merchants ta put up a
sign on every store where they handhed German goods in this country, which sign would
tell the people going in there ta trade that
they were dealing with a firm buying and
ehling German goods, and thereby put
thern on their guard.
My honourable friend from Prince Edward Jsland (Hon. Mr. Pro'wse) taîks about
curtailing and preventing trade. There is
nothing in this Bill about preventing trade
with Germany. There is not one word
that says that we cannot buy Gerrnan
goods if we want to. But I know that the
majority of Canadians do flot want ta.
Borne o! us neyer want to see a German
face again, -and we realize that we owe
a debit to, the boys who are dead, and ta
the boys who fought, and when any mernbers of Rny farnihy go inte a store I want
thern ta have à chance to know whether
the goods they are buying are German
goods or goods made hy some nation who
wihl not use the profits of Canadian trade
to start another war with us at the first
opportunity.

who wilh bie glad ta know that we advertîsed their goods or that there are men in
Canada-if there are any such-who are
sa far forgetful o! their duty to Canada and
ta the Canadian soldiers that they would
deal in German goods. But, as against
that, I do not want people to go unwittinghy inte a store in Canada and think they
are buying Canadian, Aamerican, or English
goods, and have palmed off on themn goods
from a country that I detest and shall continue ta hate so long as I have a drap of

Honourable gentlemen, 1 arn going to

it can be. There will he vast difficulties

twa years ago I1 voted in favour of the
-principle of a mnan wha sold GeTman goods

so, and I arn going to stick to that principle to-day. I arn not going to say that
I have gone back on it because there is
less danger of the German flag flying over

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentie-men, I generally see eye to eye with the
Hamilton
honourable gentleman fron
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton:), but I regret
to say that on this occasion 1 arn unable
to support the Bill wbich be has presented
to this House. In dealingc with this measure we rnust not lose sight of the fact
that 'the British Government has adopted
a policy to encourage trade with Geriany.
One of the reasons. of that, I think, is to
enahie -Germany to pay the indemnity
which she will be called upon to psy to the
Allies. We rnust not lose sight of the fact
that the moment that Eng-land deals extensively with Germany, the great majorîty if not all of the firrns dealing- with merchandise of different kinds will of necessîty, if this Bill passes, he oblig-ed to advertise that they are dealing in German
goods. What effect will that have? The
masses of the people, seeing that nearly
ahl the merchants are dealing in German
goods, and are advertising the fact, wil
corne to buy German goods, and I arn
af raid that, inst-ead of this legislation curtailing the sale of such goods it wîll have
the opposite effect, popularizing the goods,
and extinguishing the sentiment now prevaîhing-, and whîch I hope will endure,
against the purchase or sale o! German
goods. For the reasons J have stated, I
cannot see my way to vote in favour of the
Bill.

APRIL 28, 1920
Honourable
,Hon. W. H. BENNETT:
gentlemen, during the caurse af the discussion hast week, same gentlemen advanced the argument that, as a matter of
firness ta the German manufacturers, we
shouhd deal with them, and for that reason should nat allow this Bill ta pass. I
have heard' a great deal said about the
Kaiser and his part in bringing about the
war; but I want ta say that his part was
infinitesimal -when compared with the part
played by the German manufacturers, wha,
ever since the. war ai 1870 with France,
have worked up the war feeling in Germany. Who worked up the war feeling?
W-as it not the manufacturers? Was not
the aim af Germany ta acquire colonies al
over the world? For what? To lester
German trade. Let any man read the story

where the Krupp worka are, and he will
learu ai the -extraordinary evolution ai
that city. Aiter 'the Franco-Prussian war
it was a small place, but then started the
era in lGerniany that produced this war, an
era af filthy greed for money that started
rnnang the manufacturera. Any mnan who
has ever read the political histary ai
Gerrnany knows that for years past ini
the electians there have been but twa parties, the war party and the anti-war party.
The Socialists were the anti-war party;
why? Because they did not want ta see
a huge debt incurred, and for *vhat purpose? For the benefit ai the Krupps, dealing in guns, or others dealing in clothing
or bouts and shoes. The war spirit was fastered by the manufacturera ai Germany,
because they were amassing fortunes at the
expense ai the do'wn-trodden taxpayers.
.Any man who has ever read ai thie mavexnents af the Sociahist party in Germany
wiJl 'be conversant with that, and will know
that antaganism -was developed a-mong the
masses ai the people, by reason ai the
fact that the so-called wvar party were
corrupting constituencies, buying up members ai the -Reichstag, and daing everything possible ta keep up the feeling that
millions upon millions must be spent for
the purpase ai war. The appeal was made
in the constituencies: " If you want millions expended, vote for the war party.
If you want ta see your towns closed againat
the manufacture ai war goods, vote against
them, and vote for the iSocialist or Peace
party." And yet ta-day we he-ar in CanOn

We can learn a great deal from the war,
and 1 hope we shall learn. What did we
ever buy from 'Germany in large quantities?
We bought toys ta the tune of thousands of
dollars. Go down Wellington street and
you will find in one of the Government
buildings an exhibition of German tays,
many af them made from raw materials
sent from Canada. Go to Beaverton and
yau will see a very large toy lactory which
has been established there and is increasing its business ail the time. Toys such as
we have been importing tramn Germany had
better be made in Canada, because a great
deal ai the hardwood that went into their
composition was imparted -from.this or same
other cauntry. -Let us teach the German
manulacturers that they muet be treated
accarding ta their deserts.
I supposed that same honourable member in' the course ai this debate wauld
have said: "Look at what we ship ta Germany." What do we ship ta Germany?
Nat lumber. We cannat campete 'with the
people of Narway and Sweden and other
neighbouring countriçs that have lumber ta
ship. We cannot ship sawn boards, as they
are called. because they cannot with advantage 'be sent that long distance. In th&
heavier sorts ai timber the proximity ai
tho-se cauntries ta Germany gives them a
mare favourable chance than Canada.
" But," sanie hanourable gentleman. will
say, .-look at the figures ai aur experts ai
grain ta Germany."
But if yau look at
those figures you will find that in the years
1912 and 1913, when Germany was contemplating this war, we exparted larger quantities ai wheat than ever before. Our exparts had neyer been'up ta such abnormal
figures, and they have neyer been since, and
neyer will be again; why' Recause the
Germans were making preparations for war
in those years. 1 am sarry 1 have nat the
figures by me; ibut any honaurable gentleman who rwill campare themn will find that
~in the years priar ta those immediately preceding the war, aur experts af wheat ta
Germany would nat at aIl compare with

what they were in those one or two yeairs
before. I know that particularly, because
the fact was com.mented iupon in. my part of
the country, where large quantities o! grain
for exjport went throughi the elevators-the
abnormal quantity of grain then going to
the continent of Europe and particuiarly to

I bave beard gentlemen say, -This Bill

Well, ahl I oan say is that the gentlemen
who vote against it in the House of CGomnMons bad better look out for publie feeling

sentiment that the hononrable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) had in bringing
in this Bill. He feit that it was going to
punish the Germans. But I do not think
the method, that he bas taken is the right
one. The trade between Canada and Germany is, I think, a matter for the Government to deal with by putting a tariff on
goods coming f rom Germany. England is
at the present time fltting up ber ships, and
ever since the close o! the war has had
agents in Germany, to cultivate trade wjth
that country again. Are we going ta stand
out and refuse to trade with Germany? The

were known the worid over, through advertising. Germany was suprême in the way
o! propaganda by advertising. Once when
1 was in Rome 1 was offered a picture and
1 was shown the authenticity of it. They
said: "'We got ït -authenticat-ed by MT.
ýMuelier, of Coblenz; here are ail the papers
isigned and seaied; the man that soid me
the picture paid so much for the officiai

died two years afterwards, and on his death.bed he made a public confession that foi
the paltry sum o! fi'e marks he had authenticated any picture merely for the &ake
-of the money that was in it, though the
p*ctures neyer were genuine. That was German propaganda for you.
Now, if it pleases England to trade with
Germany, why ahouid flot Canada, a smaii
Blritish coiony that has, done its utmost in
this war, sirnply say, "We wen't." Let. Us
6ay that this w'ar has cost us enough in
biood and money te do without German
goods. Let us wear our own goods, and if
we cannot get them to lit as they did be~fore, let us be satisfled to wear overalis,
if we must, instead of wearing German
goods. When the war breke out Gerniany
.told us, "AVe are going to conquer the
world." Ireland was to rise, te a man, but
it didn't. India was te rise agaainst Britýsh rule, but it didn't. The Cape o! Good
Hope was geing te rise, but it didn't. Canada was geing to lie back and l.g, but Canada did the very opposite. The author of
the book I have mentioned said te the Gerjuan Emperor: "Your dipiomnats have sys.tematically deceived yeu; your dipiomats
lied, or did flot know what they were about
when they told you that if you went te
war yeu would cenquer. You did not." So
far as trade was oncerned, what was the
*policy of Germany during the war? Take
the northern district of France, containing
the great manufacturing centres et that
ccuntry.
They systematically destroyed
every factory in the north o! France se that
they would net in the future interfere with
German trade. They destroyed every or-

chard in the richest part et France; why?
Because seme o! them were inter!ering
with the sale o! German wines.
Why
should we flot have some feeling ie! t, and
.say: "No trade with Germany; let us do
witheut the goods e! Germany." We 'haye
done se; we have not missed German geods
for the last five .years, net having bought
a pennyworth et them during that time.
Then let us desist, and teaoh the 'world, if
they are willing te sacrifice sentiment for

on this Bill. People, countries, and empires are very otten swayed and actuated
by senîtiment. Sentiment is a grand thing;
ceuntries have been saved *by sentiment.
In the hast war many of our young mnen

peals to a persan when hie is endeavouring
to make up his mind on any question. Another thing that actuates him in bis conclusiomns is reasan, and 1 think that in a
question of this kind appeals cai 'be made
ta reason as well as ite sentiment.
The promotera of this Bill daim and argue
that it is a Bill to punish Germany. Tbe
arguments advanced by practically ail those
wbo have spoken in favour of the Bill are
arguments showing that we have suffered
great injustice from G3ermany, and that
norw is our oppartunity for getting square
and punishing bier for the great injustice
she bas done. Our men were killed; the
bodies of our beat sans lie in France and
in Fianders, as a result of the war brought
on by Germany. That is one of the arguments. Another la that the German manufacturer will be punished througb this Bill,
and that as he was behind the war we
should bave this Bill-in order ta punish
him. What strikes me in considering that
view of the -question is that in endeavouring ta punish Germany thraugh this Bill,
we may in the end punish ourselves.
The pramoters of the Bill cannat say ln
one breatb that it is designed ta punish
Germany, and in the next breatb that it la
going to. help Germany by promoting the
country.

1They must take either hamn
and, as their arguments have ail been calculated ta ehow that Germans sbouid be
punisbed. we must take it that the object
of the Bill is ta punish the German people
and German manufacturera. But what is
the situation in Canada ta-day fram the
commercial and business standpoint? We
have heen Enweating and struggling for the
last fe'w yesrs ta try ta live in this country. The Board of Commerce has been created by this Parliament in arder to endeavour te kcep dawn the high cost of living. The argument used was that during
the 'war millions of people tbrougbout the
warld were flghting each other, rwere destraying instead of producing-, and that
when the war vwas over and people settled
down ta produce there would be some hope
of reducing the high cost of living. That
vas the argument; but the proposition contained in this Bill is ta shut out 65,000,000
people from .producing goods 'which migbt
be brought inte this country and might
help ta ibring durwn the high coat of living.
There la no way in which we can ever bringdo4wn that cost ta a reasanable basîs except
.by interchange of trade.
As has been pointed out with great force
by 'Ulhe honourable niember for Mon cton
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR.

<'Hon. Mr. MeSweeney), France and Belgiulxn
-have been devastated and - injured ta a
very much greater exten-t'both in lives and
in property tharb we have, and they are
'trading w1th Germiany. Britain, who lost
in the war twenty or thirty men to ouir one,
.
is trading with Germany.
l the Canadian maanfacetuies and producers of goods wish 'to combat Germrany,
the proper way for themn to do it is by producing goods at a reasonable price. Let
theM wake up, and do as Germany has done,
and invent new methods of production. Let
the labouring people of t2his ountry do as
the labouzing people of Gertnany have done.
Let the manufacturera and the labourera
and evetry one in bis country stand tagether and endeavour to increase production and put on the market goods t3ia't are
as good and as chesp as those of Germany.
To pasa a Bill which lias for ita objet
the tying up of 65,000,000 producers la to mY
-mid to bang another -milistone around the
necks cd the consumers of this country.
I do flot thînk the manufacturera of this
country have much cause to complain.
They have made their millions during the
war, u.id 1 do not complain of that: I arn
glad they have. If tlhe country is to be
prosperaus, industry and manufactuTing
must flourish; but I do not think we are
justified in passing a mneas'ure whid, in
my opinion, will do more harmi tihan good,
in that it will increase the cost of living.
No crie will deny that it la very difficuit
no-w for the consumera of this country to
make bath ends meet.
1f I were actuated by sentiment, I wouid
vote for this Bill. But I amn not actuat-ed
by sentiment. I think the oniy way to discuss this question is by foregoing sentiment, and by appealing to, reason and getting down to f acta. The German people
have injured us, no doubt; tihey have killed
aur sons; they bave ferced us to spend
large sumns of money for tthe defence af
our country. They have don-e ail that; but
if we impose a greater burden on the consumers of this country in order te get

Honourable
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
gentlemen, wifi ail the suffering, a.nd al
the loss of life and tr-easure that has been
broug4ht te this country by the action of
Germany in piunging the world into the
great war, I think it is oniy natural that

APRIL 28, 1920
thero shouid ho- a strong desiro to enact
ec'me legisînation to provent Germanmade
goods finding a ready ma.rket in this country. With that sentiment I arn fully in
accord; burt I do flot think that the Bill
w(hidh we are now oonsidering is the best
means o! bringing about that rosuit. If it
is the wish cd thie co'untry that we ahould
flot, purchase German goode, why not place
an embargo upon. them' If the proonoter
of this Bill will amoud it s0 as to compel
ail German goods comidng te 'this country te
bear the words, "Made in Germauy," then
the people will know what, they are getting.
But that ie not the course taken by te
honourable gentleman. One part of te

In lettere eaelly legible over every outaide entrance to hie premnises the words "Dealer in

The sign that ie poeted over the door of
a merchant je usually moant te signif y
dus principal occupation. It might come to
pase that a country etorekeeper, carrying
Iperhape $15,000 or 320,000 worth o! stock,
would have $100 worth o! German toye or
dyes in hie -stock, and he would be obliged
to place that eign over hie store and, to a
certain extent, brand himsel! pro-German.
That would be tee effect of it in most comimunities. 1 think that je an unfair position to put hlm in. Yeu may say that
he should not buy the goods. He may get
the goode not knowing that they are Gerjuan and may a!terwards learn that they
are; and he would then come under the Act.

the presence of honourable gentlemen that
the Bill would noît be effective until alter
the war, and that the reason for ite introduction was so that when the war was
over people could not oppose it on the
ground that merchants had loaded themselves up wïth goods and that the legislation would be un!air. This Bill passed
the Senate at that time with. the support
of ail but perhaps one of the gentlemen now
opposing it. The scales appeur to have
fallen fromn their eyes. Every gentleman
who has stood up has eaid: -I have the

for the suffering families; I voted for the

it."
They remind me of the story,

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: 1 did not ask the

lie will vote againet it. Why should an 'honourable gentleman go egeinet those people

Then there je enother argument ta whicb
I would draw attention, and I have =ore

*any other avhicli I bave heard against the
Bill. Some bhonourable gentlemen bave
*eaid that it will decrease 'trade 'with Germany and lessen Germany's opportunity to
eern money ta psy off ber indebtedness to
-the world. That is en argument that is entitled to respect. If it is reesonable, it
ouglit 'ta be weighed, and if it ie not eound
-it ouglit to be ignored. Now, let us see.
The business which we did with Gerniany
at the high tide of our trade 'with lier did
not emount to more than $4,000,000 in a
*yeer. Here are the returns. The honour-able gentleman from Sirncoe - (Hon. -Mr.

299

Bennett) has given them ta me. The trade
is a bagatelle. We did more business with
.Belgiuiný than we did 'with that great em-pire.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then what ie the
use of bothering with the Bill? What is
the good of moving Parliament if that is ail
the trade amnou.nts to-if it is a «nere bagatelle?>
. Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON- The hionourable gentleman should have asked that
question when he encouraged me to bring
in the Bill, and ihen he moved ta amend
it, and approved of its being passed.
Does Germany require aIl this solicitude?
I think I may sa.fely say that Germany hes
corne out of tihis war better off th-an any
oither people in -the world; that all the
lying camouflage that she bas -put up is in
keeping with her whole 'h'istoTy of unreliability. The whole debt of Germany before this war began rwas not more than
$1,2W&,000,000, accooeding ta Whi'teker, whe is
an authoritv on that question. That great
empire of between sixty and seventy millions of people is, as I said the other day,
a standing menace to the if e o~f the world.
.During the war Germany did not spend any
money outside her own country. Ail 4that
she got fromn other countries she stohe
from them. She robbed Roumania; she
.wrecked Russia; she paid nothing to any-body. And she has ail the wealth now'that
she lied before the 'war. We did not set
foot on Germen soul to destroy any .property
that she had. She was looked u'pon as one
of the richeet nations in the 'world; and
cen any person say tbat ber treasure bas
-been depleted? She bas everything that
she haed before; wherees we, f rom this war,
have gone eanpty away. Look at the rate
of exchange. The devil bas given her that
blessing even. The greateet blessing that
came to Germany was the fali of the mark
on the 'market. A great Englîsh authority
said the other day that the greateet bleesing
to England bas been the faîl of the pound
sterling. It bas absolutely eut off the imiportetion of goode from t.he United States.
I can cite a case in point, and 1 cen give
you the naime of the gentleman who actually
bought the goods in question. Before the
war began, a member of the 'House of Comnmone, engaged. in the manufacture of knitted goode, purcbased a machine for knitting,
ta be 'brouglit into Canada from Germany,
for $1,800. The price was 9,000 marks, or
$2,200, laid down in Buffalo, or $ 1,800 in
Canada. The same kind of goods are for
sale in Gerrnany to-day et the serne price,

were established in thase provinces under
the terme af the Act. Ini the three Maritime
Provinces, hawever, the Provincial Governments felt that frorn their standpoint it was
not desirable to take advantage of the provisions of the Act; and therefore, during the
reconstruction period immediately following
the war, for the purpose of helping to place
returned soldiers and civilians in employment, the Federal Government operated
nine employment offices under an arrangement which ceases to exist at the end, of
April, 1920. Therefore we find ourselves in
the position that in the largest cities, such
as Halifax, St. John, and Moncton, which
have, signified a desire that this work should
be continued, it cannai be carried an. There
is provision that it may be done through
co-operation betweén the Provincial Governments and the Federal Government. The
municipalities, however, desiring that they
should have an opportunity ta carry on the
work in co-operation with the Federal Government on the saine basis, it is proposed to
extend the Act Sa that in sucli cases that
inay be done. It will mean no added expense, no appropriation af money outside
of that already provided for by statute.
Hon. .Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, in looking at this Bill and the report
laid on the table of the House by the hionourable gentleman at- the beginning of this
session, it seems to me that hie has rather
exceeded bis authority under the original
Act. As I read the original Act, and as I
think the minister stated a minute or two
ago, he was empowered ta do this work in
co-operation with the provinces. H1e apparently found that hie could not get the
desired co-operation in the three easterri
provinces, but he went ahead and did the
work and incurred expense. I caninot see
that hie had any autbority under the original
Act ta procaed in that way. Of course, 1
understand that this Bill will give him
power in future- ta deal flot only with the
Provincial Gavernments, but with municipalities or other organizatians.
Hon. ýMr. ]ROBERTSON: The observation
of my honourable friend is quite correct so
i ar as the existing Act is concerned. The
work carried on by the Federal Department
af Labour in the Maritime Provinces during
the period of necessity was authorized, although not by statute, because it was necessary work. It was carried an ta meet the
emergency existing, but it cannot be carried
on any f urther because the authority expires at the end af this montb. Therefore
it is .proposed ta amend the Act sa that in

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is nathing

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is le! t entirely

ta rny honourable friend that a nuimber af

to apply to food that niay be in transit,

of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: II would like to jask
the honourable leader of the House if the
retailer who bhas the goods on his shelves
will be penalized under this Bill, or ivili
it be the manufacturer wbo puts up the
goodsP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It 'will be
the retailer.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: That would be a
rnanifest injustice to the retaiher. How is
the retailer going .to, analyse the goods or
drugs on his shelves, in order to, tell
whetber they are pure or impure? It is impossible for him to do so. These goods
corne fromn the manufacturers. They pass
through the bands of the jobber and the
whohesale grocer before reaching the retailer. It would be an injustice to take
those gooda off the Bhelves of the retail
grocer, for instance, and if they were found
impure in any respect under the provisions
of this Bill, to penalize hirn when the
manufacturer, who was the real cuiprit,
would get off scot-free.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There are
rnany considerations entering into the subject. and if my honourable friend will wait
until we get into comnîittee, we shall be
able to advance reasons why this should
bie doue. There are other Acts affecting
the very question whichi my honourable
friend raises. There is another Bill, wbich
will reach the -Senate in the course of a
few days, dealiug with drugs and opium.
Hon. Mr. BRELOOURT: May I ask the
honôurable leader of the House if this is
a consolidation of previous Acts?
Hon. Sir JAMES WOUGHEED: Yes; it
is a repeal of the Adulteration Act and a

revision and consolidation of ail the Acts
relating to those particular subjects.

was uecessary rnany years ago, and should
have beau euacted then. I arn afraid that
in the past we have paid far more attention
to protecting the horse, the cow, and ,the
hog than we have to protectiug man, in
the matter of food. We have been very
rerniss in that respect. I arn impelled to
rise and say the few words I arn goiug to,
say, because of a statement that was made
to me ouly last evening by a gentleman
frorn Montreal, whose father, an engineer
in that city, is an old personal friend of
mine.
This gentleman told me that bis
father was very iii with eczerna, and hie
said: "You would be astounded to know the
number of cases of eczema that exist today in the city of Montreal." The doctors
have attributed it eutirely to the use of bad
meat, wbich is taken out of warehouses
and is being sold in the city of Montreal.
When a statement of that kind is made by
thoroiigbly responsible members of the
comrnunity, rnen of high repute, one is
doubly «irpressed witb the necessity of
legisiation of this sort, and again il congratulate tbe Governrnt on having
brougbt dowu this measure. I arn sure the
Bill will receive ail tbe attention wbich it
deserves.

It is not at ail againat the principle of tbe

Grand Trunk Railway' Company recgariing
which the notices vjeré? sent out. This is
the purpose of the Bill.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, niy honourable friend hîs not
laid before us the correspondence which
was brought down in the other House in
regard to this matter. I do not say that
I complain about that. I understand that
it took three hours for the mi'nister in the
other Hlouse to read all that correspondence, and 1 think the honourable leader
of the G.overrnnent in this House has probably given us the pith of the correspondence in the few remarks he bas made in
moving the second reading of this Bill.
This measure, as .my 'honourable friend
bas presented it bo the House, appears innocent and simple. Its purpose, according
to what hie tells us, is simply to correct
errors or omissions 'that have occurred in
the drawing Up of the agreement, one railway having been wrongly described, and
another having been omitted, in the original agreement. These are small matters,
regarding which we would niake no objection. But this 'Bill, as I see it, brings- be
fore us the wvhole agreement with. the
Grand Trunk Rail-way Company respecting
the purchase of the railway. W'e a.sked last
year that this agreement bie submitted t3
Parliament; but the Governmient at that
time did flot feel disposed to allow Parliament to examine the agreement before they
passed upon it. The agreement now placed
before us bas already been sanctioned. although not altogether in due form, by the
shareholders of the company, and we are
practically committed to it by the lezislation of last session. Therefore, I do flot
k-now that there is inucli to be g-ainel bv
dîscussina its ternis again.
We hiad a fairly full discussion of the
whole inatter at hast session. But I would
point out to the Go3verumiient thiat the action
taken by honourable gentlemen in ibis
House last session in inoving "that Bill
,33 be not nov read a second tiilue, but that
further consideration thereof be deferred'
until the nexi session of Parliamient'" was
a %vise one, suid one to which the Governmuent oughit to have given their consent.
Then we should not have been phaced iii
the.position in which w-e find ourseives today, of having to deal with titis matter a
second time in order f0 correct errors which
would then not have been moide or ivoild
probably bave been discovered. This is. I
think, -a strong argumnent against hezislation being :brought down in a hurry. as
w-as the BIll of last session. Hnua~

gentlemen will remember that it was introduced in the House in the very last days
of the session, when we thought prorogation was about to take place. We were kept
here for a considerable time longer, in
order to put 1through this particular piece
of legisiation. Had the Government taken
the necessary time to deal with it in the
way in which honourable members of this
II-ouse asked that it be deaft with, we should
flot now bie called -upon to deal with the
question again.
~Another point. We miglit also have taken
a different view ci the legielation had we
had beifore us the information that has now
been given to the country by the Minister
of Mailways, as to the country's position
with regard to the roads now being operated
The other day the
by the Government.
Minister of Bailways told the country that
it would be necessary to provide the sum
of $47,000,000 for the purpose of making
goed the deficit on operations and to pay
the llxed charges on the roads for the operation of which the country is now responsible. In giving those figures the Minister
of Railways mentioned that the loés on the

railway year ending the 31st of December,

that bas been put into these railways, and
the amount of money that bas been spent
by the country on them. We find, on page

assets of thîe country:

the Appropriation Act of 1917, 'bot.h t-hese
amounits were put down as loans bo the
railway coinpany; but, as far as I can understand, the Minister o! Railways the other
day, when nientioning these amou-nts o!
fix-ed charges thaît the railways had to pay,
was not taking inito consideration any interest paviment that the railway conipany
'o-ould inake 0on tiioge lans which, accordEITTON

SENATE
inr to the Public Accounts, -have been ad'vanced to the company by rway of loan and
flot as out-and-out payanents. I think *w'e
oug-ht to have further information about
su4ch a matter in order to realize what
amount of money we are paying out in connection with these railways; fbecause, if
%ve are advancin-g this money by way of
loan, the amounts ought not to be put in the
Estimates every year but provided for
by a sepa rate Act; and. surely the rail-way com'pany, if they receive these monevis
ini the -way of Inans, ought to pay interest
on them. If it is necessary for the Gevernment te .borrow money fromn other
sources, it amust pay interest on what it
borrows, and if those sums are entered in
the Public Accounts as investments, the
country is certainly entitled te get interest
frorn the railway for the amounts so
advanced.
I bring up this matter in
order that honourable gentlemen may
reairize -what the position is with regard to, this particular railway question. If we -were going into the general railway policy of the country many
other questions would be raised 'which
'would add very greatly to the figures given
by the ïMinister of Railiways as te the
actual cost of these railway8 te the country;
and I think we ehould caregully cousider
the position into which we are driven and
the enermous sums we are paying for the
luxury of epe'rating these railways.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: I understand that
the Bilil before us has 'been fairly explaîned to the House by the honourable
leader of the Government, and there is
nothing in it which, in any way adds te the
financial obligations of Canada other than
-what was incurred by iwhat is known as
the Grand Trunk legisl-ation of last session.
When I saw in the press the announcement that the Government proposed to
legislate with regard to the rfghts of minority shareholders in Engêland or Canada,
I confess that at first I t.hought that any
such legislation must be improper and unfair to those stockholders; 'but, as 1 have
read this Bill and heard the explanations
given here and elsewhere, I have corne te
the conclusion that ne wrong is done te
any one, and that I have no legitimate
cause of complaint against this Bill. I was
opposed to the purchase by the Government
of the Grand Trunk systern, because I did
not then and 1 do flot now believe in governrnent ownership or government management of raîlways; but I do not set, that it is
niy duty to oppose a Bill which does not

which I do not believe, but which is necessary

leisiation

heretofore

passed by a large majority of the members of the Lower House and a niajority of this House. 1 understand that
this Bill deais3 only 'with the Vermont and
Province Line railroad, aIl of the stock ef
which is owned by the Grand Trunk railway, and the Penibroke Southern railway, the majority of the stock of which is
owned by the Grand Trunk railway, and
that they are the only twe corporations in
which any question arises under tihis legislation. Supposing for a imoment that we
were te throw cut this Bibl, or te delay the
carrying out of this'transaction iby sendin.it back, it would anean that the Grand
Trunk railway would issue new notices te
ail the shareholders of thoee twe corporations that a meeting of the sharehelders
would be held, the Grand Trunk would control every share of one company a.nd a majority of 'the stock oé the other one, and
we would have te i-atify, after two
or three months' delay, the Bill which. we
are given the opportunity of ratifying teday. I cannet see that .any one suffers, or
that any wrong is done te any one 'by this
Bibi, and therefore I cannoit see it te be, my
duty te, vote against it. At the same time,
in justice te myseif and those osf my iriends
who dýid not vote fer the legisiation before, I
want te say that IT do net recede one inch
froni the position 1 look at the last session.
I did flot -believe in the purchase then; 1
do net believe in the purchase now. I did
net believe then in igovernment ownership;
I do net bebieve in it now. But 'because
of that opinion, which. is *a minority o'pinion, and net t'hat of the Rnajority of the
members of the House of Commons and of
this Huse, 1 do net see that it is my duty
to effer useless opposition te this legisiatien, and therefore I shaîl net vete
against it.

Hon. N. A. BELOOTJRT: This is the third
act in the financial tragedy rwhich, in the
opinion of net a few Canadians, is 'bound.
te termifiate in the finaneial ruin of this
country. For rny part, I amn net prepared
at thîs stage or at any stage te give - any
sort of acquiescence, by my silence, in the
legislation which was passe-d by this House
when we acquired -the Cariadian Northern,
and later -Dn wher' 'we acquired the Grand
Trunk railroad. The original drama was
schemed wîth only two, acts: the acquisition
of the Ce.nadian Northern and the acquisition of the Grand Trunk. This third
performance was wholby

unexpected

and

APRIL 29, 1920
When we did
wholly unprovided for.
acquire the Canadian Northern it was contemplated and intended by the Government that the Grand Trunk would also be
acquired later on; but it was deemed flot
easy to, have the Canadian people swallow
both pills at the one time. It seemed better to go ahead with the Canadian Northern, which was perhaps the worse of the
two pis, and have that. one well down
before any attempt was made with the
other.
The time for the play was well chosen.
The excitement caused by the war, the
f act that everybody's mind was centred on
the one object, the one purpose. of bringing the war to a satisfactory conclusion,
was chosen as the hast time possible to
pas. tbis legisiation, which would flot
have been passed, in my opinion, had it
flot been for the circumatances which 1
have indicated. It was thought-and I
have no doubt the argument had a very
strong influence in determining those who
are responsible for the legisiation-that
when once the Canadian Northern b.d
been acquired it would be an easy matter
to convince the Canadian people of the
absolute necessity of acquiring also the
Grand Trunk in order to carry out the
scheme of public operation of railways.
Thereforeb *when the CJanadlan Northern
deal was passed, the Grand Trunk deal
was trotted out. AU of us know how well
the scheme was managed. It was onty
through the desperate appeal o! the Prime
Minister o! the day to gentlemen of this
House who owed their seats to bis hanevolence that the lagisiation was passed
in the Senate. There were gentlemen in
this House who were going through the
lobbies decrying ýthe deal in lur'id langu-age, and expressing their determination toi vote againat it, and yet who came
to the House and voted* for it. I am flot
going to inquire into their motives; I
only state the fact. If the inatter remained with me I would not do what my
honourable friend (Hon. 'Mr. Foster) just
now stated he would not do. I would kick
thé Bill out. I would try to save the country
from the enormous financial burden which
has hean imposed on it by the taking over
of those two railways and endeavouring
to operate them as government properties.
We have been told that the obligations
of those two systems would be six or seven
hundred millions in one case, and 1 amn
not sure that we have heen told what the
obligations of the Grand Trunk are or
xnight be. From all the information I
S-201

-307

have been able to gather I take it that
the debta and obligations of those two aystems are not very far from a billion and a.
hall. When we are told that the dabt o!
Canada to-day is two billions, I say we
are misleading ourselves and the public;
for the debt of Canada to-day, by reason
o! these obligations, is far nearer four
billions than two billions of dollars. How
are we going to pay this billion and a bal!
in addition to the two billion of debt that
we admit we have to pay' la it by the
operation of the railways? Those who took
the trouble to go into this matter and think
it ont realized from the very drst that there
would annually and every year be a huge
deficit in the operation of the railways. Tt
was estimated as sixty millions in the first
year, but it will ha found that it is between
six-ty and seventy-flve millions from the first
year's operation. What are we going ta do?
How are we going to pay this billion -and
a haîf? We are told that ibis huge sum is
represented. by assets; that we own the
property of these two systenis. Wel1, I
ask any business man, what is the good
of an asset-the operation of which reanîts
in an annual deflcit? la that not the kind
of asset that you would want ta get rid of!P
I. that flot the kind of an asset that -is
absolutely worthlessP But that ia our position to-day, and I am very mucb af raid
that the people of Canada have a very
poor conception o! what is meant by the
hargain whicb we have made with those
two companies, and have not the faintest
idea as to where they are 'being led by the
Parliament of Canada in this iegislation.
The only reason worth mentioning wby
these railways should be taken over was
that if we allowed them to go into the
banda o! a raceiver Canada's credit would
ha very seriously affected.
,Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Even b.d the railways gone into liquidation, bow would the
Dominion have escaped payment o! the
guarantees given on the bonds?
Hon. 'Mr. BELCOURT: Assuming that
the Government would ultiniately have had
to pay these iguarantees, I do not
think those obligations were nearly bal!
what the debts o! the companies ware;
and if we were going to choose betwaen
escaping one debt and the other, we would
be 'choosing 'the smaller debt and escaping
the larger one; for if those companies had
been disposed o! they would, have realîzed
probably enough to indemnify the Dominion and Provincial Governments which
have given the guarantees, and whatever was

SENATE
realized would have -onle to help to pay the
obligation 'for which Canada was guarantor.
1 do flot think, it would have cost Canada
very much if those railways had been
allowed to, bc deait 'with un the saine way
-as any other ban'krupt concern in Canada
or any other counitry. The people of this
P&rliarnent bad no right to saddle the counttry ?wit.hi the huge debt and -the huge obligations of those two railway systerns.
especially when it mnust have been clear to
anyone that we could not possibly operate
thern with, success.
Now, 'what does Goiverrument operation
mean in this ountry? Let us lock for
a mnoment al, what it hias doune for other
countries. There is- no qcounibrv on the face
of the earth where government oiperation
o! railways has been successful.
An ýHon. SENATOR: Germany?
Hon. '-,r. BELCOURT: Not Gerniany.
Prussia was the only part of the îvorld
in whicb it was reasonably successful;
but the surplus declared t'here on tiwo or
three occasions was -made, as it i.s generally made in cases of that sort, by cooking
the ucounits. I aesaert t1hat there is flot one
country in the rworld rwhere the government operattion of railrways has been successfui, or rather, where it bas net f urned into
a huge deficit. If you cannot ruake the
cperation el railways successful in count ries such as Franre, Great Britain, Belgitnm, and Germany, how can you hope
ever to make lit a success in Canada?
Belgium, for instance. has over 500 people
to the square mile. whereas in Canada we
have less than 2. The proportion is perhaps a littie lesa in England, and a littie
le6s in France, but there you have a
density o! population at least two or three
hundred tirnes gre-ater than AF is in
Canada. But th.a:t is noi the whole story.
In Great Britain, France, Beleroîn, and
Germany the railways are principally occupied in carrying mnanu faut ured articles. and
tbey have very short distances to -go. where-as in Canada our railw%ýavs are enLcaýged înosf]y in carrying- raw rnaterials-ore. grain.iron,
and -so on. And ]ook at tihe tremendous
distances we have toecarry goods across
this country. 1 say if ivas utter inadness for

Canada. But thnt will not le NIr. Hania's
!anît. 1 arn sure that the deficit that we are
going to have every year -will not be due to
any delinquency or want of ability on bis
part, but sinip]y because of the utter iinpossibility of bleeding stone.
Again, honourable gent-lemen, I beg to be
excused for indulging in a speech which I
know will have no effect, and which. mnight
just as well neyer have been made. I arn
conscîous that iny only justification for
making these observations, wholly unprepared and which on the spur o! the mnoment
I arn iipelled to miake, is because of my
deep and unalterable conviction that peril
to Canada because of this nefarious bargain
is mnuch graver thant rnost people have
realized. 1 want to get rid o! somet-hing
that troubles rny conscience: that troubles
it so rnuch that 1 could not. sit here and allow the principle of this Bill to be agaix4
sanctioned without voicing niy protest.
Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: Honourable gentlemen, I must not atternpt to make a
speech. But, like miy honourable friend
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), I want
to take this occasion again to repeat what
I have more than once said in this House,
and what I have said many times in vanous parts of Canada, perhaps not publicly,
but privately. Miy honourable friend does
not go -back to the origin of the terrible disease frorn which Canada is suifering, and froin wvhich I arn afraid she will
continue ta suifer so long as Canada is
Canada-that is, the inordinate unnecessary building of railwvays in this counstry.
This building of railways is the outgrowth
of a lack of knowledge on the part of public
men and Canadians generally o! their country. Unfortunately for Canada, few men
have studied conditions and have corne to
understand fully the geo graphical construction and the physical disadvantagaes under
which Canada necessarily labours.
A xnost inordinate overestirnate o! Canada's possibilities and resources is the
cause o! the whole tragedv. I say again, as
1 have said many t-irnes, that is a condition
which ba-s flot been studied by the public
men of Canada or by Canadians generally.
When Canada rouses herself to the real
truth, as 1 amn sure -,-ie will within two or
three years, there iý g-oing to be a tremendous awakening-.
The public men of Canada are continually
talking of our nurniierous resources and their
inexhaustibilitv. There is na resaurce that
is not exhaustile; and I regret to say it,
as a Canadian, that this is a country iimI
ited iin variety o! natural resources.
sxvallowed the talk, o! Our public men for

309

inaniiv vears. and 'was under the impression
that'tibis counry was going to be a second
United States. Sonie years ago, however,
I began to study conditions very 4.are!uIly.
and I arrived at an entirely different conclusion. It rnay seeni egotistical for me to
say this, but I say that there hasno Canadian who has spent as much as I have done
ta study Canada' est o! the Rocky mounitains to the Atlantic. We have explored
more o! Canada eiast o! the Great Lakes than
perhaps ail of the rest of the lumber trade.
1That may seeîn an extravagant statement
to makze, but il i.s true. If the knowledge
that I have o! the eastern port-ion af Canada had been possessed by the people generally, certain conditions which now prevail, neyer would have prevailed.
I do not 'want to belittle the country.
Canada bias certain possibilities, but it is
not the wondýrfu1 .country, rich in resources, that the Canadian people àbeieve
it to be. I invite Canadians to make a
study of their country and its conditions.
and to niake a comparison with the other
countries of the world. Canada is necessarily a dear country to live in. It is a dear
country in which to produce. We can produce very few articles here in competition
with other counitries. We can perbaps .produce pulp and cernent more nearly on an
equality with other cauntries than anything else. But, generally speaking, Canada neyer has been, is not to-day, and neyer
will be, a cbeap country in wbich to produce. The great vigour o! the people, because of the northern climate in wvhiclh
we live, contrihutes to our activities and
enables -use to witbstand disadvantageous
conditions. But I say that if Canada had
been understood, the mad follies that exist
in the country to-day, in the shape of railway construction, neyer would have been
undertaken. I make the staternent now,
as I have made it before, that the wisest
thing the Canadian people can do is to make
a study of their country and determine
how many thousands of miles of the railroads that have been built should be
scrapped and abandoned entirely. Perhaps
it is a courageous statement to miake, but T
believe before three years pass many Canadians iil believe as I do.

THE HALIFAX GARRISON.
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION.

Hon. A. B. CROSBY rose in accoriance
with the following notice:
That he will cati the attention of the Senate
to mnatters pertaining to the garrison at Halifax, and the agreement wlth the imperîs.) authorities, and aiso regarding the defence. both
mllltary and naval. and the dockyard and ail
agreements and understandings in that connection; and lncjulre whether It la the Intention of
the Government to restore the regiment to Halifax.
H1e a 'aid: Honourable gentlemen, yesterday I was going to say a word or two with
regard to the garrison of the city of Halifax.
but the honourable leader of the *Government asked me if I would wait until to-day,
when he might be able to give me the information that I desired. ff understand
now that he agrees with everything that I
am going to say, although he does flot yet
know what it is; so 1 feel perfectly free to
discuss this niatter as best I can.
Years ago we had in Canada àn Imperial
garrison. That garrison was from time to
time remo'ved from one place to another,
and finally it came to the city of 'Halifax.
The Imperial authorities decided that there
must be a garrison at Halifax, and for the
last 25 or 30 years that garrison, consisting
of from two to four regiments, has been
stationed at Halifax. For the last five or
six years, until the Dominion .Government
undertook to tal<e over the garrison, we
have had in the city of Hialifax in the
neighbourhood of two or three thousand
mnen. In 1905 an agreemnent was entered

into between the .Government

of 'Canada,

represented by the Militia Council, and the
Imperial Government, represented by the

Secretary ;)f State for Canada, by which the
Government of the day undertook the work
of looking alter the garrison at Halifax and
carrying on that work. The Imperial Government loaned us officers, and handed over
ail the properties they had in

connection

with the garrison. They handed over the
Wellington barracks, which 1 think-I do
not want to exaggerate --cover about hall a
square mile of territory. They are situated
on elevated ground in an ideal position
f ronting on Gottingen street, where there
is a very high stone wall of f rom two to

two and a hall feet thick. They also banded over the Artillery Park, and a splendid

APRIL 30, 1920.
reservation for a military cernetery, where
soldiers can be buried. Then there are the
fortifications, situated on both asides of the
harbour. As everybody knows, without
Halif ax, it would 'have been very difficuit
for Canada ta carry on her part in the
war. In iact, it 'would have 'been almoat
impossible for us ta have von the war.
We ail have a high regard and great respect for'the soldiers, and we ail want ta
do what we can for theni, particularly for
the returràed wounded soldiers, w-ho require
care and hospital 'treatment. 1 need not Tefer ta the dependents of those wha have nlot
carne iback. Certainly we are ail interested
in the men who require our assistance, and I
think we ail agree that nothing is toa good
for theni. In the city af Halifax, a very
large haspital was being buit, which according ta -the ternis ai the contract -was to have
been completed on thelast day ai 'November
laist. That hostpitai is just now nearing cornpletian. Consequently Bick soidiers and men
convalescing couid not be ýput into that
building and had ta -be put int.) what wtere
known as emergency hospîtals on the Gommon, which were caiistructed to accorninadate returned nien, but <which were being
usod for the troops theri - scationed in the
garrisors. 6omebody started an agitation,
and said that the place where the garrison
were living was not good enough f-3r the
soldiers, and that they should be -puL into
the Camp Hill hoepital, s0 called, forgetting
tha.t the new hospital had nat been canipleted and that the Camp Hlill hospital was
being used. Such an agitation was raised
that it became evident that urNiess the men
could get into the hospitai on Camp., Hill
they would have 'to go aomewhere else.
Somebody 'was sent down Irani Ottawa ta
inspect the place, and as a result the garrison was removed ta 'Montreal.
1 arn iniorrned on creditable authority
tha't the quartera in Halifax are juat as
good as those in Monitreal. I arn not saying
that the quartera iii Montreal are not good
enough; but simply that they are no bet'ter
than those in Halifax.
It is nlot rny desire ta interfere in any way
with Montreal. Under the legisiation which
we passed twa years ago we established au
Consequently Monarrny ai 10,000 men.
treal can have a garrisan ai one regirnent,
or two or three regîrnents, if they s0 desire.
But what I desire ta impresa upon the
House is this. While garrisona were being
taken away frani other cities in Canada, it
was considered expedient and neceasary ta
have the garrison at Halifax, and the Governrnent ai the day entered into an agree-

mient witli the Irnperial authorities undertaking, to continue that garrison. IL as
been maintained there since, and -1 do not
believe the Imperial Government would
agree to its being removed from Halifax
and placed anywhere else.
Hon. Mr. DOMWjlLE: Rt aught to be
put in St. John, N.B.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I do not know
whether there should be a garrisan there
or nlot, but if it were decided ta put one at
St. John, .N.B., I arn quite suire the Imperial
aut.horities would feel. there should be another garrison established. We want the
garrison at Ha.lifax. My honourable friend,
who is a military man, knows ver y well
that if there is ta be only one garrison ini
ail the Dominion ai Canada, that garrison
should be at Halifax.
Hon. Mxr. DOMV]3LLE.: They spend.money
ta keep Halifax up.
Hon. Mr. CRZOSBY: Well, that would be
no disadivantage at 8t. John. Stili, I amn
pleading that the garrisan be lef t at Hali-fax, niot at ail because they would spend
rnoney in that city, but because 1 believe,
as I said befare, that the Imperial. authorities would want the garrison continued
there.
The Dominion Gavernent came ta the
conclusion that it was not f air ta expect the
people af the United Kingdom ta pay taxes
for the maintenance af a regiment in the
city,of Halifax, ar for a dock-yard in that
city, and that the time had arrived when
the Imperial autharities should be relieved
ai that expense. They were, accordingly,
relieved af it. *Now, .1 contend that we are
1
not fuleliling aur part oi the contract.
have in my hand the agreement which was
entered into, but I do not wish to take up
the tume ai the House in reading it. Under
the agreement, 1 believe, we had no right
ta withdraw the garrison irom Halifax wîthout the consent ai the Imperial authorities,
but the excuse was made that the garrison
was being withdrawn for anly a few months
and wauld be returned. The article appearing in the newspaper indicates, however,
that the garrison will not be sent back,
and that is the reason why I bring this
mattez ta the attention oi the Governrnent
and ask that we periorm aur part, as we
agreed ta do.
The article ta which 1 reierred was published in the Morn.rng Chronicle ai Saturday last. It says:
It is believed In local mllitary circles that
the removal of the Royal Canadian Reginent,

This is based on a despatch f rom Montreai to

manding the Montreal district. has asked that
city to give a 40-year lease on a piece of property in the East End, and it is believed that
the barracks will ba erected there.
On the arrivai of the Royal Canadians at
Montreal. from Halifax. rnany prominent business mnen of the Quebec city became interested
In the Idea of lhaving them permanently located there. This bas resulted ln the proposai that
barracks be erected for their accommodation.
They are at present quartered in the Peel street
barracks.

As I said hefore, there cani be no objection to the establishment of a garrison of
tîvo or ibree regiments at Montrea], but
what 1 desire to impresa upon the House
is the fact that there are in Halifax al
the property and facilities necessary. There
is no need to spend a dollar to obtain a
lease of any property there. We have in
Halifax aufficient property to accommodate
5,000 or 6,000 men, if necessary. The Wellington barracks were soniewhat damiaged
in the explosion that occurred in Decemnber, 1917, as they had not been thoroughly
repaired or reconstructed, they were not
proper quartera for the men tu enter last
year; but the Wellington barracks are now,
1 understand, in good condition.
With regard to the navy, the most advantageous location for a dockyard is Halifax, and a dockyard waa estalblislied there
by the Imrarisl authorities. In faet, the
gentleman who tian.sferred the property te
the Imperial authorities, did so without
charging a single dollar, but on the condition that it must neyer be used for any
other purposez, than those of a dockyard.
'This Governmient has taken over the property on the sanie condition. There has
been some talk of the niavy going out of
existence, or reverting to the pre-war statua; but the agr ement betwaen the Government of Canada and the Imperial autboritias regarding the dockyard waa siiînilar

to that with the military authorities with
respect to the garrison. If wa make up
our minds that w-e can no longer continue
the do-ckyard at Halifax and carry on the
navy, as we undartctok to do when we took
over the proparty from the Imperial authorities, than it is our duty so to informi the
Imperial authoritias and let them decida
whethar to oontinue it or not. We must
hand back to the Imiperial Government ail

were turned over to us amounting. in value

goin g to say now that ive do flot want the

must give the Imperial authorities proper
notice, so thàt they may decida whather
they thamiselves shall carry on or not'

The Royal Canadian Regiment is looked
upon as being practîcally a Hialifax ragiment, because a great many of the men
eniisted there, although there arealso. I
understand, quite a number of men from
the province o.f Quebec. I dlaiim that the
Royal Canadian Regiment, which hald the
gaarrison at (Halilafx and was transferred
tempnDrarily to Montreal, should be returnad f0 Halifax, if we do not wish to
break faith with the Imiperial authorities.

position the Conference indicates the lines
an which it considers that a solution oi the
problem can best be found; but it is vain
ta expect that the result ai the war can be
euîxnînated by a atroke af the pen.
2. Peace flot yet R--established.-At present Europe la f ar irom having returned
ta the conditions of complete peace. Russia la atated ta have in the field armies ai
1,500,000 men or more, and the di$bandment
ai these armies la af course a primary condition ai Enropean peace. But many also
of the countries which have been created or
enlarged as the outcome ai the war have
stili the appearance af armed camps; and
not lesa than 1,000,000 men are still under arma in Poland, Roumania and the new
States created out ai Auatria-Hungary.
Moreaver, althaugh arnued conflict bias
ceased, the mutuai rivalries and antipathies
which are the natural legacy ai war still
dominate many ai the nations ai Europe,
and are leading ta the erection of artificial
econamie barriers which must seriously
hamper, if they do not entirely prevent, the
restaratian ai the comnion prosperity.
The firat atep to the reconstruction of
Europe la ta complete the pracesa of demobilization in aU countoeies, ta, resunie the
full employment in peacelul pursuits ai
the whole ai the able-bodied population
and ta encourage by every means the normal literchange o! -their products. Until

in every branch of 111e, Europe, which has
aufiered so terribly d'uring the paat years
ai strife, -will continue ta suifer froni the
restlessneas and lack of! confidence which
la the natural consequence ai the upheaval
through 'which ahe has passed.
oi Produétion.-Liberty has,
3. Irase
iuideed, beem preaerved ta Europe, and the
threat aof military domination is gone. This
great achievemeuit has, bowever, left victors and vanquished alike impoverished
and enieebled. Death or disablement has
removed frein the rwork of production millions of mnen in the prime ofli11e; and
millions mare have had their efficiency
impaired by aufferinga an -the field ofi battie or through pestilence or -privations at
home. lnstead aiflieving the assistance af
these sans, each country bas ta provide, in
the most generaus mfneasure possible, for the
maintenance -of the maimed and for the
faniles of the fa!Ren, and this must for
many years ta come be tihe first charge dii
the national incarne. Meanwhile those who
remikin have not yet recovered- the former
habit ai industry, and have not yet re-

adjusted their standard oi output ta coinpensate for the reduction oi hours which
publie opinion in ail ocuntries has deinanded and is securing. At the same time,
of the mach.inery which inight have made

adequxate renewals being possible during the
war.' In particular, ail means of transport
have been diaorganized, and the efficiency
Mi the raiiway systems has been. iniversally
irnpaired.
To these geiner al lasses must be .added
the special disturbances ai production in
each country. For example,, a large portion of the mort fertile terri tory, more
eapecially in France and in. the north of
Italy, has been devastated; while in France
also industrial centres and minîng areas,
of vital importance to hier industries, have

lows:

ited quantities of goodâ that are available.
The increase of consuniption take-s 'the form
of an intensified demand for commodities
of every description. The demand not only
for foodetuifs, but for cluthing, boots and
other rnanufactured articles, ie in most
countries far in excess of the supply, while
luxuries of every kind commnand a readier
sale than at almoat -any previaus period.
The general extravagance now observable
throughout the world is a phenomenon
which as almost invariably followed in the
footsteps of every great human catastrophe.
It la well kxiown toi those ewho have lived
in a district which has suffered irom earthquake, and the history of the great plagues
of Europe amply illustrates it; and the results h-ave always been economically disastrous for the populations affected. It mîust
be one of the firet aime of each Goivernment
to take such measures as appear appropriate
to the circumatances of ita own people to
bring home to every citizen the fact that for
the time beinig. until supplies are încreased,
it la by diminished consumption and unselfish denial that they are best able to
help themselves and the -world and that
extravagance increases the national difficulties and perils.
5. Credit and Currency In4lation.-The immense increase in the spending power of
Europe which is reflected in thie extravagance bas ibeen brought &bout *by credit
and currency inflation during the war.
Broadly speaking, the general level of prices
miay be said ta be the expression of the
ratio between spending power on the one
hand and the volume oif purchaseable goods
and services on the other. tI order to
prosecute the war, particularly in European
countries, every Government found it necessary to incerease the amount of currency
in circulation. Unable ta raise sufficient
funda by taxation and hby loans from real
savings, they were compelled to resoTrt to
borro.wing hron the banks and the use of

Aithough detailed statistics are not available, such information as we have goes to
show that the output of factories and manufacturing industries throug-hout the world
la below the standard which. prevailed before the 'war, and far below the demands
now made upon them. The net resuit of
under-ropduction arising from these variaus
causes is an acute shortag-e o-f the essential
supplies on whvichl the econoinic life of
Europe depends.
This situation requires to b-e met with
the same courage as was displaved on both
sides during tde rwvar. The energy which
was then- thrown into the production of
foodstuffs mnust be revived and -reodubled
in order to restore the situation. It must
be made a point of honour with the tillers
of the soul in every country to, show that
peace eau extract froni nature more than
war. Europe mlust takie measures to provide herseif more largely with. the food she
requires in order that she mnay resume her
f ull activities, and much can he effected
if the necessary preparations are made without delay.

In regard to industry generally, each Government mnust take steps to impress on its
people that the limitation of production
directly assists the upyward mnovement of
pricea, and that it is -by increasing production that they can best hielp to sodlve t he
problem. Every proposai which may assiet
in this direction deserves the closest attention.

example, the note circulation bas grown
approximately as follows:

in 1913 to nearly 450,000,0001. at the end of

1,500.000,0001. in 1919;*
In Italy* from 110,000,001. in 1913 to 700,000,0O01. in 1919;
In Beigium* f rom 40,060,0001. in 1913 te

200,000,0001. In 1920;

'Whiie the war debts (which are closely
connected with inflation) amnount, in the
case of the United Xingdom, to over 7,000,000,000.1;
In France* to 6,750,000,0001.;
In Italy* to 2,750,000,0001.;
In Germany* (apart frein liahilities for
reparation) te 9.500,000,0001.;
In United States* to 5,000,000,0001.;
The total war debt o! the worid la approximately 40,000,000,0001.
Throughout Europe prices at present are
with !ew exceptions paper prices. But gold
prices have aiso risen, that is te say, gold
has a iower purchasing power than it had
before the war. This ia the inevitable result of the xnany economies which have
been effected in the use o! gold for monetary purposes and, on the *other hand, el!
the dispersai o! stocks of gold previously
held in Europe and their excessive accumulation in other countries. Thus, in the
United States. aithough the gold standard
remains effective, prices have advanced 120
per cent over the pre-wsr level. As the purchasing power o! gold ia ultimately the
measure of price, At must be obvious that
this change ia itsel! responsibie for much
o! the increase in the price o! commodities.
when expressed in terms of the currencies
of ail countries.
A considerable part o! the rise in prices
in Europe is due te this depreciatien e!
gold, but there is an additional depreciation
due te excessive issues o! paper currency.
The continuai expansion M! paper issues
with its necessary consequence o! continuousiy depreciating exehange prevents the
grant of the commercial credits required
by the situation. and thus fatally hampers
the resumption o! international commerce.
It is essential to the recovery o! Europe
that the manufacture o! additional paper
money and Government credits shoid be
brought te an end. and this must be effected as soon as the war expenditure has been
terminated.
*Note.-The national currencies have in each
case been converted into sterling at approsirnately .Par of exehange.

6. Profiteering.-Excessive profit making.
commoniy known as profiteering, has resulted frors the scarcity of goods. Deflation and a check.upon the continuous rise
of prices will do much -in ît-self to end the
conditions that make profiteering possible.
But it ia essentiai, in order to obtain the coperation of ail classes in the increase of
production, that each government should
take such eteps as are appropriate to the
circuinstances of its own people to assure
and guarantee to the workers that the
burdens that they are called upon by their
efforts te remedy are nlot aggravated by
those who would exploit the economie difficuities o! Europe for their own personal
ends.
7. Restriction of Government Expenditure.-Demobilization has *been effected by
the Powers represented at the Conference
at a far speedier rate than could have been
anticipated, but heavy abnormal expenditure resuiting fromn the war stili requires to
ha met (particularly in connection with the
restoration of the devastated areas). Such
charges must be regarded as part o! the
war burden, but in order to stop the proceas
of inflation and to start the process o! deflation. the necessary measures must be
initiated by every country te balance recurrent government expenditure with national
income and to begin at the earliest possible
moment the reduction o! the floating debts.
The best remedy of ail is that debts should
be reduced. out o! revenue, but in se far
as this is not possible, floating debts should
be consolidated by means of long-terim
boans raised out of the savings o! the
people, and it is out of the savings of the
people that any fresh capital expenditure
must be provided. The Governments here
represented have undertaken the consideratien of the measures required for this purpose.
8. Restriction of Private -Expenditure. But private economy is not less urgent than
economy in ýGoverninent expenditure. It is
only by means o! frugal living on the part
o! ail classes of the nation that the capital
can be saved which is urgently required for
the repair o! -war damage, and for restering efficiently to the equipment o! industry,
upon which future production depends. It
is o! the utmcst importance that it. should
be brought home to every citizen in each
country that just as in the war their private. savings made available for the Governient goods and services urgently needed
for the prosecution of hostilities, se in the
period of reconstruction. economny by individuals will reduce ihe cost o! essential

articles both for thernselves and for their
fellows. and will set free capital for the
reconstruction of their country and the
restaration of the machinery of industry
throughout the wvorld.
9. Collapse of Exchang-es.-ConmerciaI
intercourse, on the resumption of which the
recovery ai the 'world depends, is governed
by the foreigu exchanges. and most of the
foreign exchanges have been to a greater or
lesa extent disorganized du-ring the past
year. The discount ai 'Eurapean currencies

The abats af the exchange does not reflect
the true financial situation ai the countries
concernied, provided their industrial Me
can be resumed. It is in part the resuit af
depireciation in the purchasing power oi
the several currencies, but in part it resulta
iromn the faîlure af exporta. ManY countries are temporarily dependent on the importation ai food, raw material, and other
necessaries, and are nat in a poeition ta
export nearly sufficient ta furnish the
requisite means of payment. The resuit
bas been severe competition for the very
limited supply ai Buis of Exchange which
bas iorced down the rate ai exehange beyond tbe point wbich properly represents
the purchasing power ai currencies in the
buying snd selling countries. In the degree in whîch rates ai exchange are s0
farced down, the prices oi imports are
iorced up and tbe prices ai food and raw
material increased. The ultimate cure ls
ta raise exporta ta the requisite amounit.
and this should be impressed on the trading communities affected, but it is nat immediately passible ta increase exporta sufficiently, and unlees steps are taken ta furtiish a substitute the situation will rapidly

action wiil only retard ultimate recavery.
Meanwhile means must be iaund ta prevent

the present moment, the Governments ai

limited extent for the purpose of relieving
extreme distress, and State aid in this
matter would be at the best entirely inadequate. It le fromn the resumptian of commercial credlts that the necessary means
must be iound for securing the interchange
oi the resources of the world, and the Conference is assured that such credits will
be iorthcoming as soon -as governments
have taken steps to strengthen confidence
in their commercial and financial policy.
The-Powers represented at the Conference
recognize, however, the necessity of continued collaboration in this matter, and they
will continue to consult together regarding
provision and distribution of the necessary raw materials -and foodatuifs with a
view ta the early reauimptian. of normal
conditions.
They recognize, further».the special position of the devaistated counitries, and
particularly of France, having regard ta
the widespread devastation which her territory bas suftered, the consequent diminutian ai ber immediate resources, and the
heavy càpital expenditure which ahe must
incur in restoring the damaged areas. The
restoration of the devastated areas is ai
primary importance ta the reconstruction
oi Europe.
Tbey have also bad under consideration
the special position ai Germany. where
enterprise is at present para.lysed and the
poasibiîity ai obtaining commercial credit
closed, by reasan of the fact that her obligations for reparatian are still totally unknown. It la most desirable, therefore, in
the interesa ai the Allied Cb~untries, no
lesa than in that ai Germany, that at the
earliest possible moment the total af the
reparatioxi payxnents ta be made by Germany under the Treaty ai Versailles should
be fixed, and that, in accordance with the
termis ai the Treaty and the reply ai the
Allied and Âssociated Pawera ta, the German delegates dated the l6th June, 1919,
she should *be enabled ta obtain essential
foodatuffs and raw materials, and. if necessary in the opinion ai the Reparation Coinmission 8hould -be allowed ta raise abroad

Reparatian Commission may deem essential. In the case ai Austria, the powers

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED

MAY 4, 1920.

Hon. àMr. ROBERTSON: That is the intention. The purpose oi the amendment is
to give the mnunicipalities the saine opportunity ta take advantage af the provisions
of the Act itself, on a fifty-fifty basis, as the
province would have if it saw fit ta came
into the arrangement.
Hon. [Mr. BEIjOOURT: I arn afraid my
honourable friend i. gaing beyond the jurisIt may be

argued that paragraphs a, b, and c, of
section 3 af the Act of 1918 are quite permissible, because the powers conferred upon
the minister may be exercised without at
ail infringing the rights of the provinces;
but I do nat think that this would apply
ta the anmendment now proposed in new
paragraph b:
Ta require any persan or firm ta make a written return of such information as may be
deemed necessary for the purposes of tht. Act.
or of any regulation made by authority of tht.
Act, under penalty nat exceeding one hundred
dollars and flot les than ten dollars, for each
refusai or negleet ta answer or wilfully taise
answer.

That would be a pawez which the minister
-nîight exercise in regard ta any persan in
any province, and notwithstanding any
provincial legisiation. Sa nmy honourable
friend, I amn afraid, did nat quite state the
case the other day when hie said that the
proVliisions of the amendment were provisions which would be enforced only 'with
the consent and participation of the provinces. That would not apply ta the aniendtuient which is now proposed, because,
whether the provinces wish it or do nat wisli
it, my honourable friend can require any
persan or firm ta make a written return.
I do nat think that i. within the constitution. 1 am afraid that provision would be
ultra vires.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If rny honour,able friend fully understands the proposed
amendmnent and the reasans for it being inserted here. hie will quite appreciate the
necessity of it. The Departînent af Labour
mnaintaîn what is known as a cleuring house
in the city of Winnipeg for Western Canada, and one in Ottawa for Eastern Canada, and the employees af labour, particularly the manufacturing concerns, numbering between 8,000 and 9,000 throughaut the
country, make a weekly return on a form
af postal card size, ehowing the number ai
persans they have had iu their employ during the week, and the number they anticipate they will require during- the next
week. and same other information, so that
we rnny knlow at ail tijîxes just what the

3M5

prospective requirernents are. Up ta the
time when the War Measures Act was discontixiued, there wvas authorty-I do not
recail, but I presumne it was by Order in
Council-whereby any information desired
had ta be supplied. Under that arrangement we were able ta get, in connectian
with this service, the information necessary
ta carry an aur work intelligently. It has
happened that a few, a very few-perbaps
less than a score out af 8,000 or 9,000 employers throughout Canada-have objected
toagoing ta the trouble af sending in this
necessary information. This clause is inserted simply for the purpose of enabling
the department ta obtain the necessary iniformation and ta administer the Act properly. I think you. will find that under the
Board of Commerce Act the powers of that
board are stili wider than thase wvhich are
suggested here, and if the Federal Parliament had jurisdiction ta enact a clause of
this sort in the Board af Commerce Act, it
seems ta me there is no question as ta its
jurisdiction in thîs connection.
Hon. -Mr. BELCOURT: I am afraid that
that is flot a very convincing sort ai argument: it is simply begging- the question-,
because if the provisions of the Board of
Commerce Act are ultra vires, they wvould
flot mnake this any better. Because an ultra
vires Act ha. already been passed, is na
reason why another Act would be intra
vires. If my honourable friend wiIl look
at section 6 of the present Act, he will see
that it provides:
The payments hereinbefore autharized shah,.
as ta each province. be conditionai upon agreement between the minister and the Government
of the province as ta the terme. conditions and
purpases wîthin the meaning of this Act upon
and for which the payments are to) be made and
appied, and upon such agreement being approved by the Governar in Cauncil.

Clearly my honourable friend's jurîsdiction with regard ta payments would be limited by the Act; that is, it would require
the concurrence of the Provincial Government. But that applies only ta payments;
and here my honourable friend la taking a
power which is flot dependent upon the
agreement or concurrence of the province:
hae
will have the right ta require any person or firm ta make a written return of
information. This clause can ha intra vires
only if, like the question of payments, it
ia made subject ta the acquiescence or concurrence ai the Provincial Governrnent. I
arn afraid that if it i. nat so conditioned,
or so limited. it will be ultra vires.

Hou. Sir JAMES LOU-GHEED înoved that
the Senate go into cominittee on Bilt 27. aii

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is proposed to

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

No. jUQt

~Hon.

Mr. BEI.OURT: Wouid it not be
advisable to deal 'with ail three at the saie
time? You have a general Act respecting
food and drugs. Why not make the other
-Bis part of that, and have only one?
The
H-on. Sir JAMEFS 'LOUGHEED:
Bis ae to honey and nauple products
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. Whyv not put
theni ail into one Act?
Bull 27
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
simply deals with general princil)les and
does flot deal with individual subiecta.Ail through the statutes runs legishation
dealing with particular subjectez sucli as
honey, mnaple producta, butter, oleoiarzarine. etc. It woiùld therefore be very uindesirable for us to encuniber this Bil or to
import into At any specific" subject. because it is a Bill deaiing simply %withgeneral principles. As we proceed niy lionourable friend will probably observe whai
ia the policy of the Bill.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
the -Senate went into Conumittee on Bill 27.
Hon. Mr. Crosby in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
aak leave of the commnittee to bring within
the bar, Dr. Amyot, who is the Deputy
Minister of the Departrnent.
Section 1 was agreed to.

On section 2-)definitions:
Hon. Sir J 1 ES LOUGHEED: I may
say that paragraphis a, b, and c are froin
the old Act; that is, the Adulteration ActParagraph d is new.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOeK: P.aragraph d confines the interpretation of the word "food"
to food for man only?
Hon. Sir JA3MES LOU.GHEED: Yes.
-Hon. Mr. 1BOSTOiCK: And does not refer
at ail to animais?
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUG-HEED: No.
Section 2 'was agreed to.
On section 3-food, when deemed to be
adulterated:
Hlon. Mr. POWER: Is flot the language
a littie too sweeping? "Food includes every
article used for food or drink by man, and
every ingredient intended for nlixing wîth
the food or drink 'of man for any purpose
iwhatever." Section 3 says that, food shall
lie deemned to be adulterated within the

as to reduce or lower or lnjuriouely affect its

quallty or strength.

Xow. suppose that the food in question is
Scotch whisky; if you put a little water
into the Scotch whisky you are guilty of
adulterating the food.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
think any Scotchinan would stand for
that.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Where are they
gohw to -et the Scotch?
Hon. "Mr. POWERl: It is not a joke; it is

Hon. Mr. POWER: If you say, "and

can qualify it ini such a way and make the
Act praticable.' We have to import some.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: That question was up

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- I quite

it occurred to me that the joint committee

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: In the other Houcse

from that standpoint.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.: Would the lionourable gentleman explain the reason for
the suspension of this enactment by Order

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is on

been made for this purpase, and the difficulty ef replacing them. It la proposed ta

Hlon. Mr. MURPHY: Will the inanufacturers of carbanated beverages be compelled

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 purpose moving an amendaient to line 33.

ineans of preventing the adulteratian of
food. not merely in the way 9tated here, but
by its awn process, as it were-deterioratien, either by reason of the bottling, the
can used, or something else? We have al
read recently of the very seriaus trouble
caused by the eating af ripe olives. Many
deaths have taken -place, both here and in
the United States. Only a few days ago I
read in one of the newspapers that the
trouble was largely caused by the rubber
rings, which are used to hermetically seal
the botties, poisoning the contents. The
saine article pointed out that contrary te
the general opinion, it was not the tin can
that caused the trouble, but ripe olives

that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
3, paragraph d, does this, and in fact Nvas
provided for that purpose.
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn afraid.that

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
refer te :the chemnical process of becoming
putrid.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Very serious danger is encountered by the caniununity in the
way I have indicated, and -if there is any
preventive against that the department
should consider the advisability of rnakingit a part of 'this legisiation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEÉD: That is
one of the abjects, and it la proposed, under the powera granted in the Bill, ta make
inspection s0 as to determine fully whether
the food is fit for human consuniption.
Hon. Mr. BEL'COURT: Should there not
be sonie provision in the Bill to cover that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend thinks that paragraphi d
is nat sufficient 1 will accept a suggestion
and before we corne to the third reading we
can follow it up. We desire te make the
Bill effective along 1these lines.

iion of that Subsection for such period as
he may prescribe "with regard to botties

suggested that the words "«ordinarily known
as sofit drinks" should be deleted in order
te aliow the Governor in Couneil, on representations made, te go ýbeyond that expression, "soi t drinks," because those beer
bottles are nlot essily obtained just no'w,
and some delay may be necessary iu that
case, as in others, for the importation of the

what it is worth; but, as the matter is to

Hon. Mr. BELÇOURT: It occurs to me
that the words used in the section are not

as distiiied water and spring water sold,
but they are not minerai waters.
Hon. Mr. POWER. Ginger aie or ginger
beer is nlot a minerai water.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUJRT: 'No, but I think
the words ought ta be extended so as to
include distilled water, and probably others.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Originally the language was intended to cover
that clase oi bottie in which a cheap drink

On section 7-saniples may be obtoineri;

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: la ibis section

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; the
only new feature is that At gives the department authority to hold samples until analysis la miade.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is it new
so far as it givea power to the deparinient
to seize and confiscate the goods witbout
any trial or any conviction?
The
Hon'. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEDspirit la, the same as in the old Act, except that now the inspector xnay temporarily seize a suspected article until an analysis la made, and if the goods are nlot
found contrary to the Act they may be
immediately released. It was found that
wben seizures were not mnade the vendors
took precautions, to dispose of the suspected
gocds as ratpidly as possible. so that
when the inspecter returned they were
gone. Under the old Act it was not pos-:
sible ta hold the goods îmported into Canada for sufficient tinie to determine what
should be done with theni.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Subsection 2, at line 22, saye:
If the. Dominion Analyst reporta tlitt the. sald
article in adulterated or mlsbranded withln the
meaning of ibis Act the article no selzed and
held shall ipso facto be forfeited to Hia MaJesty.
Otherwlse it shail be released forthwIth.
The article seized might be very valuable; yet in making thîs new law we are
giving an officiai power ta forfeit it without granting the holder of the article any
trial at ali. He should net be fined or inprisoned without a trial. 'That is a very
drastic Act.

Hon. Mr. PO~WER: I find no provision

In the suxnmer time a dealer in soit drinks
might suifer serious pecuniary loss by
being compelled to hold a large stock over
until the Dominion Analyst, perhasps coming
from some distant city, had an opportunity
to examine and report. In large cîties there
are Dominion Analysts, but t.hey are not
distributed over the country, and provision should be made for prompt reports.
Hon. Sir. JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
13 deals with reports.
The
Hom, Mr. LYNCSTIMAUNTON:
honourable member for Middleton (Hon. W.
B. Rosa) has just pointed out that section
12 absolutely contradicts section 7, with
which, we are now dealing. because it says:
If the Dominion Analyst reporta to the depart-

ment that the-whole or any part of such articles
of food or drugs as have been submitted for
analysin by the. aforead Inspector ia adulterated or misbranded, the ininister may declare
such article. or no much thereof as the. Dominion Analyst reports to be adulterated or
mtabranded, to be forfeited to the Crown.

This leaves it in the discretion of the
minister, 'while section 7 gives the minister
no discretion whatever; he is as heipless
as anyhody else; the article is ipso facto
forfeited to the Crown.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Insteadl of
saying "shall ipso facto be forfeited," we
might use the words "may ipso facto," etc.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is taken

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It seemB
te me that subsection. 2 is snperseded by

This subsection 2 of 7 is not required if
section 12 stands.

read: "If on analysis it appears :is-4braiided." Sureiy the gemieral appearance ai the
aticle should nat be sufficient.
Ho.n. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wefl, if
the lacts warrant that conclusion.
.Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose -i!
it appears" are synanyntous witîh "if he
finds."
Hon. Mr. M-\URPHY: "Appears" is an
unfortunate word.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do nat
knowv of any word more used ini judiciail
proceedings than the word "appears." It
-s a -.ord w'hich is invariablv uzed. in ail
arcters of the court.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED rnoved
that subsection 4 be anmended zread as
fcallowvs:
A copy of such certificate shall be furnished
torthwith by the departmnent to-the persan from
whorn the sample was procured.

The amendiment ai Han. S:r James
Lougheed wvas ag-reed ta. and the section
as ainended iras agreed ta.
On sectiorn 9--appeai; further 'iivestigeation and analysis:
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think the
words "in full" should bc included. The
persan supplying the article ha£ only ten
days in which ta controvert the certificate
of the Dominion analyst. He gets notice
to-day, and ten <laya hence he nmuat put
beicre the nxinister a coniplete case.

3

Hon. '.\r. 'MURPHY: Thirty days would
lie oetter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think a period
of ten days is altogether too short, because
b)y the words "in fuil" lhe wouid be ahliged
to submit at once ta the minister the complete evidence.
Han. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It daes
flot say that at ail; it says that lhe shail
notify the minister that hie intends ta suhmit the evidence.
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: "Stating in fuil
the nature of such evidence."
Xhe
Han. Mr. LYNROH4TAUNTON:
nature wvill be that the article is pure food
and that tlie label is ail right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.: Na, no. My hanaura ble friend is too much of a lawyer ta
th'nk it meana that.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It saya,
"stating in fuil the nature of such
evidence."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My recollection la that yau have ta take such a step
as that under the surnmary proceedinga in
appeal fromn a justice af the peace under
the Criminal Code. That is ta say, yau
have ta, serve yaur notice of appeal within,
I think, ten days. That is ail that is required. The appeal ie nat lodged. The persaon cancerned aimpiy gives natice af appeal.
He sinîply has -ta state that he intenda ta
present evidence in his own behaîf ta cantrvert the certificate. He does nat submit
ev'idence; he simply states the character ai
the evidence ta be submitted.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do ziat think sa.
I think the wvords "stating in full the nature
of snch evidence," mean that hie would
hia-ve ta submit a complete statenient.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If they
liad ta state the evidence in fuil, that wvould
lie a different thing.
Honi. Mr. BELOIOURT: It is open ta that
construction.
Hon. Mr. McMREANS: If a inan living in
Victoria receives a capy ai the certificate,
lie is required to notify the iiîiister within
leîî days. lit wiil take six days for hie
notice ta reach here. You miglht as well
shut him out altogether.

appeal to the man who condemns your
goods?
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: 'No. He notifies
the minister.
Hon. Mr. MeblE,ýANS: The minister niay
not get that notice.
Hon. Mr. MUEPHY: In one place it says
Dominion analyst; in another place, chief
Dominion analyst.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I1 think that instead
of striking out the words "in full," as su-gested by the honourable member fromn Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), it would be
better to lengthen the time given to the
accused to make his appeal; because wve
should see that the department gets fair
play; and if the party appealing is not
bound to state in. full the grounds of his
appeal, the department is liable to be talcen
by surprise when the inquiry cornes up. I
think the better way would be to give the
accused a littie longer time to make his
appeal.
Hon. Mr. 'MURPHY: There is no objection to that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
does the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
suggestP
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: 0f course, it depends altogether on whether the words "in
full" are left in or not.
Thirty
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-ST-AUNTON:

Hon. Mr. BELOULRT: If the words "in

with the time given.
Hon. Mr. MURLPHY: Leave "in full"
and make the time thîrty days.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
extend the time and leave in the words "in
f ull. " That permits of a better presentatiè'n of the case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Give thirty days
Hon. Mr. POWER: Give twenty days.
Hon. Sir JAMM~ LOUGHE.ED: Say ive
split the difference and make it twenty
days.
Hon. Mr. POWER. I move that the word
"twenty" be substituted for "ten" in the
fourth line of the paragraph.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Power was
agreed to, and section 9 as amended wvas

Section 10 was agreed to.

Hon. .Mr. BO6TO-CK: Is this a new clause,
or is it the same as the old clause-,
Hon. Sir J.AMES LOUIGREED: I understand it is the same principle as in the old
Act. Section 13 of the oldi Act makes provision for this.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Did it not provide that the penalty should be divided between the informer and the department?
Hon. Sir JAMES. LOUGH.EED: That is

Section 11 was agreed to.

zeetion 14 was agyreed to.
On section 15-regulations by minister:
Hon. iMr. BOSTOCK: 1 think that paragraph c af this section contains an- objectionable provision. I do not see why the
informant shoculd receive half the fine.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: I have had, I t.hinik,
a dozen or more very strong telegrams from
bo th grocers and druggists, protesting
against the division cd the penalty with
out-side persons.
There
Hon. Mr. LYNICH-STAUNTON:
will be no prosecutions unless that is done.
There are '-ery few prosecutions even now,
and there are a great many adulterated
foods. 'This is a very salutary- provision,
and I think it should *be tihere Vo protect
the public.
Hon. M'ýr. BOSTOC1'K%: Will not the publie
protect themnselves under this Act?
Hon. Sir JALMES LOUGHEED: No. This
principle is to be found in many Acts.
Hon. M.r. BOSTOOXK: I think it is very
objectionable.
Of course,
Hon. IMr. 'DANDURAND:
tihose who are poisoned cannot prosecute;

Hon. Mr. CURRY: IS that. iii the .31Act?
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Section 15 was agreed ta.
On section 16-penalties:
I subHon. Mr. LYNOH..STAUNTON:
mit that t.his section should be amended
ta read in this way: "Every person who
knowingly, or under such circumstances
tihat a magistrate finds tiiat hie should have
known, selle, offers for sale, or exposes for
sale," etc. à man should flot be heid
criminaily liable if he did flot know, or
if it can be said that he ought flot ta have
known.
Hon. M1r. MURPHY: Section 17 covers
that.
Hon. Mr. LYN M-6TAU.\"TON: No, it does
not. I have read section 17, and I think
it is the most extraordinary clause 1 ever
saw. I think that a man sliould not -be 'held
criminally liable unless lie knows or ouglit
ta have known. A inan may *buy sealed
packages, in which case hie has flot the
slightesÉ oxpportunity of knowing; and Isu>.
mit that ho sliould not be hieid ialble. The
language 1 have suggested leaves the matter
entirély in the discretion of the magistrate.
If he finds that a man ouglit ta -have known.
hie would be liable. I think the inagistrate
s1houid have the responsibility of saying that
a man couid not know or oughlt flot ta have
known.
Hon. Mr. McMEA.NS: Why does flot section 17 cover that case?
I ivilI
Hon. M.r. LYNCIH-STAUNTON:
expiain if a man buys a large quantity of
canned goods from a reputabie dealer, does
any one contend that lie is bound ta open
tiose cans and have the contents analysed?
Section 17 says that i-f the persan accused
proves -that lie couId not with reasonabie
diligence have uibtained knowiedge od its
aduiteration or mi9branding Îhe shal ibe discharged." With reasonable diligence -li
could have opened the cans.
TIhen t.hiey
Hon. Mr. DAND.URAND:
would not be saieable.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUN\TON: No. He
could punch a (hale in every can.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: TIhis provision would not go that far.
-Hon. Mr. LYNUH-STAUN.TON: No mani is
held liable in a -criminal prasecution unless

t.he court is satîsified that he lias knowiedge
or oughtr ta have known.
Hon. Sir JÂMBS LOUGHEED: If we
aniended the provision is accordance withi
the views ex.pressed by my honourable
friend, it wouid be futile to attempt to enforce the Act. because it would flot bo
possible ta prove knowledge in regard ta
deteriorated or adulterated foods on the
shelves of a retailer. Surely section 17 la
sufficient. The hast su.bsection oRf
section 16
doubles the penalty il the offence is an
aggravated one. The policy of thia Act is
to protect, the publie from Ibeing poisoned.
le it not isifinitely more important that the
public shc>uld be protected than that 8ome
one who is selling adulterated, food ediouid
possibly escape? It seems ta me that you
have to choose between the two, and we
have imported into section 17 ail thxe protection required by any man dealing in
these gooda. All ho would have te do would
be ta make thbe necessary inquiry.
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOOK:

Would it not resuit

iii this: A man buyinig a case of canned

saimon would have ta take one tin and haire
it analysed before ho couid sell the case?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. Ail
he lias to do is to exorcise ordinary discro'Lion.
Section 16 was agreod ta.
Sections 17 and 18 were agreed ta.
On section 19-voiuntary payments:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Wliat is the abject of clause 19? Does that mean that whon
the man is brought up lie may voluntarily
pay so mucli ta the minister and the prosecutian will stop? It is a rather curious
provision.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I think the word
"voluntary" sliould bo struck out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It sî-mply pernxits the accused ta acknowledgo hie
g-uilt.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He does not pay
voluntarily, but because lie lias comiiiitted an afflence.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: That can only
be done after a suit lias been instîtuted.
Hou. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
after adulteration lias been established.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can the minister
say how inany payments have boon made
under this section of the aid Act.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.: My deputy tells nie that even within the last threeweeks there have been some.

Hon. '-%r. BOSTOCK: Perhaps my honourabie friend could let us have that information later.
Hon.. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Section 19 was agreed to.
On section 20-refusai of access:
Hon. Mr. POWER: I think the language
of this clause is 'rather too sweeping. If
a person omits to show the inspector-it
is flot merely if he refuses, but if hie "omits
to show the inspector al] or any of such
articles in bis posseasion"-he shall be liable. I think that is going rather too far.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That la
the law which has been on the statute book
for many years, and I do flot think it bas
been productive of any great hardship.
The department is act.ing under that now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There need be
no prosecution. If the analysis establishes
that a person ia guilty hie can pay in.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Suppose
there is a certificate establishing adulteration or misbranding. A man so charged
may not desire to go to court and hie May
say, "I1 admit the offence," and hie can pay
the fine.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Do you think
that. is sufficient punishment? I do not
think it is.

TRUST ÇOMPANIES BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 38, an Act to amend
the Trusts Companies Act, 1914.
He said: The abject of thiW Bill is ta place
trust companies under the Insurance Branch
so i ar as inspection is concerned. It p1uces
them in practicaliy the same position as
insurance companies with relation ta inispection. There are about 30 trust .companies operating under federal legisiation,
and there is no provision at present for an
annual inspection; but the department or
te iister of Finance is placed in motion, perhaps by sorne untoward circumstance, and an inspection is made. Companies af this character are becorning s0
important in the transactior Vf business that
it is very necessary for the public ta be
protected by the most rigid inspection.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I understand that
this Bill anid the next Bill an the Order
Paper, No. 39, are very niuch on the same
lines.
Yes,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
necessarily so.

CIVIL SERVICE INSURA.NCE

BILL.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 58, an Act ta amend
the Civil Service Insurance Act.
He said: As honourable gentlemen are
aware, the Government maintains an insurance service for members of the Civil
Service. This insurance service lias been
self-supporting. The amount of the policy
has been increased, froin tine ta time. At
the beginning it was, I think, $2,000 ar
!2,5W0. Then it was increased ta 15,000. IV
is now proposed to increase the maximum
aniaunt of insurance ta $10,000, so as ta
permit of a more adequate allowance for
the family of the deceased, or the beneficiaries, as the case may be. As I have aiready stated, the insurance is self-supporting, and the Governinent therefore feel
every confidence in acceding ta the representations which have been made by Vhe
members af the Civil Service, that the
aniaunt should be in.creased fromn $5,000 to
$10,000. Owing to the very great rise in
prices, and the increased cost af living, it
is very desirabie that additional provision
should be made aiong these lines.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I notice that this
Bill empowers the Government ta extend
Vhe insurance ta Vhe Navy as weli.
Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Under the aid Act it was extended ta the
civil and miiitary empioyees of the Government. Why Vhe Navy was left out I
do not know, uniess it was that when Vhe
Act was .pasd, shortiy after Confederatian, we were net sa impressed. with that
hranch af the service as we are now.

Government to the question put. It will be
seen from the answer that of the returned
soldiers who qualifled Major Stehelin got
177.8 out of a possible 200 points. Next to
him came Mr. Baril, a professionsl translator, who got 172.7 points, or 5 points less
than Major 8tehelin; then followed Adolphe
Drouin, with 167 points, or 10 points below
Major Stehelin. Therefore, honourable gentlemen, if the examiners know anything
about their business, and I can. assure you
that they are eminently capable, this gentleman qualifled. To prove this more clearly
I wiUl refer to the list of civilian candidates
who also passed the examination. One of
them, Mr. Potvin, who is employed here as
professional transiator, and, I understand.
is well cpxalifled, took the examination at
the same time, and he got 171.8 points, being
6 points below Major Stehelin.
Major Stehelin, when he passed his examination, was just back from the war. Hie
had not shaken the dust of the trenches off
his feet. He saw an adve'rtisement in the
paper, tried the examinations, and on his
own merits, without any influence, he was
appo4nted and sent here by the Civil Service
Commission. That same gentleman was later
dismissed on the ground. of alleged incompetency. The allegation of incom'petency
falls, prima facie. The proof that he is
comrpetent is the answer to this inquiry. I
do not know what power there is in this
House-I do not refer at ail to the committee, nor to the Clerk, nor to the Speaker,
because they cannot go into the details of
every case; but who is the power in this
House that thwarts the nomination, the
proper nomination, of competent men made
by this commission? Who is it in this
House who renders null and void the will
of the country, as enacted in the 39th section of the Civil Service Act, which says:
In aIl examianation@ persans who have been
on active service overseas on the military or

naval forces of Hie Majesty. during the present war; who have lett such service wlth an
honourable diacharge; and who obtain suffiiient

marks to pao such examinations, shall, Irre-

apectiije of the marks they have obtained, be
placed ln the order of menit on the list of successful candidates above ail other candidates.

This gentleman had qualified in every
way. I desire this House to know that when

SENATE
th e war broke out lie with aIl his brothers,
four or more of the'n, volunteered at the
very first caîl. and xent over and served
their country. This gentleman was promnoted on the battlefield, an'd the old father of
these boys died during the war, possibly not
of regret to see his sons fighting- for England,
Canada, and France, but more likely because he himself was too old to, cross over.
Major Stehelin bas been properly sent to
this House. He was dismissed because of
alleged incom-petency, and, what is worse.
one of my honourable colleagues said-what.
he will permit me to qualify as regrettable
-that the selection of this very nian was the
worst that could have been made. I say
that, according to the answer which is before us, according to my own knowledge, flot
only was iAnot the worst, but it was the best
that could have been made from among the
military candidates. 1 knew of this gentleman, and he came to me and told me that
lite was made impossible for him, in the
Senate. I asked what wvas the matter, and
asked him to show me his translations. He
brought me the last translation lie had
made. II lookai over it, and, gentlemen, if
I can judge of the French language, that
translation wus 25 per cent hetter than
some of the translations of our Debates
which have been made of fate years. No
doubt the language was flot as eloquent as
that ot Bassuet or of Mirabeau; but. honourable gentlemen, you cannot make an
eloquent French translation-of an English
speech that lacks eloquence.
1 shall fot add anything further except te
say that I believe a Nvrong, has unwittingly
heen done, and 1 would like the members
of the Coinmittee on Internal Econoiny to
see whv they are made responsible for a
wrong towards a very deserving man.

BRADBUTRY:
Hon. Mr.
ifl oTder. I would like to say a few
words. I do flot t.hink that remarks suoh
as have been ma.de bv the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mlr. Poirier) sbould be
allowed to, go without soine words of rehuttal. I arn amazed at the attitude the
honouraible gentleman lias taken on this
question. I happen to know a little about
wshat has taken place in regard to the
appointment of this tranclator. The gent.leman, according. to tihe return which bhas
been made, secured a sufficient number of
marks to put him at the head of the list,
and one 'would naturally have thought he
would be competent to fill the position.
The man bas my heartfelt synipathy, and,
as a returned soldier miyselt, I would have
H-on. Mr. POIRIER.

been glad to see him flot only obtain the
position 'but prove himself quadified toi hold
it. 1I arn informed by those w*ho know that
he was absolutely incompetent; that his
translation was so bad that it could flot
be used. -It wag sent to experts to be
examined, and tihese experts pronounced
it absolutely unfit to -be placed in Hansard.
1 was led to believe that the honourable
gentleman who, bas appealed. on behalf oft
thi-s man knew triese !facts. StUR he pleads
that a man 'who is inefficient slhou1d be
place-d in 6uch an important positio*n as
translater of the Senate.
I arn sorry, honourable gentlemen, to
realize that the tendency in our Civil Service
to-d-ay does n<et seemn to, Jbe towarde securing
efficiency. Efflciency ought to hbe tie aim
cdf the Senate and of every honourable
gentleman in it. Instead of that, il I can
read between the lines, the honourable
gentleman would be quite satisfied to retain
in the Senate, at a higih saIary-I think
$2,400 or $2,00-a man who was aibsolutely
incapable of doing t.he work. Ho-w this
man secured the marks which. qualified hlm
for the appointment is another question. It
praves to me t.hat the examination which
take place in connection with appointments
to positions oft thia kind are little ehott of
a farce. Hanourable gentlemen may remember that at last session, when the question
of the method of making appointments to
the staff of the' Senate was débated in this
House, I contended that the Chief of the
Department requiring assistance ougiht to be
consulted in the preparation of the examination papers. so, that the man appointed
would 'be qualified to, fulfil the duties he
would 'be called upon to ,perform; 'but the
Hous3 did flot see eye to eye .%ith me.
Q'onsequently that provision waa oniitted.
The fact that this gentleman apparently
succeeded in passing an examination and
satisfying tihe Civil Service Commission
demonstrates clearly that the examination
was anything but sufficient. The man himself had absolutely no experience. In the
first place, the position calîs for a man with
certain qualifications, including university
graduation. This man is flot a graduate of
any university. He was, 1 understand, a
book-keeper in a lumber camrp, perhaps a
very competent; man in bis uine, but absolutely unqualified for the very important
position to which he was appointed.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAI[N: I do not want to
interrupt the lhonourable gentleman, but
how dbes he .account -for the tfact that this
gentleman got so, many points?

MAY 5, 1920

man from. Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais),
who is not here at the moment, la more
comrpetent to speak on this question than I
am. He is an educated Fren-chman. I arn
tcld that 'when a page of the translation was
subrnitted to the honourable Senator, he
declared that iL dernonstrated the absolute
incompetence of the man who made that
translation; iL was not a good translation
andi was unfit to be inserted in Hansard.
I do net know the object of raising this
question. I presume that every honourable
gentleman in this House ia anxious te
secure efficiency in its officials. That should
be the first aim. Now, if this gentleman
was inefficient or incompetent, why should
any honourable -menmer rise in his place
and protest against his being removed from
the position? I could understand the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Poirier) having
a grievance against the Civil Service Coinmission for sending to this House a man who
was evidently incempetent and inefficient.
If the appointee was not qualified, as I
think has been demonstrated, beyond any
question by men who know, then why should
the honourable gentleman feel that the
man lias been harshly treatedP I arn told
on every good authority that this man,
when he was occupying the position, admitted frankly that hie was not competent to
discharge the duties appertaining to the
office. In view of these facts I do flot think
that any1body responsible for changing the
situation is deserving of censure or bla-me.
I think that if the authorities cf this House
had not taken the action necessary to insure our having a correct translation, then
they would have been derelict in their.
duty to the House, and would have been
deserving orf censure. I think tiiat the
officiais of the House deserve to be highly
commended for the action they have taken.
I hold in my hand the classification
volume in which are stated the qualifications
required for this position as follows:
E2ducation equivalent to university graduation; at least two. years of experience as translator or experlence of similar character and
standard; In soinse cases suflicient specialiaed
training or previous experience to insure thorough famiiiarity with legal and scientiflc terminology; considerable demonstrated aptitude
for translation and the faculty of expresslng

ideas cleariy in each of the

languages used;-

abillty te read. write and speak two or more
languages 11uently.

Urifortunately, honourable gentlemen,
this man had none of these qualifications;
and how under heaveni he secured the
highest marks in that exarnination is a
rnystery to everybody. That is a question
that rnight bear investigation.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: ls that an insinuation

Commission or the examiner&?
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BRIADBflRY:
gentlemen, I arn niaking no insinuationI amn making a plain statement of facts.
and the honourable gentleman can take
out of that whatever hie likes.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Is hie a university
graduate?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: According to my
information, he is not a universîty graduate,
and has none of the qualifications that
would have entitled hlm to the position
which has been awarded him by the Civil
Service Commission.. This is only another
argument, and a very strong argument in
my mmnd, for taking this House frorn underneath the operation of the Civil Service
Commission. Every officiai, of this House,
to my mmnd, ougit to be appointed to the
*House on the recomandation of some responsible officer of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Hear, hear; I amn
in favour of that toc.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Il that wvere the
case, we would have no such trouble as we
are having to-day. I purpose giving you
some day an opportunity of votîng on this
question, ail I intend to move an amendment to the Civil Service Act <when it cornes
before us, with that purpose in view.
.Now, I arn not Soin.g to detain the House.
1 would not have risen te say a word only
that I thouglit my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Poirier) wvas perhaps misin-forrned. Th 'e
gentleman who now occupies the position
of translator, Mr. Potvin, ivhorn I have
known for years. is a graduate of two universities. He is a thoroughly qualified
French seholar. He had been perfcrrning
the duties of the position to the satisfaction
of his chief and of everybody who came in
contact with the translation, for, I think,
eight or nine months previous to the exarninaLion. In my opinion, accordin-, te law
Mr. Potvin should have been appointed
without that examination.

THE BRITISH EIPIRE STEEL
CORPORATION.

On the OrdeTe of the. Day:
Honi. FREDERLO NICHIOLI&: Honourable gentlemen. I would like ta ask the indulgence of this Houa. to refer ta a matter
that is occupying publie attention to a considerable extent at tia time. Yesterday,
the honourable the. leader of the Opposition
placed on the Order Paper an inquiry for
certain particulara in connection with the
British Empire Steel Corporation. I amn
tolod ithat if I were ta remain liere until tomorrow I would have an opportunity of
speaking te thie question. But, unfortunately, I amn informed- that a great many of
thie mechanica in aur Peterboroughi works
have threatened ta go out on strike tomorrow morning. Therefore. by leave of
the House, I would like ta refer to this
matter at the present time.
1 arn interested ti this merger from. the
standpoint that I arn one of the vice-presidents of one of the constituent comapanies,
the Dominion Iran and Steel Corporation;
and, while I shall noit attenipt at this time
and ini this place to defend the British Empire Steel Corporation, beesu.. I do not
see that any information is yet before the
public that warrants any attack, and therefore no defence is neceseary, I do think it
'would b. interesting to thia House ta have
certain information from -one rwho ie qualiB.ed ta give it firet hand.
It was soine inonths ago when the. question of the merging of certain Canadian
steel corporations and other corporations
camne before the company cf which I arn an
executive officer, and at that Itiiai I was
personally very rnuch cipposed txi the idea.

great many conferences, and I have to say
niow that, with a more intelligent understanding otf the situation and of the proposais set forth, I arn only too glad to say
t.hat I believe that the merg-er of the Canadian companies as proposed by the British
Empire Steel Corporation will be one of great
advanitage to Canada. There are lgood mergers and there are bad iiergers, but froim a
patriotic standpoint I believe this merger
will bring prosperity in certain lines of industry, will increase the development of our
resources, and -wiII be to the advantage of
Canada and beneficial in every way.
iAt the present moment any manufacturer who uses iron or steel as the base of
his industry knows that we are entirely
dependent on the United -States in that respect, and that at times like the present,
when it is almost impossible for the United
,States to secure a sufficient amount of raw
material to enable the .American manufactu.rers to keep their factories employed,
honourable gentlemen may imagine that it
is far more dtfficult for Canadian industries that have to depend on the United
States for their supply. to recaive equalîr
favourable treatment.
The Dominion Iron and Steel Corporation,
wnich is the principal constituent of the
new merger, because in the new issue oi
securities I believe it is allotted 38 per cent
of the whole, occupies a very peculiar strategic position in regard to world trade; but
in regard to domestie trade it occupies a
csomewhat disadvantageous position. It has
the great advantages for export of coal. oi

the No'va Scotia Steel Company, to mnarket
their products to advantage in the western
section of this country. Freiglit rates br

to ship coal by vessel during certain months
of the year to the port of Montreal. The
-balance of the Canadian requirements of
coal are imported from the United States.
In order that we may develop our natural
resources we must look for an export
mnarket, and that was the one reason, niv
,whole reason, for being favourable to the
coming alliance with the British Empire
Steel Corporation, when I found that it

public on a basis such as that upon which
eecruv Canadian industry should be establishied.
First of ail, I 'vould like to refer to a most
niisleading statement wvhichi xas made in
another place yesterday. Taking- the Hainsard of the House of Comnmons, I notice
that 3fr. J. E. Armstrong made the followinz- remarks:
I rose particularly to cail the attention of thE
Government to the fact that the Uirne has corne.
when we should investigate thesa mergers instead of perniîtting them to say that they have
a capital of $207.000.000, and that they are going to put In enough watered stock or common
stock to make up $500,000,000.

Some Hon. SEN-ATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. 'BELCOURT: We cannot discuss what is going on in the other House.
Hon. Mr. NIOHOLLàS: Well, honourable
gentlemen, I will not quote ifromn Hansard;
but I think iny memory ýis sufficiently
clear to enable me to mention that 'I read
in the newspaper this xnorning- that a certain meinmber in another place had made
the statement that, because the British Etiipire Steel Corporation xvas applying for a
echarter of $500,00,0OO capital, and only
$207,0,000 of that was to be issued for the
purpose of taking over the constituent coinpanies that were entering into the merger,
the balance ivas -al to be îssued as watered
stock. That is a most unfaîr statement.
L1 little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
If we are to assume-no business mnan would
-and if others xvho are flot interested in
business to the same extent are allowed to
form the impression that ail the balance oi
the capital that ia not invested on the unimiediate inception of the corporation is
,going to be distributed as watered s tock,
I do not know what stage we would arrive
at.
The facts are these.
0f $59,0,OOO.
$207.000,000 is to be issued to take care of
the securities of the different enterprises
entering into the new merger. The balance
will remain in the treasury, and, xiii be
issued froni time to time, if called uipon.
for the sake of strengthening the organization by the addition of nexv interests.
It is a very ambitious scheme. As I
have pointed out, heretofore we have beeni
entirely dependent on the United States.
To-dax- there are associated with this nexv
-enterprise a number of leadin.- ianufactutrers; and financiers of Great Britain. They
are zoing into this, not simply because they
expect to mnake .money out of it, or because
they expect to make any great ainount of
moitex-because they have deliberately shut
the door against making money; and that

MAY 5, 1920
lias led me to the belief, honourable g-entieirien, that, after ail, the. guiding spirit is
the tact that they wvant to act in accordance with the lessons they have learned
from the war, when the trade of Great
Britain and the trade of the Empire wae so
dependent upon German activities, and that
they must have for their shipbuilding, for
their machine building, and for every other
clase of industry, iron. and steel to mnake
the Empire independent.
*My proof that they are actuated by a selfsacrificing spirit is this. The industries at
Sydney cannot be developed without the
expenditure of a very large amnount of
capital.
The Dominion Iron and Steel
Company cannot, if it remains as it is, satisfactorily proceed without many millions of
new capital. These British capitaliste have
undertaken to take $25,000,000 of 8 per cent
cumulative preference stock at par, and to
put that $25,000,000 at par into the treasury,
and they do flot get one share of common
stock or any other kind of security. It is
cash, and dlean' cash. They get no bonus
of coinmon stock; there le no water in il;
and therefore 1 think that honourable members of this *House should be informed of
the tact when they come to the discussion
of this matter, at which discussion I regret
to say I shaîl not be presenr.
'Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: Does flot the
honourable gentleman think that 8 per cent
le a pretty stiff rate?*
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: 1 do not believe
that anybody could go into any financial
market in the world at this very moment
and get $25,000,000 on an 8 per cent basic,
when the Governments are paying 6 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: As I understand
my honourable friend, these companies on
this capital are going to issue stock at S
per cent.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS - I think that every
financier will admit that in these days,
considering- the risk, unless the men w~ho
are supplying that money are actuated by
patriotic motives and by a desire to bind
the different parts of the Empire dloser
together, both for patriotic and selfish reasons, it would be quite impossible at this
time to get S25,000,000 for any Canadian
industry at such a rate.
1Ilion. Mr. BELOOURT: Are we to understand that there le corne legislation coming
down in regard to this question later on?
Hon. Mr. NWOHOLLS8: I mentioned on
rising- that the leader of the Opposition

34,c

had placed an inquiry on the Order Paper
for certain information regarding the merger, and by leave of the House, knowing
corne of the tacts which couldenot be procured eleewhere, I desired to gÈve the
House any information which was at my
disposai. If the House desires to hear it,
I shall be pieased 'to continue; if not, I
shaîl be equally pleaséd to take my seat.
,Soins Hon. SENATO)RS: Go on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I aeked a question which was not answered. Is this to
be foilowed by any legislation?
Hon. Mr. NIOHOLLS: I arn quite unaware that any legisiation le to follow.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
From the
tarm. of the inquiry of the leader of the Opposition, I take it that he dos not intend
to speak upon it.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The information is
important anyway.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go on.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: As it le the expressed desire that I continue, I will give
you another fact, and that ie that the directors of the new ýmerger will be entirely
Canadian, or so I amn informed, and that
the British people who are-advancing the
initial $25,000,000 are satiafied to remain
ae an advisory board ln London, and to
leave the entire operation and management
of this great Canadian enterprise to Canadians to develop for the benefit of Canada.
I think it le rather unusual for people
who are putting up a large amount of
money when money ie required, and when
they are in a position to dictate ternis. not
to dictate terme, but to say: " We have
decided not to go into this at aIl; we beliste in Canadian management of Canadiart institutions, and ws look to you to
work with us for the good of Canadaand
for the good of the Empire."
Before I was converted 1 had to be convinced by tacts. The tacts were placed before us by probably one of the leadingfirme of auditors in the world-Warwick,
Mitchell, Peat and Company. They investigated most thoroughly our books, the
books of the Nova Scotia Steel Company,
and those of the steamship cornpany.
Warwick, -Mitchell, Peat and Company
and Price, Waterhouse and Company are,
I think, the two concerne of actuaries
that stand higher than any other when an
organization le going to be put together
and the shareholders or others desîrs to
know the true conditions of affaire. We

the circumstaince of the case may seem
to him ta warrant.
Al.though thie motter concerne aur Canadian resources, I doubt, M tihere are many
honourable gentlemen in thie Chamber who
are aware of t.he fact tiiat within the bounde
of the province of Nova Scotia aind on Belle
Isle, which. is port of Newfoundland, there
fa fifteen per cent of all lhe coal and fron
ore of t.he world. 0f wbat advantage bas
tha4 been ta thi a count~ry in the paet? We
have played with it, but. it aliould m.ake ue
potentfaliy rich. We have played with it
largeiy because of the adverse geographicai
,situation. If these wonderfui naturel resources had been situated say in thle vicinity
of Montreal, or in the province of Ontario,
w1hioh are the manirfacturing centres,
radiating both east and west, Canada would
to-day occupy a different poeition industrially and finoncfaiiy. But those reso1urces
have been lying dormant, honlourabie gentlemen, and thi s is, the first opporfunity
we bave to make a proper development and
use of them. Canada during the war gained
the admiration of the worfd not. only by
tihe g'allontry of the soldiers that it sent to
the front, but aiea on account of the financial strength oi the country, wihich enabled
it to meet the enarmous expenditures connected wîtb the conduet of the wor. Canada
ha& won the admiration of the world for
having shown. tao the returned soldiers
greater consideration than bas been, shown
in any other part of thie world; and we have
not done witlh that, yet. I believe tiiet if
w-e are a.ble to link up Wi-th the Empire and
march in synohrunism with ber, each constituen4 part of tihe Empire aiding in purely
British development, it will be a great t:hing
for this country financially, commercially,
and patriotically.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

The reeson five hundred millions of
capital is asked for is that. it will leave an
ample amount of treasury stock wvhich. can
be issued only in the event of other enterprises-British, indian, Australian. etc.coming in to cernent stili further this ivorldwide British Empire consolidation. And I
would draw the attention of hionourable
gentlemen to the tact t.hat when any such
question arises it muet corne hefore a Canadian board of diTectxers, who will have to
consider it, from the st.andpoint not only
of tfhe Empire interest., but also of the interest it wilI be to Canadiens and. to Canada.
As 1 arn speaking by leave cf t.he House,
I do not wieh ta t.ake up to much time. I
have feit that t.here were certain thing-s that
would intereat the membersHon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Would mny honourable friend. permit me ta asic him a simple
question? I appreciate hie ability, and I
sppreciate bis desire in thie matter; but I
would like to put a question ta him. regarding a point which I could not, understand,
ae to the Dominion Steel Company. Wbat
bae that to do wit.h the Davie Shipbuilding
And
and .Repairing Compancy, Limited?
what has it ta do with the -Maritime Nail
Curmpany?
Hon. Mr. NIOHOLLS: I am very glad
the honourable gentleman has asked that
question. This fa so large a subject thst
it is quite impossible for me t.o give ta the
Houoe ail the information I would like tc
give in a few remnarks made by leave of the
House; but I may state that in my judgment it would- be quite impossible for us
ta carry out the full purpose of the combination unless there were adequate shipping at
the command of the Empire Steel Corporation.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: My honourable
friend has not told us about the Maritime
Nail Company.
Hon. Mr. NIOHOLLS: As to the Maritime
Nail Company, I may tell the honourable
gentleman that the Dominion Iran and
Steel Company during t.he war developed
a very large export trade in nails with
France and Great Britain. Their total nailproducing capaci-ty wae more than taken up
by their expart trade, which also took the
output of t>he nail mnanufacturing company
in St. John. I amn glad ta aay that the
Canadian corporation. wbich neyer had had
any of the expart trade and had neyer been
able ta engage in the world-wide competition in the manu-facture of nails, showed
itself1 during the war to such advantage
that it has been able to retain its trade

MAY 5. 1920
after the wvar, and the manufaci(ture- and
expert of nails wvill beconie a very iimprtant part o! the future production oi the
corporation. That is whiere quantity production lowers prices. If the Canadian
corporation can manufacture only, we -vill
say, one-tenth of wbat a aimilar corporation is manufacturing in the United States,
they cannot manufacture to the saine
advantage; therefore tbey cannot manufacture and seli1 as cheapily. But ïi by
means of this Empire trade they can nianufacture in grose as inuch as the coxnpeting
company in the United States, they xvill
be able to reduce very largely, their cost
of production, so that they can compete
successfully.
There has been a great deal of criticismn
because the figures seem large, but I have
not heard any criticism o! the United States
Steel Corporation, which is investing almoat
as much at Ojibway, on the Detroit river.
Thet la an American corporation. They
have been welcomed wvith open arma and
have been given a great inany advantagces
and concessions, and every dollar that they
may make la the employment of a capital
of from 8100,000,000 to $200,000,000 will go
across in dividende to the United States.
It can at lesst be said that th. money
earned by the British Empire Corporation
will remain within the Empire.
r feel that I amn trespassing toc much
on the indulgence o! the House, honourable
gentlemen, and occupying too much of your
time; but I consider that this is one of the
moast important questions that has ever
been brought to the attention of this country. I honestly believe-otherwise I would
nlot have become connected with it-that it
is going to -do more for the development of
our natural resouTces. of that class. and
our raw materials, than bas ever been
dreamed of before. I believe it is going to
give us connection wîth the great iron and
steel mills o! Great Britain; of Australia,
and of India. I tbink it is most unwise for
gentlemen wbose namnes I have resd in the
newspaper thie niorning to attempt to
frighten away or discourage capital whien
it la willing to corne here without bonus. 1
think it is a most regrettable thing. and I
hope that the samne class of destructive
criticism will not occur in this honourable
House. 0f course, constructive criticism is
helpiul te any enterprise or any industry.
Hon. -Mr. BOSTOCK: I understood the
honourable gentleman to say that the
amount of stock that was to bie iseued 'vas
$207,000,000; but the statenient that appear-

347

ed iii the Ottawa Journal yesterday inornIii- gave it as S250,000,000. Can hie explain
t ile difference between bis statement, and
the Statenient wvbich was attributed to Col.
Morden?
Hon. 'Mr. NICHOLLS: The balance sheet
as submitted to me called for $207,000,000.
Whether there bas been any new enterprise
which bas been given consideration since
then, or whether the $250,000,000 is an error
in the report in the press, I amn unable to
tell the honourable member at this time.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I might point out
to the honourable gentleman that the statement as it appears; in the paper refers to
the assumption of a nominal funded debt
of S43,000,000. That added, te the 3207,000,000
which the honourable gentlemen mentions
would make the total 5250,000,00. Oan the
honourable gentleman give un any information about that S43,000,OOOP
Hon. Mr. NIOHOLLS: I ama eorry I cannot at thia time; but if it is a funded debt
it 'viii of course be taken care of by the
issue of new securities. What I do know
is this, that the valuation by the experts is
S403.0000 as against 3207,000,000 of contemplated capital. I know a.lso that when
.the corporation starts there will b.e over
S77,000,000 of liquid assets, cash and goods.
Hon. Mr. BLCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I amn sorry I cannot congratuiste
my honourable friend on bringing this subject before the House at this time, nor
can I congratulate him upon the remarks
wbich hie has made. I arn very sorry to
have to rise and say this, for my honourable friend and I are very good frienda. and
I distike saying anything which may at
ail appear ungracious. But I am impelled
to do so as a member of the -Senate of Canada, which unfortunately baî thrown at it
daily many bricks that it does not deserve.
I do not know the first thing about the
subject wvhich the honourable gentleman
has discussed, and I will not attempt to
follow him in any of the details as given
to this House. But I rise for the purpose
of placing on record my view that it is
utterly unseexnly for the Senate o! Canada

The honourable member from Toronto (Hon.

there was flot a dissenting voice. At that

Now, having listened-and in my*judgment
witih a great deal of profit-to the reinarks
made by the honourable gentleman fromn

honouraible fniend 'fromn Ottawa w'ill understand that I feel some diffidence in raising

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourabie gentlemen, I was going to sugeet that if vie are

as to permit of t~he question being discussed
when AV cornes up at the regular time Vomorrow. Then rny honouraible friend from
Ottawa will have a chance to say ail hie
desires to say, and the rest of us will likewise 'have a ohance to talk. The thing is
developing now into a debate, and 1 am
very glad of it, for I want to have my part

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCE: With the le ave of

bliat it is improper, for this House to be

OAKLEY DIVORCE CASE.
REPORT 0F

COMMITTEE
BACKC

REFERRED

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
adoption of the 56th report of the -Standing
Committee on Divorce, to whom was teferred the petition of Mary Oakley, tog-ether with the evidence taken before the
said committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentienien, before this report is adopted, I would
like ta cati attention to the fact that the
recommendation of the committee is a departure from what has been the usual practice in this committee. The committee have
recommended that the mother, Mary Oakley. be given the custody of the children.
I believe some recommendatiens of that
kind have been made and passed by this
House; but I do net think that has been
the case since some time in the eighties. I
was not in this House at that time; but I
amn told that the committee, and presumably the House, abandoned the practice o!
dealing with the custody of the children,
and simply granted the divprce or refused
it. For some leason or other it was
thought unwise that this House should deat
with the question of the custody of the
children, inasmuch as ail the provinces
have machinery of their own for dealing
with that question.
I was not preserrt when the committee
adopted this report, and there may be some
special reason for it. No doubt the Chairman will explain to the House why the
committee departed from the usual practice.
I amn not complainiiig; I onty want to put
the HRouse au fait.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I had the
honour of presliding at the meeting of the
Divorce Comrnittee when this report 'vas
recoinmended. This p~hase of the question
was deferred at that time at my request,
and I consulted the au'tborities, as to
whether or not we shoutd make the recoinn.endation. I may May frankly that I was
aut strongly in favour oï mYaking this tecoinendation; but rightly or wrongly, I
think the committee have the authority to
exercise this po'wer. Apparently the last
case in which the custody of the children
was granted was in 1905, that o! Isaac
Pithiado, the wellkknown lawyer of Winnipeg.
In the case tbat is no'w before the House.
independent evidence was submitted ta the
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

comm:nttee as ta the financiat standing- of
Evidence wvas given flot
the petitioner.
only by the mother, but by the family
solicitor, which satisfied the comnmittee that
she was abundantty able to look aiter and
prcperly maintain the ch'Ildren. I may &ay
that te the committee she seemed to be ai
person eminentty ffittted te have the custody
ni the children. I cannot give any reason
for the recommendation other than that the
hu.,band had abandoned the children.
They were le! t in the custody of the mother,
and it was evident te the cornmittee that
she was the proper person to have the
charge of them, and beyond any shadow
af doubt had the rneans 'to maintain them.
These are the main 'ressonts for rnaking the
recommendation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like te ask
the honourable gentleman if there was any
suspicion tihat any move would b. made te
take the chlldren out o! the custody of the
mother.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY- I understand
that the mother, speaking through ber attorneir, waw afraid that such an effort
might be made, although the father, the
respondezit was in New York.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: For certain reasens
some of us do net interfere in divorce -petitions; 'but la it, not very unusual Mor the
committee te say 'who shal -have the custody
o! the children? It is bad enough 'to have
divorce; but yeu are adjudging civil rights.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
been a immber of the Divorce Comrnittee
for probabty a longer period than any o!
the present mernbers of the co'mmittee, and
I rnight say that isince becoming a mem-ber
o! that corfnittee this subj-eat has irequentty 'been *brought 'te our attention,
numerous applications -having -been made
by petitioners to be given the custody of
the chitdren. We have persistently refused sudi applications, wi'thin my o-wn
knowledge, sirice 1890, with the. exception
of the 'Pitblado case in 1905. My recoltection o! the circumetances of that case is
that there was a possibility o! the children
being suddenly removed to the United
States, where the father would flot be in a
position te assert his. ailthority over thein
or ta dexnand their custedy. However, that
was a very exceptionat case, and there was
a grave doubt in the minds af the committee
as to w'hether they shoutd exercise such
authority.
Furtjhermore, it bas been urged, and I
think with very considerabte weight, that
the committee would be exceedinga its

MNAY 5, 19-20

authority, and would be usurping 'what in
my judgment is clearly the rig1ht of the
provinces under -property and civil rights.
I think the courts are in a very much
better position to determine thie question
than a committee of Parliament. If we
start dealing with the question of the
custody of the children, we will next have
to deal wilth the question of alimony; and
in that way we ishaîl Ïbe, according to my
judgment, going entirely outside of the
atrthority by which 'we act. I think iL
would. be inuch better to confine the exercise of aur authority to, 'the. single question
of divorce, leaving the question of the
custody of the children and the quest.ion of
alîmony to the courts o'f the reepeotive provinces in which the parties may live.
I arn unaware who je the #promater of this
Bill, -but I think there je every probability
of it being jeopardized in its passage tiirough
PeSrliament during the present session if this
clause is lef t in. the Bill. I think iL would.
be in the interet of the petitioner that the
words should be stricken out:
and granting her the eustody of the children. the Issue at said marriage. and for such
further sud other relief as to the Senate may
seern meet.

I subînit this with ahl duq deference, and
more particularly as an attempt le being
rnade-which I hope will eucoeed-to hand
thie entire subjeco yer to the juriediction of
the courts, iL would be unwiefor us to
depart from the *very well established pracLice which ha .prevailed in -the Senate for
practically a generation.
Honb. ïMr. WILLJOUGHBY: I have no objection to the clause being stricken out of
the Bill, as suggested by the honourable
leader of the Houe, if the. other members
of the committee are agreeable to that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: You might
postpone the consideration of the Bill until
to-moierow.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I would move to
strike out these words.
I will
Hon. iSir JAUMES LÉOUGHEED:
move that the report be referred back to the
committee -for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to.
THE HALIFAX GARRISON.
INQTIIRY AND DISCT3SSIOlf.

Tii. Senate reeumed frein April 30 Lbe discussion of the inquiry af Hon. .Mr. Crosby:
That h, will cail the attention of the Senate
ta matters Pertainlng ta the garrison at Hallfax. and the agreement wlth the Imperlal au-

351

thorities. and alzo regarding the defence. both
military and naval, and the dockyard and ail
agreements and understandings ln that connection; and inquire whether it is the intention of
the Government ta restore the regiment ta Halifax.

Hon. L. G. POWER: The honourable gentleman who made this inquiry (Hon. Mr.
Croby) divided it into two sections, one
dealing with the military aspect of the matter. and the other with the naval aspect.
These two aspects of the question are really
distinct and indeipendent.
With respect to the garrison. which is perhaps the more urgent just now, honourable
gentlemen muet bear in mind'that Halifax
ie a strategic point, and flot simply a point
on the map. It is a port where coal and food
and shipa and military stores and dockyards are ail available; it is not like an ordinary town. Halifax has been the headquartees in Americs, ol the British Navy
ever since about 1750, and it has been. a garrison town for over 160 years. The expedition which finally captured Louisburg-and
since which Louisburg has been *a British
possession-was fitted out and sailed from
Halifax in the year 1758; and from that time
forward -Halifax bas been both a naval and
a military station. That is a cii'cumstance
which, I think should count for a littie.
Shortly siter that, the expedition to Quebec,
durig which General Wolfe loat hie life,
wa s tarted from -Halifax. Then during the
Revolutionary -War, beginning in 1776, Halifax was again the principal military and
naval station of the British arma. During
the. French war which took place in the
period between the close of that Revalutionary war and the war of 1812, 'Halifax
continued to be a garrison town, and the
military and naval headquarters of Britain
in North America. Then of course in the
war with the United States in 1812, Halifax
waa again the headquarters of the British
înilitary as well as naval lorces. In the samne
way. during the Crimnean war, although
England was rather short of troops, the garrîson was not withdrawn from Halifax. Instead of two battalions there was only one,
which was a strong battalion stationed in
Halifax.
In the recent war, which is now definitely
over, Halifax occupied a very important
position as a military and naval station, as
every one knows. There was a time when
it was thaught that Halifax was liable to
battacked by German submarines and it
was efflciently garrisoned.
It je now proposed to withdraw the infantry from Halifax altogether, and apparently to leave the military defence of

that city in the hands of a few artillery men.
1 think ýsaiie very substantial reson should
be shown for such a change as that, such
a departure froin the policy of England
tovard Canada vhicli bas continued down
ta the present time; but so far as I ani
aware na substantial reason bas been given.
0f caurse, honourable gentlemen have
learned that nowadays cauntries going to
war do «not begin and niave forward gently,
as they did a hundred years ago or mare;
perhaps before war is declared the attacking forces are on foot. If Halifax. which la
so important as a statian for military and
naval purposes, were left defenceless, and
a war should break out unexpectedly, the
place might be carried by a coup de main,
and it would be impossible for Canada ta
recover it. I think that is a matter which
deseirves a good deal of consideration.
While Monýtreal has the largest population
af any city in Canada, it is nat in any
sense a strategie point for a military or
naval station, and is not calculated ta be
that. Quebec is such, ta a certain extent,
but Montreal is flot. We should examine
the record and should see what England did.
I remember when there were Britich garrisons in Toronto, Montreal. and Quebec as
well as in St. John and Halif ax; but as the
field for imperial action érew larger the
troops were gradually withdrawn, first fromn
Toronto and then f romn Montreal, Quebec
and St. John; but England neyer withdrew
her troops fron-i Halifax. Two regimients
were retained there up ta 1905, when Canada
took over the military defence af the place.
Bearing in mind this little history, let
us loo'k at the agareement ta which. My
colleague (Hon. 'Mr. Crosby) hias called
attention. The transfer of the War Department properties wvas made in 1906 on the
followinga among other conditions. namnely:

and maintain the property at the exipense of
the Dominion Government penclîng its disposai.

The M.Nilîtia Council here mentioned is
the Canadian Council, and the Army Council is the Iniperial authority.
Sa, honourable gentlemen, Iooking at the
history of the case, and at the language
used in this transier, I think it is perfectly
clear tha't At was flot the intention of the
parties ta that negotiation that the garrison should be withdrawn from Halifax, an
important strategic point which should nat
be neglecrted. As the honourable gentleman
who spore, befo.re me (Hon. -Mr. Crosby)
very properly said, the Dominion Parlianment has now provided for a eosisiderable
increase in the regular force, soinetimes
called the permanent force; and when that
force is increased there will be no difflculty
whatever in assigning a regiment to Montreal, if that is thoughit desirable, leaving in
Halifax the regiment which hais been stationed there until now. With respect to this
military matter, I feel that rwhat is now proposed-to abandon the garrisoninig of Hallfax except as regarde a few artillerymen,
and ta transfer the garrison to Montrealis really, substantially, a breach of faith
with the Imperial Government.
Another point made by the honourable
gentleman 'who brought this niatter before
the House deserves to be made again: That
in Halifax we have alw~ays accommodated
two regiments. Ail the buildings are there.
Although the Wellington barracks suffered
somnewhat through the explosion, I un*rderstand that the necessary repaira have been

point, because building costs very much

the fact that our capacity to bear that burden is almost questionable, we should not
go in for spending money on a navy unless it is shown 'to be -abhaolutely necessary. Honourable gentlemen know that a
very sirnaîl navy 'will cost a very large sum
of rnoney, -and, unless it can be shown that
a navy is an wbsolute- necessity, I think
we should not spend rnoney upon it. 1 fail
to see 'any necessity for a Canadian navy at
the present tirne. It is easy to understand
that before the outbreak of war in 1914
there was sornething to be said in favour
o-f it. At that tirne, and for sorne Lime previously, Germany had been threatening the
maritime suprernacy of Great Britain,' and
the Motherland had ta pull herself together,
ta call in her ships from the variaus outlying stations, and bring thein to the North
Sea, and Canada was, in a w-ay, only doing
ber duty in contributing soene other ships
ta replace those that had been <withdrawn.
But 'what is the situation to-day? The German navy which had threatened Britain's
supremacy is gone, and the bulk of it is at
the bottom cd the water at Scapa Flow,
while the chief parlt of the remainder is in
the hands of the Allied Powers. I cannot
see, therefore, what we need a navy for.
With respect to this question, and also
others, I trust I amn a loyal subjeet. I
hope I arn as loyal as the average Englishman, -but 1 look et this question from the
point of view of Canada -in the.first place.
While I arn loyal to the Crown, I arn loyal
ta Canada also; and just as an Englishman
thinké of the interests -of England first, and
those of the colonies afterwards, so I think
o! the înterests o! Canada firat, and of thoaie
o! -Great Britain afterwards. I amn afraid
there is a tendency amongst a certain class
of our population in Canada to think flrst
of England's wishes or fancies, and secondly
of the
interests of Canada.
No one accuses Australia or New Zealand
of any lack o! proper loyal sentiment,
and Lord Jellicoe went ta Australia and ta
New Zealand and laid bis proposaîs befare

cornes and lays proqposale, as I understand,
before the Government of Canada. I think
that we are in a much better position to
reject tbem than either Australia or New

*Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Australia and New

Hon. Mr. POWER: Australia has hiad a
navy for.several years. Australia needs a
S-23

navy. Australia is an island and the
people are exposed, or think they are exposed, to attacks from Japan. The position is different frorn that o! Canada.
Then there is this to 'be borne in niind,
that, no matter whether we try ta set up
a navy or not, as long as England owns s0
rnany West India islands anmd Guiana, and
as long as t!he Panama canal is a waterway,
England must and will keep shîps in North
American waters, anmd there is no necessity
that I can see for Canada keeping ships
here tco. England will continue ta have a
very large navy, end that- navy -will naturally be sipread aver the face of the waters
in aIl direction%. Sa any naval business
that may be necessary can be transacted
by the British ships.
The honourable gentleman who brought
tiiis inatter before the House spoke of Bermuda as being now the summer station o!
the British West Indian-North American
squadron. I think the honourable gentleman was a little in error. No doubt Bermuda is mot as warm as Jarnaica or any of
the other West India islands, but the climsite o! Bermuda is a very enervating one
and iL would mot serve, as Canada in the
past served, as a summer station for the
bulk of the British shipa. They came ta
Halifax. Then they carne up frorn Halifax
to Quebec, and some o! the arnaller ships
ta Momtresil. The navy will continue ta
meed a summer station, anmd Halifax bas
always been the sumîmer head-quarters in
North America.
I do flot think, honourable gentlemen,
that I have anything further to say on
this subject except that we should be loyal
ta Canada first anmd foremoat, then loyal
to Great Britain, and that ivith respect to
this naval proposal we sibould not go into
iL until a Canadian navy is shown to be
sibsolutely necesssry; and up ta the present
time iL does not appear to be necessary and
no one bas undertaken ta show that it is.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I tihink iL is quite natural for the
honourable member from .Halifax or any one
!rom the lower provinces to make objection if the garrison is Lo be removed from
Halifax to Montreal. However, there are
mamy of us who are not so much interested in that aspect of the question. Speaking for myself, I arn more interested in the
extra expenditure that will be required if
iL is true thaL the transfer is to be made.
I understand from the discussion that bas
taken place so far that HRalifax bas all the

exercîse to the regiment. Moreover, there
is a close connection between the army and
the navy, and the army people can understand what naval evolutions are taking
place and know something o! the routine
of the navy. Halifax ha§ aiso several ontlying islands. One that I have particularly in mnd is McNab's Island, a large island ont near the sea. Upon that there
are tenta for the soldiers and they con go
there in the summer time. It is a very
healthf ni resort and provides ample space
for ail their military evolutions. Without
.any exception Halifax is tbe ideal place
for a regirnent. There is hospital accommodation and there is ample provision
for sanitary arrangements being made if
the town should become unhealthy or if
an epidemic should break out in the barracks.
With regard to the expense, I do not
think ihat suitable accommodation, or accommodation equal to that already available in Halifax, could be procured in Montreal for an expenditure of less than S10,000,000; and as the Halifax site, with al
these advantages and facilities that I have
endeavoured brieby to describe, with aIl its
historical elements and its connection
with the naval efforts, is far superior to
any other site that I know 'of in Canada,
it would be folly for the Government-I do
not know that the Government would be
singular in this act of folly, but I should
say it would be a crownipg act of folly
for the Government at a great expense
to take away the reg-iment from the place
to which it bas been accustomed, %vhich
is adequately fltted for it, and 'which can
be improved to an infinite extent.
Hon. Mr. CA6GRAIN.: Has it not been
the universal custom not ta leave a regaiment more than a certain number of years
in any one town?
Hon. Mr. *ROCHE:- It was the custom
of the British Government to mnure the
soldiers ta different climates. The soldiers were sent from one place to another.
The British Government sent them out to
the West Indies, and when they were
diseased in the West Indies they were
brought to Halifax to recover. It would
be the same witb Montreal; after the soldiers went there and becan.e diseased,
they would be brougbt back ta Halifax.
Hon. RAOUL DANiDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I have seen no statement
from the Government explaîning its action
in regard ta moving the garrison frorn Halifax to Montreal. I amn not even sure that

the Governmient in tends to renove to Montreal the regiment uLow siationed in Halifax.
But 1 know this mnuch. that it has apparently been decided that a regiment shall be
st.ationed in Monireal. I know that, because the Generai Officer Çommanding the
division has applied to the City council of
Montreal for a certain number of acres in
a park in the east. or northeast end of
Montreal, stating that accommodation
would be needed fomr 1,000 men, and at-the
same time asking for the use of a building
which is now on the grounds and w*hich
would house a certain number of soldiers.
It was explained that a number of bouses
would have to be buit for married soldiers.
The figure of $2,000,000 or $3,000,000 was
mentioned as t.he capital expenditure. That
is an officiai statement wvhich I think we
shall find will not be controverted. As I
have stated, I do not know what actuated
the Government to make this -Change. I
surmise that up to 1914-18, the danger bea foreign one, it was considered desirable
to bave a regiment stationed in Halifax,
but that since 1918, the dangers being possibly internai or domestic, owing to the
changed conditions and the unrest which
prevails in large centres of population, the
G3overnment bas feit the need of maintaining soldiers in places like Montreal rather
than in a quiet., sedate place like Halifax.
If these are the reasons which. have actuated the Government, there may be good
ground for their action.
But should not the Government apply its
polîcy in sucb a way as to save every dollar
it can? If the Government decides that it
is better and safer policy to have a garrison
of 1,000 men near a large centre which in
the near future may have a population of
1.000,000 with a foreign element of 15 or
20 per cent, rather than to have the garrison located a t.housand miles away, I have
nothing to say ag-ainst. that decision; but I
would point out to the Government that in
the carrying out of such a policy it couid
save millions of dollars by using the barracks at St. Johns, on the Richelieu river,
wbich were built in 1844, I think, by the
Royal Engineers, and have since heen enIarged. 'Durin-g the war more than a thousand men were housed and received their
t.raining there before being moved eastward.
There are splendid grounds around those
barracks, and it seems to me that if the Government wvants ta have a thousand men
within striking distance of Montreal, the
purpose in view couid be served by having
thema at a distance of 45 minutes by rail,

I say likewise that it is no time for

have a chance to breathe a little. Canada
bas increased lier debt by two billions, and
we do not yet know where the money will

Government through the Dominion Government. There are the fortifications, there is
MecNab's island, which was referred to by
the honourable member <rom Halifax (Hon.

to the forts. In one of these forts, calied

In addition to the properties I have already mentioned, there is the Wellingtoni

My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has referred to the necessity of having a regiment at Montreal. I do flot object

police in Ottawa, something very dastardly
must be expected.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is a big
population.
Hon. LMr. CROSBY: Yes, there will be a
big population if you have 2,000 soldiers here
and another 1,000 or 2,000 in Montreal. However, I amrn ot complaining of that. What I
say ic, that under the agreement we are
hound to notify the Imperial authorities before withdrawing that regiment from Halif ax. WVhen the Dominion Government took
over the troops at Halifax there was not
only the Royal Canadian regiment, which
numnbered between 1,000 and 1,200 men, but
we had one or two companies of Royal Engineers. 1 arn inforrned that at Point Pleasaxa you can «go underground, out o! sight
o! everybody, and by mieans of some sort of
contrivance you can tell the exact location
of a ship coming towards the harbour, and
that by the operation of some device with
which 1 am n ot famniliar, by mierely'touching a button, you can blow her to pieces. if
that is the case, is it not wvise to keep the
defences that did flot cost us a cent, in proper conditionf Is it not right to keep a
regimient there? If we decide that it is flot,
I say that at all events we should inforin the
Iinperial authorities that we have abandoned Halifax as a garrison city o! the
Dominion o! Canada and of the Empire, and
should hand the property back and let them
say whether or flot they will put a regiment
there. The answer which we have heard is
xio answer to the agreement 'which I cited.
The diseussion concluded.

AND

RE-

On motion of Hon. Sir Jaines Lou£!Iîeed.
the Senate went into Coînmittee on Bill
38, an Act ta amend the Truzt Companies
Act, 1914. Hon. Mr. MeMeans in the chair.
Subject. 1-definition:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG.HEED: As 1 exMlained yesterday, this Bill inerely makes
provision for an annual inspection o! al
trust companies somewhat similar ta the
inspection of insurance companies by the
Superintendent of iInsurance.
Section 1 w-as a,"reed to.
On section 2-examination and report on
condition of companies:
Hon. Mr. B')STOCK: I would like to ask
the leader of thbe Government %vhetherunder
the proposed arrangement the superintendent will have authority to say when a coinpany may cçmmence business. I understand thart in the past certain irregularities
have necurred in regard to trust companies
-that some of themn proceeded.to do business when thry had nat complied with the
Act, and that afterwards it a'as tound that
ail *the transactions o! the company were
illegal. I think that is a very serious matter. Il there is no provision in the Act, 1
think some arrangement should be made
whereby the superintendent would have the
right ta refuse to allow a company to proceed to do business until it was shown that
the conditions under which the charter
was granted had been complied with.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
think there -can 'be the âlightest doubt that
a trust company cannot praceed to do busziness, any more than coulci an insurance
campany, without securing the authority of
the Finance Department. The pawers of
the company are defined either by the letters patent which it may receive, or hy the
special Act which it rnay obtain froni Parliament. Ail those campanies are undet
the contrai of the Insurance Branch of the
Finance Depart.ment.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The other day I received a letter painting out that in the
winding up o! a trust company in British
Columbia it was discovered that the coinpany had proceeded ta do business befare
properly c&mpiying- with the Act, in the
matter of putting up the necessary cash.
In the interests od the public it is very uniHon. bir. CROSBY.

portant that such a seriaiis hreach af the
law should be prevented in- future.
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 0f course,
a canîpany may do business surreptitiously,
but in the Trust Companies Act as it is taday no trust company can obtain letters
patent; they must came under the provisions o! -that Act, which la the authority.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: What -would be the
scope of an inquiry by the Finance Department into a trust company? Could the inspector, or an officiai designated for that
purpose, inquire into t.he value o! mortagces or other securities? 0f course, the
usual examination is by document-there
are so many thousands o! dollars here and
so many there; but now that there may be
a transition in the values, 'would the investization by the Finance Department go
further in the case of trust companies?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, precisely as they would examine into the securities o! an insurance campany. In further answer to my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Bostock), who asked as to thse authority
under which a trust comrpany must eect, I
would refer hlm to section 13 of the Trust
Companies Act, which mrakes provision
that a company shall not commence business or exercise any of the po-wers conferred under section 62 of that Act until
it, has obtained from the Minister of Finance a certificate permitting it ta do sa,
and no application for sucis a certificate can
be made, and no certificate issued, until
satis!actory evidence has been submitted ta
thse minister on affidavit of the cornpany's
officers. Thse particulars o! thse evidence
that must be submitted are given in the
Act.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: The necessitsv
for sucis inspection is so apparent that 1
wauld suggest ta thse honourable leader of
the Government that in the annual conferences between the Federal G-avernment and
the provinces this matter should be taken
up, in order ta incite tise provinces
ta establish uniform modes of inspection of
their own provincial trust companies, and
thus afford coanplete security ta the public.
Although the provinces beilieve that they
have thse exclusive right of legislating in
tis niatter, they would surely be agreeable
ta sucis uniformity -as ta give sucis protection as this inspection woud ensure ta those
w-ha deal with federal companies.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 quite
agree xvith what my honourable friend has;

said; but the 1provinces*seeii te be reluetant
in regard to ail companies of thiis. kind,
te enter into any uniformn arrangement between themselves and the Faderai Governmient. If I had my way I should have soe
uniformi systemn by which ail companies
would be incorporated in Canada, in the
different provinces, under one General Act.
To-day we have the anomaly of each province Iegislating for itself, and incorporating companies which do business ahl
through Canada, so that the public have to
familiarize theoeselves with ail the coinpany law of the different provinces. That
remark applies to boan companies and
trust companies. It is only by a process
of evolution that we can bring about even
the advanced legisiation contained in this
Bill, because up to the present time it has
been most difficuit to get public opinion
to consent to a proper inspection of loan
and trust companies.

RIB-

On 'motion o! Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate wen't ir!to committee on Bill
54, an Act teo confirmn the agreement dated
the Bth day of March, 1920, between Hie
Majesty the Ring and the Grand Trunk
Railway Company of Canada for the acquisition by 'Hie Majesty of the capital stock
of the aaid Grand Trunk Railfway Comipany,
except the foyur per cent guaranteed stock.
Hon. 'Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1-alterations in schedule to
agreement:
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, 1 understand that tihis clause ie for
the purpose of correcting an error in the
agreement. I «would like to ask the leader
of the Government, in regard to the Vermont and Province Line Railroad Companiy, whether 'when the Grand Trunk Bill
was before this House lasV session there
was a considerable liability against the
road which was likely to fah upon the
Grand Trunk Railway -Comnpany or upon the
Government in connection with »ome lawsuit 'by reason o! *that company not having
cwried out the provisions çf the charter
that if, holdis in the United States. This
is a matter of importance to the people of
Canada. *Wé do not know very much
about'this question; we are falling heir to
At through aesuming to run roads in another country. That raises the important
question o! the liabilities and difficulties
tihat -we are taking upon ourselves by the
action of the Government with regard to
this agreement.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
tell my 'honourable friend wvhether there is
any 'litigation .pending. It, is isufficient, it
eseems to me, that we are this much ahead,
that -we are getting a railway that we did
noV expect to get. While it is o! standard
gauge, the saine gauge as the Grand Trunk
railway syetem, it la not quite so long. It
'is about three miles in length.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Does it run?
Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: As téhe
Grand Trunk contirols 100 per cent of the
stock, it seema to me that 'we mig-ht as wel
take it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: With all its liabiliies?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman tell us mliat the liabilities
are?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: On a
road only three miles in length tbey 'would
noV be very great.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: On a road iwith a
terminal they might. Three mile of the
Grand Trunk going into the city of Montreal
is valued -at $ 10,000,000.
H<m. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, we
are getting a very valuable property 'there.
Hon. Mr. 1 OASGRAIN- What is the value
of it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I take
my honouTable friend's stateinent as to
that.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What le the change
from the position of last year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Vermont anýd Province Line Railroad Company 'was omitted f rom the agreemient of
last year, and we are now indluding it ini
the agreement. It is a .property that is
transferred by the Grand Trunk to the
Government.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Wby was it omitted
before?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
done by mistake. The Grand Trunk holds
100 per cent of the stock. Then there is
the Pembroke Southern Railway Company
which appeared as a leased road. That is
nhe road is controlled by the
a misetake.
Grand Trunk holding a majority of the
stock, and it is to correct that mistake
that that road is being included in this Bill.
.1s 1 pointed out, there was als-o a slight
omission which could ecarcely be eaid to
be material, in regard to some of the notices
served upon the stockhol.ders. Thiere were
some stockholders in Canada, eight of whom
lhad authorized notice Vo be Qerved on their
agents in London. 'Two had not, and they
did flot receive the regular notice.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: How long is this

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This will

Goverument. Thte finding- of the -arbitrators canuot exceed the maximum amount
fixed by statute.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. *FOWLER: It strikes -me as
being a little careless, to say the Ieast, to
leave out a whole railroad, even though it
were onily 3 miles long, and to not know
whether it is owned or leseed. *How long
is the Pembroke iSoutheru Railway?
About
Hou. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
25 miles.
Hon. Mr. FIOWLER: It looks, because
they were so anxious to get rid of it and te
unload it on the Government, as if it dîd
not amoun-t to much.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I wotild like to ask
the leader of the Government if these two
roads are miortgaged; that is if there are
outatanding bonds on these roads.?
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUGHEEP: Even
though there were bonds on the&e roads,
that would not necessarily make the Government liable for payment on the bonds.'
If the roads were encumbered for more
than their value, the Government wouid
readily let them go; but if they are not encumbered for their full value, or not at ail,
it is manifestly to the advantage of the
Government to have them. Had the facts
as they appear before us to-day appeared
on the f.atce of the agreement last ses&sion,
1 arn sure that it would not have altered
the decision of Parliament in any way.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 think I said last
year that yen might abandon a road like
that. But there ie almost a multitude of
these smali roads iying in the United
States, and if you undertake to throîw out
what does not pay and to hold what does
pay, you may find that that will affeot the
treatment you will receive ail along the
line of the Grand Trunk in the United
States. While it is legaliy possible to take
that position, I do nlot knocw that it is a
practicai policy. You may have to make
good these bonds.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would like to
direct attention to parag-raph 10 of the
agreement, regarding undisclosed liabilîties.
I assume that the resuit of ithis is that the
Governiment is boumd to pay these liabilities when disclosed, and that the only
remedy provided is that in paragraph 10.
Construing that, it seems to put upon
the Government the obligation of psying ahl the now undisclosedl liabilities,
whatever the amount. over and above
per

of '$5,000,000
the lîmit
annum. They are bound to pay ail the liabilities of these corupanies whatever theyý
amourit to, and the oniy remedy is to ask
the arbitrators to take that into account,
and to reduce the award if they ffeel so disposed. But there is primarily a liabiity
on the part of the Government to pay ail
the liabilities, now disclosed or stili undisclosed.

On section 2-agreement as corrected
ratified:
Hon. J. P. B. GASGRAIN: 1 do flot know
whether this agreement would have been
carried by the shareholde*s if there had
been added to the Bill a certain provision
which gave rise to, conisiderable, debate in
another place. We ali remnember that in
1910 there vwas a strike on the -Grand Trunk
which tied up the system from Chicago to
Pootland. The Minister of Labour at that
time, the pTesent leader of the Opposition,
and the late Sir Frederick Borden acted
as mediators between the men and the
Grand Trunk Company, and they succeeded
in havin_- the men taken back. No mention
at ail was made at that tîme of pensions.
The men - were reinstated, with their
seniority rights. 1 amn informed tihat some
of tho-se men had been in the employ of
the company and participatîng in the pen8ion fund for over thiirty years, and they
f ully understood that in being reinstated
they were not losing any of the advantages
they had enjoyed; that 'they were being

asked the Minister of Labour to be present.
because I rwould like f0 knorw his opinion
about thiý. There are thiree alternatives,
honourable gentlemen: first, that the pensions sfhall be forfeited; secondly, that we
ishall insert in this Bill-and this La the
very last chance we have for doing it-a
clause whereby the companry shall be called
upon to carry out the understanding then
reached and to pay those pensions; thirdly,
that the Government, that is, the taxpayers,
mill ipay tihose pensions. These are the
three alternatives regarding which I would
ask the Minister o! Labour to give us his
opinion in a little while.
The Minister of Justice in another place
declared, as we read in ail the newspapers,
thaf the men may not have a legal righit
to those pensions. But there is a moeral
righlt, and it would be infinitely better for
the country f0 pay those pensions than for
this Parliamrent to usurp the functdons of
the courts of justice of the land and de'clare,
without hearing the parties, that the
Grand Trunk shareholders should be
nulcfed for the amount of the pensions.
The amount is flot disclosed. No one hias
been able f0 'teli w'hat it is, although there
,lbas been in another place a debate *which
lasted nearly t-wo days. However, we are
face f0 face with this situation, that a
grave injustice has been done. The late

came across to Canada froni the adjoining Repubiic, and somefimes prefty sharp
things are done te the eoufh oYfthe 45th
parallel. He neyer mentioned this pension
business, but aft-erwards, a long time afterrwards, he, declared that hie could flot re-instate those men in tiheir pension righfs
because the Provident Fund of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company did not allow for
the paying of those pensions, as there was
not continuity of service. Now, if the Grand
Trunk had been willing to do justice to
those menHon. Mr. FOWLER: Which men?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The emplovees,
the strikers. If the Grand Trunk had been
wihling to do justice to them, if could
easily have been arranged and the necessary power could have been obtained from
Parliament. Se that coritention doff not
hold good at ail. However, I may say that
the then Goverrnment. refused. to have anything further to do with the Grand Trunk
Company until they gave justice by impiementing their word and carrying out the
understanding. These are the facts that
are before us.
It was rnost clearly demonstrated, and
if has not been denied in any of the discussion that bas taken place, that there had
been no talk of these pensions at ail. The
men were put back in their places with al
their rights, whatever they might be. However, the Minister of Justice, as you can
see by the papers, did a great deal ol special
pleading; but hie would flot take one side
or the other, and hie said it would be in-

judicious for Parliament to saddle the
shareholders with this; and, 1 may say, the
Minister of the Interior said about the saine
thing. Now, we know that we in this country are in a terrible mess with this rail\vay
business; the blame belongs where if belongs.

Mr. CASGR.AIN:

Twenty years ago we had some 16,000 miles

Then we had one mile of railway for every
284 persons in the country. That wvas a
difference cf only 16 pe.rsons per mile, because during those ten years the popula-

that under the former administration there

years ago or thereabouts there was a change.
What happenedP The immigration stopped.
Do you think that railway building stopped?
We went on building railroads even more
than before, and, according to the DraytonAcworth report, we were hoaded down with
40,000 miles of road, enough to go a.round
the earth at the equator one and a hall
times. Therefore that was the time when
we ahould have stopped raihroad building.
But that waa the very time we went on
building more than ever before, and at the
time the DraytonAcworth report was submitted, about five years ago, there were onhy
187 persons in the country for every mile
o! railway.
,Hon. Mr. LYNCIH-STAUNTON: Wouhd
the honourable gentleman tehl us the exact
mileage that was built after 1911?
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: After 1911? I have
just samd about 15,000 miles.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: -Where

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman give me time to explain
where it was? I ahail be very glad to do

The honourable gentleman is very facetious
in asking me that questdon. He la supposed

Honi. Sir J.AMEIS LOUGH.'EED: I think
the honourable niember for Hamilton
should have put the question in a different
way. He shouhd have asked: who made
the contracta for the building of the roada
that were built after 1911?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 am very glad to
answer that too. The Canadian Northern
went at that time as far as Edmonton. Now,
what broke the back of the Canadian
Northern was to build from Edmonton to
Vancouver acroas the Rocky mountaina. I
will aak, who subsidized that road? Who
contributed anything to it, and what did

miles, from Edmonton to Lucerne, at the top
of the Rocky mountain, the two roads, two
beautiful roads, ran just parallel-and nobody in the country! And I may just tell you
this, honourable gentlemen, it does nlot matter if we take a littie 'time on this thing.
Remember that every day we post.pone talcing over that Grand Trunk railway we are
saving the country at least $80,000; that is
$3,000 an hour. So there is no hurry in
taking it over. We have plenty of tiime to
discuas it.
Hoii. Mr. CROSBY: I would ask the hion.
gentleman to tell us how we are saving
$80,000 a day by delaying the taking over
of the Grand Trunk.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 arn very glad
that question bas been put, because that
gives me a chance to explain that also, and
this is the very simple explanation. The
Grand Trunk railway, administered like a
comie opera, as government railways have
been administered, will have a big delicit.
I predicted the other deficits, and I have
been on the conservative aide every time.
The Grand Trunk railway, under Government control, will have a deficit -of $30,000,000 a year, with present rates.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Grand Trunk
properP
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Grand Trunil
proper will have a deficit. I stake nriy reputation on this: I thoroughly helieve the
Grand Trunk in twel1ve montha of Government ownership will have a delicit of at

iiionths hence, we shall see whether I amn
right or not.

the only railway, sa far as 1 knaw, that bas
such a fund. That fund bas been in existence since the eighties, and in 1907 they
were allowed ta add ta it out of the earnings
of the road.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The Government
railway bas a fund exactly the sae, and
the case of the men on the branch lines
wauld be even stronger, because they were
neyer strikers,* but always loyal servants.
Han. 'Mr. CASGRAIN-,: Are they losing

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 understand they
are Iasing their pensions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Clause 17 of the
agreement states:
In no case shall any acquired rights or vested
interests In either the pension systemn or the

Insurance and Provident Society be affected.
Sa they get their pension; Ai-l, only those
unfortunate strikers of 1910 wha lose their
pension.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But that does flot
apply ta thase men on branch roads which
were taken over by the National system?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn only speakabout July, 1910, when the agreement was
entered into, whieh was witnessed by two
ministers af the Crown, by which the men
were ta be reinstated with their seniority
rights; and after they wvere reinstated they
were denied their right ta the pensions,
and ta this day they7 have not got them.
The Government of that day refused ta
bave anything further ta do with the Grand
Trunk Railway Company until they gave
satisfaction or justice to those people in
accordance with the agreement entered inta. That is ail 1 arn saying.

Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY:
were there?

these three alternatives is ta be followed

'MAY 6, 192036
whether he is going ta amend this Bill in
such a way that those men will get their
pensions, or whether the country is goingé
ta be taxed for them? T1he honourable gentleman is a prominent member of the Labour party, and that party is becaming
very pawertul in the country at presentand 1 will add that if there were no strikes
tor five years a great many of the leaders
of the Labour party and walking delegates
would be out of employment, and they
would have ta go and work like everybody
else. One of the arguments made in anaiher place against paying these pensions
was that the labour leaders had said:
-"Oh, the mnen don't care for the pension."
0f course, labour agitatars do not like a
system af pensions, hecause the hope of
receiving a pension for continuous employment has prevented many men froru going
on strike, and they are ahl the happier for
it. The labour agitators do noV like anything that prevents a strike. I do not say
tbis because I am against labour, for I
am juat as gaod a triend of labour as any
one here; 1 was the fiast one in this House
ta propose the eight-hour day, and I made
a long speech an it, but gat very littie
sympathy.
1 was the first one in this
House ta say that nien should be
paid semi-monthly. But thé Labour party
is travelling altogether too fast for me:I must canfesa that 1 cannat keep up with
AV. There are too many labour leaders and
they are too ambitiaus, and I will welcome
the day when a mian wîll arise in this
country and free labour fram the tyranny
of unianism.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Inasmuch as
my bonourable triend bas indicated so
directly that be desired some remarks tram
the Minister of Labour upon this question,
1 feel like gratifying bis desire if tbe House
will spend a little time-not for the purpose of using the question as a political
tootball, as bas untortunately been done Ii
times past, but in aider calmly and inipartially ta state the truth, if I can.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: You will have
many bonourable gentlemen listening ta
you.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tbe honourable
gentleman mîho bas just spoken referred ta
the fact that in 1910 a strike occurred on
the Grand Trunk railway, and tbat the
then Minister of Labour and the then M-Ninister af Militia succeeded in having the men
who were out on strike rei'nstated. He
points out that the question ot the.payment
of pensions did not came prominentîr to

the front when those nmen retired tram the
service, for did tiat question arise for
some time. I rwant to shorw that the honourable gentlemans information is quite
erroneous. That stilike occurred. in July or
August, 1910, and, notwithstanding the tact
that the Government of that day continued
for nearly a year and a hait afterwards,
200 Grand Trunk canductors and trainmen
were out of iBervice until about January,
1912. 1 took occasion only to-day Vo look
into the files and get an ides, of what did
actually take place, Ibeause my hanourable friend spake Vo me yesterday, as he
told the -Hanse, and 1 taund that valuminous correspondenoe had pa.ssed between
officers representing tfiose employee-s and
the Department of Labour. Evidence was
sanmtted clearly indicating that the
promises and piedges muade by the then
management of the Grand Trunk had nat
been tulfilled; 'but, ootwithstanding that
great pressure had been brought to bear
on the Labour Department ot that day, it
was only in 1912 that the question was
takien up. 1V Nvas then tound that of the
200 men whom Judge Barron, the commissioner appain'ted to investigate, their complaints alter the strike, had tound should
be rekinstated, 138 had not been reinstated.
Pressure *was brought to bear, wliich 1
need noV go into in detail, and it proved
sufficient ta cause the rein.sta'tement of
those 138 men forthwith-an action which
I submit might have been taken a year
and a hait betore. It was samewhat of a
surprise ta me fihat the homaurable, gentlenman sbauld at'tempt ta bring ujp this inatter
on the floor ot the Hause for the purpose
of thrawing mud at the Governruent because of lack af interest in or sympathy toi
thase railway men.
That,- however, has nothing 'whatever to
do -with 'the question of pensions. P~twas
not until. February, 1914, that the subject
of pensions arase, výhen a conductor in the
province of Ontario, %vhasename 1 think 1
could find, was disqualified tram turthex
service in the Grand Trunk employ becau-se of tailing eyesight, and he made an
application to the cam'pany to be retired
upon hi6 pension.. He was one ot the emplayees wvbo had participated in the strike
trouble of 1910,' and he was intormed that
because bis service had not been continuou-., but had been broken by that short
interval wvhen he was an strike, he was flot
entitled ta the pension consideration.
Silbsequently cases af a similar nature

did not see the question in the sanie light,
sud adhered Io the original -stand that had
been taken. It was pointed out to the

ail those facts, the raiilway company took
the position that those men had flot been
continuously in service within the meaning
of the Provident Fund Act, and therefore
were flot entitled to the pension. Appeal
was taken by the organizations named to
the vice president, subsequently to the
president; but meanwhile a new president
had corne into office, Mr. Chamberlin, and
subsequently an appeal was made through
him 10 the board of directors of the Grandl

says:
In no case shall any acquired rights or v'ested
Interests ln elther the pension systeni or the

It ciearly includes these members.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is not the
contrary the proper interpretation to place
upesi that? Whatever rights they have acquired are stili intact, and to be det-ermined hereaiter.
Hon. 'Mr. BELOeURT: No, their vested
rights are gone. They were deprived of
those rights in 1910, and have been deprived of them ever since.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: The inost
that can be said is that they have been
postponed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They are not in

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGiHEED: Il they

affected the continuance of that right? If
they had a legal right in this fund, can it
not 'be asserted to-day as well as in 1912?
Hon. fMr. BELOOURT: I amn afraid that
if the agreement is left as it is these men
will have no rights whatever. The Grand

which will prevent them being compelled
to pay.

seerns to me that there is a great misapprehension. These pensions are not a liability
of the Grand Trunk Company at ail, nor
are they made a lia.bility of the Government. The pensions are a liability of the
pension fund. If a -nan obtains a pension
it ie -not taken out of the funda of the Grand

pension fund which 'has already been set
aside by the Grand Trunk railway for the

purpose of paying pensions.
Trunk Railway, like a bank or any other
inetilution, sets aside each year so .much
money for a pension 'fund. If the Government takes over the road, i.t wiil continue

fund, and wii have no proprietary interest

the men do flot rank on the pension fund,
that will not benefit the Governiment, at
ail, because the 'Government cannot appropr'iate and use the money. They are onlv
trustees for th'e men, .and the whole question is whether or nmt this pension fund
shall be saddled with 'this -iability. If the
Govern'ment intendis to increase the pensions, that is quite another question; but,
so far es the Gran-d Trunk Railway is concerned, their assets would incit hbe increased
onie dollar if th-ey paid ail these pensions,
because 'they a-e only liable for the amount
they -agreed to contribute. It passes my
understanding, and for the life of me 1
cans'ot see, how this agreement, which
deals with the liabilities of the Grand Trunk
Railway Company which may be assumed
by the Goverxbmen't. or which -the Govern'ment rnay esk to have charged against the
value of the Grand Trunk railway, can in
any way be involved.
Hon. Mr. IBELiCOURT: It ds the eubjectmatter of the agreemen't:

the agreement we are making. If the Gevernnent should decide to-miorrow to pay

Thiat being so, I cannot see why we should

We can ratify something that the Government of Canada has done, but it does flot
seern to me to be quite the proper thing to
ask the Parliament of -Canada to ratify an
agreement in order to put into shape something that has been done by the shareholders of the Grand Trunk Railway Coinpany. This brings mie to another point.

it would have been better if they had giveni
the matter further consideration and had

Grand Trunk Company on lines very
different from the lines of this agreement;
that would have been very much better for
the Dominion Goverument to make an arrangement with the Grand Trunk Company
along the lines that were suggested ini thie
correspondence brought down, lines which
would have kept the Grand Trunk Company
and the shareholders interested in the operation of the road. Canada would have had
the advantage of a large body of shareholders in England and possibly in other parts
of the world being interested in seeing that
the Grand Trunk railway was successfully
operated and that the business was properly
carried on; and they would have been interested not only in the development (f the
railway, but also in the upbuilding of the
Dominion of Canada itself. That policy
would have been a very much better oee
for the country and would have saved the
Dominion of Canada from being placed in
the position it occupies to-day, of havinc.
under the agreement to arrange te pay a
fixed sum of money as interest to the shareholders of the Grand Trunk railway every
year. They obtained money on the credit of
the Dominion of Canada, and the Dominion
is responsible for paying the interest on the
cemfpany's shares and bonds, without anm
,reference to tlic operation of the road o'i
the amount of profit that inay be derived
fromi it. This agreement imposes upon the
country very great liabilities and responsibilities, and 1 do flot think the country
realizes the extent of the difficulties with
which we mav have to contend in carrying

Hon. Mr. DANDURANU: It wou]d be iiiterezting to know froin the representatives
of the province of Manitoba if these people

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 'Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: My honourable
!riend is absolutely in error when he speaks
about the right being taken away. I understand that, it was the Norquay Government of Manitoba who made the protest,
and the Dominion Government, in order
to do away with that agreement, loaned
the company $15,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRALN: I have discussed
that question with my honourable friend
before. We dîd not agree at that time,
so I do flot hope to convince hirn this afternoon. But, after ail, the Canadian Pacifie
railway is a public utility, and the tendency of the age is that public utilities
should pay only a reasonabie rate of interest to their shareholders. I can give
an instance of a contract that was
made for the tramways of Montreal.
A valuation of the property was made by
the comm~ission, and ail that the shareholders could possibly receive on their investment wvas 61 per cent. The company
had to accept that, and the fares have to

is not publie ownership, because the
company operates the road; but the
rates are fixed independently o! the
company, and if any extension is to be
made this independent commission decides
whether the line shaîl be built or flot; and
wben the line is buiît it is obliged to charge
certain fixed fares. So, aiter the C.P.R.
shareholders have been fairly treated, and
well treated, I would flot be averse to
having anything over and above a reasonable dividend faîl into thie public coffers.
The C.P.R. would only be returning to this
country what they have been getting from it.
Now, as to government railroads, where
are we going- if we do not increase rates?
According to the admission made by the
Minister of Railways, we have had a deficit
o! no less than $47,000,000. -And that is

must be the real deficit! It reminds me
o! the play in which the lady says, "«Oh,
you don't know the half of it, dearie."
Well, perhaps we don't know the haîf of
it: it may be niuch more than that. Then
the minister adds that for every dollar collected by the railways, 78 cents went to the
workmen. Considering also the enhanced
price o! coal, which is 200 or 300 per cent

I see that, according to the correct figures
the Government now controls 22,000 miles,

Hon. Mr. LYNOCI-STAUNTON:

me. He need not labour it any further.
Hon. Mr. CASGRMIN: That leaves only
4,000 miles for the independent roads. In
any case I thought that the Drayton-Acworth report would be correct. It cost this
country a lot o! money. They had an*endless number o! experts going ail over the

as to mileage,. and 'I did flot verify the

being correct. However, that is only one
f actor.
A:t the time we took over the Canadian

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does the honourable

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I want to have the

to have the rword "kno-wingly" inserted so
that it will read: "No person shahl knowingly expose for sale." As you will readily
und-erstand, it is ibsolutely impossible for
the end man, wh& is the retail dealer, say,
in a general store in the country, and who
huys his goods froni the manufacturer or
the jo»bber, to tell whether the maple syrup
or maple sugar is adulterated or not. I
have personal knowledge of a case occurring under the old Act, and this Bill la not
very different-a case in .which. Inland Revenue officers on their rounds 4ntered a store
and took a sample of maple syrup that had
been put up in Quebec and was labelled
"Guaranteed pure maple syrup." A sainpie of this syrup contained in a 24-ounce
bottie, was bought for analysis, and as a
resuit the merchant was brought before a
mnagistrate and fined $20 and costs. That
'was a manifest injustice, for nobody could
tell under the cirêumstances whether that
maple syrup was aduhterated or not. I
tasted some of the syrup, and I assure you
I could not tell. There la no justice in
making the retail grocer subject to a fine
of $200, as he would be under the provisions
of this Bill.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the ohject of this Bill is to remove the restriction
which is now part and parcel of the AXct,
under wvhich the pilota' tariff cannot be increased until the minimum salary of the
Quebec pilots' for three successive years
falis below $600 a year. That is considered
entirely inadequate, and the object of the
Bihl is to give authority to the minister of
the department under which the pilots
corne, to increase that tariff froin tiîne to
turne as may be consistent with the requirements of the situation.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
to extend the tirne for the manufacture, importation and sale of oleomargarine for one
year. It also gives further authority to deal
with the subject of regulations. It makes
provision for prescribing penalties for violation of the regulations. There ha.s been
more or less controversy between the dairy
interests of Canada and the consuming publie as Vo this particular question. But the
Government is prepared to assume the responsibility for extending the time for another year for the importation, sale, and
manufacture of oleomiargarine.

OPIUM AND NARCOTIC DRUG BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the

the Opium and Narcotîc Drug Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is introduced in pursuance of the provision
which appears in the Pea-ce Treaty between
the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany and other enemy countries. Previous
to the war, in 1911, a convention was entered
into at the Hague in pursuance of which
the different nations agreed to legishate in
regard Vo the regulation and suppression of
narcotic drugs. The Bill is largcely administrative. It embraces the principle to which
I have referrcd, anid aniends chapter 17 of

Opium.

that in order Vo, attain that end certain disabihities will be imposed upon t.hose people.
For instance, they will be prevented from
getting paregoric and such remedies without a .prescripti on. As the; Bill was first
introduced, it prevented the ordinary
grocery store in -the coun-bry from selling
domestie remedies which they have been
accustomed Vo, seli and deprived people in
rural districts of the opportunity ouf obtaining tlhem, which -would have entailed a
hardship indeed. But the Bill, as a.mended,
has remedied that situation to a great exVent, and, as it appears before us, I think
it as good and proper a Bull as can be
fra'med for the purpose which it bas in
vîew. No Bill which absolutely prohibits
ean be enforced without inflicting some
hardship on some people. We ahi realize
that in connection. with the prohibition

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the effect
ai that clause?
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is ta
prevent the members ai the Board, particularly ai local Boards, from trafficking
in any way in the lands which they are administering on behalf ai the Government
in the carrying out of the Act. I think
there have been cases in which there has
been a suspicion that members ai the Board

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That provision is made ta avercome difficulties

desirable ta be able ta distinguish the property of the Board, on whieh they hold the

IMMIGRATION (DEPORTATION) BILL.
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON rnoved the
second reading of Bill X2. an Act to aînend
the Immîigration Act (Deportation of Undesirable Persons).
He said: Honourable gentlemen, if the
proyposed amendment 1 o section 41 o! the
Immigaration Act is adopted. the section wvil1
apply merely Vo British subjects born outside of Canada and who have not acquired Canadian domicile, and will not apply to any others. AI] the other provisions
of the Act se apply, and this arnendiient
will bring section 41 into, lne with sîl the
other clauses of the Act s0 far as it relates
te British subjects.

MAY 7, 1920
The proposed elimination of subsection
2 of section 41 is regarded as desirable.
That subsection was passed at a timne when
it was necessary, under w-ar conditions, to
'place safeguards or restrictions whîch
would enable the immigration authorities
to cope with any situat.ion that înight arise.
Hon. .Mr. WATSON: WVi1l the honourable gentleman read that portion of the
section which is being repealed?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Subsection 2 o!
section 41, which it is proposed to repeal,
reads as follows:
Proof that any person belonged to or was
within the description of any of the probibited
or undesirable classes within the meaning of
this section at any time since the fourth day of
May, one thousand nine hundred and ten, shall,
for ail the purposes of this Act, be deemed to
establlsh prima fadle that he still belongs to
such prohibited or undesîrable class or classes.

It does not seemn necessary any longer to
keep what may be termed a rather radical
restriction in the Act, and, as honourable
gentlemen know, it has been very widely
objected to by the press and by labour
people particularly. Inasmuch as it was
enacted for a specific purpose in time <f wa r,
and the emergency has now passed, it is
flot considered important by the Department of Immigration that it should be continued.
Hon. Mr. BOSTIOCK: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill seems to be one of those
which. are very difficult to understand
owing to the way they are printed. When
I first read this Bill the term "Canadian
citizen" seemed to me to be very broad, and
At was difficuit to understand the meaning
or effeet of the Bil1. In the Act o! 1910
I found a definition o! "Canadian citizen."
But I did not understand very clearly froni
the explanation given by the niinister what
was the change that was heing- mnade. I understood the honourable gentleman to say
that the present Act did not affect a British subject domiciled in Canada. It seemed
to me that the proviso in the present Act
was that the section should net apply to
any person who is a British subjeet either
by birth in Canada or by naturalization;
but the explanation that the minister bas
just given seems te be centrary to that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is a distinction, though perhaps not a very wide
oxie, between Canadian naturalizatien and
Canadian domicile. The terni "Canadian
citizen" is defined in section 2 of the Act,
paragraph f, I thirik.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is the Act of
1910?
REVTSED

s

Hon. Mr. ROBEXRTSON: 1910 or 1918. At
any rate, "Canadian citizen" is interpreted
te mean "a person born in Canada who has
flot become an alien; a British suhject who
has Canadian domicile; or, a person naturalized under the laws o! Canada wbo bas
flot subsequently become an alien or lost
Canadian domicile." The Act as it would
apply if amended as proposed would mnean
that a British subject, a!ter he had been
resident in Canada for, I think, a period of
five years, would be regarded as having
obtained Canadian domicile 'and would
then be on the samne ground as a Canadianborn citizen; but a British subject -who had
been here less than five years would still
come under the provisions o! section 41 of
the Immigration Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does not that question of domicile relate closely to the question of intent? Would not a man who
came over here with the intention of living
in Canada be imnmediately considered to be
domiciled in Canada? It seems to me it is
a very wide question, and one which it is
rather difficuit to discuss.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that the
term, "domicile" is quite clearly defined in
It
the interpretation clause of the Act.
reada:
(<d) 'domicile' means the place in which a
person has his home, or in which he resides....
<ji)
Canadian domicile can only be acquired.
for the purposes of thîs Act, by a person havlng
his domicile for at least five years In Canada.

That is the interpretation of te word
"domicile" in the interpretation clause.
WVhatever it may mean els.ewhere, that is
what it meane for the purposes of this Act.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to ask
the minister if tItis repeals the drastic authority which we gave the Government last
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Only in part.
Hlon. Mr. MURPHY: What part?
LYNCH-STÂUNTON:

in the city of Winnipeg ought to be a
warning to every man that such legisiation
as we placed on the statute book a year ago
ie absolutely necessary. It does not necessarily follow that it should be enforced
harshly; but I maintain that, when there
is occasion to enforce it, it should be on
the statute tbook so that it could be invoked.
and shouid be strictly enforced. when necessary. I do not believe that men who commait acta which bring thema within the provisions of such a law should be deait with
as &orne men in Canada have been deait
with. As my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Stausiton) bas said, agitators who
have corne from the Clyde, or froma England, have caused a great deal of our
trouble. If I understand this Bill, such
characters could not 'be deported if once
they became Canadian citizens if we adopt
this Bill. They would be protected by their
citizenship, and 'could do alnost anything
they liked. They could be put in penitentiary, of couree; but I do not fbelieve it is
in the interests of good government that
such men should be put in the penitentiary and kept at the expense of the country. They should be deported, and the deportation of half-a-dozen such men would
be the very best thing that could happen
to-day as a warning to others. When they
are sent tn the penitentiary they becomne
martyrs. the Government îs pestered by
petitions to release them.

of doing drastic things; but now that the
necessity has passed, thene is sýurely no objection to giving a British subject who has
been resîdent in this country for at Ieast
five years a trial before a jury of his peers
before he is deported.
The flrst clause of the Bih1 is siniply an
amendment to section 41. In the second
clause of the Bill iA is pno.posed te repeal a
provision Which permitted the depontation
of anyone, whethen a British subject or the
subjeet of any other country, who at any
time sin.ce May, 1910, had been guilty of
any -of the nets or utterances described in
section 41 as being seditious. That legislation was passed a yean or more ago, and
V1here bas been en opportunity for dealing
with any pensons in this country who came
within 'that clase; and 1 can assure this
House that a substantial nrnnber of men in
different parts of Canada viere deported. It
is flot gene.rally known at t-he present timne;
but I know of one locality frein which a
large number of men of that elass viere depo'rted. I think the nu'mber was 21. Those
who.m iit was desired te remeove having been
deported, the legislation bas served its purpose; se that to-day there is in this country nobody of the class referred to who has

The minister

M AY 7, 1920
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:- I beg the hon-To acquire
ourable gentleman's pardon.
Canadian domicile one must be a Canadian
citizen or a British subject havinig .acquired
Canadian domicile, which means five years'
residence in Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does the minister
say that we have deported ahl who camne
wîthin the undesirablie class except Oanadian citizens'
AU wvhom it
Hon. .Mr. ROBERTISON:
seemed necessary to deport.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What about Ivens
and somne more of those prea.cheirs?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think honourable members will agree that the Government and the authorities of the province of
Manitoba and the court,& o! that province
acted wisely when they gave to Mr. Ivens
and every one of his colleagues in that
movement a fair trial. lMr. Ivens came to
this country a *young man, in fact a boy.
He received his education'in the Wesleyan
College in Winnipega. He grew up in this
country. He had been here for more than
thirty years. I submit to you that public
opinion, and you honourable gentlemen
yourselves, would agree that It would mnot
have been fair to railroad that man out o!
thîs country without a fair trial.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: How about the
others?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Citizens o!
foreign countries who camne to Canada and
were guilty of seditious acts and utterances
merited deportation, even though those
utterances or acts were committed prior to
the time this legislation was passed. We
dealt wilth a substantial number. Now, that
having been doue, and more than a year
having gone by during which that work
has been carried out and concluded, there
is no necessity for continuing upon our
statute books a 'Iaw that will permit an
officer of the Immigration Department to
cause to be deported a British subject who
has been in this country more than five
years.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: And has been
guilty of ail those acts?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Can any officer do
that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The immigration
officers can do that without a trial. Now,
honourable gentlemen, I urgently sug-gest
that this matter be given careful and
serions consideration before you finally de-

cide. I arn not asking you to make a snap
judgment upon it, but arn simply requesting you to give earnest consideration to
this question: is the Parliament of Canada
going to refuse to pass legisiation which
wilI entitle a British subjeet of more thani
five years' residence in this country to a
fair trial before a jury of his peers before
he is cleported?
I would suggest that, inasmuch as we
have a ve-ry sinall attendance in the Hlouse
at the present moment, and as this is a
very important subject, we should adjouraR
the debate until souie future day-say until
Tuesday of next week if you desire, to gîve
you time to inquire and consider just what
the effect of this measure would be.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourable
gentleman stated two or three times, in discussing this question of domicile, that a
man has to be in the country five years
before he acquires Canadian domicile. 1
cannot see that in the Act o! 1910, which I
have before me. It says only three years.
Has the Act been changued since then?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think At was
changed in 1918.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What is
the section?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- I think I cani
give the honourable gentleman the informa'tion. "The Immigration Act and Regulations," as issued by the Immigration Department in the year 1919, quotes section

Hon. MT. ROBERTSON: I do not think
you will find it there.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Where
is the section that defines "domicile"?
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: Chapter 25.
Hon. Mr. R0BPRTSON:. It is section 2,
subsection 1, paragraph d o! the Immigration Act o! 1919. It reads as folio ws:

SENATE
Canadian domicile can only be acquired. for
the purposes of this Act, by a person havlng
his domicile for at least five years in Canada
after having been landed therein within the

STEAMBOAT INSPECTION BILL.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE
PORTED.

AND

RE-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
that the Senate go into Committee on Bill
49, an Act to amend the Canada 6hipping
Act (Steamboat Inspection).
Hon. WM. ROCHE: Honourable g-entlemen, at the second reading I asked the
Minister whether this Bill was to apply to
sh'ipping generally, and I think he replied
in the affirmative. ýI would like to point
out at the present moment, if the honourable gentleman says that, what would be
involved in it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHJEED: We can
discuss the question fully when we go into
Committee, as we intend to do.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: This affects the principle of the, Bill; that is the point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The principle of the Bill has been assented to bv
the House, because the Bill has received
fit second reiading. it, is now at the Committe-e stage.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I arn speakinga ag-ainst
the motion to go inte Committee on the
Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh. yes;
my honourable friend can do that.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I want te point out
briefly whe.t effect the Bill will have. I
say that this infringes international law.
In the first place, foreign ships are deemed
part of the territory and under the control
of foreign states, and these resent any in-

MAY 7, 1920
terference with the management or construction cf their ships.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My bonourable friend will observe that it is proposed to give authority te the Governor in
Council te make rules and regulations
%long the Unes mentioned in the Bill, and
we would have te wait until those rules
and regulatiens are rnade.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Yes, but this proposes rules and regulations regarding ships
over which we have no contrai.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
ManifestlyHon. Mr. ROCHE: I de net want te argue
with the honourable gentleman; I enly
want te say just what effect it weuld have
and aise te urge that we conaider carefully its effect on Canadian shipping. If
this Bill is paased, foreign shîps putting
inte ports like Sydney for ceai would have
te be stepped and their fires would have te
be put eut and their houlera examined.
Halifax aise is a port of cail. Vessels
corne in merely to get orders, and then they
preceed. If they can b. stopped and their
boilers ins'pected, it will have a bad effect.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Gevernrnent wili net go beyond its autherity
in the matter.
The mnotion was agreed te, and the Senate
went into Cornrittee on the Bill. Hon.
Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On section 1, new section 578--rules and
regulations:
Hon. Mr. ROCHEi No-w, Mr. Chairman,
T wish te make this observatien, that in
the cases I have cited of foreign shipa, the
regulations could net apply te thern, because they are precluded by their nationality frorn centrol by the Governor in
Council or anybodv else in this country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Irnpliedly,
Nithout any argument, this mnust necessarily be within the authority cf the Government of Canada. We cannet for a moment
presurne to assert authoritv which we do
not possess. Until the rules and regulatie a.re passed, of course, it cannet be det-errnined what the autherity is. But, 1
think rny honourable iriend rnay rest assured that the Governnent et Canada is
net geing te as.sert an authority which it
clearly dees net pessesa.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS - If you bur a
foreign ship, until that ship is registezed
in Canada it is net subject te inspection.

f

Hon. Mr. CROSBY: There are conditions
under iwhich we can have a foreign ship
exarnined. Canadiai vessels have to pass
a test at least once a year. Their boilers
must be tested every year, and under certain conditions the vessels may have to be
tested more than once. For instance, a
ship may meet with an accident. Then,
there are classes of ships that couie into
Canadian waters, and, 1 arn sorry, to gsay,
are able te trade between one Canadian
port and another. Any such ship that remains here for a certain length of time is
subjedt ta inspection, whether shte is
British or Norwegian or Swedish, or
if
be.
whatever register she may
the vessel is trading from port te port in
the Dominion cf Canada she is subject
te our houler regulations. We have passed
legislation by which we restrict the size cf
ships, in order te give the Dominion Ceai
Company, the Dominion Iron and Steel
Company, and the Nova Scotia Steel Cernpany the privilege ef chartering these
ships, because we did net have ships on
our own reg-isteir up te 1,500 tons. These
ships have been coming into Canada and
trading in Canada year. in and year eut,
and they corne under our houler regulations.
We exercise centrol ever themn. Under the
Shipping Act their boilers must be tested
at least once a year. In my judgrnent
ne foreign ship should be trading between
port and port in Canada. We have ships
of cur own, and we want te preserve our
own coastwie trade. MHowever, we are
net, discussing that point. The point I arn
making is that any ship that corntes into
Canadian waters and trades frorn port te
port in Canada is properly subi ect, regardless cf nationality, te the same examinatien as a Canadian ship.
.Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Paragraphs a, b, c, d, e, 1, and g cf titis new
section 578 are the saute as in the present
law.
Hon. Mr., ROCHE.- With regard te the
observation cf rny esteemed colleague front
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Crosby), I want te say
that vessels loading cargo in Canada would
be on a different basis from those about
which I have spoken. Provision could be
made that vessels should net load in Canada unless they were subject te inspection.
We might have control over that. But
my good friend. from Halifax knows very
well that the portwarden or atylbody else
cannot make -a survey upon a foreign ship
except on application te the consul cf the
nation by w.hich the vesse] la owned.

RUMOURED FRENCH EMBARGO ON
LOBSTERS.
INQUIRY.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to
bring to the attention of the House a seemingly well-founded report that the Government of France is about to put an embargo
upon the importation of lobsters into that
country. Inquiries -have ibeen made at
the Department of Trade and Commerce,
but they seem toi be in a quandary to answer them. 1 would ask the leader of the
Government if hie bas any information on
the subject, and, if not, whether he will
endeavour to get the information for us.
The question was asked in the other House
this day week, but there has been no reply
which would in any way clear up the matter. I need hardly say that such an embargo would be a serious blow to the lobster industry of the Maritime Provinces,
which anîounts to about $3,000,000 a year.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
no information upon the subjeet, and have
had no intimation that such a thing was
to be done. If I can get any information
on the fiubject I shall be glad to communicate it to my honourable friend.
MAPLE PRODUOTS BILL.
REFERRED BACIC TO COMMITTEE 0F
WHOLE.

On the order for the third readîng of
28, an Act respectingc Maple Products:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, 1 wish to make a. slight
amendment to this Bill before it is read
the third time. I therefore move that it
-be not now read a third time, but that it be
re-committed to the Committee of the
Whole.
The motion was agreed to, and the 6enate went into committee on the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I propose
striking out clause 3 of the Bill which
makes provision for the imposition of a
fine in the event of mnaple sugar being
seized on the shelves say of a retail merchant or otherwise, if it should be found
to be adulterated in any way. The Food
and Drugas Act whieh was passed *a few
days ago makes, I think, ail the necessary
provision for the imposition of penalties
and for the enforcement o& an Act of this
k.ind. I therefore move tlx.t clause 3 be
stricken out.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does this alteration
meet the point that was, raised the other
deay hby the honourable gentleman from
Tignish <Hon. Mr. Murphy)?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. The
Food and Drugs Act makes the most ample
provision for the enforcernent of penalties.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: May not the penalties
prescribed by the Food and, Druge Act be
too severe for those who anay seli adulterat-ed maple sugar? With what substance is
meaple sugar adulterated? Some of those
penalties may be very eevere indeed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
a minimum penalty, which is very small,
and the Food and Drugs Act makes the
most ample provision, eo that any one
violating it may take advantage of a want
of knoowledge or anything of that kind.
Last week before we passed the Food and
Dxugs Act we discussed that phase of the
question. I arn sure this is a very reasonable and moderate Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: As the one who
raised that point, I may say that I took
exception to that section of the Food and
Drugs Act on account of its 6tringency.
You will notice by the section that when
a man is supposed Vo -be hiable und.er this
Act, if he notifies the magistrate that ha
boug.ht the article in good faith and used
aIl necessary precautions to get a pure
article, he would flot be subject to the fine.

Why make a difference by not specifying

lîfe preservers and fire-buokets? Only the
number of fire-extinguishers is to be prescribed.
Hon. 8ir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does not

Hon. Mr. BOYER: That is precisely what
I say.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But we
do nat do that?
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Why should you ask
power ta prescribe the number o! fire-extînguishers and noV to specif y the number

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It might
be difficuit to determine the number of lifeboats that should be carried. I do noV think
that you could adopt any uniform standard
by which. that cauld be doue.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Yee, according to the
number o! persons the boat je lioeneed. to
carry.

Horn. IMr. *CASGRAIN: Well, perhaps 1
could. You *must kxxow that at present
there are varions kinds ail life-boats. There
are the coiiapeibie life--boats, there 'are
boats of different sizes, end so an. The
regulation und-or t.he S'hipping AeV on the
other side, states exact-iy the provision that
mnuit be made <air every aine. There is no
analogy between the number af boats and
the provision (4l ive-sa'ving. For dunstance,
there le a new iaunéching ap'pairatus by
means ofl which it is possible to handie
abouft four timnes as mainy bate as foTxnerly.
That makes quite a difference. It ie not
the number of boats that ie important; it
le the number of places in the boate. Everyone must 'be pro'vided for. There are boat
&rills at certain hours, and every one must
go and sitand by tihe -boat. Eivery paasenger
on board dhip hae a particuiar place assigned Vo him.
Then, ae to the number of fire-extinguishers, th'at is un altogdther diff erent tihing.
For instance, ail the tire insurance cainipanies say that there muet be a certain
number of fire extinguiehers. Thait je why
tihe num&>er je specified. bore, I take it.
It is Itihe saïme with regaid Vo, a store or other
building. If you want to get the benefit of
soins insurance clause or te pay less for
your insurance, you must have a certain
number of fi.xed fire-extinguiehere.

The motion was agreed tai, and the Bill

Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: Not the number
of boats-the size ai the boats.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That authority should be sufficiently wide ta permit of the niimber being prescribed.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY:- According to class cf

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
have relation chiefly ta the number. As I

RE-

PORTED.

On nibtion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
tihe Senate went into Committee on Bill 94,
an Act Vo Amend the Canada, Shipping Act
(Pilotage). Hion. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On section 1-section. 434 repealed, etc.:
Hon Sir JAMES LiOUGHEED. My honourable friend opposite ('Hon. Mr. Bostock)
asked me for a statement ot the fees of
pilots. I lay the statement upon the Table.
As I explained in introducing thics Bill, it
îa proposed Vo repeal the section of the Act

referred to because it provided thiat the
pilotage charges cannot be increased until
the minimumn fees of a pilot for three consecutive years fall below $600. (f course,
that i-s a very low rate of payment for pilots.
It le .propeeed Vo leave the matter entirely
Vo the discretion of the Minister. There je
no intention at the present time of increasing the fees, but this removes the restriction, which is very embarrassing.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does noV the passing of this Bill rather hold out an invitation Vo the pilots Vo ask for an increase?
Hon. Si(r JAMES LOUGHEÉD: The desirability o-f increasing theni has been represented, but the Minister has no intention of doi.ng su at the present time. But
when the restriction is removed, if it should
be desirable Vo do so, owing Vo the increased
cost of living, and su on, he can exercise his
discretion.
Hion. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand that the 'Minister dopas flot intend
Vo avail himiself of the legi-sIation.?
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Minister states thet, not-withstandinga the
repeal of the section, it Is not his intention at the present time Vo increase the

Hion, W. B. ROSS: 1 undestand that the
average income of the pilots is new $2,400
ajear, se it wilI be ene considerable time
before they get down Vo $500. What is
intended, 1 understand, is Vo make the law

Hon. Sir JAM1ES LOUGHEED.

Hion. W. B. ROSS: It is an invidious

there are complainte from those pilots wlio

s perfectly legitimate practice. If you can

it is worth as mnuch as butter, because its

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have been teld

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Oh, no.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: In reply te
the honourable member from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) I may say that I think
it is wisdom on the part of the ýGovernmnent
that they have extended this time for one
year. At the close of the great war no person
in Canada knew what the effect on the dairy
industry would be. The dairy industry ai
Canada is one of the greatest industries we
have, but I mnust say that with the prices
the facrimer or producer is receivîng for his
milk, 'I do not think hie la suff ering by the
manufacture of oleomargarine. Butter in
this country to-day has become almost a
luxury for the poor man. But, regarding the
quality of oleomargarine as compared with
fine butter, I cannot agree with the honourable member for Assiniboia.,.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFE: Well, give us oui
choice.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: 1 have tried several
times te eat it in New York, but I prefer
my bread without any oleomargarine on i't.
Any person who has been accustomed to
good creamery butter, or efrst-class dairy
butter made by a Canadian woman, will flot
take kindly te oleoniargarine. I think the
Government is very ise in limiting the
tixne .from year 'to year. Had a depression
occurred in t.he cheese trade 0cr the creamery
butter trade, it -%vould have been an easy
matter to let the time for the manufacture
o! oleomargarine expire- and let the people
o! Canada have creamiery butter at a lower
price. But there is a foreign demand for alI
the fine butter we can niiake in Canada, and
so long as the prices remain high I think
the Govlernment of Canada is displaying a
great deal o! wisdoni in giving the workingmnen who cannot buv butter at fancy prices
an opportunity o! obtaining fats of this
kind.
*Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would ask the honourable leader of the Government whether
it would flot be well to strike out clause
3 of this Bill, as he did a simil-ar provision in Bill 28, the Maple Products Bill,
leaving the penalty to corne under the
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF

operation of Bill 27, an Act respecting Food
and Drugs, which, as hie said a moment ago,
makes ail the necessary provision for the
enforcement of a penalty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not like to consent to striking out clause 3.
I amrn ot prepared to say without Iookinginto the question further, that oleomargarine
would necessarily corne under the Food and
Drugs Act of 1890. As this is simply a tentative piece of legisiation, expiring at the
date mentioned, 1 tliink it had better go as
it is.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: If I mnight be
permitted to inake a suggestionî, I would
urge that instead of striking out clause 3,
the penalty should be made $100. That is
the way to deal with that clause. I know of
a store&eeper who during this past winter
has sold, on an average, according to an
admission 'which hie made the other day.
150 lbs of oleomargarine a week, as butter.
He was fined the other day $50, the full
penalty of the law. That man should have
been fined $150 or $200. He was importing
oleomargarine, and clearing 25 cents a pound
on it -by selling it te the poor people of
Kingston as butter. I wouid inake the penalty more than $50, and protect the dairy
trade.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That would flot quite
meet the case. A man might seil 5,000 lb. and
$100 would not be a sufficient penalty. The
penalty shouid be as it is. $5, but the
<fender should he made te return te, te
purchaser twice the value of ail the o]eomargarine that hie sold as butter.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: That is ail righlt.
Hon. W. B. -ROSS: There was a similar
difficulty in England. The fine ivas made
as high as £5,000, but the man who sold the
oleomargarine as butter profited to the
extent of £30,000, and, after paying his fine
of £5,000, was £25,000 ahead. These penalties
are not o!f much value. The offenders should
be deait with in the other way-that o!
allowing the persons çwho got the oleomargarine for butter te recover twice the value.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wish te informi
my honourable frîend from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain), wvho seems to have
very little regard for oleomarg-arine, that 1
was lately- told by a grocer selling that
article that during the winter hie sold it to
persons o! limited means for cooking purposes, and even for the making of fine pastry,
and they ail claimed that it served the
purpose as well as the butter generally
used in cooking-. I heve heard that more

than once; so 1 wanted ta give the information to my honaurable friend, who seems
ta be prejudiced against, aleomargarine.
Section 4 was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed

The Bill was reported without amendment.
OPIUM AND NARCOTI'C DRUG BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into committee on Bill
20, an Act to amend The Opium and Narcotie -Drug Act.-Hon. MT. Blain ini the
Chair.
On section 1, subgection. 1-titie changed:
Hon. Mr. B06TOOK: Why le this restricted to narcotic druga? Are there no
other drugas to which this law is ta be
applied?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This Bill
àa confined entirely to habit-4orming drugs.
Subsection 1 wa-s agreed ta.
Subsection 2 was agreed ta.
On subsecti on 3-amendment in consequence of section 5A:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What ie the effeet of
this clause?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It makes
it oblig-atory to have a license to seli.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: A. I understand,
every wholesale or retail druggist and every
physician will have ta, be licensed under
this Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: What will be the
position of country stores under this Act?
They selI certain patent medicines which,
I suppose, cantain some o'f those druges.
Will they be liable, unless they get a
license frorn the minister, to be fined for
,having, those medicines in their possession?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
a provision whereby any person can seil a
preparation with a limited quantity.
Hon. Mr.'BO-STOCK: Such as most patent
medicines would have?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
provided in paragraph a of subsection 4,
new section 5A.
Subsection 3 was agreed to.
Subsection 4 was agreed to.

399

On subsection. 5, new section 5, subsection
1-penalty for giving, selling, or furnishing drugs to any but authorized persons:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: This seems ta be a
pretty drastic section. It does nat specify
the drug. It would caver everything in the
nature of medicine or druga..
I do not
think that should pass in sa braad a farmi.
What is meant by "drugs"?
Hon. Mr. MURPIHY: II would like ta ask
the honourable leader if the Bill *has nat
been very much amended. Have we before
us the amendments made to it?
Hon; Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. -MURPHY: That is the difficulty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
the Bill ae it has corne from the Gommons.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: After it was amended?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
was amended radically.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: We have not those
amendments made ta the Bill.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Without a definition
of the word "drugs,' what would it cover?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Paragraph a of subsection 2 gives the meaning
of "druga":
"drug- mneans and Includes any substance
(whether, alone or in conjunction with any
other substance) nientioned in the Schedule ta
this Act or which may be added ta such
Schedule unyder the authority of this Act.

And if my honourable friend wihl refer ta
the schedule he will find that it means:
cocaine or any of the saîts or compounds
thereof; morphine or any of the saîts or
compounds tiiereof, opium; eucaine or any
of the saits and comnpounds thereof.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would that caver
liniments? There are drugas in those.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then you could flot
seli Friar¶s Balsam without the authority
of a doctor. 'It seerns ta me you are tying
up the druggist in a very tight corner.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In new
section. 5, subsection 4, the exceptions are
ta be found.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 think thîs ie one
of the most important sections in the whole
Bill1. If the Bill contained this section
ahane it would lie worth passing, for the
simple reason that it prohibits the refilling

SENATE
by druggists o! a physician 's prescripticns
without orders from the physician to refill
them. Every one knows that doctors have
been blamed to sonle extent for creating
the habit of narcotic drug-taking, by prescriptions which ;they have given at
various Uines. As a inatter o! fact, if such
habits hiave been formed, through doctors'
pre&criptions, which are g-iven only for
emerg-encies, for certain pux'poses, and for
a certain length o! time, it is because of
the irregular action of druggists in continuing îndefinitely to fi siuch prescriptions time after time. That is very often
bow the habit of taking narcotic drugs is
scquired. It is not by the original prescription o! the physician, whieb is given
for a certain purpose, usually in an emergency, and only for a certain length o!
time. This section prohibits the druggist
from refilling any prescription of that kind
without ta special and specific order fromi
the doctor to do so, and 1 tbink that if it
is carried out it will be one o! the xnost
usetul means o! preventing the drug-taking
habit, or at ail events of decreasing it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: Can the honourable gentleman, with bis experience, say
.whether it is likely to be carried out or not,
and whether it should not Ïbe subject to
some other regulation?
-Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That 1 was going
to ask afterwarde.
11Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is like every
other statute in that respect.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It seems to be a
section in the interest of the doctor. If
the doctor's prescription can be used onily
once-if you musit go to the doctor every
time-1 can quite understand why the bonourable gentleman frorn St. John (Hon.
Mr. Daniel) would be very strongly in favout o! this.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is a lawyer's
view o! it
Hon. Mr. FO.WLER: I suppose honourable gentlemen do not remiember the time
when they were purohasing paregoric. But
paregoric would be excluded by this. would
it not?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: So it shouid be.
Hon. Mr. SGHAFFNER: It is u'sed for
children more than anything else.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There have been
somo pretty good men raised on paregorie,
and they have lived a long time. I must
say it strikes me that this is very drastic
Hon. Mr. DANIEL.

legisiation. and 1 think we are havin- toc
much of that kind of leg-isiation. There
is too much of "thou shalt not " in our
enactments, and it is really against the
publie interest, 1 think, to pass lawvs of
that sort. I for one protest against this
section. I do n'ot think that subsection
4 <a) of section 5A gives sufficient relief.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I might tell my
honourable friend that under subsection
4 <a) paregoric would flot be shut out, because there is nlot a sufficient strength of
opium in it. Opium is the chief ingredient
in paregoric. At the saine time. I might
tell my honourable friend it is and always
has been a very dangerous thing in the
household, and has on more than one occasion, to my own knowledge. been productive of serious harm.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURLAND: I do flot know
much about this question except that I have
heard doctors and othera say, ever since 1
have been able to understand, that haif
the chîldren who die before attaining their
second or third year do so as a resuit of
having been drugged with ail kinds of patent medicines. Knowing hardly anything
of hygiene, and very littie of the way in
which children should be fed, the parents,
when a child cried, even though it had
been fed only bal! an hour before, fed it
again; and if the child cried again, they
gave it a bottie. Thus, often, owing to the
parents' lack o&knowledge of the effects of
these drugs, c'hildren have been sent to
the grave.
Hon. '-%r. MUJRPHY: That is true as far
as ordinary food is concerned. But if a
child, after being given the bottle, continues to cry, recourse is had to the paregoric bottie, and hie is chloroformed into
quietude. WVhen he awakens hie cries again
because of the disturbance created in his
6tomach by the food, and *he is given paregoric again and is once more chlorofornmed
into a state of insensibility, and in that
state hie dies.
Subsection 5 of section 1 was agreed to.

Hon. 'Mr. FONVLEII: I understand it has

people. I xvould be a great mistake. A

a doctor would flot give a prescription for it;

ilion. Sir jAM!\ES .IOUGHEED: I a-11 iniforxîned that there are ûnly about thirty or
forty in the whole Dominion îwho -%vill take

further provisions of the Bill are entirely
new, and are drafted in prusuance of the
Convention of 1911, wvhich I understand was
entered into at The Hague. This legisaation
is practically in conforrnity with legislation
introduced by the other nations who adhere
to that Conventon.
Hon. ;MT. D.ANIEL: But that Convention
does not specify the fee that is to be paid
for a license?
Hon. iSir J-41MES LOUGHEED: No.

Hon . Mr. MURPHY: Perhaps the explanation îs that this is only for imnport
It iay be that
froin foreign countries.
tlhere are only forty or fifty wvho will be
under the necessity of taking out licensee.
If it applied to every retail druggist who
bought morphine or opium, t would be out
of place.
Hon. &r JAIMES .LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Do we understand
that-wholesale importers?
Hon. Sir JAlMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. SMr. MrURPHY: Should not that be
made clear?
They
Hon. Sir JAiMýES LOUGHEED:
will discover that.
Hon. Mr. DANqIEL: I ain not sure that
the leader of the Governîîîient is absolutely
,corredt about that. If vou look at this
section you wjll find that there are two
chargeds mentioried-one of $5, and another
o! $2,5. The section says:
For a license for a year for a manufacturer
or a dealer other than a retail druggist. the

So the retail druggist pays $5 for every

and as k> what our foreign population has
done and is doing, in the cultivation of the
opium plant.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Have the poppies
grown in the West anything like the
strength of the opium of the .East?
Hon. Mr. DOUGLAS: I arn speaking of
what my own eyes have seen. The poppies
of the West are a rather strong-er and better
plant than you find in India, for example,
where I spent some twelve yearTs.

us all about that. We think tobacco is not
-o very dangerous, but there is great danger
in its habitual use. A field of poppies is
a beautiful sight; it is like a sea of roses;
but you can scarcely realize the influence
that it exercises upon those engaged in
its cultivation. A man, for example, cannot cultivate the opium plant and make it
fit for market as we know it, because hie
becomes dTunk, and that in a few hours.

There are many cases o! that kind right near
the international boundary line.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
orîly the maximum. It does not follow that
the Order in Council will fix the fee for exportation and importation at $5. This simiply provides that the .fee shall not exceed
that aintourit. The intention o! the department is to advise the Governument to permit an importation of $25 without thiat
charge heing made. But this is reg-ulative,
naxiimnuni
and its object is to fix the

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Why slîould the

under the conditions which the hiononrable
gentlemnan from Brockville (Hon. M-%r.
Webster) mentions?
Hon. Mr. POWLER: Thiere iinust h)o a
fee. The honourable leader says the ibuporter niav be allowed to import up to $25
worth, but the Act would require the panient of a fee.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: For instance. a
muan might run short of heroin and send
across the international boundai-v line for
some, which might be worth only $5. and
if hie had t4opay only a dollar it would not
be reasonable or equitable at aîl.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I miight

(Hon. '.\r. Fowler) that it is really neot
obligatorv to issue the license. My honourable friend will see that this simply
gives power ta the Departiment oi 'Health to
issue licenses. It is simply an enabling
power and it is proposed that it shall be
exercised reazsonably. There mnay be circunmstances in which the importation or the
exportation may be permitted without
license.
Hon. Mfr. FOWLER: Why nlot say: "No
fees shall be exacted for any importation
under $25"? That wvould make it clear.

given ta the department, that is nlot going
ta be exercised arbitrarily. I understand
that a regulation will be passed, by which
a persan, without being obliged ta t'ake out
a license. may bring in $25 worth. If the
value is more than $215, then the license
would be required.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not provide

Does it inean
What does that inan
that a practising physician can be called
upon to state exactly how mucli be prescribed for any individuai patient. and
when, and the dofes, and everything of that
kînd? To my mind the wording of the
clause is too diffuse. It gives the minister
power to caîl upon the physician for al
kinds o.f information, which the physician
cannot possibly furnishi him.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If ho
cannot give the information hie cannot
compiy, that is ail.
Hon. 'Mr. DANIEL: Yes. 'but if lie does
flot give the information hie la hiable to a
penalty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Quite riglit.
Mon. Mr. DANIEL: That la the point. I
think that clause should lie modîfied to
some extent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If it is
ascertained that a surgeon or a dentiat or
a veterinary surgeon lias been ulsina an unusual quantity of opium, why should he noît
lie required to furnish that information? It
seema but reasonable. Furthermore, the
physician will hereafter be relieved of the
obligation of keeping a record.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The remarks of the
lionourable the leader of the Government
are ail very well as far as they go, but this
clause does not say that the in!&ýrmation
shahl be required only of any physician who
in t.he opinion of the Minister, is using or
dispensing more opium or morphine than
the Minister thinks hie ouglit to. The Minister can caîl upon any physician at any
time for any information that lie may want.
There la nothing in this to indicate that. that
information will lie required only from those
physicians wlio in the opinion o! the Minister are using more o! these druga than hie
thinks tliey ouglit to uge. I think the
clause ought to lie modified in sucli a way
that the Minister would understand that hie
la only authorized to caîl upon a physician
for information in any case where lie appears to be prescribin-g too niuch.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Many physicians

Hon. Mr. FOWLLR: Yes, they dispense
their medicine. Sucli a person is acting in
the dual capacity of druggist and physician,
and lie ouglit to be subject to the saine restrictions as are iniposed upon the druggist.
If you make the druggist furnish the information, why should you not makce the medical man do so? It is not to be supposed
t.hat the Minister vrill ask every medical
mari for the information. It is to be inferred from the very tenor of the section itself
that such information will be required only
where the Minîster has suspicions that. the
man is overdoing- the t.hing.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

It does flot say so.

Otherwise you
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
wouid infer that the Minister would be trying, to poke his nose into everybody's business. It is only in cases where suspicion has
been aroused and information is laid, or
somet.hing of that sort.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
there has been abuse.
Hon. Mr. FOWVLER: I t.hink the section
is ail right.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: 1 quite agree with
the honourable gentleman from Sussex

scrupulous.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They are flot all

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The Minister will
not require the intormiasion uniess bis attention is directed to abuses, or unless. a
case is made out against a man; and if such
a thing should occur it is the Minister's
duty and responsibility to inquire, and hie
should have the power to demand information as to liow rnuch of the drug is beingused.

attention of my honourable friend to this iniformation in order that when the Bill cornes

SECOND READING POSTPONED.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON moved the
second reading- of Bill O03, an Act respecting the Director of Coal Operations.
Hon. HjEWITT BOSTOCK: I would point
out to my honourable friend that this Bill
lias flot yet been distributed. 1 have asked
for a copy of it and have flot been able to
obtain one.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can state to
the House briefiy the purpose of the Bill,
and if honourable gentlemen desire that it
should stand over, I have no objection.
In 1917 in Aprîl, I think-there was appointed by Order in Council a Director of
Coai Operations, with jurisdiction over the
coal mines in what is known as district 18,
in Alberta and southern British Columbia.
The duties of the director were to regulate
the production of coal, the seliing price of
Âny
coal, and the wages of the miners.
disputes that arose between the miners and
the employers which they could not themseives adjust were to be referred ta the
Directar of Coal Operations, and hjs decision was to be final. That arrangement
was carried on most successfully. No interruption whatever occurred in the production of coal in that area up ta the sympathetic strike af 1919, when the minera went
out for some littie time in sympathy wvith
the Winnipeg difficulty. That contrai will

-and it is the opinion ai the officiais ai the

public interest that this control or direction
ai coal operation should be continued until
the next session af Parliament, or prabably
for th e period ai one year. If prior ta the
expiration ai that time the Governar in
Council should deem it unnecessary ta continue the measure, he may annul it. It is
simpiy a temporary expedient for the purpose ai continuing the present stable situation in that district. There is yet some
danger ai interruption through what is cammonly known as the O.B.U. element agitating for the overthrow ai the International Union anýd their purpose, which they

Hon. 'Mr. BELCOURT: What jurisdiction
has this Parliament in the matter? As I
understand my honourable friend, the
Orders in Council deait wlth the price ai
coal, with vages, and with disputes befween the workingmen and the operators.
On what g&round does the honourable meinber base our jurisdiction for the purpose of
this legislationP
.Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is upon the
saine ground as that on whicli the Federal
Parliament claimed jurisdiction in passingthe Industrial Disputes Investigation Act,
which governs this matter in sa far as
publie utilities are concerned. Goal mining
cames under the head of public utilities.
Instead of relying upon the establishmnent
of boards frorn time to time as disputes
arose, it was in 1917 considered desirabie
to, establish a tribunal that would be available at ail times to adjust disputes promptly. This experiment lias been tried out and
has proved successful for three years. It
will be abandoned when conditions in that
territory seem to be wholly normal. It is
not considered that normal conditions yet
exist, althougl the abnormal conditions
that prevailed a year ago have very rnuch
improved. It is therefore desirable that
the control should be continued for a limited period.

belong to the One Big Union on the Canadian aide receive their orders froin headquarters in the United States?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable

and one which it ia perhaps difficult to
answer. The One Big Union is an organization that supposedly sprang into existence

Coal ares.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I agree with the honourable member from Ottawa (Hon. M-Nr.
Belcourt) that there is a good deal of doubt
about the jurisdictien or the power o! Parliament to pass this Bull. I have net the
Bill before me; I have only heard the statement o! the Minister of Labour. I think it
is -highly desirable that this question o! constitutionalîty should be threshed out before
the Bill is given its second reading. The
question of constitutionality is one that
ought to ha discussed before the Bill goes
into Committee. What the Government did
by Order in Council a few years ago, o!
course, does not throw any light at ail upon
the position of things to-day'. In England
the war is stili on, because an Act wvas
passed providing that the war fhould, not be
over until there was a proclamation saving that it was over; but here the war is
certainly over, because the Peace Treaty
bas been ratified and there bas been an
exchan-ga of ratifications. So far as we are
concerned, t.here is no war. If there is jurisdiction to legislate on this subject it is
not by virtue of the War Measures Act; it
would have to be under the British North
Amarica Act. It seemas to me that this Bill
would corne into confiict with section e2 of
the British North Amaerica Act. Coal coinpanies are in practically the samne position
as electric railway celupanies and as factories for that matter. Just where the jurisdiction lies I do not know, and at the
moment I arn not offering any opinion. I
think the question miust be thrashed out,
and I wouid suggest to the honourable the
Minister of Labour that, having explained
the Bill and enabled the House to see what
bis point is. hie should ]et its stand until
after the adjourniment. There will be no
time lost. The right stage at which to raisa
this question o! constitutionality is at the
second reading. If the Bill passed the
second raading and the question of couatitutionaiity had to come up in Committea,
that would not haly mattars at ahl.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 liave great
respect for the opinion of the hionourabie
member for Middleton in legai miatters; but
with ail due regard to his remarks, rnay I
ask why it is necessary for this House ev'en
to stop to question our jurisdicti.on at this
time? There is a public service to be performed. This measure has been in effect.
If this Bill is not constitutional, then the
Industrial Disputes Act itself is not, and
that Act has flot been questioned by the
provinces in the thirteen years that it bas
been ini force. The province of Alberta in
this case, througb one of its governiment
officiais who was here within the last two
weeks, bas urged that we pass iegislation
to continue this control. I think i would
be most unwise at this time and under
these circumstances to raise the question
o! jurisdiction, because it is not important
and nobody is objectîng on that ground.
If on some other occasion honourable gentlemen deem it desirable that the question
should be carefully sifted I have no objection; but 1 hope that this House ivili not
hold up a necessary ineasure-for it is
necessary, even though it is oniy temporary-designed for the purpose of maintaining stable conditions in a very important
industry upon the output of whieh hundreds o! thousands of our people are dependent for their coal from day to day during the severe winter season. We ought
not to Jet a question of that sort interfere
with our doing what is necessary under the
circumstances to meet the situation.
Hon. Mr. ROOHE: I would like to ask
There is

a struggle between the operators and the
miners. I imagine that if the Controller
fixed a price at which the article would be
,soid, that embraced the elernents of labour,
operating charges, and ail that. I would
ask the minister if bie remembers what the
Controller allowed as the ground price of
the coal? What would there be for the
owner o! the rmine after the charges were
paid, and what wouid be ailowed to Iirin a.,
pr6fit on his commodity? Was there any
allotiment o! that kind?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have flot at
hand the information for which mny honourable friend asks; but in 1917. wben tlie1 control began, the existing price of coal and the
existing wages were tak-en as a basis, and
as the controller from time to timne authorized an increase in wages by reason cof the
increased cost of living-which by the way
was the basis u-pon which the increased
wages were calculated-he granted an increase in the selling price of coal, sufficient

It bas prevented unjust criticism frein being levelled at or directed against the ernployers, the ceai operatore, because the

and feit that hie did net grant or permit

te ail parties interested.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: How much was left

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, two or three weeks ago a Bill te
amend the Inxnig.ràtion Act was brought
up in this House for its second reading.
The honourable member from Hamilton
<Hon.* Mr. Lynch-Staunton) moved in
amendment that the Bill be not read a
second trime, but that it be postponed for six
months. Some discussion took -place, and,
the day being a Friday, there vas not a
very large attendanoe in the House; consequently I moved the adjournment of the
debate in order that the rnat.ter might -have
the consideration ithat it undoubtedly deserves, and that it might net be deait
with too hastily. I think it but fair to say
that I believe the honourable gentleman
from Hamilton was not fully aware of- al
the facts bearing, upen the question, else he
might not have submittgd bis, emendment.
Briefly, the facts are these. In June, 1919,
some serious industrial disturbance occurred in the city of Winnipeg, and it was apparent that certain 'men wiere conducting
themselves in a way that was 'probably not
lawful, -and were guilty of seditiaus acts
and utterances. But there was at that time
no provision in the Criminal Code of Canada to enable the courts or -the Government
to adequately cope with crimes of that sort.
Therefore Parliainent in ita wiadom passed
certain amendments te the Immigration
Act. Honourable gentlemen may recal
that that measure was not discussed at any
great lengt.h; in fact, I think it passed
through both Houses in one day. I have
no hesitation in saying that I believe that
at that trime that particular piece of legislation was necessary and desirable in order
that steps might 'be taken, should occasion arise, te protect the interests of our
people, and te guard against and adequately deal with residents of Canada who might
be guilty of seditious acts whioh could net
be tolerated. Had the amendments which
were made to the Crimninal Code at
the subsequent Session, and whi.ch are
in effect to-day, been in force, it
would net have been necessary
te

has now passed away, and the necessity
for the continuation of what I regard as
very drastie legisiation no longer exists.
The provisions cf the Criminal Code are
ample te ineet the requirements, and the
S-27

417

Goevernment and the Parliament of Canaod,
are being severely criticised by the publie
at large, and, as henourable gentlemen
know, by a large and ànfluential press,
claiming that the legisiation which R have
referred to, and which. it le now proposed
to amend or repeal, ought flot te have been
passed because it was contrary te British
customs snd British institutions, and what
we ordinarily term British liberty.
Mhay I point out that the amendinents to
the I[mmigration .Act, as 4hey now stand,
make it possible to depert from, Canada a
British subject who may have been resident
in Canada nearly ai his life 'wàthout giving
hlm a trial by a jury of his peers. Such
procedure, honourable gentlemen, is absolutely contrary te the spirit of the British
constitution, and te thst greut bill of rights,
the Magna Oharta, upon which it in
founded, and 1I arn sure that there is ne
desire un the part of honourable gentlemen
te put the Parliament of Canada in the
position cf resorting te or Teturning to ai
high-handed method of dealing out justico
such as existed prier te 1215.
Hon. [Mr. SHARPE: Miglit I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Under
the law as il stands ai present, would it be
possible te deport the men who are now in
jail in Manitoba for the disturbances thoy
caused a year agoP
Hon. Mr. ]ROBERTSON: I feel quite incompeteni te give a legal opinion on the
question; but my own view is that, by
reason cf the faci ihat those men werc
taken into custody .and were given a fair
trial before a jury of their peers, and were
found guilty and convicted and sentenced
and are now serving their ternis of punishment, when they shaîl have paid the
penalty impesed upon themn by the court
they will net "be liable to any further punishment. I do net think that a man can
be tried twice for the same offence, or can
he tried a second time afier he has been
convioted and has paid the penalty imposed on hlm. That may be only a layman's view, and it is net my intention te
express an -opinion from the legal standpeint.
There are iwo clauses of the amendnient
proposed te the Immigration Act. Onc proposes that a British subjeci, after he bas
resided in Canada for five years, cannot be
deported without being given a trial for
the offence with which he is charged. The
second arnendment proposes thot the clause
which. was added'te 1lhe Act st year, whereby it was possible I0 accuse a man of taie

mote peace, order, and good government,
and that failure to pass it would have the
contrary effeet. I therefore hope that this
House xnay see fit not to support the
amendment presented by the honourable
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton).
Hon. Mr. BRADBtTRY: Before the honourable gentleman sits down, will be permit me a question? The honourable gentleman has at different times to-day and
'when he was speaking previously stated
that the legisl.tion was not British. Does
nlot the honourable gentleman know that
during the war there were dozena of Canadian citizens wbho hadl gone over to London
and 'were deported from. London without
any trial?
Hon. *Mr. ROBERTSON: I ari very
well aware that that is the fact. The Immigration Act as it is proposed to arnend
it would give Canada a similar right ta deport any British subject who cornes Io
Canada and does flot beheve himaself, if
he has nlot been here for more than five
years; and I do not know thet any Canadian citizen wio had been residing in England for more than five years ivas deported
without a trial.
Hon. Mr DANIEL: I would like ta
ask the minister ta make clear a point
that puzzles nie a little. There are two
provisos. One, which it is proposed ta repeal by this Bill, rends in this way:
Provided that this section shall not apply ta
any person who le a British subject, elther by
reaýon of b1rth I Canada or by reason of natu.ralization In Canada.

It appears to me that that provision
exempts -Canadian ýcitizens, while the proviso we are now asked te aýpprove simply
gays :
Provided that this section shall not apply te
any persan who is a Canadian citizen.
A man is a
What is the difference?
Canadian citizen either by birth or by naturalization, and it appears ta me that the

old Act was just about the sarne in this
respect as the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Without going
carefully into that, my opinion is thet the
Act as it now stands permits the deportatien of a British subject who is net a Canadian citizen, no matter how long he may

have been resider.t in this country. The
proposed arnendment 'would make it passible ta deport a British subject who bas
S-271

41U

flot been in Cnnada long enougah to obtain
domicile, which under the Naturalization
and Immigration Acts, is a period of five
years.
Heon. Mr. DANIEL. It will not affect
Canadian cîtizensv
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.- No, it will not
affect Canadian citizens.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Would the honourable gentleman permit me a question?
Was the Immigration Act which 'we passed
last Session necessaryP If it was necessary, why change it? Are the sarne conditions nlot liable to arise again'
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

No.

tHon. 'Mr. MURPHY: They are not?
Well, I mistake the signa of the times. I
wish te differ with the minister. I believe that those conditions are possible at
any time, and if the Act was necessary
last year it is still necessary to have it
maintained.
My reason,
-Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
honourable gentlemen, for expressing the
view that the saine conditions could nlot
arise again is that the Criminel Code itself haî been se emended since this legislation wes passed as ta meet &Ulnecessary
requirements and al emergencies.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Would the minister state in what manner'the Criminal
Code was amended so as te meet snch conditions? I arn not -aware of any legislation having been passed that would. meet
conditions euch as occurred in the Winnipeg strike, when we had to peas special
legisiation te enable us to cèpe with it;
and the minister was on the ground et thet
time, and was one of the strongest supporters of thet legislation.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Could the minister tell us how many men were deported
under the Act as it stands st present, since
At was passed?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn not in
possession of that information, but I do
know that a substantial number were deported, most of whom were not British

if I may be pardoned for m.aking a further

I would suggest that it is fair and right
that we should view the situation from

viewpoint ta take an this question-that
we should respect the rights of other people
if we hope ta have cur awn respected.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFE: I intend ta vote
for the amendinent ta give this Bill the

a few minutes my reason for doing sa. I
believe that the Minister of 'Immigration
should 'be vested with authority ta depart

trying fto set aside praper governwent and
by putting the country ta enormaus expense, he should be deported. I have seen
it stated that the Winrnipeg trial wouid cost
far more than $1,000,000. There are -men
who would behave in that way if the country had to provide a million dollars ta
prasecute .them; and, on the other hand, il
they knew that they were Hiable ta be deported for canducting them -selves in that
manner, ,they would hesitate very mucb.
The present legislation, if it is allowed ta
remain as it naw stands, v.ould be in my
judgnient the best possible deterrent for
such mnen, because if there is anything t-hey
abject ta it is ta be sent back ta their own
country, where they wauld be cast into jail
ai onte il they started one half the trouble
they have caused in this country. I am not
as a rule in favour o! high-handed measures; bit I have net the sligahtest fear that
any man in Canada *wha would attain to
the Position o! MiniGter of Immigration
would be likely ýta deport a persan 'without

to override law and order, there are -worse

Hon. GEO. H. BRADBURY- 'Honourable
gentlemen, I regret very -much that the
member for Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) is flot here. I do not agree with
the honourable gentleman who introduced
this Bill *<Han. Mr. Roïbertson> Vhat il the
honourable genitleman from, Hamilton had
known ail the factEs he would flot have
taken the action he did. 1 discussed this
matter pretty fully with the honourable

thoroughly avare o! what would be the

It
very important piece of legisiatiori.
lookis ta be quite an innocent littie Bill,
but it -will have a very lar-reaching effeet
if this honourable boKdy i.s led ta endorse
it.
In the first place, what is the clause of
the Immigration A-et that is being amended?
I wil1 read ta you a part of clause 41 of'
chapter 26 of the Immigration Act, which,
I may say, was rushed through this House
very hurriedly:
41. (1) Every person who by word or act In
Canada seeks to overthrow by force or violence
the Government or or constituted law and authority in the United Kingdomn of Great Britain
and Ireland, or Canada, or any of the provinces
of Canada, or the Government of any other of
His Majesty's dominions, colonies, possessions
or dependencies, or advocates the assassination
of any officiai of any of the sald Governments
or of any foreign Government or who in Canada detends or suggests the unlawful destruction of property or by word or act creates or
attemnpts to create any riot or public disorder
In Canada, or who, without lawful authority assumnes any powers of governmnent In Canada, or
In any part thereof. or who by common repute
belongs to or ls suspected of belonging ta any
secret society or organization which extorts
money trom or In any way attempts to control
any resident of Canada by force or by threat of
bodlly harm, or by blackmail, or who ls a mermber of or affihiated with any organization entertaining or teaching disbelief In or opposition to
organized government shall, for the purposes of
this Act, be deemned ta belong ta the prohibited
or undesirable classes, and shahl be hiable to

MAY 27, 1920
deportation in the rnanner provided by this Act,
and it shaîl be the duty of any oflicer becoraing
cognizant thereof and of the clerk, secretary or
other official of any mnunicipality In Canada
wherein any such persan may be, forthwith to
send a written camplaint ta the minister, glving
full particulars: Provlded, that this section shal
nat apply ta any persan who la a British subJect. either by reason of birth Ini Canada. or by
reason of naturalization in Canada.

Honoursbla gentleman, 'what does that
mean? Under section 41, the Minister of
Immigration can deport sny rasidant af
Canada who is not a Canadian citizen by
birth or by naturalization and 'who is
praven guilty ot any of the acts mantioned
in the section just quoted. This is the
present law. Il we adopt the anending
Bill proposed by the Minister of Labour,
we cannot deport a man, no matter 110'w
great a menace ha may ba ta law and order
in Canada, unless ha is an alien. In other
wordsHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If xny hanourable friand will permit me. I desira to point
out ta hini that that is not quite correct;
that it is possible ta deport sny British
subi ct who bas not been a residant here
for a .period of five years, being the time
required ta obtain domicile.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: 1 understand
that; 1 understand ithat Versons twho have
been in thea country Ior less than five years
may ha deported. A Red agitator who is
British and ha-- residence in Canada for
five years may carry on a campaign among
our citizans calculated ta overthrow the
Governuxant of this country; or he may be
t.he cause -of nocts and bloodshed and the
destruction of .praperty; he .may be guilty
af all the acts set out in &ection 41 of the
Immigration Act; still, if we pass the proposed amendmnent, we cannot deport that
man.

it 'will Ibe rernemrbered th-at hast session,
atter an atternpt had been Rnade in this
House ta pass legislation that -would hava
givan the Governxnent power ta deport persans rwho were a menace ta the Stata, and
alter this House had rafused ta endorse
such legislation, the Government itselif put
through a Bill ta amend the Immnigration
Act, and then realized, at the alevanth
hour, that they did net have power ta control the Red element, in Canada, and that
in order ta obtain that power it vwas necessary ta bring down another Bill, çwhieh
my honourable friand (Hon. Mr. Rabertson) is now desiraus of amending. .The
Bill was passed hy the Hause of Cornions
aitar an explanatian by the Minister of
1mmigration. It vwas given the first, second

421

and third readings in just ten minutes.
This shows, honouraible gentlemen, how
important the Government at that time
considered t.his legisiation to be, and .hoiv
well it succeeded in i.mpressing upon the
Flouse of Co'rnrons the importance of it.
The Bill was rushe-d over to this.Chamber
and passed in like mnner, in just seven
and a -hall minutes, even in face at the tact
that the House just the day before had refused to endorse similar legislatian 'whieh
I had the honour to inove. My honaurable
friend says the Bill vas an emergency
measure. Perhaps it vas, but it vas legislation that iwas then deemed necessary in
the best interests of the country, and I amn
one of those who comtend that the conditions
in Canada have nat changed sufficiently
to warrant the Govern*ment in destroying
the power which, they ncw tcvld.
As I said a nmoment ago, this House endorsed that legisiatian. It vwas late; it
ought ta have endarsed such legisiation
betore, when it had an opportunity of endorsing a measure which. had been 'brought
in by one of its members. Hawever, it was
better late than neyer, and the Senate justified itselt ini approving of the legisiation
that was sent over from the Courions.
What I have said ratais to clause one
of thue Bill. Naw -let us -cansider clause 2.
We inay find, honourable gentlemen, that
this apparently innocent Bill, like some dangerous reptile, has its eting in the tail. 1
think you will find that one of the greatest
objections to the Bill is to ha found in
this véry innocent-looking lîne comprising
clause 2:
Subsection 2 of the gald section forty-One 18

hereby repealed.

Let me read the subseetion 'which it la
prôposed by the Bill ta repeal:
41. <2) Proof that any person belonging to
or was within the description of any of the
prohibited or undesirable classes within the
mneaning of this section at any time since the
fourth day of May, ane thousand nine hundred
and ten. shall, for ail the purposes of this Act,
be deemaed to establish prima jacie that he still
belongs to such prohibited or undesirable clais
or classes.

If we repeal this suibsection as suggested,
we practically say ta the red. element of
Canada: "Agitate; creake all the trouble
you lika; destroy property, cause loss of lits;
the Governanent will nat deport you." That
is practically what we say if we accept thue
suggestion ma-de by the honourable the
Minister of Labour. I ask, hoiurable gentlemen, would fluet 'ha a vise tluing for this
House ta do?

422

SENATE

Every honourable gentleman will, I arn
sure, recognize that this subsection entails
absoluteiy no 'hardship on any reputabie
citizen of Canada. On the other hand, it is
a protection to ail good citizens, and it enables the G'overnment to enferce iaw and
order throughout the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Would the honeurable gentleman allow me a question? Suppose t.hat a year eiapsed aiter a. man had
been deported, and that the minister found
that the information upon 'which. he had
deported the -man was absoluteiy false--that
the depertation had'been hrought about by
ill-wil, or something of that kind. Who
would make amends to the man for baving
been deported without a trial?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: 0f course, that is
straining the point a great deai; that is a
case that is not likely to, occur, for the
reason that -the Minister of Immigration,
who, is responsibie for the deportation, will
not deport anybody 'without being absolutely sure that he deserves to bhe deported.
Does the prosent law in any way have an
injurious effect upon reputable citizens' I
think not. But it does affect and ho'd back
and check -the d-angerous Red elernent,
which has been very aggres-sive, and rwhich
has alpeady caused serious leds8 of life and
pro<perty in this contry. 1 think every
bonourabie gentleman -will admit that.
T¶his clause simply eaiys te 'the agitater 'who
is in the country to-day, aud who has aiready committed those aot.s, and bas -made
himself liable to deportation, that the Government has noV rtaken any action-, but that
it is possible that, i he cont.inues te commit acts of this kind, the -Governmenit wil1
use this clurb tha-t is hanging- over hi-s head
il inecesisary. I 'bel.ieve it is sahidtary legislation. Why sboulld -hs House 'be -se much
concerned over such charaoters as are
affected fby the present la-w? it does net
affect any repu-table labou~r man in Canada.
No Tespeétable labour ni-an in Canada bas

that is on o-ut statute 'books. t iis to proteet -the labour man -and the lives and the
property of himself and -his children against
a.-hators who h-ave corne into the counVry,
and who xnay do harru, and 'who have doue
harm, as vwas the case in the'city of WimiiPeg. This ia a «hig Atick, if you flike, that
the Governiment of Canada places in the
hands of tahe Mdnistier o-f Immigration Wo
hold orer tihe heads of undesirable character-s, which enables him te say te these
-men: "Behave yourselves, or Ithis stick

cause perhapa serious trouble in the country. Why, honourable gentlemen, it was
just a year ago that the legisiation which
we are now asked to repeal -was rushed
through both Houses as nec-essary leg-isiation.
My honourable friend the Mini-ster oi
Labour says that since that time the
Criminal Code has beeu arnended in euch
a way that this legislation i-s net necessary.
Every honourable gentleman lvuows 4hat
while the Crimnal Code has been amnended,
a mnu canndt be deported under the
Criminal Code. He can ha puoeeded

there you niake inaietyra ai theni, and
forth'with thbe labour organizationis ot
the country proceed ta petition the Government to release them. You place the labour
organizations in an awkward position. We
should go slowly in amending important
legisiation like thic. I submit that if the
Bill was a necessity a year ago, when it was
put through un a very few moments, it is
just as neessary ta-day. We have t-be saine
elemeint stilliun Canada. It may be sleeping but it is here, and the Government bas
evidence -against dozens of mnen who would
corne within the mean.ing cd clause 2 of this
Bill. That is a faot that is known ta
everybody who knows anytbing about what
the Government bas been doing. I say that
tihis is s.alutary legislation. It is a splendid
thing for the law ta have a *club which it
can -hold over the bead of evil-doers, and I
trust that -this body will not endorse the Bill
before the House, but will rather vote for
the six months' hoist moved by the honour-able gentleman fram Hamilton.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, we who are dexnocrats ta the hilt,
sprung from the tallers anîd workers and
farmers of the land, are very apt, perhaps,
ta be carrîed away by oui syrnpathy for the
labouring maqn, and, if we ala<v that to take
too great a hold upon us, we may support a
measure that will not be ta the best advantage of the people of Canada. To my
mind there is one tbing that is higher and
more sacred than anything else, and that, is
the safety of the 6tate. Il the safety af the
state ia iniperilled, thon it ia t>he duty of
aIl persans to stand by the State. To rny
mmnd there are elemenuts in Canada w-ho are
endangering the safety of the State, and it
might be our bounden du-ty to support legislation that would allow those who bave the
administration of affairs' for the time be-ing
ta take summary action.
The Minister of Labour, in the very able
address which he delivered in support ai
his Bill, stated that the rights wbich he was
seeking ta accord ta these men were like the
rights that were sought for the people under
the Magna Charta. Now, lot us think for a
manient why Magna, Charta was obtained,
and the circumstances surrounding the agitation which brought about the granting of
the Magna Charta. by King Jolhn. T-he
Magnta Charta was granted because the
barons were being oppres'sed by t-be Kinig.
King John was ma.king exactions upon the
barons and the people thaît were so obnoxious, so unfair, that the people rose up snd
dernanded 1roim the King that they be
granted the righlt of trial by their peers.

Thlev haàd ]-)(en t.brown into prison, they
had'been taxed and penaâlzed, and had no
recoiirse. They were not given an opportunity of s'tating their side ad 'the case; but
.the King, wbo is all-ipowerful, took the
inatter juta bis own hands, and was exacting tribute or punishing or penalizing
thern to suoch an extent t.hat they could
stand these wrongs no longer, and rose up
denianding certain privileges, which were
gran.ted at t.he point of the bayonet, sa ta
speak, and which have ever since been the
right of British subjects.
What is the situation to-day compared
with the situation then? The situation today, as 1 understand it, is that certain elements in lihis country, as well as in other
countries, are in exactly fthe came position
that King John was in at the tirne the
Magna Charta was demanded. and obtained.
Thaut is to say, 4tbere are certain agit-ators
in Canada and in other countries who are
using the miost .powerful weapons ihat can
be used ta exact froan the people st large
concessions ta which t-bey are not justly entitled. I do not say for a marnent that the
labour people are noît entitled to use the
strike weapon within resaniable bounds;
but when they go to the extent oi plotting
and agitating for the overthrow af established authority, when they go ta the extent of ad-opting a progia.înme ta put aside
ail liawful governiment in this country, then
they are u.sing t-bat weapon in a -way calculated ta do injustice to the bulk of the
people, and ta exact f rom thean a tribute
ta which .they have no right, nat even ta as
.great an extent as had King John to the
.tribute which he was exacting. T-ake
the situaition as it exirgted in Winnipeg.
(Men plotted there 'for the overthrow of
constitutional authorit.y. There is no question about that: that cannot <be denied. 8o
bad was the situation in that respect that
perhaps for the first time in this country
citizens of ail clac-ses banded thenvisMves
together to oppose to the very lirait the
onslaught of the extremists who were nc.t
only threatening the lives and the property of the people, but were threatening
to overthrow lawful constituted authority.
Now, does it *not aeemn right that some
power e.hould be placed in the bands of the
governing authorities whereby they -nay
take speedy action in case of an tmejýrgency
-in case mxen appear ix any comminUt3' inl
Canada and begin an agitation which
rnight cause grievous injury to the wliole
country, which might bring dec-th and destruction in its wake? la it not fair that
sorne person in authority ehould have in~

SENATE
their band6 the power of taking action
which would relieve the country speedily
cdfthis menace? You taill of trying iliese
men. What happened a' the trials whicli
took place in Winnipeg? These men wlio
were tried, able men, eloquent nipn, men
who knew how to appeal ta a jury, who
knew how to appeal to a imob-or to
the multitude, if you like-in many cases
deiended. thernselvee, and they were given
the very best opportunity that could be
necorded to any one ta disserninate. t.hroughout this country frorn on-e end ta the other,
by means ai their addresses ta the jury
and their questians to witne&ses, ideas and
doctrines of the imost revalutionary kind.
Il you are going ta try these men, you are
simply gaing ta aid themI ifn the disserninatien and distribution ai the doctrines
which they advacate, anid which. everybody
rnust acknowledge are not such as any ai
us bere, or any citizen af Canada warthy
oif the name, could subacribe to. I far niy
part will always stand *up ta the very utrnast far the rights of the labouring man,
for the rights ai the warker who is one ai
the producers of weal-th. in this country;
but I think it is nlot in the interest ai the
hanest labouring mnan ai Canada, the labauring man who bas the wfliare ai the
country at heart, ta allow the seeds af
revalution and anarchy ta be sawn axnong
bis class. The 'best interests ai the labaur
mena of this country will be served -by sustaining in Canada the established forin af
Governrnent in such a way that when righte
are taken away fram any one they can be
given. back Iby the praper authorities. The
labour man and the agitatar have no mare
rights in this country than t.he ordinary
citizen, and if tbey are gaing ta -use the

threatened in the city cdf Winnipeg, In order
ta remave lawiul authority and ta obtain
conces&ians ta which they are nlot entîtled,
then I thin< it is time &oar us ta stand by
the law on aur 6tatute books, which will
aid in their speedy removal iramn aur midst.
The fact that people imake ,claimns and
strike daes not for one moment rnean that
the dlaims are just. When labour nien
hold up the commrunity and deprive theni
of food and fuel and other necessaries ai
life, t1ney are the judges. The people generally dkb not previously pass juckrnent
upon their dlaime. The men try their own
case; they decide in their own faveur, and
they strike ta obtain concessions and privileges which the bulk cd the cammunity
niay believe they are nat entitled ta ohtain. Thur, it is that the strike weapon is

a more powerful w-capon than lias ever
been used before in this country. It is sa
poweriul that, if i~twere used ta the extent
that bas been threatened on more than
one occasion, the whole commerce ai the
country could be destroyed, public utilities could be destrayed, 4nd people could
be deprived af the abeolute necessities ai
lufe; death and destruction could be caused
upan every hand. I have no fear that the
honest labouring man oi Canada who seeks
ta -better his position is gaing ta bring,
about any such condition in the country.
1 have absolute laith in him.
He bas been tried, and tried bard, on many
an occasion in the past, and he bas always
shown himseli a true Britisher and a true
Canadian. But I have fear that agitatars
who corne arnongst us tram. abroad rnay saw
the seeds of rebellion and anarchy in aur
midst and may do irretrievable injury, not
only ta the country at large, but ta the
labour people of Canada an particular.
Therefore when I say that I arn gaing ta
support this amendment I do so only in the
interest af the people ai Canada, nlot only
in the intere-st of stalbility of goverrnent
in this country, but, as I honestly believe,
in the interest of the loyal, honest labouring men ai Canada as well.
Han. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I propose'in a very few words ta
state why 1 arn not going ta vote for the
amendment maved by the honourable
gentleman irom Hamilton. I mnust say that
it is after considerable hesitation that I
hesitabave came ta that conclusion. M-Ny
tian bas been due ta tw-io or three considerations. First af aIl, my dislike, my
fear, of the foreign agitator, especially the
international agaitatar-t-he man who carnies
on the nefariaus business of labour agfitating, sometimes in Canada, sometimes in the
United States, and sometimes in Europe. I
hesitate also because ai the tendency which
it seems ta me is toa much in evidence
nowadays in Canada, that of pandering Io,
and endeavauring ta meet all t.he wishes af,
the labour men in thîs country. Some of
them are very unreasonable and impracticable. Another reason whieh causes me ta
hesitate is rny profound dislike of rnost of
the war legislation, especially the war Orders in C.auncil, such as are by this Aet
continued indefinitely.
Notwithstanding these considerations, I
feel that it would 'be unwise and illogical
for us ta deport without trial rnen who
'have (been given citizenship .in Canada. I
think it is dangerous ta confer upon ouie

MAY 27, 1920
mnan, even a Minister of the Cro'wn, the
power to deport, without triai, without any
investig-ation exoept such as lie may carry
on by and through his subordinate
officers, a man to whom Canada ha@ given
the right o! Canadian citizenshiýp. I think
it je inzproper to empower a xninister of
the Crown to undo that wvhich the Government of the country bas done. When we
grant a certificate of naturalization, giving
to a man who bas iived here the -requisite
iength of time and has complied 'with the
law, the right to call himsell and to be
treated by affhers as a Canadi-an citizen, I
do nlot thinc it ia aomething which we cen
revoke. It ia something which ia given, not
for a year or two, but permanentiy. Deportation wouid be, to ail intenta and purposes, a compiete canceilation o! the certificate of niaturalization by which one who,
having complied with the law, becomea a
Canadien citizen.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: You cannot deport a Canadian- citizen, if I underatand the
Act aright.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; I do net say
that. I say that for that very reeson wve
should not deport one ivho bas become a
Canadien citizen. Not only should a -Cenadieu citizen .by :birth not be'deported, but
yon ehould nlot deport the man 'whom you
have made a Canadian citizen bay naturelizetion.
Hon. Mr'. BR.ADBURY: Under the Act
you cannot deport him either.
Hon. -Mr. BELCOURT. You cen do it
under the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: No, you cannot.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: You cannot deport a Canadian citizen either by netural-ization or 'by birth.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But doea not
the Britiah subject acquire Canadian citizenship by five years' domicile or reaidence
in Canada? If he does, je this not equivalent to giv.ing the alien bis naturehization
papers?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That ie the position I take. My position je that 'by reaiding in this country for five years a Britieher
becomes a Canadien citizen entitied to the
rights and privileges enjoyed by all other
Canadiana, whethier born or naturalized.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: He would' under
the amendment, nlot under the present Act.

without having to go through any formality
at ail.
J[ do flot want to make a speech. 1 desire oniy to state as briefly -as I eau the
reasons why J[ think we should support
this Mill. 1 contend that, having conferred
Canadian citizenship upon a person born
in the British Ilies who. has reaided in
this country for five yeara, we shouid not
transier to any one man, even a Minister
of the Crown, the right to take away that
which the lo.w hae granted. It is nlot in
the intereat of the future of this country,
nlot in the interest of the colonization and
developiment of Canada. 'It might deter a
great many peraone from coming here. We
shouid neot put any obstacles in the way o f
proper immigration to thia country.Some honourable gentlemen have 'waxed
eloquent over the great dangera with which
the Caniadian labourer bas to contend because of agitators coming here and trying

Honourable
Hon. J. J. -DON NELLY:
gentlemen, J did not have the privilege of
hearing the discussion 'when this Bill was
before the <Jhamber on a prev'icus occasion;
but, after listening to the explanation 'wWh
has beezr given to-day by the Mànister of
Labour, I arn disposed to be in sympathy
with the principle of the Bill. 1I cannot
agree with the argument put forward by the
honourable member -for Selkirk (Hon. Mr.
Bradbury), that, heeause the Bill that was
passed a yeaî ago reeeived only about ten
ninutes consideration in the 'House of Gommons and seven minutes consideration in
the Senate, it should not be amended or
altered at present. 1 arn rather disposed te
think that that is a good argument 'why
some consideration should be given to it
at the present time, and rwhy there mnight
be strong reasons for amending it. Nor can
I agree with tihe honourable member f rom
Selkirk in bis argument that if we pa.ss
this Bill we strengthen the -position of thre
Ried agita:tor. My belief is that you etrengthen the Red agitator if you give lum a
grievance, and the Bill paaised in 1919 did
give him a grievance and placed him in a
position te stir up trouble; made him mu4jh
stronger over the people whom he wais
ende.avoring to control. I think -that to,
remeve .that grievance will be a step in the
right direction, and that, I believe, is the
object of the Bill.
My main reasen, though, for desiring to
support the Bill, is that I understand froin
the minister that under it no British subject 'will be depcrted without being given
a f air trial. tI believe that is a principle
which shouid be supported by thir, House.
Thre honourable member from Selkirk mentioned the cost of the trial in Winnipeg. If
we were gtrided entirely by thre question cf
cost in giving a fair trial to all those who
corne before the courts-tif we carried that
argument te its logical conclusion, 'we would
adopt lynch law in this country, hecairse
it would be -a great eaving of expense te thre
country if 'we lynched those who were guilty
of murder, instead of giving tihem a fair
trial. Il believe in the pr:incý.ple of a fair
trial, and I think that is the main principle

MAY 27, 1920
involved in the measure. For that reason
I propose to support the Bill.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: ILarn not very clear
wîÎth regard to the Bill introduced by the
honourable the Minister of Labour. I understand At to be an amendment to the tImmigration .Act, ýproviding tthat if a British subject stays in thuis country for five years the
Act shail not apply to him. I would like
to ask the honourable the Minister of Labour if 'lie -is in tavour of the Aet with that
amend ment?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In aniswer to
the honourable gentleman's question, -I shall
bave to make an observation. Il do not
think lie 'bas quite astated the case. There
is nothing to prevent. tbe British subject.
after being given a tri-al, from bein-g deported, if it is decided that 'lie Eohould be;
but after lie bas resided liere five years and
under tbe Naturalization Act *has gained
Canadian eitizenship, hie cannot and ouglit
not to be deported without a trial.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But are you in
favour of leaving the Acet on the statute
bâok witb the amendment that you no1w
propose?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.- les.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Then I thiink the
remarks of the honourable minister, from
a logical point of view, entirely failed. Il
it is proper to expedite the deportation of
a man from Canada because lie is dangerous,
it is just as important to do so after five
vears as it is after four.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But hie should
be proven guîlty.
Hon. Mr. M.cMEANS: I understand the
Minister o! Labour to say further that
there is no necessity at ail for the Act.
because the arnendments to the Crirninal
Code cover aîl the features that are necessary. If the Minister of Labour would bringc
in a Bill repealing that Act entirely, so that
we cou]d discuss this matter on some question of principle, I would bie prepared to
meet him hahf-way. But here is an Act 4ihat
lie placed upon the statute book last year,
and lie cornes tliis year and says, -I want
it changed so that if a man has been in thie
country for five years the Act shall not
apply to, him."» Honourable gentlemen,
there is somnething wrong about that princîple. If the Adt is a proper on,- for Canada, it ouglit te be aupplîed to an imimnigranit wliether lie bas been in this country'
for four, or five, or six years. Either tlie
principle of the *Act tis correct, or it is

421

wrong. I can speak about this matter froin
a disinterested point of view, because, RL
arn proud to say, I arn Canadian-born and
amn quite free fromn the effects of that Act.
But isqppose -the Reds should get into power
and thaît Act were on the statute bookc.
There are rnany on this -side of the 'House
and sorne honourable gentlemen on the
ot.her side who might be railroaded out of
the country. ¶Phere is that danger about it.
Hlon. Mr. CROSBY: Better fix it.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: But I would lil<e
to get at the principle of this thing. If
the Act is proper in princi-ple, this proposed amendment is not, and if the Act
is flot proper in principle any amendhnent
will flot cure the defeet.
Hon. P. POIRIER: -Honourable gentlemen, 1 did flot corne prepared to make a
speech nor do I intend. to make one, but I
crave permission to be a.Ilowed to sumirnarThere
ize this Bi1l as 1 understand it
was, -as everybody knows, a world war.
During the war we had recourse to ernergency legislation, as did other counitries.
In some countries it was even necessary
to adopt martial laws. Now that the war
is over, why should we continue ta live
under what I might eall an autocratie
régime, such as -we willingly accepted
during the war? A great -principle is involved in the question before the Senaite

to-day:
f ree mnan or ncyt? If the Bill does not carry,
we go back to the tixne of Magna Charta,
and to King John Lackland, to whom reference was made by zny honourable friend
from Antigonish (Hon. Mr. Girroir). At
thalt tirne the authorities could take it upon
themselves to cast a -man into j-ail, or into
the Tower of London, to rob him and to
deprive him of bis life, without a trial by
bis peers. We have corne througb revolutions and bloodshed to the state of freedom
which prevails in .the British Empire. Are
we going to go back to King John?
Sorne eHon. SENAT ORS: No. no.
Hon. Mr. POJiRIER.: We are, if we do
not wipe this legislation off our statute

Bastile was razed: there is a man who may

To me the enorrnity of that situation ire
appalling, and 1 arn éurprised et any honourable gentlemnan standing for the continuation of a state of things which was
unfortunately made necessary by the war.
Let us return to normal conditions: let us
refer differences to our courts. I believe
in our courts: they represent a high state
of civilization. But if you give power to a
minister, or to the Government, or to the
GoverAor, or to the King, to deport a Cariadian citizen without trial, 1 say, honourable gentlemen, you are going back to the

Hon. Mr. :BENNET: I should like to
ask the minister a question. In the case
of depertations last year, were the proceedings ex parte, or how were they conducted ?
'Hon. Mr. ROBERTISON: In answer to
niy honourable f riend's inquiry, if I remember correctly, the provisions of the
Irnmigi-ation Act touching that point provided that officiaIs of the Immigration Departrnent-4 thïnk either two or three officiale-had juriediction to make an inquiry
and advise the minister as to whether or
not deportation should take place. ýThe
rninister acted upon their recommandation, unless ha had doubts as to the correctne-s of the recommendation. .The men
accused did not have the opportunity of e
trial by jury before beîng deported. The
suggestion ie, as the honourable gentleman
fromt Acadie <tHon. Mr. Poirier) haa just
pointed out, that notwithstanding the
fact that after ifive years' resîdence in this
country, under the Naturalization Act, a
British-l>orn subject becornes a Canadian

citizen, he is, by the Immigration Act as
it now stands, deprived of the right of a
trial.
Then the man
Hon. Mr. BENN=TT
complained agaînst was flot even present.
'Hon. MIr. i'>OBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. BENiN=T: That is barbarous.
Honourable
Hon. GIEO. MoHUGH:
gentlem~en, 1 have listened with a good
deal of interest to the discussion of this
question and I must say, ffrom the statements of the honourable Minister of Labour, that I arn iully in sympathy with the
proposc u B iil. I listened to the address of
the honourable gentleman from Selkirk
(Hon. Mr. Bradbury), who wants the law
to remain as it stands, ao that it may be
held as a 'big stick over the heads, of the
people. The honourabla gentleman from
Antigoilish <Hon. Mr. Girroir), followed
eomewhat along the sae lina, and said
that in case any one was accused of sedition
or anything of that kind, it ehould be left
with Cie (Minister of Immigration to "say
whether or flot he should ha deported..
Hon. Mr. GIRLROIR: I do not think my
honourable friend is quite stating the case.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: When there is
cause for suspicion.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: My idea is that
in excaptional cases, when the safety of the
state is threatened, sorne one should have
authority to deport.
The state is
Hon. Mr. McHUGH:
better able to, taka cara of itself than the
individuel. The men in Winnipeg who
were accused were brought to trial, as I
think every person accused of a crime
should -be, but they were not ail convicted.
It would have been an injustice to the innocent if they .had al .been deported, without
a trial. I think tthe sooner legisiation is
passed under which a mari may retain his
freedomn until he is fairly convicted o! some
crime the better. I shall support the Bill.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, from the arguments used by the
Minister of! Labour in his speech this afternoon it did not semr to me that the honourable gentleman was going the right wsy
about attaining the desirad objeet. If it is
bis intention that these men should have
a trial before any action is taken, I do not
think this lagislation is going to accorplish
that intention. My chie! objection to the
legislation put through last year was that
it failed to provide that a man should be

MAY 27, 1920
given a hearing before action was taken.
As the minister exphiined a few minutes
ago, everything was left in the hands of
the officiais, who reported ta the Minister,
and then it was lef t ta the Minister to decide what should be done. The man
charied had no opportunity of beîng tried
bef ore hic peers. The Minister now cornes
down and proposes this amnendment, but
only in one certain direction. As I view
it, the arnendment sirnply makes provision
that a British subjeet, like xnyself, who
cornes ta Canada and lives here for five
years, cannot be deported; but the Britieh
subject who has not been here for five
years can be deported without any triai.
It se-ems to me that if it la good legislation
ta provide that a man who has been in
this country for five years should be given
a trial before he is deported, it wouid aleo
be good legisiation ta give the sanie right
ta a British subject who has been here for
only four years. I think it is the intention o! the Minister ta amend the Act in a
very different way from that which is provided for in the Bill.
As was said by the honourabile gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Mffleans),
if the Act is te be arnended now 1 think we
ought ta discnss the wboie, principle and
policy of the Act. In the first session of
1919 the Goyvernment considered that this
legisiation was necessary, and I for one do
not think that.conditionqs in the country
have altered very rnuch since that time.
1 do nlot altogether like this kind cd legisIation; but if the Governent, whi.ch is
responsible for the administration of the
affairs o.f the country, thought that it was
ne-cessary in the first Session o! last year.
I 'for one do not feel inclined ta vote for
the Bill, and shahl vote for the ainendment, because I do not think the Bill goes
far enough in one respect, and 1 think it
would be better that we shouid discuss the
whole question as a matter of policy on
another occasion.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Hononrabie gentlemen, 1 coincide in a great rnany of the
sentiments expressed by the hononrable
gentlemnan îvho bas just taken bis seat. It
is bareiy twelve months since the legiclation which we are now asked ta amend
was enacted. As bas already been said, it
wvas put throngh Parliarnent hurriedly as
an ernergency measure; and I cannot cee
that the circumstances which produced the
urgency at that time bave changed ta sncb
an extent that we rnight 110W safely repeal
that ]egislation.

I mnust say, honourable gentlemen, that
I was astonished. this afternoon at the great
amount of sympathy extended by sorne honourabie gentlemen who have spoken-symTpathy to whomP. To the rworst malefactors
this country bas ever seen; the very 'worst
class of people that have ever received the
hospitaiity of this country. What worse
character couid 'we receive into our midst
than a man who cornes bere for the express
puripose of sgitating and creating trouble
and trying te overthrow the Governrnent of
the counitry. The people for whomn sympathy has been expressed this afternoon
are described in the Act: how are they described? They are descrihed as "ad&vocates
of assassination." Are they people to whom
our 6ympathy shouid. go out this aiternoon?
Shouid we extend our sym.pathy ta any one
"<who advocates the assassination of any
officiai of any of the said Governanents, or
of any foreign Governments, or who in Canada defends ox sugg-ests the unlawful destruction of property?» Are these the kind
of people to 'whom -we shouid extend our
sympathyP People 'who corne here to humn
down and to destroy w.hat onr citizens have
for many years been trying te build upP
Such a thing doeà not appeal to me, honourable gentlemen. Shouid we--extend the
right hand of sympathy to any man "«who,
without iawf ni authority assumes any powers of govemrnent in Canada or in part
thereof.* or who by coenmon repute -belongs
ta or is susipected of belonging ta any
secret society or organization which extorts
money from or in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada by force or
by threat of bodiiy harm or 'by biackrnail?"
or things of that kind ta obtain action and
a position in this country that he is unable te obtain by legîtimate meansi' One
honourable gentleman has said: -Why, if
you do not pass this legisiation, you wili
give these people, these agitators, these
men who are attempting and advocating
the destruction *o! property and the assasJuat
sination of officiais, a grievance."
think of it: yon -wiil give theni a grievance.
A inurderer might jnst as weil say that you
give him a grievance by putting a section
in the Criminai Code pro.viding that if he
commits murder he must be hanged. Sncb
arguments do not appeai ta me in the slightest degree. The legisiation of iast year was
passed in gond faith as a matter of urgency
and eimergency, and ta rny mmid there la
no reasont in the rworld why it should be
snddenly repeaied and cnt off at the present
time. Personaiiy I arn opposed to both
sections of the Bill which is now before us,
and under the circumstances I feel obliged

SENATE

430

to vote for the ameudment of the honourable gentleman from Hamilton.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I had not proposed to say anything
iu connection 'with this ineasure, and I do
not know that I should now, only that the
leader of the Opposition bas expressed a
view on the subi ect in which I do net feel
able to concur. I agree with the leader of
the Opposition* in feeling that perhaps this
legislation might have come te us i a better form; but, alter ail, honourable gentlemen, the House la not altogether responsible for the form. The Go'vernment and
their officers and the IParliamentary Gounsel
are re6ponsible for the forrn; and even
though the form does caot quite suit us I
do not think the fact that we do not fully
approve of the form is sufficient reason for
voting agaînst the measure.
The honourable gentleman grom Selkirk
<Hou. Mr. Bradbury) apoke of the haste
with which the measure was put thxough
the two Houses ln the first session of
last year. When the honourabie gentlemuan gave us that piece of information,
I tbought that he was really putting
into the hands of the minister about
the strongest argument that he could.
It ie a wel known ma.xim in -law that hasty
legisiation is as a ruile bad legialation; and
no iegxslation could have been much more
hasty than that cf which the honourable
gentleman from Selki-rk spoke. Thie is eupposed to be fpeculiarly a deliberative body
-supposed to be, on the whole, the cooJest,
and I think I might almnost add, the most
level-headed legisiative body lu the country;
snd to say that they would pass a measure
of this sort in seven minutes goes te show
I.hat the Senate were just a littie bit Tattled, te use a slang expression. The Goverument niay have been suffering last year
fira a condition like that of Philip who
bad been a littie bit drunk and who now
feels -sober and appeals te Parliamient to
help hlm cut c-f hig trouble.
H1--n Mr. BRADBURY- If I remnember
rightly, the honourable gentleman was in
bis place hast year when that legielatien
was passed.
Hon 1&. PONVER: I do not remember
whether 1 .a or not; but it does not follow, if I overlooked my du-ty on that occasion, that 1 Ehould do the same thing
now.
What is the proposai, honourable gentIemen? I niesu what does the law a it
stqýnds to-day--aiid as the honourable gentleHon. 'Mr. DANIEL.

mïan froîîî Selkirk wishes it to statnd-what
does that do? It practically places the
liberties f a very large proportion of Our
people in the hands of any government
undérstapper who may be aetuated by
vindictivene&s or some other unworthiv motive. Thot is nlot a satisfactory con~iition
of things. The references that have be-en
made to cases of murder, etc., are to iny
mind quite beside t.he question. As some
honourable gentleman raid, one would not
advocate lynch law in the case of murder,
and I do not think that these 6ubordinate
officersý, 'who are flot always the most hightoned people in the world, should be allowed
a chance to interfere so serioutsly with the
welf are of men who perhaps may be infinitly better than themselves. We sboul'd,
I .thnk, bear this in minci: I do net reiuemober now who expressed the maxim, -but it
was substantially that it la better that ten
guilty men should escape thon that one
innocent mani should be found guilty. And
I do net think that there is much danzrer of
many guilty men escaping.
Then, some honourable gentleman spoke
of vxsîii comning from abroad. But this
measure dces not apply to mren coming
from xibroad; it appliexs to citizens of Cn'nada. If the ho'nourable gentleman from
Selkirk, or any other honourable gentlemaxi, cau devise some legisLation whîch wi11
shut <,ut tbe objectionable people from
abroad, I shall be glad te support it. Bot
unfortunately, as far as my limited judgment goea, I feel. bound now te vote agaînst
the amnient and lu favour of the Bill.
Hoinourable
Hon. W. I. BENNETT:
gentlemien, I have listened te the debate
with much interest, anid propose to vote
for tFe Bill introduceci by the honourable
the M1-i£iister of Labour. I amn at a loss to
understand sorne of the arguments that
have been adJuced here te-day. In the first
-place, it has tLeen argueci that there is
enormous expense iu having te instîtute
crim-nal prosecution-s. I do not know of
any country in which there is -not expended
annuapy an eno-mous sum for crirninal
*posecutiofls. Take the province of Ontario, in which there have been some big
crim«n.ai trials, like the Hyans case and
the case at Woodstock some years ago. The
country spexit a great deàl of money iu both
of those in-arder cases iu order te secure
convictions, and everybody will agree that
it was money wel spent. That being the
case, if any person 8hows a disposition to
contravene any section of the- Act, he can

431

MAY 27, 1920

be prcseculed, even if the prosecution does
cost the (,ountry a good deal of xnoneY. I
suppose the effect of enforcing the aaw and
prosecut:.ng is 1t,;ciater others as well as to
punish the accused. For that reason it is
to b-, hoped that if any prosecutions do
take place under the I.mmigration Act or
under any section of the Criminal Code,
they 'vill have a deterrent effeet on other
persons. One would imagine iromn the remarks cf sornie honourable gentlemen that
there was not a decent labouring man in
Canada;z that fre-m one end of Canada Vo the
othe.- there was %. seething mass of men
who wer, cut tc. murder and burn down
bou.ses and commit ail sorts of crimes.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: WVi11 the honourable gentleman excuse me when I tell him
that the city of Winnipeg asked the Dominion Government to keep away fromn
Winnipeg and they would settle the rnatter
themselves. And they did settie it: the
Committee of One Thousand Citizens of the
city of Winnipeg settled that strike.

Sorne [fin. SENATORS: No, ne.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: There has not

Hon. Mr. DANlEL: Those are the men
you are speaking in favour of.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: WFill the honourable gentleman excuse me? He must flot
put into xny mouth words that I did flot say.
I said flot one word in disrespect of the
Minister o! Labour, for whom I have the
highest regard, and it ili becomes the hionourable gentleman to make that statement.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT1: Wben my honeurable friends can prove that Ymen have been

Winnipeg there was a terrible state of
affairs; there is no question about that.
But there was ne other city in Canada where
the Governanent intervened and prosecutions rasulted.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Suppose they had
succeeded in Winnipeg, what would have
taken place in other cities in Canada?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I admire the Government's action. It was the Government,
not the city of Winnipeg-

Ail honour to
Hon. Mr. BENNETT:
whom honour is due, and if the honourable
gentleman wants to throw so much discredit *on the Minister ai LabourHon. Mr. MeMEANS:

No.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Wait a moment.
The minister waf there-

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If the honourable
gentleman -will refer to Hansard hie will
find his words there-that the Committee
of One Thousand or One Hundred asked
the Dominion Government to k.eep out of
the matter. These were his own words..
Surely the Minister of Labour is a member
o! the Governinent.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: They settled it:
they took charge o! ail public utilities. How
did the Government do it?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If -the honourable
gentleman stîll sticks to his former statement, -that the Committee of One Hundred,
or One Thousand, asked the Dominion Government to keep out of it, all right.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: When the hionourable gentleman does not know the difference between the Committee o! One Hundred and the Committee of One Thousand,
hie knows very little of what took place in
Winnipeg.

nient to bring forivard. the Bill at the present tinie. If it were flot for the agitation
the Government would be satisfied to let
the legisiation stand as it is. I have no
desire to say a word against the labourites.
It is flot the main body of labour who are
the cause 61 the trouble in this country; the
trouble is caused by the agitators, the very
men who should corne under this Act, the
very men that you had in view when the
legfisiation was'brought into existence in
June, 1919. I was not personally present
when the Bill -%vas brought into the House,
and I was somewhat surprised to find that
the Bill had been rushed through in a very
few minutes, as appears to have been the
case. It was a very important Bill. I do flot
believe that any man, no matter how high
hie may stand in the Government-whether
he is the Minister o! Labour, the Minister
of Immigration, or the Prime Minister himself-should be given the right to dispoe
of a .man's liberty without a trial; and that
is what is done when a mnan is, deported
from the country without a trial. I say that
is unfair and that no man should be given
thnt power.
What facts are we confronted with at the
present t1ire? The Government saw fit to
place this Act on the ctatute book in 1919,
and it was placed on the stiatute book for
a very good reason. Then we had the trouble
in 'Winnipeg, on account of which certain
men were tried and found guilty of sedition
and other crimes against the commonwealth.
-nen who, if they had had their way.
would have done what, so far as the peophe
of Canada generahly and the people of
Winnipeg particuharhy are concerned? They
would not onhy have taken possession o!
the country, but would have been trying to
govern it at the present tirne. Why should
the Governrnent now seek to change that
law? 1 arn going to vote for the amendrnent,
because, if %ve pass the Bihl, what is going
to be the resuit? We wilh be saying to these
men in Winnipeg, to these men in prison:
"Corne out from prison; we cannot do anything with you." We are going to say to
agitators ail over the Dominion o! Canadaand they are not ail confined to Winnipeg,
unfortunatehy-that the Governrnent has
thrown up its hands, that it is not going to
be able to control the situation as it did,
and that admission is going .to encourage
these men. That is whiat I object to mainly
in the present Bill. Why shouid we take
euch a course? Why should we flot say: "We
are goîng to let the haw remain as it is until
the affairs of the country are quieted;, until
this agitation bas ceased to exist." That is
S-281

the course I think the Governiment should
take. 1 think that if the Governrnent were
wehl advised they would withdraw the Bill.
As the leader o! the Opposition has said,
the Bill does not deal with the situation; it
only deals with a very srnall fraction o! it;
and if we pass it the men whorn we are
trying to prevent -agitating in this country
will say: "The Governrnent has withdrawn
tiheir efficient piece o! legishation, and we
can do as we hike." There are only one or
two things that I want. I want to see the
arnendrnent carried, and I want to see the
Minister o! Immigration have backbone
enough to deport those men when they are
reheased from the penitentiary at Stony
Mountain.
Hon. ]RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not intend to give a silent
vote on Vhis question, but I shaîl bie as brie!
as I can in giving .my reasons for voting
fcr the Bill and against the amendment.
What does the Bill say? It saya:
Section forty-one of the Immigration Act, as
the said section

Is enacted by section

one cf

chapter twenty-six of the Statutes of 1919which declares the conditions under which
people may be deported-is hereby amended by strlklng out the proviso
at the end thereof and substituting therefor the
fol'oving:
P.ovided that this section shal flot apply to
any person who is a Canadian citizen.
That is, if this Bui is passed, no one who
is a Canadian citizen wihl be deported under
the Act. Now, what is a Canadian citizen?
A Canadian citizen is described under three
heads: First, "a person born in Canada
who has not become an alien;" second, "a
British subject who has Canadian domicile"
-that is, who bas been five years in this
country; third, "a person n-aturalized under
the laws of Canada, who has not subsequently become an alien or lost his Canadian domicile." The Act o! hast year excepts from deportation a person who is a
British subject either by reason o! birth in
Canada, or by reason of naturalization in
Canada.
Honourable gentlemen wilh see
that the exception covers a Canadian citizen born in Canada, and a person who,
under the naturalization 1iaws o! Canada,
bas become a Canadian citizen; but it does
not cover a British subject who bas Canadian domicile. I confèss that I arn very

deport, and if it did not leave in the hands
of the authorities a weapon with which to
deal with agitators. We mnust flot think
that deportaion is the worst t.hing that could
befall an agitator. Sometimes yeu are
sending an agitator over tu the neighboring
country from 'which hie came, and w1here he
may stili breed sedition of all kinds. It
appears to me it, ie much better to do as the
Cri-minai Code has always allowed and will
always allow the authorities to do, that is,
to put hjm into prison here aiter lhe has had
a trial by his peers. -I think ,that, the principle of ordering deportation or any other
punishment without a trial is wzong, and 1
am glad, therefore, to be able to concur in
the principle invclved in this Bill.
I think that the effect of this proposed
legislation will be good. It will flot help
to allay unrest cf the agitators, but none of
us care about that. We want tu aliay the
unrest ameng right-thinking men. AsAfar
as the agitator is ooncerned, there ise not
a man in this House who does want to get
rid of him as empeditiously as possible. If I
thought for a moment that this Bill would
allow the agitator to escape I weuld. be
absolutely oppeeed to it; but, as I bave

Code will take care of himi properly.

BuLL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 03, an Act respecting the
Director of Goal Operations.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
was discussed at some length the other day.
and I think the honcurable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) requested some
information as to whether or ot -the Department cf .Justice ooneidered it in order that
it should be passed. For the honourable

gentleman's information 1 desire to state
that both the Minister of Justice and the
Dgputy Minister have personal knowledge
of the Bill and have passed upon it. 1 have
a memorandumi fromn the Department nf
Justice endoreing it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOTJRT: Would my hoitcurable friend read it?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have not the
memorandum with me, but I can get it for
the honourable gentleman.
As eutlined the other day, the purpose of
the Bill is to enable the Government te
continue the control and guidance of coal
operations in what la known as District 18.
comprising the province of Alberta and the
southern portion cf British Columbia, fnr
a period cf one year or 6uch shorter time
as in the opinicn cf the Gevernor in Couricil is desirable. it is needless for me to
enter into the details again.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would like tu
ask the minister exactly what is meant by
the Orders in Council that are dealt with.
The Bill as it stands refera te many Orders
in Council. Some cf themn apparently are te
remnain in for-ce. I have no kniowledge cf
wha they are.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Orders in
Council referred te are noted in clause 1 of
this Bill. Under the War Measures Act
the Government, .by Orders in Coundil P.C.
1725, P.C. 1896, P.C. 3224 and P.C. 426.
created a Director cf Coal Operations and
clothed. him. with certain authority. By Or.
der in Ceuncil passed a few months age,
these and certain other aspecial orders were
te continue -in force during the present
Session cf Parliament, and they 'wouild auto.
matically become extinct at the end cf this
session unless continued by legislation. It
is deemed desirable by the Dominion Gev.
ernment, by the representative cf the Alberta Govern.ment with whem I have dircussed it, by the Goal'Operaters' Association, with wbom I have had verbal, telegraphic, and written communications, and
by special representatives cf the United
Mine Wcrkers, whc are representing the
men affected, and with whom I have coinmunicated by telegramn and by letter, that
the co-operation now existing amongst the
Government, the coal operators and the
United Mine Werkers should. ha continued

and insuring the production cf ceai in that
area until ahl danger cf any repetition cf

is .purely for the purpose of carrying on
the control, which has proved successful,
until it appears to be no longer necessary.
There is absolute unanimity on the part
of ail parties interested as t~o the desirability of this legfislation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is qixite evident
that =y honourable friend. who has just
asked a question (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot> and
probably other honourabie gentlemen in
the House are not aware of what inatters
are deait with, and in what inanner they
are deait with, in these Orders in Council;
and the answer which my honourable
friend the Minister o! Labour bas just
given is more remarkable for the information it does not contain tihan for the information iA contains. What my honourable driend <Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) evîdently
desires to know ila what are the -subjecets
deait with in those Orders in Council. Thoy
are mainiy questions o! the houxs and the
wam~ of the men employed inthe mines.
These are t.he main aubjects.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, yes. I have
read them. They deal mainly with the
hours and wag-es of men employed in those
mines, the conduct .if the operations, etc.
I tooc the ground the other day that before the Bill passed the second-reading we
shouid have the opinion of the Department
o! Jue4ice. Notwithstanding the respect
which 1 have for the Justice Department, 1
maintain that we have no right whatever
to deal with thie matter here. This Bill
is wholiy unconstitutional, because it deais
with a t.ubject which fails exclusively wîthin provincial jurisdiction, nameiy, property
and civil rights. If hours of labour and
wages o! labourera are flot maLters of provincial ;urisdiction, coming under the head
of property and civil rights. I do not
know uhat could come under thât head.«
1 repeat, I have the greatest possible respect 1cr the Department of Justice, but I
am quite clear in my own mind, from my
own experience, that this Parliament bas
no rigLI. to deai with bout--- of labour and
wages of employees.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Ordcrs in
Council were laid upon the Table, at the
request of the leader of the Opposition, some
days ago. 1 ehahl be giad to lay upon the
Table the orders issued by the Coal Director, the numbers of which appear in the
échedule referred to in the Bill.
It is pe-rhaps out of order for me to reply
to the observations of the honourable
member from Ottawa regarding the constitutionne.ity of the Bill, but surely, inasmuchi
as the Federal Parliament have deait with
hours, wages, etc., in coal mines, by the
Investigation Act,
Industrial Disputes
ihich bas been in force for the past thirteen yeurs, without any exception having
<been îaken by the provinces, coal mining
must be coneidered as coming within
Federai. jurisdiction, especiaiiy when these
properties are Federal natural resources
and are still in the hands, and ownership of
the Federal Government.to a great extent.
Hon. Mr. BELODURT: Mly honourable
friend toid me the other day, in answer to
my question, that these Orders in Counicil
or rega]ations did flot apply exciusiveiy to
lands owned by the Crown, but applied to
ail m&r.ing properties in the West; so this
distinction is quite in conflict -with the
etatement ha made the other day.
-Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not at ail; for
the reason that 1[ have just stated. The
proparties are largely owned by the Government; th*at is, thay are Faderai natural
resourfres. That je what I etated the other
day.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my honourabie
frîend had stated that these Orders in Council and regulations were confined to Çrown
coal lands, 1 would flot have raised the
question of constitutionaiity.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It wouid not
alter the situation.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: He told us that
the O:eers in Council applied to ail miiiing
lands, whether owned by the Crown or by
individuals. That i.s why I raised the point
that, wctwithstanding bnia opinion and that
of the Departaient of Justice, we had no
right to deal with such mattera here.

EXOHF.QUER CJOURT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 108, an Act to amend
the Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, last Session we amended, the Judges Act, making
provision for the salaries of a president and
two puisne judges o! the Exchequer Court.
This apparently was in con templation of
some constitutional changes taking place
in that court. Why it was dons it is difficuit to say at the moment, because the
Government apparently had not deterrnined
upon making the changes which, the drafteman o! the Bill perhaps assumed 'would be
madle. I need not point out that this is
not in coniormîty with the Exehequer
Court Act, which siinply miakes provision
for a judge and !or an assistant judge. The
object o! this Bill is to bring it into conformity with the legislation of hast session,
to a limited extent, contemplating of course
an amendment being made in that Act to
meet the changes which we shaîl make
by the Bill now before us.
This Bill provides that the Exchequer
Court shaîl be presided over by a president and a puisne judge instead of by a
judge and an assistant judge. It also gives
authority to the Government to appoint a
deputy judge. This is very desirable in the
event o! their being a congestion o! business in the Exchequer Court necessitating
further assistance.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: How is the deputy
judge appointed?
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
deputy judge wi]l be appointed by the Governor in Cotincil. It further gîves authority

to the Government to eniarge the jurisdiction or the powers of the Registrar of the
Court. With these changes we shall, I
think, improve upon the constitution of
the Exchequer Court and to some extent
bring it into conformity with the legisiation of last year.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I notice that
under clause 13 a registrar is to be appointed. I understood that there was
already a registrar of the court.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGJ{EED: Yes.
This simply amends the section of the Act
un-der whieh the registrar is appointed.
.Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it the intention to appoint a third judge now?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. No
provision is being ma.de for the appoint-1
ment of a third judge. Provision is being
made for the appointment o! a deputy
judge under certain conditions. The judge
o! the Exchequer Court becomes the president of the court, and the assistant judge
becomes a puisne judge.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:

He bas not yet

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; but
not as puisne judge. That appointment wil
be made in pursuance of this legisiation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The ohject of the
Bill is merely to give the title of puisne
judge to the assistant judgeP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
to give authority to the Governor in Council to appoint a deputy judge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I observe that
the deputy judge is to have "the qualifications for appointment hereinhefore mentioned." I suppose this refers to the qualifications for puisne judgeP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, already in the Act.

SUPIREME OOURT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved thE
second reading of Bill 109, an Act ta amend
the Supreme Court Act.

441

H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, in a
word, this Bill is for the purpose of ibringing about simplification and uniformity
in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,
and preventing appeals being brought in
matters af trifiing importance, more particularly on the plea. that the titie of land
or future rights are involved. Several sections of the Bill embody amend-ments and
additions to the Act made from time to
time ta meet special cases as they have
arisen. Honourable gentlemen 'will doubtless recail that for a number of years we
have been adding amendment ai teg~amendment to the Acts respecting the 8upreme
Court, the Exehequer Court. and many af
the other judîicial tribunals of the country.
It is desirable, therefore, to cansolidate
those amendments and ta render them as
compact as legîslatian can make them.
Another purpose of the Bill is, ta prevent
a class of appeals which, to-day occupy a
large part of the tume ai the 8upreme
Court. It is now proposed that an appeal
shail not lie ini any case unless the sumn
involved is $2,000 or aver.
Hon. Mr. D)ANIEL: Does that refer ta
appeals ta or appeals iram the Bupreme
Court?
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Appeals
ta the Supreme Court. Protection is being
given ta litigants in matters which might
not corne within that class of case, by naking provision for the Appellate Court or
highest court ai any particular province ta
give a right oi appeal ta the Bupreme
Court. That will 'be recognized in a certain class ai case, which the Supreme Court
hereafter may hear.
A great deal of judicial oontroversy bas
arisen on certain definitions, such, for instance, as the terms, "final judgmentand -"judicial proceedings." There bas been
more or less diversity af opinion on those
terms in the different provinces. One abject ai the Bill is ta render uniform, sa far
as possible, the use and meaning of certain
technical ternis.
When we go into Committee 1 shall be
very glad ta explain in greater detail many
af the amendments, which are largely ai
what -might be termed a domestic ar internai character, so far as the court itself
is concerned. I think it sufficient ta say
that these amendments are being carried
out at the instance of the Supreme Court
îtself, and we are greatly indebted ta the
judges ai the court for the preparation of
the legislation now before us.

SENATE

442

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Honourable gentlemen, in new section 37 it is provided
that "an appeal shall lie directly to the
Supreme Court from any final judgment of
a provincial court, whether of appellate or
original jurisdiction." Is it intended by
that that appeals may be taken directly
fromn the trial juidge, or must they bie fromn
the appellate division?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
answer my honouiable friend's question,
but I shall be prepared to do so when we
go into Committee.
Hon. Mr. PROUD FOOT: There are a
number of other points, but it would probably ha better to leave themn until we go
into Committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Yes.
When we go into Gommittee I shaîl have
ail the information my honourable friend
may desire.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I notice that
by section 39 appeals are to ha limited to
cases in which over $2,000 is involved? In
Ontario there has always been an -appeal
in any case involving $1,000 or over, and. it
has heen found to work very satisfactorily
in our courts. This will depr¶ve many parsons of the right to appeal?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED: Yas.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The fact that
the judgas of the 6uprame Court dasira
these change.s is, I think, one reason why
we should scrutiniza the Bill very closaly.
Possibly they want to sava tbais-elves considerable work. Howaver, I will bring thesa

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In reply to the
inquiry of the honourable leader of the Op.position, I may say that the proposed
amandments as made by the House of
Commons do not in any way alter the sense
of the Bill as introducad and passed here.
The word -"duly," in two places, I think.
bas been taken out of the original Bill,
which read, -"duly autborized.- Only the
word -"authorized remains. I do not
"
think it changes the sansa of the sentence
at ail. By an arnendment mnade in tbe otber
House, at page 1, in line 24, they strike out
the words " members of the union " and insert " union members affacted.- That doas
not change or affect the meaning in *any substantial way whatever. The othar amendments are of no consequenca and do not;
change the genýra1 meaning of the Bill.
They are entirely acceptable so, far as I arn
concerned.

Indian Afflaîrs in the said province.

In 1912 an Order in Council was issued

Government and the Government of British

MAY 28, 1920
Columbia, touching certain differences concerning Indian reserves in that province,
and whict rendered it desirable that there
should be a settlement between both Governments in the interest of the Indians
lhemselves. A Royal Commission wvas appointed by both Governiments in 1913, and
that Commission sait and took evidence until
1916, thoroughiy investigating the.whole of!
the Indian reserves in the province of British, Columbia.
It sat as a
Hon. Mr. DAND)URAND:
Joint Commission?
Hon.* Sir JAMES LjOUGHEED: A Joint
Commission. There were a certain number of! representatives seleoted by the British -Columbia Government and a ceitain
number of representatives appoinfted by the
Federal Government, and they sat as a
Joint Royal Commission.
A report was
made by that commission along the line§
of the agreement which had been entered
into, and in pursuance of which the comnmission was appointed.
Probably the
essentiai features of the report, more particularly those with which we have to do,
have relation te the reduction of some reserves and the addition o! other reserves.
That is to say, it is propose4 te reduce, by
wsy of cut-off, certain reserves occupied by,
'the Indians te the extent of some 47,000
acres; and the British Columbia Governnment, in view of this reduction, are conveying to the Crown, in the right of the Dominion Government, for the Indians some 87,000 acres.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Has that conveyance been accepted.by the Indians?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
proposed in the original agreement thait before effect would be given to the eut-off of
the different reserves the Indians of the
respective reserves should surrender that
particular cut-off; but it has been found
that effecit cannot be given to the report o!
the Royal Commission in that way. Consequently the British Columbia Government some time ago passed a Bill, almost
in the same language as the Bill now before
us, and it is proposed by the enabiing leg-iSlation-that which bas been secured. from
the British Columbia Legisîsiture and that
which it is proposed shal 'be secured from
this Parliamert-that effect shaîl be given
te the report which was made by the Joint
Royal Commission, except in the matter of
securing the surrender by the Indians of
the various cut-offs which have been made.
I need scarcely point out to honourable
gentlemen that the interests of the Indians

443

in the hands of the two Governments can
Le protected by the two ýGovernments botter
than by any other means. The Indians
upon those reserves would number, in round
figures, 1 underatand, about 20,000 scattered
over the whole province of British'Columbia.
The reserves include nearly three-quarters
of a million acres of land. The titie of the
land has ibeen for a long time in dispute as
between British Columnbia and the Indians,
and, I might gay, as between the Federal
Government and the Indians. There neyer

was, as honourable gentlemen wîll recaîl, a
time when there were two Crown colonies
in whait now constitutes British Columbiaone on the Island of Vancouver, and one
on the mainland. Those two colonies came
together in 1866, if I remember rightly, and
became one coiony. I need not refer to the
entry o! British Columbia into Conifederation in the seventies. The question of the
Indian titie is practically the same to-day
as it was at that time. Under the Imperial
Governiment there were certain lands allotted to the Indians. They were permitted
to occupy them. There was neyer any formal cession of those lands to the Indians.
They ciaimed to have had-and possibly we
might net dispute it-what is known as an
aborîginal titie to the land.; but the right
of occupation had always been ceded te the
Indians by the Imperial Government, by
the Crown colonies, and afterwards 'by the
British Columbia Government, and likewise by the Federal Government. But in
some o! the provinces there had been a
formai cession of the Indian lands by way of
Treaty to the Federal Governiment. That
did not take placi in British Columbia. The
old practice has been carried on from Orown
colony days down to the present time. It
is now proposed under this agreement that
the reserves which. have been delimited in
the report shaîl be conveyed by the province of British Columbia te the Crown in
right o! the Dominion Government for the
Indians. When any o! those lands are sold
hereafter, «the money wiil be carried in
,trust acoounit for the particular band of Indians that occupies those lands. There is
one condition, however, whîch has beeL~ IMposed by the prov'ince of British Colurabia,
and which is similar to that obtaining in
ail the -other provnces of the Dominion,
nameiy, that shouid the band of' 1hdians
occupying the reserve in question become
extinct, 'the land would revert to the province, together with any fun-ds which might

of the Royal Commission. the Governor in
Council may order such reductions or cut-aifs
ta be efiected without surrenders of the same
by the Indiana, notwithstanding any provisions
of the Indian Act ta the contrary, and may
carry on such further negotiation and enter
into such further agreements with the Government of the province of British Columbia as
may be found necessary for a f ull and final
adjustment of the differences between the said
Governments.

This question is one that has caused a
considerable amount of trouble between the
province of British Columbia and the Domninion Government for a great many years.
My honourable Iriend refera ta the fact that
the province of British Columnbia bas neyer
recognize'd the Indian titie, as it is called.î
As he very truly said, the Government of
British Columbia, while that province was
a Crown colany, set aside certain lands
for the Indians ta live upon; and I do flot
think thase Indian lands were ever conveyed ta the Indians in any way. At the
time 'British Columbia came inta Confederation, a clause was placed in the terms
of union which read as follows:
13. The charge of the Indiana and the trusteeshiji and management of the lands reserved
for their use and benefit shaîl be assumed by
the Dominion Government, and a, policy as hiberal as that hitherto pursued by the British
Columbia Government shall be bontinued by the
Dominion Gavernment after the Union. To carry
out such policy, tracta of land of such extent
as it bas hitherto been the practice of the British Columbia Gavernment to appropriate for
that purpose shail from time ta time be* conveyed by the Local Gavernment ta the DominIon Government In trust for the use and benefit of the Indiana, on application of the DominIon Government, and in case o! disagreenient
letween the two Governments respecting the
quantity of such tracts of land ta be so granted,
the matter shall be referred for the decision of

the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

That was the basis a1 arrangement between the Dominion and the province in
this matter, and it a.pparently provided
that if the Dominion Government and the
provincial Government disagreed in this
matter the Secretary of State was ta decide.
The (matter apparently went along until
1875, when an endeavour was made ta bring
about a setlement, and an Order in Council was drawn up as a resuit af negaOtiations
and recommendations between the province
and the Dominion Government. At that
time the Attorney General of British Columbia, Mr. Walkem, afterwards Mr. Justice Walkem, made a recommendatian ta
the Gavernuient; and a clergyman ai the
Church ai England, a Mr. Duncan, made
certain recommendations an behaîf ai the
Indians. Mr. Duncan was apparently very

445

much interested in this matter, and he and
the Attorney General of that time apparently did flot altogether agree as to how
the question should be settle-d. As a resuit of their work the Dominion Government passed an Order in Council, which
was the basis of the understanding arrived at. It is rather a* long document,
but 1 think that possibly I had better read
it to the House in order that honourable
gentlemen may understand the situation. It
is dated the 5th, of November, 1875, and
says:
The undersigned bas had under considera-

tion the Report of the Executive Council of
British Columbia of the 18til August last. adopting the recommendations contained in a memorandum of the Local Attorney General, the
Hon. Geo. A. Walkem, as the expression of the
views of that Government as ta the best method
of bringing about a settiement of the Indian
land question and submittlng those recommendations for the consideration and assent of the
Government of the Dominion.
The action of the British Columbia Government in this matter was no doubt brought about
hy the Order of Your Excellency

in Couneil

of the 4th November last. on the subject of the
Indian Reserves of British Columbia, which was
communicated officially to the British Columbia
Government by the Secretary of State.
The suggestions contained In Mr. Waikem's
Memorandumn and adopted by the Order in
Council of the British Columbia Government
are as follaws.
1. That no basis of acreage for Indien Reserves be fixed for the province as a whole,
but that each nation (and not tribe) of Indians
of the same language be dealt wlth separately.
2. That for the proper adjustment of Indian
dlaims the Dominion Government do appoint an
agent ta reside with each nation.

3. That reserves of land be set aside for each
nationality of Indiana. Such reserves ta contain
in addition ta agricultural land, a large proportion of wild and forest land. Every application
for a reserve shail be accompanied by a report
from the agent having charge of the nation for
whom the reserve ls intended; and such report
shail contain a census and glve a description
of the habits and pursuits of each nation, and

also o! the nature and quantity o! land

re-

quired for the use of such nation.
4. That each reserve shail he held in trust
for the use and benelit of the nation of Indians ta which It bas been allotted; and in the
event of any materiai increase or decrease hereafter of the numbers of a nation occupying a
reserve, such reserve shaîl be enlarged or diminished as the case may be. so that it shaîl
bear a fair proportion ta the numbers of the

nation occupying it. The extra land required
for any reserve shall be allotted from vacant

Crown lands, and any land taken off a reserve
shaîl revert to the province.
6. That the present local reserve be surrendered by the Dominion ta the province as soon
as may be convenient, the province agreeing ta
give fair compensation for any improvements
or clearingu3 made upon any reserve -which may
be surrendered by the Dominion and acceipted
by the province.

SENATE
The suggestions in question are stated by Mr.
Walkem as having been made by Mr. Duncan
in a letter which is appended to the Order ln
Council.

The undersigned would remark that the suggestions as given hy Mr. Duncan ln the letter
in question do net correspond precisely with the
propositions formulated. by Mr. Walkem.
Mr. Duncan's suggestions are as follows:
1. That no basis of acreage for reserves be
fixed for the province as a whole, but rather.
that each nation of Indiana be dealt wlth separately on their respective dlaimas.
That for the proper adjustment of such
dlaims let the Dominion and the Provincial Governments each provide an agent te visit the Indians and report fully as te the number and
pursuits of each nation and the kind of country they severally occupy.
3. That the Provincial Government deal as
.lberally with the Indiana as other Provincial
Governments in the Dominion. My opinion is
that a liberal policy will prove the cheapest ln
the end; but I hold it will not be necessary in
the interests of the Indians to grant them only
cultivable lands; rather I would recommend
that a large portion of their reserves should be
wild and forest lands. and hence mnay be very
extensive wlthout impoverishing the province,
and at the samelme so satisfactory to the Indians as to allay ahl Irritation and jealousy tewards the whites.
4. 1 think the Provincial Government might
reasonably insist upon this wlth the Dominion
Governrnent, that no Indien shahl be allowed. te
allenate, any part of a reserve, and ln case of
any reserve belng abandoned, or the Indiana op
it decreasing so that Its extent le disproportioned to the number of occupants, that such reserve or part o! a reserve might revert to the
Provincial Government.
Mr. Duncan adds *."Theexisting reserves are
shown to be by the correspondence both irregular in quantity and misplaced as to locality by
followIng tribal divisions, which, lo ne doubt a
mistake'and fraught with 'oad consequences.
"My advice would be ln the tneantime slmphy to Ignore them, as it certainly would not
be wise to regard them as a precedent, and it
would be imPolitic te have the two systeme of
reserves in the province, one tribal and the
cther national."

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Whose
document is this?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK. This is Order in
Council No. 1088, of the lOth of November,

Hon. Sir JAMES LOIJGHEED: By whom
is the memorandum sigýned?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: By R. W. Scott,
Acting Minister of the Interior. It goes on
to say:
It will be observed that Mr. Walkem epeaks
of the appointment o! an agent by the DominIon Government whereas Mr. Duncan proposes
that the Dominion and Provincial Governments
shah each provide an agent te viskt the Indiana
and report upon the question of reserves.
While the undersigned la of opinion that in
view of -the very large experience Mr. Duncan
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

has had arnongst the Indians of British Columnbia and the marvellous success which has attended his labours amongst them. that gentleman's suggestions on matters of Indian policy
are entitled to the greatest weight, and while
he concurs entirely ln the general principles
enunciated by Mr. Duncan, yet he thinks that
both the suggestions of Mr. Duncan, and the
propositions of Mtr. Walkemn adopted by the
Government of British Columnbia in their Minute of the 8th August last fail to provide a
prompt and final eettlement of this long pending controversy..
Mr. Walkem provides merely thaît the agent
shaîl make an application for a reserve and
report upon the subject and Mr. Duncan recomnmenda that the Dominion and Provincial agents
shall report mereiy as to the number and pursuite of the Indians. Looking te Mr. Walkem's
admission, "that the Indiana have undoubtedly
becoine disconterbted and tbnat they are restiess
and uneasy as to their future," and to bis
further statement "*that the local government
have ibeen keenly alive not only to the advantage but to the absolute neceseity and urgent
Importance et a speedy settleinent of ail the
questions connected with their reserves," and
again to Mr. Duncan'e expression of opinion
as to "the urgency and Importance of thbe land
question and lis vital bearing on tbe peace and
prospe¶-ity of the province," the undersigned
submits that ne scheme for the settlement of
this question can be held to be satisfactory
which does not provide for ite prompt and
final adjustment.
In lieu therefore of the propositions submitted
by Mr. Watkem and sanctioned by the Order ln
Council of the British Colum1bia Government,
the undersigned would respectfully propose the
following:
1. Tfhat with a view to the speedy and final
adjustment of the Indian reserve question in
British Columbia on a satisfactory baste, the
whol-e matter *be referred to three commissionere, one to be a.ppointed by rthe Government
of the Dominion, one iby the Governinent of
British Columbia, and the 'third te be named by
the Dominion and the local Governments
jointly.
2. mhat the eaid commissioners shahl as soon
as praoticable after their appolntment meet at
Victoria and make arrangements to visit, with
ail convenient speed, ln sucih order as may be
found desirabie, each Indian nation (mean-ing
by nation aIl Indian tribes speaking the same
language) in British Columbia and atter full
inquiry on the spot, lnto ail matters affecting
the question, to fix and determine for each
the number, extent and
nation separately
locality of the reserve or reserves to be allowed
to lt.
3. That in determining the extent of the reserves to be granted to the Indians of British
Columbia no basis of acreage be fIxed for the
Indians of that province as a whole, but that
each nation of Indians of the samne language
be deait with separately.
4. That the commîssioners shall be guided
generally by the spirit of the tems of union
between the Dominion and the local Governments, which contemplates a 'lliberal policy"
being pursued towards the Indiana; and in
the case of each particular nation regard shall
be had te the habits, wanits and pursuits of
suci nation, to the amount of iterritary available ln the region occupied by them, and to the
dlaims of the white settlers.

If I understand iA aright, t.hat was the
policy of the Dominion
Government
throughout the whole of Canada outaide of
British Columbia, and it has been because
of the attitude of the province of Britishi
Columbia in this matter that the question
has never been settled in that province.
But I flnd that a surrender was made in
one particular case in the year 1899, when
the Dominion Governinent made arrangements &bout the land in the Peace River
area. It was before the province of Alberta
was established, and when the land was
in the hands of the Dominion Govern-ment.
An arrangement was made with the Indians for the surrender of the Indian titie
to certain lands in the northern part of
British Columbia. Whether that was done
without the knowledge of the province of
Britishi Columbia, or whether it was done
under an agreement between the provincial
government and -the Dominion, I am not
in a position to state. The situation as I
see it, therefore, is a rather peculiar one,
inasmuch as in one part of the province
certain arrangements have been made with
the Indians and in the rest o! the province
the whole matter has been ignored or
treated in the way that I have endeavoured
to describe.
Honourable gentlemen will understand
that this may lead to confusion in the
mind of the Indian. He probably does not
distinguish between the provincial and
the Dominion Governinent. He looks upon
both Governments as the representatives of
the Crown. One o! the Indians, who was
in Ottawa a short time ago and who comes
f rom the Shuswap Reserve, which is neareat
to my part of the country, said 'when he
came to see me that lie considered the Government as representing the King and he

The Deputy Superintendent General of

It would take too long to read the whole

in reply to the second and third clauses
of the petition the department says:
In order to underatand the bearing of these

I do not think that I need go into the

how entirely that policy bas been followed to

The memorandum also atates that the policy
"of obtaining surrenders at this lapse of time
and under the altered circunistances of the
province may be questionable." The assertion
of the dlaims was, on the part of the Minister
of Justice, made as a matter of duty.
The Crown Lands Act was disaiiowed; meanwhile negotiationa had taken place between the
two Governments and a working liais on which
the reserves were ta ie set aide had been fixed
and the decisions were incorporated in joint
Orders In Cauncil. This arrangemrent having
been made the <natter waa fux-ther considered
by the Dominion Goverusiient, and the Honourable Edward Blake, then Minister of Justice,
recomznended that the Act should be ailowed ta
go ta ia operation. He atated as foilows:
"Aithough the undersigned cannat concur lin
the view that the abjections taken -are entirely removed by the action referred ta; and, though

sideretion bas been acted upon. and is being

great incoilvenience and confusion might resuit
tram its disallowance; and, consldering that
the condition of the question at issue betweefl
the two governments is very much irnproved
since the date of bis report. the und.ersigned is
of opinion that it would be the better course
to leave the Act tu its operation.
"«It is tu be observed tihat- this procedure
waives any
neither expresses nor implledly
right of the Government of Canadia to lnsist
that any ot the provisions ot the Act are beyofld
coenpetence ot the local legislature, and are
consequently inoperative."
Many amendsnents to the Crown Lands Act
of the province have since been made and
ailowed by the Dominion GovernTnent.

The -matter stood thus until the appointment of the commission. Amongst other
-rensons given in the general report of the
';eoinmission, on page 17, the conmmission
state:
The L'and Act of 1875 provided for the conveyance of lands tu the Dominion Government
in trust for the use and benetit of the InBy Section 9, of Chapter 38 of the
dians."
Statutes of 1899, an amendment was made by
adding to the provision in the Land Act these
words "and in trust to reconvey the same to
the Provincial Government in case such lands
at any time ceased to be used by such Indians."
In 1911 this enactmaent was made:
"Provided aiways that it shahl be iawtul for
the Lieutenant-Governor In Council tu at any
time grant, convey' quit dlaim, seli or dispose
of, on such terra as Snay be deerned advisable, the interest of the -province, reversionary
or otberwise, in any Indian reserve or any

enacted:

Honourable gentlemen wvîll see froin that
the kind o! entanglemients that had arisen

Governmenti; aid, as it states hiere:
To remove the administrative entanglemett

left in that way, and the Indians of course
could flot deal with the question before the
Commission.
But now,> if I understand the situation
agright. what the Indians fear in this Bill,
should it become law, is that they will be
entirely put out of court, and be unable to
proceed on any question of title, and I amn
in hopes that before this Bill goes through
the Senate my honourable friend will allow
the matter to be discussed before a special
Committee, in order that honourable gentlemen who are interested in this inatter and
who realize that it is not a good thing tu
allow these people tu feel that considleration bas flot been given tu what they have
had to say, may be enabled to discuss the
question.

that the question had been brought up in

how that bas been done, except in the discussion on another Bill. The Bill bef are

course, it may be possible that the Chairman of the Committee allowed these people
tu corne forward and make a statement;
but Bill 13 would not be before the Coinmittee, and, under the rules of the House,
I do not see how it could be discussed.
There is another feature in regard tu this
niatter which II think requires considerable
conside rat ion: that is the quesiton of the
fishing and hunting rights of the Indians,
Honourable
and matte.rs of that kind.
g-entlemen Nvill remember that yesterday
I referred to the Treaty lately made between
the Dominion and thue United States with
relation to salmon fishing on the Pacifie
coast. That Treaty was drawn up for the
purpose of restoring, if possible, conditions
in the Fraser river. For years past the
numbers o! fish going up the Fraser river
have been very mucii depleted fromn year
to year. As honourable gentlemen know,
these Inidian reserves in British Columbia,
eSpecially those set apart in the ea.rly days,
were nearly ail along the banks of the
Fraser river. That wvas the line of travel
taken by the early settlers going into British Columbia for the purpose of opening
up the mines and minerais of that country,
and therefore the traveller came more
quickly into contact with those Indians
than with Indians in other parts of the
province. The Indians on those reserves
liad naturally fishing rights, and now that
,he salmon that run up the Fraser river
have become so depleted the Indians do not

As my honourable friend bas said, this
Commission bas gone very fully into the
question of theIse reserves, and bas cut off
parts in some places and added on in others.
1 understand that when the Commission
was sitting in British Columbia the question was raised by the Indians as to the
title referred to by their petition, and the
Commission stated that they had no power

that they got in former times. That difficulty is recognized by fhe Fishery Superintendent of the Provincial Governinent. In
the report that he made ta the provincial
Government in 1918 he used these words:

vlclnlty of their spawnlng grounda are much
more valuable, lndlvldually and collectlvely,
than the fish taken within commercial fishlng
waters. Sockeye that were worth 75 cents each
to commercial fiahermen on the Fraser the past
year are worth many times that amount to the
spawnlng grounds. The runs of the future depend upon the nu-mber of eggs deposited and
hatched withln the rlver's basin. The female
sockeye of the Fraser produce averagely 2,500
eggs each.
It has been suggeated that the Indians be
deprlved of their right to fish iLbove commercial ifishlng boundaries, and In lieu thereof be
alded to do ail their fishing wlthln commercial
limita. Possibly the Indians In the delta of the
Fraser and those resident south and west nt
'Yale mlght operate to advantage and falrly ennomlcally. The suggestion is wholly lmpracticable so far as the great majority of the Indiane are concerned. Very few of the Indians
from the Chilcotin or north o! Bridge river have
ever engaged in flshing within commercial
waters. For them to journey, with women, who
do aIl of the work of dressing and smoking the
flah, fromn their homes to tidal waters and then
back again with their bales of dried fiah would
coat the Government many times more than ta
purchase and transport a far greater aupply of
other fooda for the use of the Indians at home.
The Indians of the Fraser are reasonable beinga. There are many clear-headed men in their
councils. If this matter be taken up with them
in a deliberate, clear and painstaking manner,
it la advanced that they would soon see the
benefits to be derived by dlsposing of their fishing rights. Their right at the present time la
of little value to the moat of them, and la steadily lessening In value. Many of them realize
this tc be true. The Government should act In
this matter without further delay; the expense
to be covered from the collection made for fishing licenses.

and for the full and final adjustment and nettiement of ail differences between the said Governments respecting Indian lanids and Indian
affaira in the province.

They seem to fear that Vhis w'ill cut themi
out of a settlement of their fishing and other
.rights jo which they think they are entitled. Then in the past certain arrange.xnents have been made touching Indian reserves which have not been conducted along

Justice on this que-stion. I think lie promîised vesterday to bring that down for
myi hionourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.

M-Nr.
Honi. Mr. ROBERTSON: If I reniember
correctly, I assured mvy honourable friend.
froin Ot-tawa that the Bill had been before
the Governor in Council and had been referred to the Justice~ Department and approved by that departrnt-both by the
minister ýpersonally and by the deputy minister, wîho had reviewed it. The honourable
miember froin Ottawa did not see fit to accept niv word that that wvas the case; he is

INAY 28, 12
ilot here to-day; and-I ani sorry if the
House is of the vieîv that I understaod was
held by my honourable friend froîîî Ottawa.
The Bill was referred ta and approved by
the Depart.ment of Justice and is noîv before this House for consideration.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think, if I may
say so, there is a littie difference between
the honourable the Minister of Labour and
my honourable friend from Ottawa. I was
myseif under the impression-and I thinc
the honourable member from Ottawa was
also-that the ininister had a written opinion from the Depart-ment o! Justice. From
what lie says now I gather that there was
no written opinion; that the Bill was sinîply referred te the Minister of Justice and
discussed by him, as ta whether it was
ultra vires of this Parliaiment or not. Is
it coyiect ta infer that there wvas really no
written opinion given on the matter?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.- I mnade no statement ta the effect that the Minister of
Justice or the Departnîent of Justice had
expressed a definite opinion lapon the constitutionality of the Bill. I sirnply stated
that the Bill had been referred te the Department of Justice after it had been approved by the Governor in Council, ta see
that it was in proper legal form for pyesentation. The Justice Department returned the proposed Bill ta me. The Minister
of Justice personally handed me a nietuorandum ta the effeot that the department
sawv no objection ta the Bill and rearded
it as proper to be proceeded with. I did
net give any intimation that the Justice
Department had expressed any particular
opinion. in writîng, as ta the constitutionality of the Bill. I do, however, express
te the Committee the view that there
can be no question on that point,
because district 18, over which the Ceai
Director's authority extends, is in two provinces; because the coal that is produced
frem those mines is exported to three different provinces as well as te the 'United
States, and because almost ail ai the coal
lands which are affected are owned by the
Federal Government. It is not a provincial
niatter; it is absolutely interprovinicial. The
people of the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta are absolutely dependent upan this
coal ta keep themeselves alive during the
long -winter months. This Bill is in keeping
withi the authority of the Federal Governnient under the British North Arnerica Act,
section 91. It is ini the interest of peace,
order, and good government ta exercise this
contrai, which during the past two years

453

bas prevented hardship and catastrophe
tha-, otherwvise, I arn sure, would have occurred, and that the people of the West
agree would have occurred. It is proposed
to continue that control and prevent any
un:eortunate occurrence happening to the
people in the provinces of Saskatchewan
and 'Manitoba particularly, who are depend.
ent on this coal which is not within their
own boundaries. I feel, honourable gentlemien, that there can bie absolutely no question as ta the rigaht of this Parliament ta
deal with this question. The Bill simply
continues the inachinery which has been in
op,rraIion for three years, which has worked
sa::;zfactoriiy, and which ail parties interetdask, te have continued -until the end of
thE next Session af Parliarnent.
Honi. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 have no d<kubt
that what xny honourable friend says is
per'ectly correct, that this arrangement
should be carried on; but the difference
in zhe position as I see it is this, that those
Ordeýrs in Council dealing with this matter
%%vere passed hy the Government under the
War Measures Act, which .applied when
conditions were very different irorn what
thev are to-day; and now the Minister is
ask,-ng us to do by legisiation what was done
by- Order in Council under that Act. The
difficulty in the situation as I understand
it is that this proposed legisiation is an iiiter:erence with civil right s, which, under
the British North Amierica Acet. are entirely
in :!ehands of the Provincial Governments.
Tii;- Bill, I understand, deals very largely
wiî,h questions regarding- the hours of labeur. the price of the coal. and similar matters. which corne under that clause of 'lhe

within the Bar Mr. Camecron, the Registraof the Court.
On section 1-final judgment:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can my honouirable friend tell us just what is the meaning
of the alteration in this section?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that in the province of Quebec a different interpretation is placed upon the
terni " final jud~grnent " to what is placed
upon it in the other provinces. It is very
lar.gely of a techinical character. A judgment may be final in the province of Quebec
that would. not be regarded as final in the
other provinces. It ia proposed therefore
that finality shoul.d be reached on ail judgments, entirely irrespective of any technical
meaning that may be attached to the terni,
and to bring into uniformity ail the provinces of Canada.
Hon. Mr. POWEll: 1 do not think that
the meaning of this paragraph is altogther
free of doubot. It 8ays:
"Final judgment" means any judgrnent, mile,
order or decision which determines in whole or
in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding.

fore the Supreme Court from the p;novince
o! Quebec, it would not be appealable becauze it was not the final judgtnent.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Under this new
section, woulld a party to litigation, where
a port-ion of any substantive right was determined, have a right to appeal -without
the final determination of the question having taken place?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, there
would have to 'be a final adjudication of the
entire issue tbetween tihe parties bel ore there
could be an appeal.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That ia not my
understanding of the wording of this subsection.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, it
mtight have relation only to part of a substantive right. That is ta say, the whole
question might not be in issue.
Hon. Mr. IYNCHI S'AUNTION: The
claui-e is not in any way extending the
meaning is it? It is just e-xplaining it, is
it flot?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU-GIEED: On the

Act was amended. I will read !mom the

section is as it stood before. It is preciseIy the samie as in the present Act.
New section 35 was agreed to.
On new section 36-appeals fîromn court of
last resort:
Hon. Mr. LYNCÇH STAUNTON: Is this
the samne?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, there
is a change. Section 36 in the Act as At
stands to-day reads as follows:
E-xcept as hereinafter otherwise provided, an
aPpeal shall lie to the Supremne Court from any
final judgment ot the highest court of final
resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court
of appeal or of original jurisdiction, in cases
in which the court of original jurlsdiction is a
superior court: Provided that:
(a> there shall be no appeal from a judgrnient
In any case of proceedings for or upon a wvrit
of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition
arising out of a criminal charge or In any case
of proceedings for or upon 'a writ of habeas
corpus. arising out of any dlaim for extradition
made under any treaty; and
(b) there shahl be no appeal if a criniinal case
except as provided in the Crliinal Code. Revised
Statutes. etc.

'The only material changes being made
in the section whit-h we are norw considering
are in relation to the transfer of the word
"final"- to eubclause a, and the eliiniination of the words, " in cases in which the
court of original jurisdiction i5 a superior
court." Other changes are purely verbal
or formai. The restrictions in regard to the
origin of appealable proceedinga is reinoved, in order to bring in cases now covered by section 37.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: There is no intention apparently under section 36 to extend the jurisdiction of the Supre-me Court
in capital cases.

I tbink hie should have an appeal. A-ccording to the law as it stands at present,
if $1,001 is involved, in the province of Ontario. an appeal may 'be talcen to the Supremne Court. Under the present Bill the

but I certainly amn of opinion that there
sbould be, to commence with, an appeal
to the Supre-me Court in capital cases, and
I will inove 'that the clause be amended
to tbat effect.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
so large a question as to involve a question of policy, whih could not be very
iveil dealt with in the Bill now before us:
it would bave to hae taken up by itself. 0f
course, there could bie an enlarged jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court, beyond that which. is provided for in the Criinmnal Code, by wlhich a case might be rese.rved and sent Vo tbe court o! appeal or
to the fui1 court in the province, and froni
there to the Supreme Court. I understand
tbe present practice to, be that if the accused bave ione judge wit'h hian, an appeal
will lie to the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is, if
thiere is a dissent-ing- judge.
-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. If
we are going to, deal with the subject o!
enlarging that jurisdiction and making the
Supreme Court an appellate court o! crimmnal juriediction, I tbink iA should be
taken up separately. My bonourable friend
might vexy well have dîscussed it in connection with the Bill which was introduced
a short tume ago by rny honourable friend
from Manitoba (Hon. Mr. McMeans) dealing with the review of .criminal cases and
the reduction or exctension of sentences by
the full court of the province. It would
bave been very germane to the discussion
on that Bill. My bonourable friend will
bie at liberty to take up the question at
any -other time, 'but it cannoît be appropriately taken up at present.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It struck nme
that, when dealing with the jurisdiction o!
the Supreîne Court, this would be a very
good tiînie to make the changee. Then wve
would not be tinkering with the Act. The
subjeet of an appeal in crimînal cases is flot
a new one. It bas been discussed to a considerable extent. by lawyers tbroughout the
province of Ontario and, I think, in otber
portions of the Dominion; and, while it may
not be satisfactory to amend an Act
brought, down, as this one bas been, by the
MNiîister o! Justice, yet it seenis to me that
it is v('ry wortby o! consideration and that
this is the proper tume to make the amendment.
.New section 36 wvas agreed to.

37 ceals with appeals frorn other than the
highest court of last resort in the province,
and makes provisions as to the conditions
in which appeals shail lie.
Before the
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
adoption of section 37 1 would like to
understand what change that makes in the
Act as it stands at prasent.
You will
observe that it provides -"that an appeal
shall lie directly to the Suprerne Court
frorn any final judgment of a provincial
court, whether of appellate or original
jurisdiction, other than the highest court
of final rasort in the province." What I
do not undarstand in that language is this.
May an appeal be taken direct from the
trial judga to the Supreme Court without
going to the Court of Appeal, for instance,
in the province of Ontario?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
makes provision wherehy you may go from
the trial court to the Supreme Court without appealing to the highest court of final
resort. Section 37, as it is now, deals with
an entirely different class of case. It is
not perhaps 8o xnuch an amendmant to the
existing section as a following in rotation
of the new procadure or the new jurisdiction
which is being laid down by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It strikas me
that it is not a very wise procedure to anlarge the jurisdiction so that an appeal
may be taken direct from the trial judge.
I think it is very much better that the
appeal should take the ordinary course
going to the Court of Appeal before being
sent to the Supreme Court. You will find
that the Supreme Court 'will be burdened
'with a great many appeals which otherwise
would neyer reach it, and many of which
now go to the Court of Appeal in the province. I arn speaking more particularly of
the province of Ontario. This amendment
is, I think, not a stap in the right direction.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: An appeal
from a trial judge will often bring only the
,sanie result as in the original court. Rightly or wrongly you may consider the decision
erroneous, and, by permission of the Appallate Court, or the highest court of the
province, you may go directly to the
Supreme Court of Canada. Evary practising barrister who bas had to do appellata
work knows that if hae goas to the highest
court in bis own province it is almost inpossible to change the decision already

d-ecision do not see fit to carry it to the
highest court of Canada.
The appellate

court, or the highest court in the province,
renders its decision, and the litigant saN ';.
"I arn not satisfied with that decision: I
want to go straight to the Suprame Court."
I think that by sending it direct to the
Supreme Court there will ba a saving of
considerabla expensa to the litigent.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:- Do I undarstand
from what my honourable friand has said
that at the present time there is no such
power as is given hy this clause? Is it a
fact that at the present time it is necessary
to go from the trial judge to the appeal
court of the province bafore going to the
Suprame Court? Is that the positioný
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, practically.

Hon. Mfr. PRLOUDFOOT: IV involves argument on the appeal. I think it is rather

action of thîs kind. I think there was ne
cail for the change, se f ar as the bar in Ontario is concerned. I have not heard a word
of complaint from that bar. I think the
la'w should remain as it is. Why should a
man be obli.ged te apply for leave if he bas
a case in which he thinks hie .should appeal?
He cannot ap'peal that case unless bie gets
the leave o! -sene judge. I thînk it is unfair. I know that in inan>' cases the question of juriadîction has been brought before the registrar of the Supremne Court
wben an even $1,000 was involved, and it
bas been held by the Supreme Court that
while a person might appeal for $1,000.01,
hie cannoi vithout leave take an appeal
when an even $1,000 is jnvolved, and leave
in sucb cases has frequently been refused.

Vhink the Parliament of Canada should
inake a change of this nature, cutting down
greatly, as it will, the numiber of appeals.
One could ver>' readily understand why a
change of this nature 'would be made if the
bar or the hegisiature of the province asked
for it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But Vhey
will neyer do that. The bar will not ask
for a limitation of appeals.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Oh, yes. Well,

who are interested in litigation.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT - Undoubtedly.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You have
g-reat confidence ini the bar.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Probably the
honourable gentleman is speaking from the
western point of view, which niay be somewhat mare enlightened than that of the
province of Ontario. The Ontario bar probably takes a view of these things different
from -what is taken 1aither west. I think
we should. not make that change, and I
move that the *clause providing that the
aniount in controversy shall exceed $2,O0
be struck out, and that the amount, se far
as the province of Ontario is concerned,
be the samne as it was, namely, $1,000.
Hon. Mr. LYNÇH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I think that rny honourable
frend shauld remember that it is a very
expensive matter Vo go to the Supremne
(U:urt. It costs a great deal to have the

intentionally, to intirnate that sorne of us
in connectiofi with this question are belit,
tling the labour men of this country. Sorne
of us are lauding labour men. 1 do flot
think the workingmefl are interested in this
Bill irn any way, shape, or form. If I mnay
be perrnitted to make a personal remark,
I would say that I feel as close to the workingman as anyone can, either in this House
or out of it. I arn truly and sincerely of the
woirkin-g classes, and in the part o! the
Dominion frorn whicb 'I corne I arn sure
there is flot a workingrnan who would not
have the greatest confidence in my taking
the part that I conscientiously thought best
in any matter corning before this Parliament.
The honourable gentleman from Simcoe
(Hon. 'Mr. Bennett), when discussing, this
matter the other day, rnade a staternent
which. I arn sure he could not have intended
to make. It does not look well in Hansard,
and I amn sure that w~hen he read it himself
-if he has read it-he rnust have corne to
the conclusion that it would have been
better not to have made it. He intirnated
that soulte of the members of this House who
were supporting the arnendment moved by
the honouraAde gentleman frorn Hamnilton
did so hecause they had corne to the conclusion that the workingrnen o! Canada
were seethirtg, and wvanted te murder everyone, and burn down houses, and destroy
every thing. 1 w-ill read his words, so t.hat I
shall not be misunderstood. Here is wbat
the honourable gentleman said:
One would imagine from the remarks of sorne
honourable gentlemen that there was flot a decent labouring man in Canada.

No honourable gentleman wvborn I heard
speak in this Houce said anything upon
which anyone could found an opinion of
that kind. The honourable gentleman said:
-that from one end of Canada to the other
there wvas a seething mass of men who were
out to murder, and burn down houses, and commit ail sorts of crimes.

Surely there is nothing to warrant any
such statement as that. It often happens
that honouraible gentlemen in endeavouring to put their views before the House
rather try te put the views of other honourable gentlemen in such a way as te show
that tibey are wrong.
Now, honourable gentlemen, what ir, the
reason for this Act? How did it corne to

necessary, but we had a request. Where
did that requedst corne from? It camne fronm
the Goverinent of the city of Winnipeog
and the local Governrnent of the province
The Governmient and the
o! Manitoba.
Opposition unanimously called for this
legisîstion, and, as baa been said before,
this Act was passed in a very short tirne.
How was that brought about? The leaders
on both sidoe of this House, and the leaders
on botb 6ides of t.he other House, mnust
have understood one another pretty well,
and must have corne to the conclusion that
this was an important nîattiir and that the
Act niust be put through at very shùrt
notice, in order to get control of affairs in
Winnipeg at that tirne. The Act wvaS put
through in that way, and it was considered
necessary, for we could not -have got along
without it. God knows what would have
happened if it had not gone througb. It
was put through, and was « credit to the
Parliamient that put it through. When îny
honourable friend refers te the character
of the men that this Act interferes withi,
and triesz to make out that they are to be
found among our working classes, he is
wrong. The men who played leading parts
in Winnipeg, and who were responsible for
the introduction of Vhis Act, were not workingmen of this country. Tbey were agitators who carne to thié country upon the
invitation of no one but themselves. They
came bere for a purpose, and they are the
men whorn we want to look after. As I
say, the Bill was put through unanimously;
one dissenting voice in either branch of
Parlianient would have prevented its passage. The representatives al the people o!
Canada in the other House and the representatives of the people of Canada in this
branch unanimously decided to put the Act
through.
Having gone se far -why shouId we alter
that Act? The h-&nourable memniber frorn
Simcoe reaci a despatcli that appeared in
the papers regarding seme, nominations
which had been made in Winnipeg. What
lias happened in Winnipeg? Thle provincial
governimient..and the munici.pal governmnent
and the Committee o! One Thousand were
unanimous and united in their efforts te
protect the civil rights of the peeple o! that
cit.y. W'hat he.ppened after Mayor Gray
w-as askhed by the agitators te resign bhis
position and h.and it over to semebody else
whor they would nam-e? The agitaters demanded aiso that Premier INorris leave bis
position, and they said they 'would narne a

inan te take bis place. There were intimations of assassination and ail that sort ef
t.hing. 'My 'henourable friend from Simcoe
reads te us a paragraph about the nominations that have be-en made in Winnipeg;
but what do we find? The agitation tok
place in June, but in December of t.he samne
year Mayor Gray, who had plaved a noble
part in th-is matter, appealed to the citizens
of Winnipeg for election, and vwas returned
by an overwhelming majority; by whom? By
the 'working people of Winnipeg.
Hlon. Mr. BEN.NET: WVill the honourable
gentleman allow me te interrupt him? The
nominations. referred to in the newspaper
item -vbieh 1 read were net nominations for
the municipal elections at aIl, but were in
con-nection *with the elections, which are te
take place in a month, for the legislative
assembly.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: [R followed the
honeurabla gentleman very closely, and I
know that that is what he read. He used
that as an argument teo indicate that a
change had taken place in that ceniunity,
and. te, show that these nmen were supported.
I am telling the honourable gentleman now
that nominations do net amount te anythinf, because when Mayor Gray, who
playad a prominent and laudable part, vent
th the -peo-ple and contested tihe election in
the city of Win.nipeg ha won by an overwhelming rnajority, as I have already said,
and the majority w.as given him by the
working classes of the city. It ceuld not
have been given by any other class. Tbis
is a co-untrTy of workingmen. My honeurable friend is an old politician, or at least
hie has had a little experience in matters
of tihat, kind, and hie knows, yen- well t.hat
nominations do mot anean very much. In
tact, there neyer vas an election in which
at least one o-f the neminees did net aniourrt
te, much. So I do net thlinik that my hionourable friend's argument regarding the nominations was a good one. I think I may
speak for the 'working people of this country. 7 have as much right te assume te do
that as any otheïr -honourable gentleman
here. I am sure that t.he 'workingmen of this
ceuntry have ne sympathy for what teok
place in Winmipeg on the occasion which
we are diiscussing. That being se, what harrn
can, be done iby ieaving the Act as it is?
The honourable member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) took a good deal of
trouble to find excuses for voting e.gainst
the amendznen.t. 1t took him a lnog time
te flnd thoee excuses. Rl
tihink hae must have

an(l he evidently does net want te be here
for the vote. I would like te read some of
the honourable gentleman's reasons that
prevented hitu from voting fer the amendment. This is what tdhe honourable gentleman said, ýafter (leclaring that he had coma
te the conclusion net. to vote for the amendment:
P'irst of al], my dislike, my fear, of the fereign
agitator, especially the man who who has been
ealled the International agitator-the man who
carnies on the nefarýous business of agitating,
sonletimes In Canada, sometimes in the United
States, and sometimes In Europe.

This i» the man who is, giving the henourable gent.leman a great deal of worry. You
will sea by %vhatthe honourable, gentleman
savs that hie is *worried.
1 hesitate aise because of the tendency, wvhich
it seems te me is tee much in evidence newadays
in Canada. that of pandering te, and endeavourIng te meet the wishes of, the labour men in
this country.

I think the honeurable gentleman is wrong
in that. If he had said the agitaters of this
country rather than the labour men, it
wuuld have been better. But he made that
littla mistake, and we shall have te forgive
himi for it. 1 suppose he wvihl take that back
as soon as hie bas an epportunity.
Another reason which causes me to hesitate
is my hat red-

Mark the word-my hatred for most of the war legisiation,
especially the war Orders in Council. such as
are by this Act continued indefinitely.

M-Nv
honeurable friend is such an eminent
lawyer, a man of such high standing at the
Bar in bis own city and province, one would
suppose hie would have known that this had
rne cennectien whatever 'with the War Measures Act; that this wvas an Act that was put
inte force only last year, after the War
Measures Act bad gene eut of existenceaiter the Orders in Council in cennectien
with the War _Neasures Act had ceased.
Yet the honourable gentleman gives as a
reason for voting against the ameridment,
that this Bill is geing to continue the War
Measures Act. I say that the herieurable
gentleman's arguments are ail distinct]y in
faveur of the ameridment ineved by the honourable gentleman fromn Hamilton and
a ga inst the rapeal ef the legislation which
%ve passed a year ago.
Honourable gentlemen, if for a single moment I believed that the working classas of

took place in Winnipeg last year, I would

werle re!used a water supply for the hospitals. Transportation for the people was
refused. As I said a moment ago, the men
wanted to supply these thinigs, 'but they were
kept !rom, doing so by the agitators and by
the leaders. The leaders wanted te turn the
new parliament building in Winnipeg into
a labour temple and estaiblish a Soviet

men some honourable gentlemen in this

condition o! affairs? I may tell you that
any person who la in olose touch with. the
situation at all must consider that there is
a very serions state o! affaira.
During the discussion the other day, I
asked my honourable friend-I think lie
would be classed as the junior mnember
from Ottawa <Hon. *Mr. Belcourt)-what was
the method used to deport Reds or undesirables fromn the United States. 1 asked
that question in ail huniility, hoping to
get an opinion from one of the lead-ing
lawyers in this House. But hie answered
that hie did not, get his inspiration fromn the
United îStates. I could net hielp thinking
that it wa-s oiily a short time age thiat lie
was look.1ng to the United States for inspiration.* How qu.ickly some people
change. The Unfited States to-day is a
great demiocratic country, and hiow do they
hand-le the Reds or undesirables in that
country? Do they give themi trials? Do
they spend millions of dollars trying to find
out whether people are desirable citizens or
not? Indeed, no; they deport them, not by
dozens or by hundreds, but by thouzaiids

and by shiploads. That is the way they
handle these fellows. Take' for instance,
tne case of Emmiia Goldinan, and the rest
In -my humble opin:on, the

afford to take a leaf out of the book of the
'United States, and send these undesirablé
people out of the country as soon as ps
sible.
î%ome say, "Give them a fair trial." I
want to say, honourable gentlemen, that I
believe every Canadian citizen who is lawabiding and is truly a Canadian citizen
should get his trial; buit when we have
amiong us those who want to esta.blsh
Soviet goveriiient, who want to turn Parliament buildings into a labour temple, and
that kind of thing-, 1 thi.nk the quicker
we get rid of thein the better. As the law
stands, if those men whio are to-day in jail
in Manitoba continue preaching their Soviet
doctrines in Canada when they get out,
they cana be deported; but if this Bill whichi
has been introduced by the Minister of
Labour goes through, it will be impossible
to deport those nien without the expenditure of millions of dollars of your and xny
nioney to give them another trial. If the
law wa-s good las-t year, it is good enough
for me th's year.
The other day, when we were discussing
the deportation of un.desirables another
question was brought in, which, f rom xny
point of view, a.nd lrom the point of view
of any layman, could not very well be connected with the deportation of undesirables.
It wvas brought forward by the honourable
,geii.leman from Midland <(Hon. -Mr.
Bennett), who used the.se words:

IIEV1I3E9'

-and the honourable gentlemen kissed the tips
of their fingers to those labour men and bade
thein good-bye, and hoped they would corne
baek safe.

As I was saying, I do not understand
howv this could be connected with the deportation of undesirables, unless it was perhaps throughl hris pent-up feeling that lie

Now, so far as iny -eareer as a political
colonel la concerned-and I suppose 1
corne under that term, because I was a
politician, and I was also a cooonel-I neyer
asked for any credît or anry thanke for anything that I did. In 1916 1 eaw the need
of men, be-cauee they were oialling f rom
France, "More men !" I snoswered. the cail.
I volunteered, and Sir Samn Hughes gave
me a comnmission te raise a battalion. I
did a0. I raieed ncy battalion and took iL
to England; and, if Al ie of any ad'vantage
te myr honourable ifriend, te know iL, nxy
battalion iwas broken up befoee I landed in
Liverpool. I ai the orders breaking it up
before 1 landed at ail, although I did not
hand tihe battalion over for sorte days after
that. But I -want to tell you, honoui'able
gentlemen, that every battaLon that went
te Englaind in the suimmer of 1916, with the
exception, cf that of my brother Sam, was
broken up and sent to France as reinfowemeûts. My brother «vs -the only colonel
who went over du-ring the suimaer of 1916
who vent te France with his battalion.
While I was onby a peli'ticai colonel, I
muet aay that I vas very fortunate in getting- semne good officers, and that 90 per
cent o'f those men rwere sent te France
without any further training in Engiand,
so we must have had -them in fairly gccd
shape, even for a poiiial colonel. But I
want te say this, and 1I aant te say it with
aal -the emphasis of which I amn capable,
that there .was not a man tihat I know of
'who teok a battalion te England. du-ring
1916, or any other year during the war,
who would not gladly have gone to France
with his men and Gtayed with them al

wiliinglY to ail your ruilings. In uaing that
tern I tbought I was going a littie furtiier
than I should; but I want-ed you and the
other honourable mamîbers of this House te
know my opinion of that gentleman. It le
only true-The Hon. the SPEAKER: Do you withdraw if?
Hon. Mxr SHARPE: Why certainly, cert.ainly; but, Mr. Speaker, it le net on]y my
opiniion; it le the opinion of ail those in
the House of Commons who have sat there
for twenty years. I want .to say, Mr.
Speaker and honourable gentlemen, that my
intentions areHon. Mr. BENNETT: Mr. Speaker, I rise
to a point of order. No 'honourable member
of this Chamber can corne in-te the House
and eay that the opinion, heid out&ide, by
mnembere of the House of Gommons, is that
a meniber of this House is a miserable cur.
1 thin-k that was the gen.tle.manly phrase
thiat emanatedHon. Mr. SHÂRPE: That is it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I aslked the
honourable gentleman to withdraw the ex-

pression, and I understeed that lie with)-

drew it.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: 1 did, Mr. Speaker.
I wishi te say thisHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I raise a point
of order, Mr. Speaker, if 1 may be p.ardoned.
I rise only with rel'uctance and because o!
the fact that 1 ýha;ppen to be the introducer
of the Bill which lias provoked this discussion. 1 relépecfully'suggest that it is not
in eider to debate subjects entirely apart
trein that of tihe subject-matter of the Bill,
we ouglht to refrain from se doing. I would
respecfully suggest that the dehate ho confined to the Bill before us.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I arn sure, 'Mr.
Sp~eaker, I feel very sorry, and I certainly
apologize to the House for having had to
take up this question in the way that I did.
We did oui duty as we saw it, and a man
in. this House--an honouraWble gentleman,
1 ehould say, in this. House--delibeately
inguitq and slurs every man who tried te
s
raise a battalion and who did bis duty
he saw it.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: -Mr. Speaker, I
rise to a point of eider. I can quote Hansard
te prove tlhat I -made no reference to other
honourable gentlemen., but ouly te three
nembers, of this, House. 1 did not refer to
every honerary colonel, or colonel, wbo
organized a regiment. Hansard will bear
me out in this; and to one of these heneurable gentlemen 1 did apelegize.
The Hon. the SPEA&KER: Honeurable
gentlemen, 1 do net like te interrupt rnembers who are speaking, but, my attention
the
having been called by the bonourable dh,the
Miisqter of Laibour te the tact that
cussion is going tee far, I hiope that honourable members will confine tbeir remarks
te the question before the Heuse.
Hon. Mi. SHARPE: It cornes in good
I
tinie, Mr. Speaker. I ha-d just finis.bed.
have ea-"d aIl I intented te say.
In conclusion, to corne back again te the
Bill, I maintain that- the legislatien wlhich
was neceseary hast yeai is just as necessary,
new, and I wilh certainhy support the
arnendmnrt rnoved by my honourable friend
from

Hon, the SPOIAKER.

is now before

Soie

people are under the impression that the
arnendment toý the Act of last ye-ar, which
the honourable the Minister of Labour is
jntroducin-, is an unfair method of obtaining so-me unreasonable advantage for labourT
organizatien. On the other hand, there
are persons throughout, the country who are
under tihe impression that the passing of
the Act of last year was an unf air and
,unoeason'able attack upon the rights, of
every British.Canadiafl subjeet. Perhaps
1 may be accused of repeating what others
have said in this House, but I would ask
the indulgence of the Senate for a few
moments whil.e I state the reasoris why I
intend to support the Ministeir of Labour
4
in the Bill which hie h"a broug ht down.
there may be no misunderIn erder that
standing as to the circumstances under
which the legisia-tion wa-s paseed, I would
once more remind the honou.rable members
of this Chamber, and the people of this
country, of the events that accurred ini
the year 1919. No man knowing the state
of mind of the peoples engaged in the rWOTld
war cani question the statement that we

nation -which had been engaged i the war
was in that condition. At that time, when
we were endeavouring to restcre -the happy
situation which had previeusly prevailed
in Canada, there was -thrust out of that
great western country and that great city
of Win-nipeg the red hand <>f rebellion
anarchy and revoit. The situation was not
that a few railroad nien had united for the
purpose of securing higlier wages; it was
net that a few street car conductors had
united to obtain sherter hours, or that the
city employees of Winnipeg, like the eniployees in other cities, hadl united for the
purpose of securing eoine advantage for
themaselves; but it w as that the red hand of
rebellion and revoit appeared at that tÈre.
Any man whoý knows Canada could
not but be asto-uiided when ihe heard

and similar conditions threatened us iii
these cities. The Government of this -country came before Parliament, and th's is
what they said: " W'e find that it is necessary, in order te deal with particular men
and particular phases of this trouble in
Winnipeg, that we, should have the right
te deport %vithout trial men who have
cornmitted offences, or are threatening- to
do so, althoughi they are British subjects
and cannot otherw:se

be

deported."

he

JUNE 1, 1920
Bill, as lias been stat ed. here, passed thc
lower Hou-se in ten minutes and passed
the Senate iu five minutes, because we al
realized that the condition existiug in Winnipeg and t.hroughout 'the country threatened 'the very existe-nce of ouT political
and national institutions.
I do not know whether or not that law
served any useful pur'pose in conuection
with the disturbance, but 1 always felt it
muet have -been a strong weapon in the
hauds of those charged with -the administration of the 1Law. However, there arose in
that great city of Xinunpeg the rplendid
body of men and womeu known as the
Committee of Oue Thousand, who united to
protect their city aud their country, and
who in so doing rwrote 'their names on the
pages of Cauada's history just as 8urely as
did the men who fell on the fields. of France
and Flanders, and no one should ever forgel the service they rendered net only to
Winnipeg, but to Canada. When their work
was done and order was restored, and wheu
the wheels of justice had begun to move
for the puuishment of those who were
deserving of puuishrnt, the whole labour
question in Canada, for the time being, was
settled.
Now the honourable the Minisýte-r of
Labour cornes before this Chamber and 'zays
that the condition which existed at that
time bas passed, and that the great labour
body of this country and a large number A1
British Canadians in Canada ask thlal the
law enacted last session be repealed. T do
not always agree with the honuouraible the
Minister of Labour. I doubt if there is iii
this Cha'mber any man who has differed
oftener with hini than I 'have. On the
other baud, although 'we may have disagreed, I have always respected hiqn, andi I
do to-day reýspec1t hlm, as the greatest repreeentative of labour in the Dominion of
Canada. I believe and know him to be a
great, brave .Canadian 'who, however inuch
he rnay sympathize 'with labour, is as interested asz any other man in this Ohamber
in the development of everything that is
Canadian and in the building up of a great
Canada; and I believe that the department
whichi he represeuts, no matter whether he
occupies that seat or not, rwill for ail time
plav an important part in the aff aira of our
country. He and -I have disagreed on other
important matters. or on matters which to
me seemed important; but, removing all
the electricity, 'bot!h inside and outside of
this room, and throwiug aside alI the frilîs
that have apparently bee.n used for the
purpose of surrounding this debate with
some mystery, he appeal5t te me aud he

4tgu

appeals to the Senate, and this is the
plain, simple proposition that he puts to us:
You, t.he Parliarnent of Canada, have placed
Britis-h-born Canadian citizens in a posit.ion
different frorn that of other citizens of
Canada. In other 'words, the Italian, the
Greek, the Russian or the Frencliman, who
have become Canadian citizens, cannot be
deported if they have lived in this country
for five years and have complied with al
the formalities neceseary in order to becorne Canadian citîzens; but, on the other
hand, under the law as it stands to-day,
a BritishÀbarn Canadian citizen cari be
taken -by the back of the neck and pitched
out of this country 'without that trial to
which every man with a drop of British
blood in his body lias for hundreds of vears
been entitled. That seemns to me the only
consideration which we should examine at
this moment. Have we t.reated, andi do we
treat, British-born citizens differe'ntly from
others? I u.nderstand the honourable the
Minister of Labour to say that we do. I
understand that under the amendment
made to the law we are in a position to
treat British-born citizens differently from
any others. My view of the future is different f roin that of some honourable gentlemen. I want to see a quiet, steady,
serious condition in Canada, w.hich I regret to say has flot existed during the last
few montlhs or the last few years. I want
to see a tendency among the citizens of
Canada to talk less about their provincial
and narro'w-iiinded politics than politicians
in Canada, in every province, have done in
the past year or t.wo. I do mot say that
such talk was not natural under the conditions which prevailed, but I look forward
to the time when the people of Canada will
unite in the desire to secure for Canada
that influx of people which. is necessary for
the developmnent of -the resources of this
country. Somne prefer one nationality,
others prefer another; some people do not
care whether the future citizens of Canada
corne frorn the north pole or -the south, or
fronm the east or the west, or where they
corne from. I have a preference. I do not
want to see this country built up with thousands or millions of people 'who are unable
te under.stand the political, national, relicious and other feelings that permeate tCe
best Canadian citizenship. I want to sec
the Dominion o.f Canada filled- with Britishirm c;rizeiis whý have cor here te help
devel,'p this country as men of thei: race
have donc in th,> paist. î do net warî:, ta see
nmmiratien re!arded. 1 do not war't ta
see any handicap put upon Irishmeu,
Scotchmen and Eng-lishmnen coming hiýre. by

SENATE
treating them differently in any respect
from ýthers. I want to see the hand o!
f riendship and ftellow ship extended to them,
in order that they may corne here with proper ideals in their heart and may assist in
developin-g that Canada which our fathers
dreamed cf, and which it is our proud hope
te aee realized. I say, honourable gentlemen, that having in mnd my duty to the
people I represent, and hobding the beliet that under the amended law ne critical condition can occur in this country
which cannot be deait with; without one
word of regret that the law was passed last
year; without a word cf apology to any
labour organization, because at that time ot
stress we were bound te take scame extraordinary action, but believing that the measure bas served the purpose for which it
was passed, I feel we sbould revert te the
normal condition, treating ail whu desire to,
corne te this country on the same plane.
I shall therefore vote agfainst the s.mendment ot the honourable Senator from Hamilton, and I shahl vote for the Bihl as introduced by tbe Minister et Labeur.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will the
henourable gentleman answer a question?
To which amendment et tbe Criminal Code
dees he reter?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.: The amendment ot
hast year.
What
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
section?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I bave net tbe sectien befere nie, but I wvill give it te the
honeurable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The Minister et Labeur was asked the sarne question. Se far nebody bas been able te turn
it Up.
Hen. -'%r. SCHAFFNER: I have very fe'w
words te say. My principal reason for rising is te ask a question et thé henourable
the Minister et Labour. I have had the henour et being a member et this Parliament
fer a number of years, and I must say that
I have found it more dîfficult te-day than
ever befere te make up my mind hew te
vote. I want te ask the Minister o! Labour
for a hlittle explanation ot his remarks on
page 460 et Hanisard:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My reason. honourable
gentlemen, for expressiflg the view that the
same conditions could not arise again is that
the Criminal Code itself has been se amended
since this legislation wa passed as to meet ail
necessary requirements and ail emergencles.

I was net present the ether day when the
discussion took place, but I wouhd like te
Hon.

fr. FOSTER.

know ail that the Minister of Labour ineans
by that declaration.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I amrn ot in a
position, honourable gentlemen, te quote
the section et the Bill, but 1 think honourable gentlemen will remnember that it wvas
found that the Criminal Code did not sufficiently define the termn -sedition," or was
flot clear as to what were the rights of the
individual at the time. There was no
doubt it was because, ot the tact that the
code was in doubt that these amendments
to the Immigration Act were breught down
on the 7th June, 1919, when in the opinion
of the Government and of Parliament it
was necessary that prompt and adequate
action to, meet any emergency should, be
taken. This législation was therefore passed. I think the Solicitor General did, bring
in an amendanent to the Criminal Code at
the t ail session. I do flot recail the details
o! that.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Does flot the
honourable gentleman inean the amendment to the Naturalization Act?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 stand corrected. .It may be the Naturalization Act.
At any rate, the necessary steps were taken
to amend our statutes, so that the necessity
which existed on the 7th o! June, 1919, for
the passing ot the amendment which we did
pass, to the Immigration. Act, exiated ne
longer.
I'do not desire to take up time, Mr.
Speaker, except to, answer the question, but
while I arn on my feet may 1 inquire of
the henourable the Speaker on a point ef
information? I understood you, Sir, the
other day to state that it would not be my
privilege to speak again upon the Bill. I
woui'd point out to the flouse that as the
introducer of the Bill I should be, either by
right or by consent, permitted to say a few
words in closing, because sorne o! the observations made concerning the Bill deserve reference on my part before the debate is closed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: What I said
the other day was that you had no right
te, speak a second tîme on the arnendynent,
but that after the amendment had been
voted on you had the right to close the
debate on the second reading o! the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Honourable gentlemien, it has been said that the reasen and
the necessity for this legislation a year ago
dees net exist tc-day. .1wish. I could believe
that; but I amn sorry 4te say I cannot. 'Canada is not normal, and tI doubt if it will be

471

JUNE 1, 1920
normal inside of three or four years. During
that 'period I do not see what harmn can
resuit *from le-aving this Act on the statute
book. It will flot affect ýpersons in Canad-a
who are <obeying the laws9; it will affect
only such perrons as will not obey t.he law.
The honourable gentleman from Montreal
(HBon. Mr. Dandurand) bas said that this
Act discriminates, as it applies. only to
Britieh-born Canadian citizene. [l would be
very glad te see the tAd amended to include
ail citizens regardless of where they were
born, and allowed te stand in that way
until conditions become normal. !I think
that in this country, and in nearly every
country in the world, 'we are quite liable
to see greater agitation and greater trouble
from, the Bc>shevilri and other people who
are tirying to upset Govern'ments erverywhere
than we have ever seen in the past. It seems
to mie ithat the Act aa it stands, is much. the
same as the storing of gunst, rifles, and
ammunition by the Government, and I tbink
it would be lquite in order if the law were
to say ta the people whoma it affecte that
their gurrs, rifles and am-munition should
be taken out and dum.ped in the Atlantic,
because they are going te be good citizens
thereatter and will not use them. Il they
are good citizens, the law- will flot affect
them. Therefore 1 shall vote for the amendment.
The proposed amnendment of Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton was negatived on the following division:

te the tact that the honourable !rnember from

the firat time because he was. paired with
the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff); but that he broke bis

That is my understanding.

ag-reed to it. Now, I hope the serne measure cf courtesy will be ext-ended te me.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 arn perwetly willing to take the judgînent ef the

Hon. Mr. POWER: The Governiinent are
responsible for the transaction of the buýsiness of the House, and in the past, under
former administrations, the leader cf the
Government did flot delegate the power to
set the time of adjourniment to any 'backbench 'membher who chose to press it. 1
think we had 'better stick to the nid mile.
Further, I believe'there is some hope that
we may exipect prorogation before the end
of this month, and I do net think that
we weuld be justified in adjourning beyend
next Tuesday at any rate.

BRITISH

COLU'MBIA INDIAN
BILL.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
REPORTED.

LANDS
AND

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
that the Senate go into Committee on Bill
13, an Act to provide for the Settiemerit
of Differences betcween the Goverrunents
of the Dominion o! Canada and the Province
of British Columbia respecting Indian
Landis andi certain other Indian Af!airs in
t-he said Province.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Before the House
goes into Com.xittee I should like ta say
a 'word or two with respect to this anatter.
Honourable gentlemen may perhs.ps remember that .1 asked yesterday that the
consideration of the Bill mîgbt be poatponiec until to-day. 1 finci there is a statement submitted on behaif o! the Indian tribes o! Briish Columbia, a.nd alter
reading it over with a reasonable amount
of care, I thinik the Indians 'have -made out
a decidedly strong icase te the effect that
they have not been dealt with fairly in connection with these lands in British Columbie; andi, inasmuch as tbe honourable
leader o! the House does not expeet to
have anything to do in the rway of parliamentary business otiher than this during
the next week, per'aps it would ibe a gooci
idea, -for bim to take a !ew days to look
into the dlaimis of the -Indians so that when
we meet &gain he iwould be in a position
ta submit a reasonable andi fair Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, -when I subinitteci this Bill
for second readîng I took occasion to say
that in the judgment of the Governinent it
would not ha desirable to refer this to a
special committee in order t.o hear those wvho
are seif-appointeci state what tbey regard
as the claima o! British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My bonourable
frienci aays "self-appointed."'
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:- But the Indian
chiefs are appointeci by the Indian tribes
andi are represetitative.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Thir. may
possibly involve mny anaking e statement
o4 a sort which I usually endeavour not
to make, casting reflectiona upon individuals. If there 'be any dissatis!action-and
one would judge froin the circulars whicla
have been issueci that that is tbe condition
of the Indian tribes in British Colunmbiait is largely, if nlot wbolly, due to one indu-

vidual, whio is a self-appointed ilissioner,
so to speak, of the Indians of that province.
Since 1908, 1 think it would be, this matter
has been stirred up amongest the Indians
of British Columbia, and the Goveriment
of Sir Wil-frid Laurier was confronted -with
the saie problems that are being thrust
ispon us to-day. In the Crown colony days
flot only o'f Vancouver ialand but of the
mainland, and aiterwards of .both when
theybecs.me the province o! British Columnbia, and since British Columbia joined the
union, the saie policy has been .pursued in
regard to the Indians o! that province as
we are 'following today, 7te inIperial
authorities in the Crown colony days ailotted certain landsa for the occupation andi
use o! the Indians. When the tiwo Crown
colonies came together that saie policy
waà pursued by the united colony of British
Columrbia, and when British Columubia
joined the Union provision .was made that
the Indians should be similarly treateci
by the Governnient of Canada, andi that
has been consistently done. Not only has
it been. consistently done, *but if there bas
been any departure froin fhat ,policy it bas
been along the lines o! greater genero-sity
being extendeci to the Indiane than et any
previous tîme.
There appeared upon the scene soee
years ago a certain gentleman, who apparently made it bis mission in life to promote
dissatisfaction amongast tbe Indiana of that
province and to induce tbemn to make
what I might teri the preposterous claim
of having an interest lIn the land titie of
the 'wbole o! British Columnbia. They asserted tbeir dlaim not only -to the aboriginal
title of their reserves, but to the 'whole of
the province.
The Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and
thiaý Government also, I understand, consented. in view o! the agitation whîch haci
been stirreci up by the means to whichi i
have alluded, to subinit to the Privy Council, through the proper channels, the question o! the aboriginal tities and to pay the
Indians compensation therefor. But this la
not considereci sufficient; the wbole title of
landsa in British Columbia must necessarily
become disturbed ta satsify the claima of
those whio are'responsible for this movement. Moreover, this same gentleman assumeci the responsibility, on twvo or three
occasions, of petitioning the Privy Council
of his own motion te disturb the statua

Columbia, andi to de-al with thia important

Privy Council of course rejected the dlaim,
it could not do otherwise. It could not gîve
censideration to se important a problem
unless the Government of Canada set the
case in motion, and this the Government ef
Canada refused to do.
For a number of years there have been
certain differences between the province of
British Columbia and the G'overnment of
Canada touching the Indian reserves. For
the information of honourable gentlemen
who were not present when I moved the
second reading of this Bill, 1 might say that
about -thoee-quarters of a million acres of
land have been set aside by the Goverument of British Columbia for Indian reserves in th.at province. Tliere are about
20,000 Indians in British Columbia, and
the reserves which have been allotted te
thema for their occupation and use have flot
been entirely used or occupied. My honourable friend <Hon. Mr. Bostock) read an
Oider in Council, passed as long ago as
the time when the Mackenzie Government
was in office, in which it was stated that
a commission representing both Governments should be appointed te- adjust those

was done upon the subject until 1912. [n
that year both Governments tiook up -the
subject. An Order in Council was passed
by the Dominion Government making provision, in pursuance of the agreement that
had been entered into between the two Governiments, for the appointment of a joint
Royal Commission te inquire into ail those
differences with a view to adjusting them
and to reaching a common understanding
regarding the future treatment of the InThe British
dians o4 B3ritish C'olumbia.
Columbia Government appointed a certain
number od gentlemen to that Commission.
and a like number were appointed by the
Dominion Government. They proceeded in
the beginning of 1913 to investigate the
differences which were submitted to them
for adjustment, and in 1916 they made a
report. The main question that was deait
with in that report was the reduction of
certain Indian reserves. The Commission
it very desirable that that
considered
should be done. Accordingly, those reserves were reduced by some 47,000 acres,
and the Government of British Columbia
transferred, or agreed to transfer, to the
Indians, in lieu o! the 47,000 acres of duioff, some 80,000 acres. There were certain
Indians in British Columbia who, I understand, had not been furnished with reserves, -and provision was accordingly made
for the occupation o! certain lands, whîch
Hon. sir JAMMES LOIJGHEED.

were delimited hy the Royal Commission
for the use o! those particular Indians.
The main question to be decided between
the two Governments is this-'and it is one
o! great importance to the Indians; and
what is of importance to the Indians is, of
course, important te the public o! British
Columbia-in fact, to the public Mf Canada;
because it da not desirable that there should
be any dissatisfaction in the minds of the
Indians, in regard to the lireatment accerded to themn by t>his Government or the
The province of
Provincial Government.
British Columbia, 8ince its entry into the
Union, claimed that it had a reversionary
interest in ail the Indi-an lands. It had
conveyed, as I have already saîd, about
three-quarters of a million acres te the
Indians for reserves, for their occupation
and use; but it claimed that at ail limes
it had ax:eversionary interest in those lands.
That is to say, by way of illustration, if, as
provided for by the Indian Act, the Indians
agree te the surrender of any portion of
their reserves, that reversionary interest
had te be satisfied before a transfer cf those
lands could be made. The consequence
was that if a surrender cf certain lands
should be made te A, then either A or the
Indians had te p!iy te the province cf
British Columubia whatever consideration
might be fixed for the transfer or surrender
of its reversienary interest.
IHonourable gentlemen can readily se
that a situation of that lcind would be provocative cf more or less trouble, and it was
very undesirable that friction should be
caused by 'this constant as6ertion cf the
right which British Columbia apparently
had. In the other provinces cf the Dominion the reversion cf the tible te Indian
land passes te the province in the event
cd the Indian tribe occupying any particular
land beceming extinct; and it m-as therefore very desirable that the land tenure in
British Columbia, se far as the reserves
are con'cerned, should be on the same hasis
as in the other provinces of Canada. This
was one of the oubjects, in addition to
either the reduction or the extension o! the
reserve6, dealt with iby the Commission. It
has been dealt with satisfactorily, se that
hereafter the province cf British Columbia
will -be in the samne position as the other
provinces, cf Canada se far as the reversionary interest 'la cencerned.
There were a number cf miner matters
lt therefore became neaise dealt with.
cessarv that effect should be gîven to the
findinigs cf the Royal Commission. The
only departure that this legislation miakes

JUNE 2, 1920
in regard to the agreement which had been
entered into and the report which had been
determined upon ids 'with reference to the
surrender of the cut-offs wbich 'had been
taken from certain reserves. I do not know
that the matter w.as seriously considered,
but it was anticipated that the Indians
would probably surrender the cut-offs under
the provisions of the Indian Act. But, in
the adjustment of matters o! that kind,
more or less dissatisfaction la, of course,
bound to arise. The consequence is. that
both Govenments have assumed the responsibility of saying te their respective legislatures that it is desirable that power should
be vested in -both *Governmenta te dispense
with the surrender .by the Indians of those
particular cut-ofis. We are flot invading
the Indian Act. When this matter was up
for consideration the other day the opinion seemed to prevail that we were entirely
overriding the Indian Act as to the Indians
deliberately or willingly eurrendering their
land. We are simply confining the exercise o! the power to these 47,000 acres by
which we are -reducing the reserves, and
we are in turn conveying te the Indians
almost double that quantity of land.
Honourable gentlemen have been urging
-and the demand bas been, I understand,
circularized amongst -the inembers of the
Senate--that this Bill ehould *be referred to
a special committee for the purpose of hearing certain of the Indianis, and, more particularly, for the purpose o! hearing the
gentleman te whom I have referred, and
who seeme to have assumed the responsibîlity of being the -epokesman for the Indiarls o! British Columbia. When this
matter was -before the rHouse o! Gommons,

should be heard. Tbey were beard, ostensibly, in the first place ilpon Bill 14;
but alil parties wvbo appeared before the
Coninittee of the Commons insisted upon
o'btruding upon the Commons their representatioris concerning this Bill, and, notwitbstanding the protests of the Committee,
it was ifinally deterrnined to bear the wbole
matter. lit was heard by the Commons Committee, and I may say no weîght was given
te the repreeentations. It bas been pointed
out to me by the -Government-, and likewise
by members of the Commons from British
Columbia, that it is not desira;ble that tbis
matter sbould be further stirred up among6t
the Indians. I say unhesitatingly that the

man -who -aasumes, the respons-ibility of
-stirring up the Indians aseumnes a very
grave responsibility and sbould not be encouraged in that by Parliament. Tbat is
the attitude which the Government takes,
and which I hope this Senate will take,
upon this particul-ar subject.
8ome Hon. SENLXTCRS: îHear, hear.
The
Hon. Sir JAJMES ~LIOUGHEED:
province of British Columbhia has, with a
parental attention, I might say, looked after
The
thoee Indians since Confederation.
Government of Canada bas done likewise.
The treatment of the Indians by the Government ofCanada bas been proverbial for
sympathy, for generosity, and for ail that
parental solicitude could do for any section
of the population. I say unhesitatingly,
honourable gentlemen, that no greater attention or sympathy bas been given to any
subjeèt with which the Government of Canada is charged than to the Indian question.
The treatment by Canada of the Indians
has alwaye been pointed to iby the United
States as one of the greatest tributes that
can be paid f0 the Dominion. In the treatment of the native tribes Canada bas proverbially stood above every other country.
New, 1 ask, is it desiraeble at this particular
tirne th-at conqideration, 'weight, and serionsness should be given to any one individual
who mnay choose te travel ifrom tribe to tribe
throughoiit the province and create dissatisfaction and stir up trouble among the Idians? 1 say no, honourable gentlemen. We
feel that the responsibility resta upon us
not to be party te that. The Government
of British Columibia and the Go'verrrme'nt
of Canada have corne together. The Royal
Commission, representing both Governments, -and extending over some three years
of continuous labour, paid the olosest attention to the different questions sub-mitted
bv the Indians, wîth the resuit that they
have arrived at the report already submitted
to Parlianment to twhich I have Teferred,
and te -which it is poposed to give effect
by the legisiation before us. The province
o! British Colunbia passed almost precisely
similar legisiation to that which rwe have
before us. This is an enabling Act to permit
both Governments to come together, and
to give efiect te the find'ings contained -in
the -report. I mîight say further, honourable
gentlemen, that we do not propose to exclude the dlaims o~f the Indians. It wîll
be inanifest to every honouraible gentleman that if the Indians have dlaims anterior to Confederation, or anterior to the
creation of the t'wo Crown colonies in- the
province of B3ritish Columbia, they could

SENATE
be adjustcd or Settlcd bY the Imperial
authorities. Those dlaimis are stili valid.
If the dlaim be a valid one wvhich is being
advanced by this gentleman and those associated with him as to the Indian tribes of
British Coluambia being entitled te the
whole of the lands in British Columbia, this
Gevernment cannot dist-urb that dlaim. That
dlaim can stili be asserted in the duture.
But whatever differences exist between this
Government and the 'Goverument of British
Columbia, it is very desirable that they
should be settled, and that ýboth Governments should unite in a mutual and ceoperative plan for the purpese ot doing what
is in the best interests ef the Indians in
that province.
Under these circuinstances, I do not think
it is in the interest et the Indians themselves, it is net in the interest ef the two
Gevernments involved, and it is net in
the interest ef the public, that this matter
should be Jurther stirred up. And let me
point out this: that the same problems
which are now being thrashed out in this
agitation would be thrashed out in every
province et Canada. They affect the Indians ef every province and would be coinmon te, all the Indians ef every prevince;
and, if carried te their logical conclusion,
would, instil unrest in the minds ai all the
Indians et e'very province, and weuld disturb the land tenure et the Dominion. I
therefere think that a Ceomnittee et the
Whele House 'would, be better adapted than
a small Committee çwhich 'we might select
the
te deal with the subject. I invite
closest attention et every honourable gentlemnan te the matter, and ask him te give
his best and mest intelligent consideratien
te the questions involved in the Bill.
Hen. HEWITT BOSTOCK: There are certain differences between my honourable
friend and myseif in regard te this question.
He would lead one to suppost that the attitude e.f the Gevernment with regard te it had
net changed at -ail et late years. 'He referred te the tact that the -question was
breught up in the time et the Government
et the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, when in the West, had this questien placed betore him, net enly at Prince
]Rupert, but at Kamloops, and on mne occasien made this statene'nt:
The situation arisipg trom the refusai of
Brktlsh Columbia te consent to a reference ot

deleglaitien, said:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

agreed te leave eut et the question the very
thing he wants te have a decisien upon. We
do net know if we dan terce a Government
into court. If we dan flnd a 'way I xnay say we
shall surely do se, because everybody will agree
it is a inatter of goed governiment te have no
one reetlng under -a grievance. The Indians will
continue te belleve, they have a grievance until
it has bien settled byy the court thsaît they have
a dlaim or that they have ne claim."

Now. I have understood that it was the
attitude et the Dominion Government, practically up te the time this Bill was brouglit
into Parliament, that there was a dlaim
on the part et the Indians that ought te be
settled; and, if I understand the position
st the present time, they feel that they
should stili have the right te test that dlaim
eut, and they tear that the legisiation which
is new before the House would prevent
fhemn dealing with that matter and putting
their case torward in the way in which they
desire. My honourable friend has said that
they tried te have their case put betore
the Judioial Cemmittee et the Privy Council. That is pertectly true. They tried te
do that, and on previeus occasions the Dominion Government recognized, I think,
that there was seme justice in the dlaim on
the part of the Indians that they should
be heard in this matter. Away -back in
1875 the Minister et Justice had te deal with
this question, and on the 2nd of Novemnber,
1875, the then Minister et the Interior addressed a letter te the Government et British Columbia in which he said:
on 2nd November, 1874. the then Minister
of the interlor, in a letter addressed te the Gevernment of British Columbia, said:

but because the Indians have net been sufficiently united.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This is a memorial

1874.
Hon. Mr. BLAIEN: Whom. is the niemorial

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is a miemnorial

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can the
honourable gentleman tell us why the question ivas not settled in 1874, inasmucli as
it scenis to have been a very live one-Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My understanding
of thie whiole situation is that the question
lias neyer Ibeen settled because Britishi

lion wvas placed in the hands of the Domiinion Governiinent, and. as I stated on the
second readi.ng of this Bill, the Domiinion
Goveinment miade au arrangement as to
certain lands in British Columbia in the
year 1899, when they settled with regard
to land in what is known as the Peace
River district, and a.lso in the northern
territory. Thaît, I 6ay, is one reason why
the Indians think that the whole question
should be deait with in the saine way, and
that the Indians in the northern part of
British Columbhia sliould xiot be placed in
a different position.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Is there any doubt
about their having agreed to it?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have not discussed, the matter with the present provincial Gcvernment at ail, but I have here
an Act passed *by the British Columbia
Legisiature which I niight read to the
House. This Act 'was assented to on the
29th o!f March, 1919. There are two clauses
in it. The first is ent.itled: -"Power to give
effeet to report of Commission and settie
ail differences." The other reads as follows:
Without limiting the general powers by this
In

Councîl may, for the purpose of adjusting, Teadjusting, or confirming the reductions. cutoffs, and additions in respect of Indian Reserves proposed In the said report of the Commission. carry on such further negotiations and
enter into such further agreements, whether
with the Dominion Government or with the
Indians, as may be found necessary for a full

and final adjustment of the differences between
the said Governments.

As far as I know, that represents the position of! the provincial Government to-day.
I understand that sanie question with regard to this clause of the Bill hias corne up
i Ottawa, and t.hat the Justice Departnient takes the view that the province of
Britsh Columnbia lias no authority to negotiate viti the Indians directly, but that
the negotiations ¶nust be carried on between the two Governments, the Dominion
Government representing the Indians.

Honi. Mr. TANNER: I arn asking sny
honourable .triend's opinion of that statute.
Does hie think it is sufficient te enable the
British Columibia Governmnent to carry into
effect the arrangement yroposed under the
Bill before the House?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Oh, yes. 1 think
this Act psssed hy the provincial Government will certainly enïble them to do £11
that is necessary; but the point is that
it is a full u~nd final adjustinent of ail differences betweenthe two Governmeiits.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The British Columbia Goverument are ooncurring in .proposed

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yeýs, so far as 1

The
no responsibility to the Indians.
British Cohjsrbia Governiment have «l
along taken the stand that there was ne
questidn. of title te be settled with the Indians. That was very clearly brought out
in the report made by J. A. J. McKenna,
whieh had te do in the first instance with
the appoinitment of this Commission. In
that report Mr. McKenna said:
The position taken by the province was that
the titie of Indiana to lands reserved for themn
was a mere right of use and occupancy; that
under ad article no beneticial Interest in such
lands was to be taken by the Dominion as
guardian of the Indiana; and that whenever the
Indian right to any such lands or to any portion thereof becamne ezxtingui5hed through surrender or cessation of use or occupation or diminishmeult of numbers, the land reverted. unThe Indians, as
burdened, to the province.
they advanced in knowiedge of affaire, becamne
aware that they were not regarded as havlng
the same right in reserved lands as Indians
in other parts of Canada were recognized as
having in lands set apart for them.

honourable triend has spoken cf perM-Ny
sons going about agitating amongst the Indians regarding this ques.tion; but this is
net due to the work of any individual agitator, so f ar as I know, althiough the gentleman te whom he refers has of course busied

doubt that the Indians will be quieted
simply by the over-riding of -anything that
is said by this gentleman. The Indians
themselves k-now the situation, and there
is danger that they may feel that they have
net been fairly treated and are net hein,gýiven a fair hearing in this rnatter, and
that they will therefore have a grievance

should do ail we can to satisf y tho6e people
and let them understand that we wish te

The purpose of the Bill before us is to,
confirm the -arrangement made by the Coinmissi'n, which. was -the outceme of that
report of Mr. McKenna. The fact that this

Hon.!Mr. GIRROIR: I should. like to get
a littie information. We tram the -East
do not understand this question very well.
Canno4 these Indians bring an action in the
courts tio deterinine the validity of their

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think the best
answer I can make to my honour-able friend

is this. ~1

te keep it clear, but th.at statement of Sir

my honourable friend a question. As my

these matters, but if I understand the situatian the British Golumbia LegisIature have
pa.ssed anu enabling 'Act.

JUNE 2, 1920
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. OB>SBY: And if I understand
this Bill aright, it also is an enabling Bill
tio provide fer the two Governmente getting
together and giving proper and special consideration to the settleme.nt of this whole
question. k!m I r.ight in that?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes, but it goes
further than that.
Hlon. Mr. CROSBY: If it goes further,
then so much the botter for the Indians.
I do not want to make a speech, but it
iseems to me that the two Governments
which. are having these enabling measures
passed may well be trusted, by means of a
commission or in soine other manner, to
settie this question satisfactorily to the Indians. If that be so, I can se no harm in
cur passing the Bill which is before use.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would point out
to the honourable gentleman that the Bill
now before the House purports to deal with
this question as a full and final adjustment
of ail differences. That puts the Government in the position that if later on there
is any question decided with regard to the
claims which the Indians themselves make,
'the Government cannot go back to the««Pro.vincial Government and Bay, ««Now, we
want you to give us more land," or, "we
want you to do this, or Vo do that," because
the Provincial Government can refer them.
to their own Bill, which says that this is to
be a full and final adjustment.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Would the honourable gentleman tell us what really is
the Indians' dlaim?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN:- That is just what
we would like to know. I do not know.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is a rather difficuit question to answer exactly. My lionourable friend knows that, ail kinds o! rash
statements or extreme dlaims may be made
on this account. But, as I understand, the
dlaim o! the Indians is that their aborig-inal titie, whatever that amounts to, has
,neyer been settled for.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The title to the
whole province?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOÇK: To the whole proxince of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUN-TON: Has not
the Privy Council passed upon the question of aborigfinal titile in other provinces
many imes?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think it has.

479

Hon. Mr. LYNCU-STAUNTON: Has not
the Privy Council passed upon the aboriginal claims in Ontario more than once?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I arn not in a position to speak definitely about that. I think
lhere have been questions referred to the
iPrivy Council, but not in regard to British
éColumbia.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The Indians have always understood that they
had no lee simple in the lands at ail; that
they were only wards of the Crown, as it
were, and had no real titie except what the
Crown gave them. The Privy Council has
.decided that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOÇK: If the Privy Coun-cil has decided that in one case, then why
not allow this question to be decided?
The
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
judgmrent is of universal application in t.he
Dominion of Canada, I think.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
Bill will not prevent the Indians fromi hav-ing the question settled.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Are there any halfbreeds among the Indians?
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOÇK: Not that I know
of. I have not seen any half-breeds.*
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS:- The reason I ask
is that I know that the question of the
titie of the half-breed in the Northwest was
,settled by the Governrnent issuing script.
I thought there might be sorne half-breeds
in British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There are of course
a number of half-breeds in British Columbia. I suppose some of thern might be
interested in this matter. It ail dependsHon. Mr. GIRROIR: I did flot get an
answer to my question. Cannot the Indians bring- action in the courts for a de,claration of their titie?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: As I understand
the situation, the Indians thernselves cannot sue in court. The Indians would have
to depend on the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: They are wards of
the Government.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: They would have
to depend on the Government taking
action. The Government is the trustee.
Hon. Sir JAM1ES LOUGHEE'D: Will my
honourable !friend permit ne -to intervene?
I may perhaps t.hrow a littie light upon this

The Indians of British Columbia Ghail. by

Council decides that they have a title to lands
of the Province, to surrender such title, receiving from the Dominion benefits to be granted
for extinguishrnent of titie In accordance wlth
past usage of the Crown.

The Indians at the present time, if 1
understand their -attitude, think they are
being asked to give up any claimi that they
have before they go into court, and the
question is whether that impression of theirs
can be dispelled.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Now, may

friend? Would lie be 'willing that the whole
of the land tenure of British Columbia
should be piaced in the balance, as in this
case, without pro-per saieguards?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does.
The Indians claini to bc entitled to ail

thein Nvhethier they were in a position to

said that the terns of reference did not give

Hon. Sir JA-MFS LOUGHEED: And we

Hon. '\r. BOSTOCK: The Royal Commisappointed for the purpose of deaision w

whole que.stiofl has corne up because the
Indians have feit that here is a danger that
this 1egislation iay put them in such a

Hon. Mr. I3OSTOCK: The feeling of the

their position and are net prepared to place
the Indians in a position as favourable for
dealing with this matter as they wouhd have
been placed in by the proposai made by the

cases taken into court.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK:- But if there slhould

tW more land than t.hey have so far received,
the British Columbia Government would flot
be in a position to gîve that land to the
Dominion Governmenit for the purpose.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
not the question s.t issue. :My honourable
friend wdll not say that the question at
issue is as to whether the present Indian
reserves are sufficient or insufficient. The
question, as my honourable friend knows,
involves the Indian title to the whole province o! British Columbia.
Hon. -Mr. LYNCOH-STAUNTON: Would
the honourabie gentleman tell us if the Indians suýcceeded in this case what wouid
they expect to get?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: That is what I wouid
like to know.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Suppose
the litigation takes place and they succeed,
what do tbey expect to get that they are
not no-w getting,
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The whole matter
is so complicated that it is very difficuit to
give the honourable gentleman a direct answer. As I think 1 stated -before, the Indians may have very great expectations in
this matter.
Hon. M. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What is
their smallest expectation?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What is the least
they would take?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I really cannot give

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We can take the
assurance of the honourable leader of the
Governinent that if this B3ill passes the Indians will stili be in the same position.
When this question is settled, which they
dlaim ought to be settled, 'I think their objection to the Bill would 'be done away
with; but their feeling is that this Bili in
its present form is going to debar them
from. having that question settled.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What
material. benefit would they expect to lose
if this Bill goes through?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Ail they want is a
grievance.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No, I do not think

point is that this Bull deals with two things.
First of ail, there is the statement in clause
2 of the Bifl that this is a final and funll
adjustment of al their dlaims, and they
feel that they are being placed in a position
in which they inay not be able to get this
question of titie settled.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: As the
honourable gentleman knows, they have
been agîtating for many years, and surely
they have corne to some conclusion as to
what they want.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have neyer heard
any definite 'conclusion stated. Clause 3
of the Bill says, regarding the question of
the reserves that have 'been deait with by
the Commission, and from which cut-offs
or reductions have been made, as referred
to by my honouraible !riend, that notwithstanding any provision of the Indian Act
to the contrary, the Governor in CouncilMay carry on such further negotiations and
enter Into such further agreements with the
Government of the province of British Columbia as may be found necessary.

That is another point altogether, and
the Indians of those reserves are flot alto-et.her satisfied 'with the findings of *the
Cèommrission. They want to be heard; they
are xiot satisfied to have this question settled in this way by the Governanent. The
Department here nIay be desirous of doîng
ail they cein for the Indians, but they bave
to act through their agents in the various
parts of the province. Honourable gentlemien niay ha-ve heard of the Kitsilano reserve. The province undertook to deal with
that -question and made a settlement with
certain Indians, whîch was overthrown by
the courts; and there -are some seventy

there is sonie settlement o! that particular
phase, that the Indians will feel that they
have not been fairly trcated.
The other day the Government of
Governient
the
Dominion and
the
at Washington came to an agreement relating ta fishing for soekeye saimon on the
Fraser river. For a great nuniber of years
that question has been a troublesome one.
I want to draw the attention of the House
to the situation in that regard as I see it.
Honourable gentlemen will see that on page
444 of the report of the Royal Commission
which rwe have Meore us, there is a imap
o! the reserves in what is known as the
Lytton agency. The map shows the aid reserves, the new reserves that have been
set apart, and the cut-ofis. Honouraible gentle.men will see that the reserves are on
bath sides o! the Fraser river; they w iii see
also that a number of the reserves -are
amall. Any honourable gentlemen who have
been down the Fraser river 'will k-now what
the country is like down ta *the coast, and
that irom Lytton dawn ta Yale the reserves
are only places where the Indians can go
every year and pitch their tents and. fish
for the salmon and amoke them, to carry
them a-way back ta the places 'where they
live for use in the winter. No'w, under
this fishery agreement, which. I -understand
lias been co4mpleted, section 5 o! the International Regulations for the protection and
preservation of the sockeye sainon fisheries
of the Fraser river system reads as follo.wS:
No net fiahing or fishing of any kind, other
than with hoak and une. except for hatchery
purpasea or scientific purpoaei, shaîl be permiasible in the Fraser river abave the dawnriver aide of Miasian Bridge.

As my hanourable friend from Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor) probabiy knows very
well, the down-rîver iside of Mission Bridge

other agencies are excluded frorn fishing
Lhere for sockeye salmon.
The other day I read ta the House froin a
report of Mr. Babcock, wvho is the Fishiery
Commissioner for the province of B3ritish
Columbia. What I read was for the purpose of showing what in his opinion the
Indians would have to do. He also said in
that Teport:
The Indiana resident in the Fraser river

The Chilcotin river is of course a god

I have réferred, and the question is whether
under these regulationis the Chilcotin, which
is a tributary of the Fraser river, wauld
be included. The treaty itseli refers te
the Fraser river and the Chilcotin -river.
but honourabie gentlemen will notice that
in the section whichi 1 just read only the
Fraser river iG mentioned. That, no doubt,
is a question for legal gentlemen to decide.
The report goes on to say:Thase taken by Indiana fram the Fraser
basin above the mouth of the Chilcotin is given
at 20,000, and between the mouth of the Chilcotin
and Bridge rivera at 40,000 odd; while thaae
along the banka of the Thonipson andS Shuawap
and Adams lakea at 30,000 ; in the canyon of
the Fraser and Yale, at 15,000; and in the
Harriaan-Lloaet lakea aectian, at 40,000. The
figures here given include only aockeye that
were taken. dressed andl cured. They do not
include the other species of aalman taken or
the sockeye consumed In a fresh atate. The
catches made by Indians in the years of the
big runs previaus ta 1913 we re nat a seriaus
drain on the run of those years. The nuirnhers
taken during the lean yeara, -though considera-bly less than in the big yeara. was a seriaus
drain an the spawning ýbeds. During the last
decade. none of the tribes above the canyon at
Yale have been able ta get any cansiderable
number ini any lean year, and their catches In
bath 1913 and 1917 djd not exceed those of
early lean years. The drain on the runs was
neverthelesa serious.

That wili 6how the position on the Fraser
river.

Is My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend aware that the *Governnient ha&always been ready ta furnisli supplies for the Indiands in lieu af the saînion?
In the interest of the fisheries it is flot de-

JUINE 2, 1920
sirable that this fi6hing should be carried
on.
Hon. 04r. BOSTOCK: At the sarne tirne,
last year an Indian was caught fishing in
the Fraser river, and he wae hauled up and
fined $500. That sort of thing is going to
rankle very much in their minds.
Hon. Mir. LYNCJH-STAUN'ON: Is not
that a matter that should have been brought
up when the treaty was settled? It cannot
corne up now.
-Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It may be a matter
that the Canadian Government should have
brought Up.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: Does not
the treaty govern it now?
Han. Mr. BOSTOCX: I think it does.
But this shows that the Departrnent of Indian Af airs was not watching the interests of the Indians when dealing with. the
treaty; it shows the House that the Indians
have not been getting the consideration
which they deserve from the Departrnent;
and it shows that, if there is a feeling of
unrest, as my honourable friend has stated,
there le some «round for the Indians feeling that they are not beingc properly treated.
I have tried to explaîn the situation to
honourable gentlemen so that they may understand it. I do not want honourable gentlemen to think that I have brought this
matter up with any intention of stirring
up trouble in the country; on the contrary,
I 'want to allay as much as possible any
trouble. It would be very serious if anythîng Nvere done whieh would iead the Indians to be.lieve that the Government is not
treating them fairly and as they deserve.
I arn sorry to say that soie of the Indian
agents in British Columbia are not what
I thirik they ehould be. I think -it le only
right that the Department should go very
carefully into the matter and make some
changes in their agents in British Columbia.
Those men represent the Department, and
if they are not doing the right thing by t.he
Indians, the Indians get -the idea that the
Department is not looking a.fter their interests, and they have flot the confidence
in the Departrnent that they should have.
That is a very serious inatter, and I want
to impress iipon the Governiment the desirability of giving it carefuil consideration.
Before I leave the question of the fisheries 1 want to refer the House to what the
Commission itself said about this matter.
On pages 542 and W4 of the report I find
the follo.wing:

Minute
Fisbing Rights Of Indians in B.C.
and Resolution of the Gth June, 1916:
CommisReserves
Whereas former Indiaui
sioners. aotÀng joint Governmental agr*eements.
allotted deflned flshery rights to certain tribes
or -bands of Indians in British Columbia;
Whereas this Comsnission has been unable
to obtain any advice from the law officers of
the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada
as to the authority of the said former Cornmissioners to allot such fishery rights--

Apparently that, is an admrission on the
part of the Fishery *Conmissioners that
flshery .rights 'were allotted to the Indians
on previous occasionsAnd Whereas this Commission desires that
any right or title which Indians may -have to
sikh allotted. fisheries xnay flot be adversely
affected by inaction on its partBe It resolved: That. to the extent to which
the allotting Commissioners had authority to
allot such fishery rights, this Commission, Insofar as the power may lie in it e0 tW do, con-'
firms the sald allotted - fishery rights, as set
forth in the schedule hereto appended.
Then the report deals with the varionus
tribes in the Lytton agency, to -which I
have already referred:
Anderson Lake Tribe. Minute of Decision of
September 5. 1881, constitutlng Anderson Lake
Reserve No. 1: The exclusive rîght of salmon
flshing on Mosquito river through the entire
length of reserve No. 1, a distance of 1 mile.
Bridge River Tribe. Minute of Decision of
September 1, 1881, constitutlng Bridge River
Reserve No. 2: The exclusive rlght of salmon
flshing on both banks of the Fraser river from
hall a mnle south of Bridge river upsltream. to

Fountain Indian fishery.

1 would ask honourable gentlemen to consider the impression which. it would make
on the Indian inid to have the Commissioners app'ointed by this Government go
there and m.Irke this finding, giving thein
the exclusive righit of sa.lmon fishing on
both sides of the Fraser river, and then i
day or two afterwards to harve a man corne
aleng- and arrest them and fine thern $500
for fisjiing on the Fraser river. That is
the position thingas are in to-day. These
findings deal with- all the different agencies
of British Columbia. As honourable gentlemen know, the Fraser is a large river,
and with its tributaries covers the greater
part oif the interior of the province, and
is the spawning-ground of the sockeye salmon. 1 think we ought to, be exceedingly
careful in our dealings wvitIi the Indians,
showving them every conaideration; in fact,
in dealing with any miatter in dispute, we
ought to give themn more consideration th-an
we would give to, a white man. We should
try to show Vhem, that we are looking after
their i.ntereSt8, -and are trying to treat themn
fairly and as they have a right to be treated.

Hon. J. D. TAYLORI: Honourable gentlemien, may I bc permitted too attempt to
take this matter out of the clouds and
bring it down bo the region of practical
business? As I see it, the Bill before the
House bas -no connection whatever wit.h
what is known as the Indian titie in British
Columbia, but by its termis *expressly
refers to, the settiement of ail differences
between the Government of British Golumbia and the Government of Canada. The
interest that the people of British Columbia
have in the settiement of these differences
The Indian reserves, as estabis this.
lished in Brdtish Columbia about 60 years
ago, when white Government first came into
practical existence there, bave become surrounded by the cities of Victoria and Vancouver -and New Westminster and other
white settiements throughout the province,
until conditions have arisen when the welfare of Indians and wbites alike is menaced
by the location of the reserves. At the
Lime of the Union there was an agreement between British Columbia and Canada
that land required for the Indians froii
ime to time should be provided by the
province of British Columbia out of the
Crown lands of -that province; and, on the
other hand, that lands surrendered by the
Dominion of Canada, when no longer required for' the use of the Indians, should
become the property of the province of
Britèish -Columbia. As I see it, that agreement is very plain in its termis; but the
legal departmnent of the Dominion Governiment, like the legal department of any
.c4her Government, may always he trusted
to lind a way of avoiding any agreement
which appears flot to be to -the financial
interest of that Government. So it came
about that British Columbia, when from
Lime to time the province vwished to have
i-ts reserves removed fromn the vicinity of
the cities, came to a deadlock with the
Government of the Dominion, because that
Government 6aid, in effect: "If we do as
you desire, and cause the Indians to abandon those reserves, you will immediatt'ly
become the owner of the reserves, and wiil
s;eli themn and pocket the proceeds."
So we have been deadlocked for more than
a generation, to the prejudice alike of the
Indians and the white settiers of British
Columnbia. Finally this agreement was
mnade, not affecting in any way the dlaims
of the Indians to title in British Columbia
or any of their rights. But, the two Governments getting together on a commonsense basis, the Dominion Government bas
said. in efiect: -We will flot accept your

full dlaim that you have a complete reversionary interest in these reserves, but realizing that certain reserves now hield by the
'Indians should be terminated, we wilI ag-ree
to the appointment of a Joint Commission
.to determine which of the reserves shall
be terminat-ed or reduced, and which shall
be increased in compensation; and, as to
the land cut off, we will agree that that
land shall be publicly sold and the proeceeds divided, haif to go to you, who up to
the present have claimed the whole interest, and the other haîf to, go to, us for the
Honbenefit of the Indians. as a whole."
curable gentlemen, that is what is being
carried out, in accordance with the report
of the Commissioners, a report that engaged the best attention of five able gentlemen for three years, during which time
they personally visited every one of the
3M0 or 350 reserves in British Colum'bia.
As to British Columbia it-seif, that province is entitled, I suppose, to have its
sentiments in this matter expressed. I am
free to say, fromn an intimate knowledge of
the province, that there is nothing but satisfaction in British Columbia with the re-port made by the Commnissioners. As to
,dissatisfaction on the part of the Indians,
I agree with the honourable leader of this
House that it is wholly artificial and manufactured; that it bas no natural cause; that
if the agitators were removed, or ceased
their efforts, we should be-ar nothîng further whatever from the Indians as to any
grievances they have in connection with
this report.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Wby not deport them?
Hon. 'Mr. TAYLOR: The question bas
been asked in this House, what is the Indians' dlaim as to their so-called titie? It
is, in effect, that 'tfiey bave a title to the
whole province of British Columbia as the
ýaboriginal inhabitants, and that we, the
white people of British Columbia, are there
only on sufferance, and should make ternis
with the Indians, whom we found there,
for the privilege of continuing to reside in
that province. It is true that in the several
documents submoitted the spokesmen for
-the Indians state that tbey will not insist
upon the whole of their termis, but that if
we will take their case into court they will
be. satisfied with something less than what
-they have demanded.
I observe from some of the correspondence which has been distributed that they
set up the dlaim that the report is unsatisfactory to them, on -the ground that it does
not allot sufficient land to be added to the

JUNE 2, 19-2048
reserves that are ta be increased. As ta
that point, I wiil say 'this: that at no time
have the Indians af British Columbia occupied, or attempted ta occupy or inake any
use ai, more than a small proportion af the
land already alloted ta them; ithat throughout the province they have selections af the
very best, most available, and most desirable lands, in the best agricuitural dis.tricts, and that nat only do the Indian reserves become nuisances ta, the cities, as I
have said, but they are plague spots in the
agricuitural communities, because their
agricultural lands are not cultivsted or kep-t
f ree from noxiaus weeds, the seed of which
,spread over ail the districts surraunding
the reserves. The reserves are made the

sances ai every description.
condition ai the lands held by the Indians
is, in itseif a sufficient answer to the claim,
put forward on their behali, that in the
adjustment a very much larger ares ai land
should be set apart for them.
These Indians dlaim, in addition, that as
part ai the settleinent, the titie reniaining
in the reserves should nat be a titie held
by the Dominion Govern.ment in trust for
the Indians as a whole, 'but rather that it
should be the title of the Indian tribes or
bands, and that the individual members
ai thos e tribes or banda should be the
beneficiaries whenever those Indian reserves corne ta be surrendered. They dlaim
that not ail the Indians of Blritish Columbis, as at present, but the few individuais who survive in a particular band,
should be the. beneficiaries. Sa il cames
about that there is an obstacle ta obtaining- frorn the Indians the surrender provided for in the agreement between the two
Governments; and by the Bill now before
the House il is proposed that, in this respect only, the agreement ibe set aside. It
naturally follo'ws that the iewer the Indians remaining in any band, the greater
the financial interest which each one ai
thase Indians has in lands ta -be surrendered, as being no longer used by his tribe.
Therefore it happens, as to the lands the
surrender ai which is mnost imperative, because they are not used, that the individual ciaims ai the fewv survivors are the
strongest; and so long as there is any person ta hold up ta these Indians the prosia;bulous sumai
pect that thiey may obtain f
by refusing their assent ta any settiement
made b;y the Governments. so long will it
be difficuit for the twa Governments con-

cerned to make an ag-reeinent. It seemns to
mie, therefore, that that is a strong argumient in favour of making provision that
where the Indians prove recalcitrant, and
where in the opinion of the Departmnent af
Indian Affairs the resistance af the Indian
survivors interested in any surrender is
carried beyond a reasonable paint, the Departnient, as guardian of the Indians,

Hon. S'ir JAMIES LOUGHEED: That wil

Hon. 'Mr. 'TAYLOR: Accoiding to the

by public coinpetition, and the price so abtained is ta be divided, haif being given to
the Provincial Government and halIf ta the
Dominion Government for the benefit of al
the Indians, not for the benefit of thýe few

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR- Speaking tram my

The amendment of Hon. Mr. Bostock was
negatived.
Section 2 was ag«reed to.
On section 3-power to order reductions or
cut-offG from reserves without surrender by
Indians :
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: Did I understand
the honourable leader of the 'House to say
that this wa.s to legalize the eut-off of some
45,000 acres?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Fortyseven thousand acres.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: And that it was not
giving power to the Governnient te override
the Indian Act cf .1906?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it
does not affect anything outside of the
specifie reductions. which appear in the
schedule attached to the report. It does
not affect the other Indian lands at ail.
Honi. Mr M-%cHUGH : It does not interfera with chapter 49, the Indien Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, net
in the slighitest. It does not affect land eutsida cf these cut-ofts.
Hon. .Mr. McHUGH: Thera is anether
inatter I would like to bie clear on. I
thought it a very pertinent question, that
asked by the hion. gentleman fxom Aêsiniboia <Hon. Mr. Turriff>l, -as to the settianient cf the price cf those Indian lands eut
off. The honourable gentleman fromn New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor) àsaid that
the Indians were given 80,000 or 85,000 acres
for about 4,5,000. Now, I do not think that is
an answer. What I would like to know is,
who values the lands that are being taken

b

as cut-offs, andi who puts a value uponi the
lands given back to the Indians? If the
value of the reductions and the value of the
additions balance, wve1l and good; but if the
45,000 acres are of greater value than the
85,000 acres, then I think a portion ought to
be set aside for the Indians.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Indiàns rwill profit by that. They seil 47,000
acres and they- receive 50 per cent of the
proceeds. Under the present scheme British Columbia dlaims -to be entitled to the
entire reversion; -but, in pursuance. of the
arrangement entered into, Briti6h Columbia
concedes to the Indians 50 per cent of the
proceeds of the (land, 'which will probably
be sold ýby public auction, or subject to
publie tender, and they receive, 80,000
acres.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In regard to the
cut-offs and the surrenders, 1 think my
honourable, friend might give us sorne information as to rwhether any inquiry has
beau made on behaif of the Government,
or whether they have any information, as
to how the Indians themselves view thi'S
question. The Government ie flot going
to deal with this natter vithout getting the
consent or suirender of the Indians, and I
presume the department has sonie information as te, horw the Indians view, the
matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Goverriment has sought an opinion as to this
adjustmen-t from the Indian agents of
British Columbia. With the exception of
two or three, i6olated cases, there bas been
general satisfaction on the part of the indians on the various reserves at whiat has
been done. When you take*into conrideration that there are, I think, 300 or 400 reservesHon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Twelve hundred.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED :-one cannot expect absolute harmony on a subject
of this kind. Furthermore, the Chamber
will remember that this Commission, representing both Governments, visited in person aIl these reserves, took the inatter up
with the 'Indians, and left nothing undone
for the purpose of aacertainin-g wvhat the
judgment and the wislhes of the Indians
might be.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: A short time ago I
raised the question of the Kitsidano reserve.
The position of that reiserve is peculiar.
I understand that certain Indians have
had .éome settiement made vith them, but
that there are some se-venty Indians who

stili claini that they have a right ta be
heard ini regard to this matter. They will
naturally look upon the settiement that is
being -made here as an uansatisfactory one.
I think there is special reference to that
ini the -report oi the Commission that we have
before us. On page 112, volume 1, the
report says:
The Commission, pursuanit to section 8 of the
agreement referred to in the Commission. has
had under consideration the application of the

I 'would point out to honourahie gentlemen that the Commission recognize, first,
that due compensation should be made ta
the Indiens of the said Squamish tribe or
band. I understand that the seventy Indians ta whomn I have reierred elaim to -be
members of that band, and that they have
been unable to get any information from
the Department.
As 1
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
understand it, the Harbour Commissioners
at Vancouver have expropriated this property with the concurrence af both Gavernments, pending effeot being given ta this
report or ta an adjustment ai the dîfferences b8tiween the two Governments. This
is one ai the matters which will be settled
when thiis legisiation is cornpleted. Whatever the dlaims ai the Indians are, due
recognitian will be given ta them. That is
a very good illustration af the necessity ai
this legisiation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I have here certain
correspondence in regard ta this matter, but
I do flot want te take up the time of the
House reading it. In this corre6pandence
there is a letter add-re6sed ta the present

a similar reply was apparently .sent by the

~written to, lr. Burn, the agent at Westminster, and 1 understand that c0 far ne reply

where they should receive the kindest consideration and sympathy, it is the Senate

Hon. Mr. BOYER: Honourable gentlemen, within ten ffriles of Montreal 'tihere
is an Indian reserve called the Caughnawagca reserve. Some fifteen years ago somegentleman got into that i-eserve and created
a fuss similar to -this, stat-ing- that the
Indians were being deCaug-hnawaga
prived of theïr property, of their lands,
and o! their fishing and shooting righ te.
This gentleman got a new survey made of
the reserve, and got iby-laws passed, so
that no %,0hite man could set his foot in
the reserve. One day -the Indians -woke
up to find themselves ieolated f rom the
neigahhourhood and from the -white people
amonget w'hom they had lived and froni
whom they were inaking a living. The
gaentleman who broug-ht &bout this condition died, tand. since then we have neyer
heard anything more about it. The 'Indians
came back and -said: "We .thought hie was
a friend o! ours. He paint-ed a very glowing
picture of 'the future of the -Teserve if we
did 'this and that and the other thing,

SENATE
but we have found that the only resuit of
m'hat hae did was that hae lived àt uur expense for ten years; and to-day 'sNe are,
as 'we were before, perfectly Ga!tisfied."
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: In supporting the
motion te refer this matter to a cpecial
committee, I qnay say oe of the chie!
grievance6 rwhich I think the Indians have
is 'tbat they dlaim tbe Government have not

There eeems te be a good deal csf feeling,
and perbaps not witbout foundation,
that the lIndians bave been stirred up
in this inatter by those who have no particulaT interest in the matter. I may say
that there are members of the Indian tribes
present in tbis Chamnber 'wbo bave corne
3,000 miles, 'wbo are quite capable, witbout
,the assistance of any interpreter or spokesman, te presen't their case to the Cominittee
in a 'rnoet intelligent manner, and I arn
sure that the inernbers cf the Committes,
il the anatter is submitted te tfhem, will be
6u!.prised that tbey can place the matter
before tbe Carmmittee in such a way. I
hope 'this Ho'use will support 'the motion
of the bonourable gentleman irom De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Oasgrain), be-cause
I tbink it rwould be a great pity te bave
the Indians return to British Columnbia
saying- that they had not an opportunity
of being heard.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I rise for the
purpose of supporting the motion o! the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière.
1 do so for the rea8on that I !believe that
thiere is a feeling among the Indian tribi-es
throughout Canada that they have net been
treated fairly by the Government. Whether
that feeling is justified or noît 1 amn not at
thi8 nmoment in a position te say. But I
bave a 6trong feeling against any Governnient t.aking avay from the Indians their
reserves or their lands 'without -their consent. During the reginie cf the late ladmini8tration there waë a notorieus case cf this
kind, in which a great reserve was taken
away fromn the Indians 'without their
proper 'consent 1having been secured. At
that tille I took stroing ground on býehaif
How

Mr. BOYEIIt

of tlie Indiaris, lyecause 1 thoughlt that. they
h.ad 'been uni airly deait %vith,and that the
law had flot Ibeen observed. The Indian
Act is very distinct and definite on that
question; but I understand that soine
amendments have been made by which the
GoveTniment has the power to take away or
make any settiement in regard to reserves
adjacent to ta city or a town, without the
consent of the Indians. I hold that the
Indian's titie to bis land ils jue' as sacred
as the titie of any other man; consequenitly
these people should be deait 'with flot only
fairly ibut generously. 1 do not say the
Government -ie not dealing 'with them in
that 'way, but I do say thiat when they
petition to ibe 'heard in regard to -their own
aiffaira, it -would be unwise for thia branch
of Parlîaxnent to, refuse to hear them. I
do think, though, that instead of referring
this înatter 'to -the Committee on Banking
and Commerce, there ought to bie a special
Committee of this House lappointed te investigate it. 1 do not think there would
bie any great barm done if we spent 'two
or tbree hours in Cornmittee of the Whiole
hearing the Inditan.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemien. 1 heard the other day the remarks
wbich were. made by the honourable the
leader of the Government wben he moved
the second réadfig of this Bill, and I must
say I was strongly impressed with the
reasons wvhich hie gave in support of it; but
I would he disappointed if the bonourable
gentleman, on further consideration, did
riot consent to allow this Bill to be referred
to either the Banking and Commerce Cominittee or a special Committee. I think that
parties who express a desire to' be heard
sbould bie heard. It bas been tbe practice
of this bonourable Hlouse-and the practice
bas been appreciated by tbe country at large
-to give a free hearing to ail parties who
insisted upon being heard, and not to grant
the petition in this case would be an exception whic'h 1, for my part, would very much
regret. 1 think, monreovnr, that the best
way to prevent agitation is to give the parties wbo tbink they have a grievance an opportunity to ventilate their grievance and
to be heard. 1 tbink that it. will bave a
beneficial effect, and that- the measure wvil
be more acceptable to ail parties concernied
if the matter is referred to a Commnittee.
Hion. Mr. McMEANS: Mr. Speaker, 1 do
flot quite understand the situation. This
Bill was referred to a Committee of the
XVhole House and the Commiittee passed it,
and it now stands for the third reading.

JUNE 9, 19-20
The motion o! the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) is 10 refer the iBill 10
the Banking and Commerce Committee. I
do not think Ihat is the proper procedure.
Perhaps the honourable gentleman may be
righl, but if hae is I amn surprised. However, I rose lfor the purpose of making the
suggestion Ihal the third reading of this
the
Bill be allowed to, stand, and
honourable gentleman might move thal the
pelitioners be heard in the meantime.
,Hon. Mr. CAjStGRAIN: It is before the
-Chair. The Chair can decide whelher I arn
right or not.
Hon. Mr. MeMEAN6: I move in amendment thal the third reading of the Bill be
nol now proceeded with, but that il be deferred until to-morrow.
-Hon. Mr. CASG4RAIN: 1?hat is not an
amendment.
Hon. Mr. POPE: .Defer it until Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 think it is quile
in order for an honourable member, on the
motion for the third reading, to move Ihat
the 'Bill be referred back to the Committee
o! the Whole or to another Commitlee. I
think the motion moved by the honourable
gentleman from De Èanaudière (Hon.. Mr.
Casgrain) is quite wrong, and I doubt very
inuch that the amendmnenl now proposed
would be in order.
Hon. Mr. CASGRLAIN: It is not germane
to the case aI all.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: -I do not rise to dis.cuss the merits o! the point of ordei, but
I have a suggestion to make. This malter
o! hea 'ring the delegates, I presume, has
been eprung on the honourable the leader o!
the House on short notice, but it would
seem a great hardship to return those
people, after they had come 3,000 miles,
wilhout giving lhem a thearing. I would
suggest Ihat all these motions be allowed
to stand, and that the honourable the leader
of the House be given until lo-morrow to
decide whelher he will allow the* question
of! the third reading to go to a vote, or
whether hie will accept the motion that bas
been made. I move the adjournimenl o!
the debate.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Before the debale is
adjourned, I desire to ask a question, which
I lhink is important. 1 have*heard this mat-.
ter discussed very fully by the honourable
leader of the House and by the honourable
leader of the Opposition and other honourable members, and if I understand the situ-

.493

ation aright, Bill 13, which is now before
the House for the third reading, would flot
in any manner interfere with the rights of
the Indians. I understand it to be an enabling Bill, to permnit thue Dominion Government to take up the matter with tht
provincial government, to be decided between them. The passage of this Bill does
flot in any way prevent the Indians bringing any claim before any tribunal. When
the honourable leader of the House is giving
bis information, I shall be glad if hie will
deal with this point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, by a strange coincidence,
my three honourable friends who have been
most urgent that this matter should be referred to a special Commîttee were not
present when the matter was discussed on
the last occasion, and, fi I mistake not, on
the second reading. My honourable friend
from De Lanaudière <Hon. Mr. Casgrain),
my honourable friend from Redford (Hon.
Mr. Pope), and my honourable friend iromn
Kings and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler), were
ail absent on that occasion. Had they been
present, I would have been hopeful that
they would have viewed the situation in the
saine way that the House viewed it. The
matter was fully diseussed at that time,
and had there been a division of opinion in
the House as to the propriety of sending it
to a special Committee, instead of dealing
with it in Comrnittee of the Whole, I. have
no doubt that the House would have supported a resolution along those lines. But,
after a very full discussion of the whole
subjeet, the House seemed to be unanimously of the opinion that we should proceed with the Bill in Committee of the
Whole.
Now, there are two or three statements
which have been made, unwittingly, I have
no doubt, but which I think are entirely incorrect. One is that the British Columbia
Government is not in accord with this Government upon this subjeet. I may say that
the two ýGovernments are entirely in accord
as to the desirability of getting this matter
settled. There can be no two opinions upon
that feature o! the question. The British
Colunmbia Government, in anticipation of
this legislation, bas already passed legisialion precisely along the lines which we 10day are discussing.
H on. Mr. FOWLER: With a very important difference.
Honi. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. Would my
honourable friend point out the difference,
while I sit down.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No. while you go on
I will point out just what the dîfference is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Last
year the British Columbia government
passed an enabiing Act, precisely similar to
this Bill, of which I now ask the third reading. Trhe object of the two Bis is to permit the two Governrnents to corne together
and not only to give eff ect or approval to the
agreement whîch had been entered into by
the Joint Royal Commission, but to deai
with other matters as well. The Governments are not tied down by the report or the
agreement, but have an amplitude of authority to deal with the question either, along
the lines of the report or along other Uines.
Consequently it wvould seem to me that the
proper, the most appropriate, place for the
Indiens to appear and state their grievance
would be before the representatives of the
two Governments. lt wiil appeai to, every
reasonable mind within hearing that a Commission of that kind, representing the two
Governments, met together under an amplitude o! powers granted by the two Acts,
would be a very rnuch more appropriate and
effective Comrnittee to hear the grievances of
the Indians; and to refer the matter to thema
would be much better than the rather cumbersome method of referring it to a speciai
Committeee which would have 10 report
back to this House. If any change were
made in the Bill, it wouid then have to go
back to the House of Gommons.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Were the Indians
heard?
Hon. Sir JA-'IES LOUGHEFjD: I arn
comîng to that question in a moment.
My honourable friend from Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) stated-and I
have no doubt he based his statement upon
information cornmunicated to bim-that the
Indians had not had an opportunity of being heard upon this subject. The Indians
had a full hearing before the Houee of
Commons. Upon Bill 14, a measure dealing
with the franchise, coming before that
House, they asked for a hearing, having
been disappointed in not being heard on
Bill 13, concerning wthich the Commona had
refused te give the findians a hearing. The
ýHouse of Gommons finally consented to
permit a fui! hearing of the Indiang upon
ail their alleged grievances before a comnmîttee. Consequently those Indians, and
the gentleman who repre-sents thern etated
liheir case which occupied, I understand,
two mornings, before the House of Gommons
Committee, and the Houee o! Commons did
not see their way to give effeet to the repreHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

sentations which were then miade, but dismissed the matter.
Bo much for those t.wo statements. Now,
wit~h regard to the real grievance, the grievance which is of the xnost essentiel character, entertaîned by the Indians, and
which has; been pressed very stroxigly for
the last generation, or at least since 1908,
particulariy by the gentleman wiho seemsi
to have taken upon his shoulders the responsibilities of an 'office to which he is
eeif-appointed, namely, that of presenting
the clai.ms of the Indians and keeping theni
etirred up and in a state of agitation and
ferment. The whole question cornes down
to this. The Indians of British Columbia
claim titie to ail the lands in that province.
Il honourable gentlemen in this House
deem it important that a claim of that kind
ehould be entertained, and that the titie,
not of the, reserves of British Columbia, but
of ail the lands of that province, shouid be
placed in suspense, and should be the Bubject of agitation and the cause of a state of
ferment which would disturb the titie to
every foot of land in that important province, then 1 for one do not appreciate the
wi&l-can of entertaining any euch dlaim, and
particularly of discussing it in Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Would my honourable friend allow me to ask hlm, what
induced the Commons to give themn a hearing?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
given by reason of their importunity. It
reminds one of the woman in &ripture who
was heard iby the unjust judge. I do not
know whether or flot the unjust judge
granted- her request by reason of ber importunityHon. Mr. ROCHE. 1 think he did.
,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH'EED: My honourable friend frSm Halifax is a biblical
scholar of very much better standing than
Rlarn, and if he says the unjust judge did I
shaH not controvert that. But upon this
occasion, 1 fancy, that will not be taken as
a precedènt.
~Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -My honourable
friend, of course, understands that Bill 13
wa.s flot referred to a commrittee of the House
of Gommons at ail. Certain references were
made by those people to it, but the Bill was
not properly before the Comm ittee; only
Bill 14 was referred to it.

SENATE

to rnanifest a fear that the Privy Council
is going to allow that dlaim to the lands at

Han. -Sir JAMES 'LOUGHEED. No. The
Government of Canada quite recognize that
there would be no probability, even though
the question 'were submitted, of having an
adverse judgment; but where there is no
valid dlaima it would be very unwise for
the 'Government of Canada to, lead the
Indians Wobelieve Vhat they had a claim
sufficiently serioifs -ta submit Wothe Privy
Council. That is -where the misehief lies.
The Governments of Canada from the time
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier dowin to the present
time-the last three .Governiments-have
been busily engaged in tryîng Wo impreas
this upon the minds. of the ffndianýs, but the
gentleman who represents them, is not so
impressiona'ble as to, be affected .by the
insistent expression of dîsapproval whiich
Nwe inake.
My honourable friend from Sel.kirk <Hon.
Mr. Bradlbury) has etated that he understands that the Government bar. fot kept
faith with the Indians, and that is one of
their chief' daims, and hie illustrates that
in dealing 'with the question of cut-ofis. I
Wook occasion to mention to the 'House the
other day-in fact, on bath occasions-that
the cut-ofse represent 47,000 acres, and that
the British Oolumbia Government bas
placed at the disposai of the <3overnment
in lieu thereof 87,000 acres.
lHérn. MT. POWER: 0f inferior land.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGUflED: 0f less
valuable land. But they have this advantage: that those cut-offs will be sold by
public auction, and 50 per cent of the proceeds 'wîll be carried Ù) the credit of the
Indians and 50 per cent to the credit of
British Columbia.
Now, the fact needs on.ly ta be mentioned
ta be appreciated, that it would be imffssible to have the Indians surrender the
cut-aif s in view of the agitation which. bas
been going on for some time. Il we lef t
those Wo the surrender of the I.ndis.ns of
their own motion, the misehievous element
whieh bas been stirring *up tbis question
would at ionce hecome active again, and the
Indians of course would not willingly submit to the surrender of thase cut-oifs, although it would manifestiy 'be to their advantage.
The 'Royal Commission spent
from, 1913 ta 1916 personaily inspecting the
1,200 reserves in British Columbia and consultîng witb the Indians, and I arn advised
that there is a very large acreage of land atHon. Mx. BHDiooURT.

tached to those reserves that lias neyer beeu
occupied by the Indians at ail, -and 'that it
is desirabie that those cut-offs should be at
once removed fromn the reserves, because
many of themn adjoin the cities, where the
Indiens have not profited by their contigui'ty to, the urban population.
We
know very well ihat the morals of the
Indians are not improved by a tboo close
contact with whites; consequently, it is desiTable that tbe cut-aifs sbould be reinoved,
and authority is Wobe gîven to the two
Governments ta alienate, if necessary, those
cut-offs. But that does not extend to the
other Indian lands.
Hon. MT. BELCOURT: Is provision made
for a bearing before that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If mny
hanaurable friend will look at the Bill now
before us, hie will .see that it gives very
ample authorîty Wo the tvao. Governments
to adjust «Il differences. It is not limited
by any means ta the agreement which. was
origînally entered iuta in 1912, nor ta the
report which was made by the Joint Royal
Commission in 1916. It permits the two
Governments Wosettle all these differences
-to came together ta adjust tbem; and it
seems ta me, as I have already stated, that
that would be the time for the Indians ta
-appear before the representatives of the two
Governiments. My honourable friend from
Kings and Albert <Hon. Mr. Fawler) shakes
bis head in a very sceptical way, as if the
Senate were very mucb more susceptible to
the appeal made by the ]Indians than the
repreeentativea of the two Goývernments
wmould be. But where will yau find any
individual or group al individuals s0 interested in the Indians of British Columbia
as the two Governments charged with looking after their affairs? Surely it caunnot be
contended that the gentleman who bas assumed the responsibility of asserting the
claims o! the Indians can deal with the
matter s satisfactorily as the Government
of British Ooiumbia and the Governiment
af Canada, bath of which are charged with
this particular duty and are more familiar
with it, and in view of the publie interests
aTe cancerned in iseeing this matter satisfactarily settled.
Hon. Mr-. BEIQUE: I hope the hunlourable gentleman will extend ta this House
the confidence which be expresses in bath
Governiments.
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGITEED: My honourable friend fi-rn De Salaberry entirely

JUNE 9, 1920
misjudg-es the attitude which I take. It is
flot that 1 have not confidence in this
House; but I appeal to this House and ask
if it is in the public interest to permit the
Indians to think Plur one moment that they
can appear betore Parliamnent and urge a
dlaimn which ail! the previous Governrnents
of Canada have flot seriously entertained.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honouraible friend knows that the more a
subject of this kind is stirred up the more
the agitator ibelieves he bas a right, until
it becomes a mania to suchi an extent that
lie finally enters upon a sort of holy war.
Possibly the better way, inasmuch as I
have no intimation from the Goverrrment
upon the subject, woiild be to allow the
third reading to stand until to-morrowv.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: M.Ny

Hon_ Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honcurable friend wvill see that both Governments may exercise a reasonable discretion
in adjusting the differences between them.
TIhat would carry with it, impliedly, the
right to hear the Indians.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This provision,
1 take it, would afford both Governments
-a reasonable mneans of adjusting; but it is
not provided ini any way that the Indians

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If I were sure the
Indians -would be heard, I would quite

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let me
direct my honourable friend's attention to
the language o! the preamble. It says:
For the purpose of settling ail differences between the said Governments respectlng Indiart

Hon. M-\r. FOWLER: 1 wish to ariswer
the question asked by my honourable friend

bimi to the statutes of British Columbia of
1,919. Chapter 32, section 3, says:
Wjthout limiting the general powers by this

Into such further agreements, Nwhether with the
Dominion Government or with the Indians.

My statement was that the A-et of British
Columbia showed that the British Colunhia Government was not entirely in acocord
with the course of.condudt of this Govern.ment in refusing, to listen to the Indians.
.In the British Z3olumbia Act the Indians
are recognized as parties; while in this
Act tlhey are flot recog-nized at ail. That
is o-ne of their grievanceo. The further
fa*ct that there is such .a difference of opinion between my honourable friend and
inyseif and otheris -%ho are 6upporting the
cause of the Indians here as to what is
the adtual claim of the Indiens, is a strong
reason *why a Comrniittee of this Houge
should hear the Indians. The fact that,
although 'they dlaim they were flot heard

BILL.

COMMI'TEE=

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
Senate go into Committee on Bill X2, an Act
lo amend the Immigration Act (Deportation of Undesirable Persons).
Hon. GEO. BRADBURY: Honourable
gentlemen, in rising to oppose the reference
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

of this nmeasure to, Commnittee, I do so for
the purpose of referring to a debate that
took place a short time ago on the second
reading of the Bill. During that debate,
the honourable the minister ini charge of the
Bill, and at least one other honourable
member, made it appear that honourable
gentlemen wvho were opposing this nieasure
had defamed the labour men of Canada. 1
submit that any language which excites
among the labour interests of Canada a feeling that they have been unfairly dealt wjth
under the Immigration Act, or unfairly represented by menibers of this House, is flot
,calculated to do any good in this country.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask the
honourable member from Selkirk if it is his
purpose or desire to, discuss f urther the
principle of this Bill at present? If so. I
would ask the ruling of the Chair as to the
propriety of his doing so. I think he is
quite out of order.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: 1 do flot think
it is out of order. I cana discuss it on the
third readinga.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. We are goiitg
into Committee.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I have a periect
right to discuss it on the motion toi go into
Committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: There is nothing to prevent the discussion of the principle of -the Bill on the motion to, go into
However, the
Comniittee of the 'Whole.
principle of a Bull is generally discussed at
the second reading.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: 1 do not intend,
honourable gentlemen, to take up any great
length of time; but there has been serious
misrepreseritation regarding this whole
inatter, and 1 desire to clear it up, not onlv
for the sake of honourable members of this
House, but also for the sake of the people
in the country. I refer to the language that
was used by the honourable gentleman and
by one other honourable member, because
I feel that il is not fair that those who
have differed with the honourable minister
with respect to this Bill sbould be held up
to the labour men of Canada as unfair or
unsympathetic to their interests. The honourable the Minister said:
1 want further to point out that dilferent
honourable gentlemen this afternoon have classed labour men generally with the men who have
been guilty of sedition in this country. it is

most unfortunate an.) most unfaîr. and such a
suggestion wiIl be repudiated bi' ai
labour men throughout the countrv.

JUNE 9, 1920
1 submnit. honourable g-entlemen. that
there was flot one word said by myseif in
discussing- this Bill, and flot one word said
by any other honourable gentleman who
took the sanie position as I did, in refusingto support the measure, that would justify
any such language by the honourable the
Minister of Labour. In fact, 1 myself went
out of my way to pay to the labour interests
of Canada the compliment which I believe
they welI deserve. I believe there is no
labour class in the world better conducted
or possessing more abihlity and intelligence
than the Canadian-born labour men.
My honourable friend from Simcoe (Hon.
Mr. Bennett), who jes fot in his seat at present. went one better than the Minister and
said:
One would imagine from the remarks of some
honourable gentlemen that there was flot a
decent labouiing man in Canada; that from
one end of Canada to the other
there was a
seethlng mass of men who were out to murder
and bumn down houses and commit ail sorts of
crimes.

I submit, honourable gentlemen, that
langag.e such s thjs coming froin any man
who has the honour of a seat in this honourable House is calculated to inflame the
minds and, the passions of the working
people of this country, and make themn feel
that there are in this House men who are
not ready to do justice to the labour interests.
I want to say, in conclusion on this phase
o! the question. that it ie absolutely unfair
for the Minister in charge of this Bll, and
the other honourable gentleman who took
the samne view as hie did reg-arding it, to use
lenguage which is so utteriy out of accord
with anything that was said, by those who
di.ffered with the.m. The language used by
ei-ther of those honou-rable gentlemen was
not in any way justified.
Enough of that. The Bill hu been so
misrepresented that 1 feel that, in justice
to mys-elf and in order to correct the impression that has been created throughout, the
country, something ought to be &aid to set
at rest the mincIs of the people. Innocently,
I hope, but whether innocently or not, the
honourable the M-\inister succeeded in coinpletely beclouding this question by language
that fails entirely to expda.in frankly the
relative position of the British-born who
corne to Canada and the ahiens who have
becorne naturaJized in this country, i.neltding of couxse the Austrian, the German, and
the Italian.
Great stress has. been -laid on the apparent facet that while the Britisli-born bas

the Immigration Act, yet aliens who have
become naturalized in Cianada can conîmit alil the offen-ces set out in clause 41 of
the Immigration Act and be Immune from
deplortation.
That is the ronrtenlticn oïf
honourable gent(lemen who support this
bill, a±nd that has been published in the
press of Canada, and bas gone broadcast
over thbe cou-ntiry. If that contention were
correct thon I say iA woujld be a serious
state of affairs, and the degisLatioîi that, is
on the statute bookI at the present time
woudd be juistified on-ly by an extreme emergency. Perhape Èhat emergency did exist
w~hen the legisiation was placed there; but
I eubmit, honou.rable gent-lemen, that this
contention, which lias been made by honourable gentlemen in this Huuse, is absolutely incorrect and entirely foreign to the
facts. The oerdinary lay.nan might weLl be
excused for inaking isucb a eserious mistake;
but it iis difficufit to u.nderetand how two
very eminent liegad gentlemen in this Houýse
could have fallen in to the error. I refer to
the honou.rable member f-rom DeLorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who, I regret, îs not
in bis seat, and mey hconourable friend the
Senator from Aima (Hon. Mr. Foster). Both
ho-nouTable gentlemen took, the saie posdtion-that, a Britiah subject could, be
deported lrom thi-s country without trial.
Hon. M.r. BELCOURI: My lîonoi.rable
friend is mistaken. He misunderstood me.
I did ýnot say that.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I was not referring to the honourable gentleman froin Ottawa; I weis referring to the hionourable
Senator from AIia (Hon. Mr. Fo.ster).
Hon. Mr. BELOOUBT: I thought you
said the rnember from Ottawa.
Ho>n. Mr. BRADBURY: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 beg your pardon.
Hon. Mr. BR.ADBURY: I confess frankly
that I was mucli surpri.sed et the s.peeches
made by these -two honourable gentlemen,
becauise. es everybody knows, they are two
very eminent iawyers, and the members of
this H1-ouse aistened to thein with a great
deal of interest. Thejir speeches always
carry great weight in this House. So much
is. this so that if those two honourable gentlemen had net a.ddresssed. the House when
the Bibi was before us on the last occasion

500

SENATE,

it would not. have pass.ed theý, _qecond -reading. I bel:ieve that they convincedi several
honourable gentlemen that thair contention-s were -correct. -and that the BiiH ouglit
te lpa.s-s.
A littie know.ýledg-e is sometimes a dangeroits thing. I think that if the honourable &entlemen had taken just a little more
pains and looked a littie more closely at
what was behind the Bill, they would neyer
have made those speeches. I arn satisfied
that they had no intention of misrepresenting- the Bill or in any way causing a misunderstandinga. They evidently overlooked
entirely the important smendment made to
the Naturalization Act of 1919, chapter 38,
clause 7, which provides for the denaturalization of anv citizen whose conduct would
bring him within the mneaning of clause 41
of the Immigration Act. In other words,
hiono>urable gentlemen, if an alien, fromý
Germany, from the United States-no matfer where he is from-if he has lived in
this country and secured naturalization,
and if he commits any of the off ences mentioned in clause 41 of the Immigration Act,
he can he proceeded against under the
Naturalization Act; he can be den.aturalized;
and as soon as he is denaturalized he becornes an undesirabie and can be taken by
the immigration officers before a board that
is provîded for the purpose, and if found
guilty can be deported just. the same as
the British subject. There is absolutely no
difference between the Brifish-born who
cornes into Canada and commits acts that
bring him within the meaning of clause 41
of the Imimigaration Act, and tle alien who
has secured naturalization and commits
act-s which. bring him within that clause.
They both occupy exactly the same position and can be deported.
Hon. Mr. McM-NEANS: Is this a case in
which they do not get a trial?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: They do get a
trial. If you will permit me, I will read
the clause in a moment. It is very clear
and,. distinct. The amendment made hast
year to the Naturalization Act is chapter 38,
clause 7 of which reads as follows:
7. (1) Whe-re the Secretary of -State of canada ia sattsdied that a certificate of naturalization granted by 1dm under this Act, or granted under any Naturalization Act heretofore in
force in Canada, has been obtained by taise
representation or fraud, or by concealment of
material circumstances, or that the person te
whom the certiticate ls granted has shown hlmself by act or speech to be diaaffected or disloyal to His MaJesty, the Secretary of State ef
Canada may recommend that the certificate be
revoked and the Governor in Council may by
crder revoke the same accordingly.
Hon. Mr. BRtADBURY.

Honourable gentlemen wvill realize thnt
just as soon as the naturalizpd citizen is
proceeded against under clause 41 of the
Imimig-ration Act, and the Secretary of State
recomniends the revocatien of his nat urailization, he can be denaturalized by Order in
Council. When this is done he immediately becomes an undesirable, and can be
taken before the Commission provided for
under the Act, and investig&ated and exaniined, and, if found guilty, he can be deported. In other words, the department
can deport the citizen who bas been denaturahized, for just the same reason as
as it can deport the British-born whose
inisconduct brings hîm wîthin the meaning
of clause 41 of the Act. You will see that
there is absolutely no discrimination
against any chass in Canada. Ail classes
are treated alike as regards deportation.
The only real difference is that the naturalized citizen is denaturalized before bis
deportation, and the British-born, as every
honourable gentleman knows, cannot be
denaturalized, but can be proceeded against
under the Immigration Act, which mýakes
it possible to deport him for offences under
clause 41. In a nutshell, the British-born
is deported under the Immigration Act; the
deportation of the -allen who bas secured
cîtizenshîp by naturalization is provided
for under the Naturalization Act and the
Immigration Act combined. The methods
differ, but both classes are treated exactly
the same. As every one can understand, the
Britisher could not be deported under the
Naturalization Act, hecause he is a British
subject.
To my mi, tbat disposes of the alleged
discrimination aguainst tbe Britisb-born
with regard f0 deportation. There is. not a
tittle of evidence to warrant the statement
which bas been made by honourable gentlemen, and which has gene broadcast over
the country, that there is discrimination
against the British subject.
Now, honourajble gentlemen, there is anotber phase of this question wbich is very
important, in view of the unrest 'which bas
been occasioned throughout the country. I
re-fer to the statement made by the honourable Minister, who claimed that men
have been a.nd can be deported under the
present Act witbout a trial. If that were
true, I do not wonder that some bonourable
gent.lemen were stampeded into believing
that the Act was un-British; but that statement is absolutely foreign to the facts.
Bofore I heave this subject I will prove te
the House that the Government net only

501

JUNE 9, 1920
provided a trial but a special court by
which. these men could be tried.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON"L: It might save
time if 1 wvere to point out that I (lid not
make the staterent, -which the honourable
gentleman attributes to me. I said, "without a trial by a jury of his peers." 1 made
no reference to a trial by a special tribunal
which niight be appointed -by the Department.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: The honourable
gentleman is reported in Hansard as having used certain laniguage, and when I read
it .the House will realize why this matter
should be combated. The minister said:
The legisiation dues flot serve any go,)d purpose, but is simply an aggravation; and 1 assure
honourable gentlemen that lt Is flot the desire
of this House, or any other constituted authorlty in Canada, courts or otherwlse, to impose a
system of this sort, whereby a British subject,
resident in this country for live years or more,
would be summoned and deported- wlthout belng
given a trial.

Then, later on he said:
Notwithstandxng the fact that after five years
residence in this country, under the Naturalizatiori Act, a British-born subject beconies a Canadian citizen. hie is, by the Immigration Act as
lt now stands. deprlved off the rigbt off a trial.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: No.

Honourable gentlemen, I ask the opinion
of this House as to what effeet a statement
like that, going out to the country, that a
man is tried, and deported, and is not even

Hon. Mr. POWER: He is as bad as an

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Yes, wvorse. 1 would
not place so rnuch stress on this matter if
it were flot for the press of the country.
They, believing the honourable gentleman's
statement wvas correct, have to some extent
taken up the cudgels on behiaîf of my honourable friend. 1 have here a clipping
from an editorial in the Journal of yesterday, which pays some very nice complimenits to this Chamber, and, as we get s0
few compliments, I think I had better read
it to the House. It ýsays:

and that we should not be dependent upon
one side of the iHouse or the other to support them. Here is where the sting cornes

SENATE
in the Journal's article, and this is why
I refer to àt. The Journal is absolutely
fair, but it bas been misled into believing
that British4born citizens can be deported
from this country without a trial. It says:
penator Robertson, of course was right. Any
legisiation Chat deporte a British citizen without affording hlm an opportunity of meeting hie
accusera in a fair triai, ie anti-British in lis
very essence. and while It rnay have been necessary as emergency legislation at the time
of the Winnipeg strike the sonner it is effaced
from the statute books of the country, the
better.

Now, honourable genilemen, you can se;,
at once 'what this debate has done, when,
on the second reading, my honourable
friend and some other honourahie .gentlemen took the position that a man could
be deported without a trial. I want to say
that it is a very serious position. Just what
good purpose je to be served by it I do not
know. I do flot like to accuse any honourable
gentleman
of wilfully misrepresenting
the facts. 1 do flot believe that has ever
been the intention. But I do eay without
limitation that, if I arn a judge of the English. lanrguage, the gentlemen who have
taken that position have misrepresented the
facte ae they stand on the statute book of
the country to-day, and by doing eo have
caused a very unsettled feeling. The honourable gentleman from Simcoe (Hon. Mr.
Bennett) je not in hie seat. He went one
better thani the minister, which shows the
effect that the debate muet have had upon
that honourable gentleman. He used thie
lang-uage:
In proceedinge of that nature the Inan accused may flot even knov who is making the
accusation. There may be a charge preferred
against hirn, and the next night he may be
hurried out of the country. Some persons contend Chat ]aýwyers do flot know anythlng at ail
about law.

I think it wouid be well for corne ot them
to look, up the law before they epeak.
(Readin,«):
Weil. sorne Iawyers mnay and some other lawyers rnay not.

The honourable gentleman ie very candid
about that. (REýading):
Weil. corne lawyere may and some other
lawyers niay not. 1 know one thing, however,
that there have been many miscarriages o!
justice ;there is no question about that. Let
me give you an Instance. There may be fireeaters outeide this Chamber too. Let us assume
that a foreigner has a choice location o! land

the opportunity of meeting his accuser face to
face. He je tlispossessed of hie land and is
hurried out of the country.

I sub-nit, honourable gentlemen, that
these are serious statements to go to the
country; statements that I do not feel justified in allowing- to go on Hansard without
any rebuttal; and I ask this -House, in ail
seriouýsnees, je euch language, which entirely mierepresents the facts, in the interest of la~w and order in Canada? I submit
that it is not. Utterances of this kind lrom
members of this House are well calculated
to inflame the mindc and passions of certain classes in this country, whom thie legislation has heen placed on the statute book
to control.
Now, honourable gentlemen, Jet us for a
moment examine the tacts in connection
with this question, as to whether a -man
oan fbe deported, run out of the country,
without facîng hie accuser or 'without any
trial. What does the present law provide,
in ail cases 'where deportation proceedîngs
are taken?' If the honourable gentleman
had looked at chapter 27, clauses 13, 15 and
19, of the Immigration Act of 1919, lie would
have seen that ample protection je given
for a fair and searching investigation before deportetion takes place. Chapter 25,
of 1919, an Act to amend the Immigration
Act, pute a new clause in the Immigration
Act making provision for the investigation
to which. I have referred. It reade as follorws:The niinister mal- nominate at any port of
entry any number of officers. not exceeding 5,
any three o! whom may act as a Board of
Inquiry for the summary determination of ail
cases of Immigrants, passengers, or other persons, se-king to enter or land in Canada, or
detained for any cause under this Act.

Every great city in Canada and hundreds
ut t.owns are ports of entry; so if a man is

arrested and proceeded against ýby the Immigration Board, he would be taken in
charge and brouzht before this board. WVhat
happens thenP This amendment of course
refers to the Immigration Act.
You go
back to the Immigration Act, chapter 27,'
of 1910, and here aYe the powers taken by
the Government under that Act to try cases
of persons who are subject, to deportation.
Clause 15 of that Act reade as follows:
The hearing of ail cases brought before euch
Board of Inquiry shall be separate and apart
from the public, but in the presence o! the immigrant, passenger or other person concerned,
whenever practicable.

That clause says clearly that the accused
bas got to be present.
And such Immigrant, passenger, or other person shall have the right to be represented by

JUNE 9, 1920
any evidence or testimnony
touchinge the case is received by the Board, and
a surnmary record of proceedings and of evidence and testimony taken shalt be kept by the
Board.

counsel whenever

That does nlot look as if a man could ha
arrested and run out of the country without
a trial. Here the Government creates a
special court, and the man goes before that
court and meets bis accusers and the evidence, and hie has a right to have counsel,
and further than that, he has the right to
appeal. Clause 2 of the samne Act reads:
The Board, and any member thereof, may, at
discretion, administer oaths and take ev'idence
under oath or by affirmation in any form which
they deemt binding upon the person beingr
examined.

New I arn going to turn to clause 19 of
the same Act just for a moment. I shall
read only a part of the clause, because that
is ail we are interested in. It says:
In all cases other than provided for in the
next preceding section an appeal mai, be taken
to the minister againat the decision of any such
Board of 1nquiry or offIcer in charge. by the
immilgrant, passenger, or other pierson concerned in the case.

Ail this shows, honourable gentlemen,
that the Governrnent has made ample
provision under which men charged with
offences shall be tried. They shall be
brought hefore this special court; they
shahl have the right to employ counsel to
plead their case; the evidence given shahl
be taken down; then, if the court rules
ag-ainst thern and orders their deportation,
they have a riglit to appeal to the Minister.
in the face of all these facts, was 1 nlot
justified in saying that the honourable
gentleman who took the position that thesee
men received no trial and could be practieallv run out of the country in the night,
as the honourable gentleman from 'Simcoe
said. wvithout meeting their accusera, took
an absolutely unjustifiable position? In the
interest-, of the people of 'Canada, whom
this legislation niay affect, or who might be
led to think it would affect them, I am
anxious that this matter should be placed
in such a position before this House and
before the country that there ivili be no
rnisunderstanding., and that no clais of peopie in Canada w-ill feel that the Governnient bas discriminated against Vbem in the
miatter of deportation proceedings. I agree
with w~hat sorne bonourable gentleman said
-- I think it was the honourable gentleman
fromi Alma .(Hon. Mr. Foster)-when he took
the position that it would hie horrible to
deport a British subject without trial while
an allen enemvy w~ho had hecome natnralized

503

could not be deported at ail. I confess
frankly that after the two leg-al honourable
gentlemen had spoken rny confidence was
shaken in the position whiich I had taken
on the second reading of the Bill; but I
liad in my mind the provision t.hat ig made
in the reguhations, and, wbile I did not
know the Macts, I knew that I could flnd
tbem, and consequently I voted against the
second reading of the Bill.
Now, gentlemen, there is just one other
matter tbat 1 would like to refer to for a
moment. What clasa of people is it that
the Immigration Act, that legialation that
was s0 wisely placed in the Statutes of
Canada, ivas intended to operate against?
Does any honourable gentleman csay that
it is a desirable chass. or a clasa that we
should be very much interested in protecting if this country? Those people have
been the curse of the honest labour men
of this country. They have gone into their

the men they met %vere weak, men, they induced them to commît acts that they would
not otberwise have committed. As I say,
it is wise that the Iaw sbould remain just
as it is.
The hoisourable minister of Labour said
that this lIegialation. was no good-that it
was simply an aggravation. Why, honourable gentlemen, my honourable friends
might just as well argue that the Criminàl
Code of Canada, which provi des punishment
for a man who commits a theft or a burglary
or somp other crime, is cd no use, but is
sirnply an aggravation.

Honourable gentleman, in conclusion, I
-want to say that in the best intereat of the
countrv and in the interest of law and
order, the legfislation that is on the statute
book at the present time ought to be let
alone, and this Bill ought not te proceed
further. It would ha to my niind a serious
niiistake for this Senate to adopt the suggestion rnade by the Mînister of Immigration,
who is, I believe, responsible for sending
the Bill to this House. The Act of hast year
%vas passed because it was fait to be
absolutely necessary then. The conditions in
Canada have not changad sufficiently, in
rny opinion, to warrant the amending of
thýat measure or the limiting of its effect.

Canada, and to that I took exception. The
honourable member froi Selkirk, I think,
has cleatly pointed out that that interpretation was not in his mind at all, and doubtless it was not in the minds of other honourable gentlemen. It was probably wise
fo.r the honourable gentleman to -mention
that to-day, in order to clear up the point.
But I submit, honourable gentlemen, that
I was not acting unfairly in making the
remarks I did at that time.
The honourable member was pleased to
state that in his opinion the Minister of
Labour had bec'louded, i.l not mi&represented, the facts-he hoped, innocently. I shall
take occasion in a few minutes to vindicate
absolutely every remark that I made and
prove that they were alil quite in order and
true. With reference to deportation without trial, I think it will be found, if my
remarks in Hansard are read, that throughout the debate I mentioned several times
speciýfioally "trial by jury," or "trial by a
jury of his peers," and if on one or two
occasions I made use of the word "trial"
without the additional words it is in ny
opinion misleading to interpret my words
as meaning a trial other than by a jury.
There has been, and, I think, there still
exists, a good deal of misapprehension
in the minds of honourable gentlemen as
to just what the effect of these proposed
amendments would be. I have taken occasion during the last two or three days
to attempt to get the ta.cts clearly and
concisely before me, so that I might present
them to the House, because I was informed
casually that my Bill was to be buried
and that the tombstone had already been
ordered, the inscription carved, etc.which of course w'as said in fun and received as an amusing comment. However,
I stated the other day the purpose of this
Bill, and I desire now te refer to that
statement in order that my present remarks may be connected and understood.
I said, as reported at page 458 of Hansard:
Had the amendments which were made to the
Crirninal Code at the subsequent Session, and
which are in effect to-day, been in force, it
would not have been necessary to pass such
special legislation.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: What it the amendment?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will answer
my honourable friend in a moment. My
honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), and I think the honourable gentleman frorn Boissevain (Hon.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Mr. Schaffner) both questioned my statement that there had been an amendment

to the Criminal Code that would in -any
way bear upon section 41 of the Immigration
Act, and I frankly confessed that I had
made the statement on the strength of the
statement which the Minister of- Immigration and Colonization made when he euggested that the Bill be introduced in this
House, because we 'were not overworked
while the Commons was busy. Therefore I
did not take a definite position until I had
looked into the anatter, because I am not
in the habit of making statements that I
do not mean or do not believe. I have
had the matter looked up somewhat carefully, and find that on July 7, 1919, one
month, to a day, after the amendment to
the Immigration Act was passed, sections
97A and 97B of the Criminal Code were
enacted. They are, contained in chapter
46 of the statutes, which was assented to
on July 7, 1919.
Before referring in detail to the provisions
of those amendments to the Code, honourable gentlemen, I would like to point out
to you why there existed a necesity to
rmake this amendment to the Immigration
Act on June 7, 1919. It was because the
Criminal Code did not make provision for
all offences that it was necessary to deal
with at that time; and I think I so stated
clearly when discussing this BiEl in the
second reading. The Criminal Code s it
existed prior to June, 1919, provided
penalties for various offences for example,
fo-r treason, for wh'ich the penalty is death;
for treasonable offences, for which the punishment is imprisonment for life; for conspiracy to intimidate a legislature, for
which the penalty is fourteen years' imprisonment; for unlawful assembly; for
riot; for riotous destruction of property;
for common law misdemeanour of rout;
for administering or being present at and
consenting to the administration of an
oath or engagement purporting to bind the
person taking same to commit crime; etc.
I need not give all the details. But there
were two apedific things whi-ch were not
referred to or provided for in the Criminal
Code, and which were at that time menaces
to the safety of the state and peoiple of this
country. Those two things were: unlawful organizations that were in existence or
were being formulated at that time, for the
purpose of promoting revolutionary activities: and the publication and distribution
of revolutionary literature.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not that
come within the definition of treason?

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Then, why flot entirely repeal this amendmient.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn quite willing that that should be done. But I point
out, honourable gentlemen, that two particular features, namely, the advocacy of
obtaining governmental, industrial or economie change 'within Canada, by the use
of force, and the publication and distribution of literature of the nature referred to,
were not specifically provided for.

I iihink, about ten day8--of the time that

either wýth or

Hon. Mr. BR.ADBURY: Will the honourable gentleman

In

the first

place, I should like to ask under what
authority they could be deported without
a trial? M-Ny
position is this. These men
have been tried and punished for an offence
which they comrnitted. They cannot be
tried a second time, but just as soon as they
corne out of jail, under the Immigration Act
they can be declared undesirable and deported.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that is
a very clear demonstration of the fact that
my honourable friend desires to, deport from
the country men who have been here for
twenty-five or thirty years, who have committed an offence under the law, have been
tried, found guilty. convicted, and sentenced, and who, having served the penalty,
would corne out free men if they were
Canadian citizens, but who, if they happened to be British subjects instead of Canadian-born, would be subject to a further
penalty. I submit that this is un-British, as
I said the other day, and contrary to constitutional liberty.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But would it be
unlawful?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Yes, I think it

is.
Hon. '-%r. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Would
mny honourable friend point out the law
under whichi a man could be deported from
this country without a trial?

if the Crirninal Code and the Naturalization
Act had then stood af- they stand to-day,

Parliament would flot have found it necessary or desirable to pass that drastic section
of thîe Immigration Bill.
Now, coming to the question of deportation without trial. My honourable friend
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
la a most capable and experienced lawyer;
I therefore f ul]y appreciate my very great
disability in attempting to argue with him
concerning a point of law. But I submit
that the opinion of the Department of Justice of Canada ought to go for somethirig,
and I believe it is held in high regard by
aIl honourable gentlemen in this House.
The Department of Justice have pointed out
that, notwithstanding the fact that in the
time of Queen Elizabeth many people were
deported, or transported, as it was then
termed-sent to, Australia and other partsbecause they were undesirable at home,
that has long since ceased to be the practice. After enumerating the items of legislation to, which I referred, which have been
passed since the ameudmnent to the Immigration Act in 1919, the Justice Department
point out:
That it will be observed at once from the
foregoing that very prompt and comprehensive
provisions have been made for the punishment,
otherwlse than by deportatlon, of persons who,
by the Vrovisions of said section 41 of the Immigration Act, are brought within the prohibited or undestrable classes
and rendered
lhable to deportation In the manner provided by
that Act.

The Department of Justice point out that

have been made for the punishment, other

that bie believes that is the question?
Hon. Mr. 'ROBERTSON: I do, sir.
HRon. Mr. LYNCH.PSTAUNTON: I amn
very mucli surprised.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Department
of Justice in dealing with the case goes on
to say:
it ia of course a question of Policy whether
a British subject who is guilty of any of the
acta rnentioned in subsection 1 of said section
41 of the immigration Act ahouid be rendered

lhable to the penalty of deportation; but 1 may
observe for your information that a aomewhat
cognate forrn of punishment, narnely that of
transportation. which was, devisedl as a atatutory puniahment In the time of Elizabeth, and In
the 18th century becamne a statutory punishment
for many felonies, has long since been abolished.
penal servitude having been definitely substituted for transportation In 1,857.

Tbe amendments under this Immigration
Bill prcoposed two things: firat, that a British su.bject wlio lias beconie a Canadian
citizen, after lie lias been liere for five
years, cannot bhe deported from Canada for
any offence witliout. baving a trial by jury;
and, second, that the legisîstion shall not
any longer 'be rdtroactive in its 'effect. The
last part of section 41 of the Act permits
the authorities to go out to-day and lay a
charge against a man for an offence committed a;t any time since 1910, to give him
a Star Cliamber trial, and to send hirn out
of the country. Possibly that was wise at
the time the legialation was passed, but
it is not wise no'w; and if the law is not
amended a*s proposed by this Bill, the
eff ect will be, notwithstanding the f set tbat
a Britishi eubject lias corne to Canada, and
by residence lias earned citizenahip and
naturalization liere, and lias acquired property and aîl the res't of it, that lie will lie
hiable to lie deported froni this country

fully in accord wîth the other section.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I amn with my

not see why hie argues that after trial these
mnen are noat liable to deportation. I do flot

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 nay have a

Frankly, 1 realize that that statenient miglit

Hon. 31r. ROBERITSON: But do not honourable gentlemen agree that it is. fot desirable that we dshould continue to have on
our statute book any unneceseary legisialion which causes friction. and promotes
unrest among our cammon ,peopleP With
the amendmnentsto the CTiminal -Code which
I have enumerated, and with the amendment to the Naturalization Act which has
been referred to, I think every possible
emergency has been adequatoly provided
for. There are in Canada to-day thousandds
of men, Canadiai-born citizens if you will,
who have no direct p-rsonal interest in this
subject, but who regard the present law as
aTbitrary and high-harided legisiation, and
who, 60 long as it remains, will continue ta
oppoise it

gentlemen, that when deciding finally
upon this question you will have in mind
first and always the fact that retroactive
legislation is undesirable, and will feel that
a British subject who is a Canadian citizen

MAPLE PRODUCTS BILL.
CONSIDERATION 0F COMMONS DISAGREEMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENTS.

The Senate praceeded ta consider a message from the Hause ai Cammons disagreeing ta the amendments made by the Senate
ta Bill 28, ani Act respecti]ig Maple Products.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I beg ta move:
That the Senate doth flot Insigt upon its
amnendmnents if the House of Commons agrees
ta the following amendiient ta the Bill as
passed by that Rouse:
Page 2, Une S. insert the following as clause

(5) Section seventeen of the Food and Drugs
Act, 1920, shail apply ta any prosecution under
subsection one of section two of this Act.

The abject of this amendinent is ta give
some protection ta those whli may bona
fide handie mnaple products. The Commons
ivili in ail probabilitv accept this, because
it is but reasanable. Section 17 af the Food
and Drugs Act deals with -want of knowledge and would be applicable in this way.
Assuming for the moment that a merchant
is handling unaple surnar praducts and is
unaware of any adulteration, he should
have the rig-ht to show that he had fia
knowledgue of the adulteration of the product; because it is a very difficuit thing ta
determine wvhether the pro.duct la adulterated or not. From appearance, and even
A
fram taste, one cannot determnine it.
very close chemical exarnination may be
required. Therefore I thinl, it is in the
public interest and in the interest of those
who handie products o! this kind commercially that same protection should be
aff orded.

JUNE 10, 1920.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We have not had
much time to consider this motion, but I
suppose my honourable friend bas some understandingý that the Gommons will accept
the>present amendment. They did not accept our former amendment. Is there a
chance of their receiving this better?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The former amendment was ill-considered: it, was
flot properly drawn. I looked into it afterwards and found that it had been hurriedly
prepared and did flot take into consideration the different classes of offence. We
limited it to one particular section, and
other sections had been overlooked. But it
seems to me that this amendment should
*be accepted lby the Gommons.

adviîsable to coinply w'itli the request -which

and to permit the. session of that Committee,
which wiii occupy I suppose two hours, or
two hours and a hait, to be devoted to

Cominittee then to report what may be their

satisfactory to the House.
-Hon. îMT. FOWLER: 16 it the intention
to confine the hearing to any set time, either
two hours or two hours and a haif? Because
the subject-matter would extend over a long
period of yiears, fromn the eariy settiement
of the country down to the present time.
It might take more than two hours and a

SECOND READING.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 53, an Act to amend
The Civil Service Act, 1918, and The Civil
Service Amendment Act, 1919.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bull
consiste of a eeriee of amendments to the
'Civil Service Act of 1918 and the amending
Act of 1919. Provision je to be made for the
temporary employment of persons outside
of Canada. At present it is not permisésible
to secure such employees without making
application to the Civil Service Commission,
or to employ them for more than thirty
days. IL is proposed to enlarge the
powers so that temporary employeers may
be appointed outeide of Canada for a period
of ninety days.
Another very desirable provision, which
w-as omitted from the bvo previous Acte, is
that a person who resigned hie position in
the Civil Service for the purpose of engaging
in the war, and who has returned from
overseas, may secure a statue that would
give him a preference over persons -who have
not served and who may have qualified for
entrance into the public eervice. It is only
riglit that recognition should .be given to
that clase of man. It does not follow that
he gets hie position back, but hie is regarded
as having qualified for the dlace of position
from which. he resigned.
Provision je also made for semi-annual
increases, inasmuch as the present legislation simply provides for increases being
granted annually.
.Probably the most essential provision that
is made in the Bill before us has to, do with.
the retroactive effect of the classification,
which has been completed, I believe, during
the present year. IL is proposed that the new
classification shail be deemed to have corne
into effect in April, 1919; that je to say, a
year ago lest Apnil. Comment may possibly
be made as to retroactive legielation involv-

follow that that arnount wjll be exhausted.
I understand that when the question of
classification was first taken up, assurance
was given bv either the Government or
;jiemîb, rs of te Government that it would
corne into operation on the lst of April, 1919.
The matter carne before Parliarnent at the
last Sesision, and rny re-collection às that
when it was before the Senate the undesirabllity of making the. classification retroactive was pointed out, upon representations
which had been made by the minîster in
charge of the Bill in the Lower House. But,
whatever took place at that tirne, it is said
that the asrurance which I have rnentioned
was overlooked. It will be for the Senate
to deterrnine what action to take in that
regard.
These are the rnain provisions in the Bill
now before us. 0f course, they will be
elaborated upon when we go into Coinmittee, and 6uch further particulars will
be given as rnay be required.
Hon. HEW,ÀITT iBOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, rny honourable friend, in discussing this Bill. has flot dealt ver-y f ully
with the question of the Civil Service; flot
as far as sorne of us would have liked to
see hirn go. There has been 8o mucli discussion throughout the country over the
action of the Civil Service Cornrisaion
flhat 1 for one thought the honourable
leader of the Governrnent rnight take this
opport-unity to rnake- a rather full statement of rwhat hiad heen done in the clas-sification made by the Cornmission. I do
flot know whether, by thiis Bill, we are
asked to ratify the classification which w-as
isubmitted to us last .year, or a further
classification.
If I understand aright, there are two
matters in respect to this Bill that necessitate a considerable increase of expenditure on the part of the Governrnent. Mv
honourable friend has not expressed hirniself as hein.- very strongly in favour of
the provision *which iis being made under
this Bill, that the reclassification shal
be effee~ive as frorn the lst o-f April, 1919.
I think the worde hie used were that it was
for the Senate itself to consider whether
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

that was an advisabie course to .pursue.
I urLderstand thiat 'ii tI 1e Supplernentary
Estirnates brought down this year there is

an itern of $12,500,000, reading:
Provisional bonus allowance for the Inside
and Outaide services of the Civil Service, to be
paid to such persons and classes of persons in
such amnounts and at such times as the Governor in Councîl may determine.

That has apparently sornething to do with
the legislation that is now before 'us. My
honourable friend lias; already stated to
the House that there is also involved an
arnourrt of $4,000,0OO, which I pre6ume ia
to be provided because of increases that
have in some cases heen made to salaries
under the classification that we dealt with

last year. I have lot, been able te obtain
as clear information as I would like Io have;
therefore I raise this question in order that
,rny honourable friend rnay explain the
matter te us when we go into Coimittee.
I think that crn thîs occasion it would be
advisable to impress further upon the Governiiient t.he disadvantage that the country
is suffering because of the way the Civil
Service is now ibeing carried on, and because o-f the serious lo-ss that has occurred
through a nuxuber of qehia officer6 having lef t the service o>winga to the conditions
which confronted them. That is in mny
opinion an exceedingly eerious rnatter at
the present timie, when we are snixious that
eV'erything possible should be donc to increase 'the production of the country and
to help in the developirnent of its mnining
and other resources. 1 had hoped that we
rnight have sorne statement frorn the Goverrent that the condition of things which
exists at the Dresent tirne would be
reniedied in the very near future.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, 1 desire to make only tw'o or
three observations in reference to the Bill
which has heen introduced hy the leader of
the Governnient. It will be remexnbered
that last year a Cornrittee of the Senate
was appointed for the purpose of dealing
withi the Reclassification Bill. I had the
honour of being the Chairrnan of that Coinrnittee. The Cornrittee rnade a report, in
substance concurring in the Bill as sent up
troin the <Yornmons, and taking the position
that it was flot adîvisable to alter a rnoney
Bill; consequently, as some honoura-ble gentlemen will remember, another report was
made recomrnending to the Governient
the propriety of making- the classification
retroactive to the Igt of April of last year.
That is aIl the Cornrittee feît warranted in
dom.- under good parliamentary practice.

JUNE il, 1920
That report was adopted, and 1 arn glad to
see that the Government bas acted upon it.
The Departments were numerously re-presented before the Cornmittee, and evidence was adduced to the effect that certain
representations bad been made to organizations of the Civil ýService by at least one
member of the Government that the classification, when it became effective, would be
retroactive to the lst of April last year.
Just a word in connection with one matter raised by the leader of the Opposition.
Representatives of the major Departments
of the Government, particularly those employing technical help, appeared at the
various meetings of the Conimittee; and 1
arn free to say that I think a majority of
themn were emphatically of the opinion that
the mode of selection of expert belp was
nlot working out very satisfactorily under
the Civil Service Commission. However, I
think the majority of the Committee were
of the opinion that the Act was a new departure; that it provided a new scheme or
arrangement for civil service reforni; and
that perhaps it would be as well to let it
run its course, and see if the legisiation
which is now upon the statute book would
work out satisfactorily. Perhaps because I
sat on that -Committee, many representatiens have been made to me since that time
that the departments requiring technical
help have been retarded in tihe performance
of their duties by reason of the slowness of
the Civil Service Commission in making
appointments. I have no word o! adverse
comment to make on the work of the Civil
Service Commission; but it is very much
overloaded; and it is within the know.ledge
of anyone who has taken the trouble to
make inquiries that the Government is lesing the services of a large numxber of technical men, particularly in the departmente employing chemis.ts and scientists. I think it might prove advantageous
if we were to do what bas been done in
the ïDepartment o! Soldiers' Civil Reestablishment and take these appointments
out o! the hands of the Civil Service Commission for a period of time, and let the
Department o! Scientific Research, or some
otiher body, -have an opportunity for
at least one or two or three years of dealing with the expert help that is required
in the scientiflo departments od the Government.
Hon. G. W. FOWLER:
Honourable
gentlemen, the Committee on Oil Shales bas
had before it some very clever younýg men,
experts from the Department of Mines, wbo
have given evidence to the effect that men
S-33J

515

occupying important positions and doing
important and valuable work for the
country have, greatly against their will, resigned fromn that Department because of
the insufliciency o! the pay owing te the
low classification in which they are placed
hy the so-caUled efficiency experts who were
imported fromn the United States for the
purpose of telling the people of Canada
where they get off. Invariably these witnesses have said that t>hose men, who have
spent a considerable number of years o!
their life and a very considerable amount
o! money in preparing themselves for the
work, would remain in the service, even at
a very much lower rate of remuneration
than they would receive outside, but that
the disparity between the pay which they
recei'ý~e and that which they could get in
private employment is so great that in justice to their families they have been obliged
te leave the Service.
I think thiis is an un! ortunate state of
affairs, and I think it is due to a lack o!
knowledge on the part of those efficiency
experts, who do nlot know enough to distinguish between the ordinary work of a
clerk and the work of a technical expert
who, aS I Say, bas spent a considerable
amount of time and money preparing himself for the position which7he occupiee. it
seeins to me that this business o! importing experts from Chicago-I think that is
their favourite stamping greund-is all
wrong. Amongat our ewn men we could
surely find some who would be quite as
competent to do the work as these so-called
experts. These gentlemen gave their evidence before the Committee, of whioh 1
was a member, and for my part I was not,
nor do 1 think any other member of the
Committee was, impressed by the superhuman ability displayed by themn on that
occasion. I understand that one department o! the Government bas had a Canadian efficiency expert, and that his 'work
bas been most satisfactory in reorganizing
the department on efficient lines. 1 do not
think it is necessary for us to go abroad,
particularly when the rate of exohange is
se mueh againat us as at present, and import these efficiency experts from the
United States.
That, however, is nlot the only fault 1
bave to find with this Bill. 1 purpose wben
the 'EIouse goes into Committee of the Whole
-and 1 so notify the House now-to move

Hon. Mr. TTJRRIFF: I acce.pt the correction..
Hon. GIIDEON ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, I presume to make a few
remarks on this Bill only because o! the
fact that 1 happened to be a mexnber o!
the sub-comniit.tee of the Cabinet that had
something te do 'with the adjustment of
Civil Service matters a year ago, which
has had a bearing on the retroactive feature
of this Bill. In March, 1919, the civil
servants in the Post Office Department came
to the Government with a number o!
grievances which they desired to have adjusted. This was in addition to the general
rea.djustment o! wages which the whole
Civil Service w as seeking at that time. The
honourable the President o! the Privy Council, my honourable friend the Postmaster
General, and myseif happDened to deal with
this question. )ýVe met the committ-ee representing the emloyees in the Post Office
Department. and by, negotiatîon successfully adjusted something like t-wenty or
thirty differen, grievances whîch they had.
But as te the question of salaries, upon
which they w-ere very insistent, the comnmittee was forced to tell them that they
could give thein no promise as to what the
new rates or the new classification would
be. because that was a matter not yet determnined. It had been reconimended by the
Civil Service Commission that the classification should be effective as from the
beginning of the fiscal year, which was
April 1, 1919. With that understanding, they
accepted generally the adjustmient of the
difficulties and awaited the outcome of the
new classification. The new classification
was brougaht down before the end of the
session, but, as honourable gentlemen will
remem-ber, there were in it a great many
points that it was deemed necessary te revise
or to consider further, and it was not finally
approved. The rates under the new classification did not go into effect in 1919. Bonuses
were first paid to civil servants in addition

à'.'

to their salaries in 1918. The Civil Service
Commission in 1919 recommended a cost
bonus based upon the salof living2
aries which the Commission expected would
be received under the new classification as
fromn April 1, 1919, and that bonus was paid.
Consequently, the civil servants have ever
since anticipated that when the neew classification came into eff ect it would date as
from April 1, 1919. The bonus this year bas
flot been încreased, and this fact is, I think,
an additional reason which we should take
into consideration in dealing with the
retroactive feature of this Bill, because it
is well known that the cost of living did
increase somewhat during the fiscal year
endin-, March 31, 1920, and it might be
contended that a larger bonus should have
been paîd this year.
With reference to the reorganization referred to by my honourable froend from
Assiniboja (Hon. Mr. Turriff), that is a
matter quite separate and distinct from
t.he reclassification referred to in this
Bill. After the investigation held by the
Arthur Young Company in connection with
the reclassification, they were instructed
by reason of incidents with which. this
Hlouse is familiar, to investigate the Printing Bureau and recommend a basis of
reorganîzation. That work bas been accomplished successfully, with the result that
between 300 and 400 employees have been
found unnecessary, a great deal of machinery and old equipment has been done away
with, and efflciency bas been increased. The
saving to the country is estimated, I think,
at betiveen $500,000 and $700,000 per year,
and it bas cost about $45,000 to bring- that
about, if my memnory is correct. As a consequence of the satisfactory resuits obtained
by that experiment it has been deemed
advisable to carry the inquiry into other
departments of the Governnient. Honourable gentlemen may have notioed. duringthe last few days some press commentswhich are, I 'presume, based on authoritative information, and which are substantilly correct-to t~he effect that it is proposed to cbnduct a sirnilar investigation into
the urockiing of saime o! the other depaTtments with a view to increasing their efficiency and placing them on a more businesslike basis. In order te rernive any confusion which may exist in the minds of

'Hon. GEORGE H. BRA.DBURY: I desire to Gay juet a few words. The Civil
Service question is a very important one
and for many years bas caused a great deal
of trouble in this country. When the Governiment decided to take the service out of
politics and band it over te the Civil Service Commission, in my opinion they did
6omething that did not commend the Governiment 'to the -people of this country. I
agree with wbat the honourable memnber
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Crosby> bias eaid
regarding the position that a public man
ought to occupy. When a man is elected to
Parliament, hie ought in my opinion to be
ccsnsulted regarding anything- and every-

511

thing that relates to hiýs constituency. Tîat
is why hae is elected. In many of our large
constituencies there are four or five hunldred postrnasters. Whieî one of those mien
dies or moves from the district and a iîew
poGtmaster is needed, who 6hould be asked
to make a recommendation for the position?
Under the present systern, it is at tiiînes
difficuit to get a man to accept such a position. 'The remuneration is so small that
it is very difficuit to persuade a man that it

Hon. Mr. I)XIIEL: Wbat about the constituencies in which the Government candidates have been defeated?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Under the old
system, the patronage of sucb constituencies was in the hands of the defeated candidates, and I have yet to learn that there
was any great hardship even then.
The Civil Service Commission bas been
f reely criticized for a great many things
for which I believe it is not responsible.
In the firet place the Civil Service Coinmission bas been overloaded with work. It
bias been given a great deal meore work
than it could hope to do thoroughly. In my
opinion, if the Governmrrent xvas determined
to take appointments to the service out of
the hands of the members of Parliament,
the proper men> to deal xvith them, then
tbey ought -to have started wit.hi the Inside
Service and to have put that Service on a
proper basis first. Any man who bas sat
in Parliament during the last eigbit or ten
years knows that there is not a department
in -Ottawa that i-s flot from twenty te forty
per cent overmanned to-day. That is a
notorious fact, and everybody admits iL.

SENATE

That lias beeni the situation for ye.ars. Stili
nu itiove has beenî made to weed eut the
departments. That is, to my mind the first
move that oug-ht to be made. The Civil
Seî vice Comnmission or those w-ho are responsible ought to see that the departments
are not overmanned. There should flot be
two pers.ons doing the work of one. The
criticism you will hear to-day, on the
streets and everywhere, is that if you go
into a room in one of the departments you
will fsec ten, fifteen, or twenty clerks, haif
of them sitting down chattÀing, or reading
the papers, and perhaps three or four
clerks trying te work. If the Service were
properly reerganized- the efficient men- and
women in the service would be paid a fair
remuneration for their work, and yet the
Bervice would not be such a burden on the
country as it is iat present.
With regard to this wonderful classification which hias been made by an American
syndicate, I do flot know of anything which
is te my mmid more deserving of severe
criticisni than this volume. They have
adopted the very worst leatîures of trades

clerks, al doing about the sanie kind of

Now, it does not matter how efficient or

ness o! that opinion. I think the honourable gentleman from Kings and Albert was
one o! those who most strenuously opposed
the Bill on its second readinz; but, because
the Bill had been sent to us unanimously
by the House o! Gommons. we felt that
there should be no alterations in it, and
that it shkould be given a trial. As a resuit
of that, you see the inaccuracies that -have
crept into the Classification. such as those
just read by the honourable gentleman from
Selkirk <Hon. Mr. Bradbury). You see officiais o! this House under the sway o!
officiais of the other House, and you
will also observe that, if it is neceosary

himit the scope of the authority o! the Civil

present moment is--I was going to say, little
better than a joke; but it. is- worsfe than that :
it is a crime. In my own caunty we have
four or five dredges. In the old days, before
the dredges st.arted work, word would came
from the Chie! Engineer or the Dcputy ta
prepare for the work, and the superintcndent of the yard would look around and
would employ men to run the drcdge. Honourable gentlemen may be surpriscd to
know that to-day he cannot employ one
man. Every one o! thase mnen must be advertised for, and by reason o! that an inefficient staff is got together; the good men
have been lost. The Purchasing Commission is just about as bad. If anything goes
wrong and a keg o! nails is needed. nothing
can be done until authority is reccived ta
purchase a keg of nails. Under the old
system the maxi in the yard would go ta the
store or would wire to the resident engineer,
and he would get the nails immcdiatehy;
whereas at present they sometimes have ta
wait for days ta make smaîl repairs. I say
that in view of these circumstances the Governnicnt miglit wcll consider whether it is
flot in the best înterests o! the country ta
iake some provision for the outside service.
If thcy want a Commission I have no objection; but the Commission should havý

been a Receiver of Wrecks. He dIied. While
possibly there would flot be a -wreck on that
north coast once in ten yeaTs, on the other
hand there rnight be a wreck at any time,
and there would be rio person te take charge
of it. I went to, the Deputy Minister of
Marine and Fishevies, and said, "You had
better appoint some one as Receiver of
Wrecks. It is true that a wreck mnay not
occur for a long time, but then again it miay
occur any tirne." He said, "I have no
authority to appoint a Receiver." I said,
"Oh, howv is that?" He said, "That lias got
to go to the Civil Service Commission."
The position bias te be advertised, and the
Civil 'Service Comnmission lias te appoint a
Receiver of Wrecks who miay be erniployed
once in ten years. As practical mien, we
nmust admit that this is an absurdity. If
a ton or two of coal is needed, authority
inust be had from this, that. or the other person, and eventaally you get back te the
Civil Service Commission. The Act should
be remodelled and recodified and made
practical.

Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen. I know it is a cold-blooded thing ta
get up aïfter this long discussion ta add
anything ta what has been said. I think
the honourable members of tihe Gavernment did not calculate upan the discussion
which has taken place upan the second
reading af thîs comparatively lirnited Bill.
The course which the discussion has taken
reminds me of a practice we had long ago
in the local legisiature of Nova Scotia: on
a certain day sane lhonourable inember
who had previously given notice would
move that the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole on the general

member of the House was at liberty ta
talk upon any subject he chose. I feel in
some ways Vhat on the whole it wou'Id be
more convenient if our members did not
follow the exsimple of the Committee of
the Whole of the Nova Scotia legisiature.
I do not'propose ta discussi the manner
in which the Civil Service Commission have
diszcharg-ed their duties; -but I wauld like
ta make just this one point, that we should

INSPECT'ION AND SALE BILL
SECOND READING.

Hon. Si-r JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 104, an Act to amend
the Inspection and Sale Act.
He eaid: Honourable gentlemen, p.robably
efew subjects command. the attention of the
Senate more frequently than the Inspection
and Sale Act. That is probably owing to,
the progressive character of the gentlemen
interested in its application. We have in
Canada the Fruit -Growers' Association, one
of aur mast progressive bodies, who neces.
sarily, owing ta the character of their bu-si
ness, are somnewhat expeTimental. We havt
passed legislation at the instance of the
F-ruit Growers' Association, and have gladrly
done so. At a late eanlerence of that organization it has been concluded that, owing
to the progressive character of the business
-I think I may appeal to my honourable
friend from Wentworth (Han. Mr. Smith)
as to that heing the reason-it is necessary
ta amend' the legislatian so as ta have it
conform ta what mighit be termed -the new
-requirements of the fruit growirng industry;
dor it has became a very important ind-ustry
in Canada. The ilegisiation at present on
aur statute books is very l1argely a reflectian
of the views of the fruit grawers. Notwithstanding that. it is now proposed tha-t owing
ta changing conditions, which of course are
indicative of progress, the law should be
modified or substantially changed. It is proposed that new standards shali be adapted
for apple bairrels a.nd containers of various
kinds; furthermore, for ie sake of elasticity, that certain powers, by way of regulatian, ehahl be vested in the Gavernar in
Council and in the Minister of Agriculture.
It does seeni almast an anomaly that those
engaged in an i.ndustry sucli as fruit growinga should haveta, caine te Parliament frani
time te time to a.sk for the adoption of
reg-ulatians reg-arding such mnanifest requirements in their business as containers and

Hon. Mr. MIURPHY - A good deal of
money was paid out.side to physicians who
attended the men.
Han. WM. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, I presume that the change in the tax
levied upon shipping is not for the purpose
of augmenting the general revenue, but for
the purpose of supporting the hospitals. It
is quite true, as has been observed, that a
number of years aga a tax of two cents per
regietere-d ton 'was, placcd upan ail shippimg entered at certain ports. In consequence of the very great increase in the
tonnage of vessels the rate of two cents
wes reduced ta one and a -hall cents. You
will sec the application of it at once.
Formerly a vessel of 3,500 tons was supposed ta -be a large vessel and the tax upon
a vessel of that size 'was flot excessive, although the owners of ships objected an the
ground that they -were paying a lheavy tax
to hospitals when they did flot use themn
for seamen. But now that vessels have increased from a tonnage of that size ta 5,000,
10,000 and 20,000 tons, you will observe that
the tax of two cents a tan would be an enornmous one, especially if na seamen were put
in the hospital at aIl. On a vessel of 5.000)
tans the tax would be $100; on a vessel af
10,000 tons it would :be $200. Wben the
owner of a ship has ta pay a sum like that
and places no seamen in the hospital, it
seeins ta hlm an exaction, and in the very
moderate 'bis that agents -have ta present
ta the owners that item is g-eneralýly picked
out as something- which is exorbitant andc
ought not to be paid, and the agaent is requested ta remonstrate with the Gavernment
re--arding- the payrment.
I take the port of Halifax, for instance,
because it has a special significance ta the
people of Canada, inasrnuch as it is largcly
a port of eall for s'h.ips from ail parts of
the world. A vessel miay put in for say
100 tons af coal to take on hier voyage, or
because of somne trivial accident to the nmachinery, or even for orders. To tax such a
vessel $100 or $200 seems ta be an exaction
on the part of the Government. Moreaver,
these vessels frequcntly have flot time ta
wait ta put a seaman or an officer, who has
some discase or has met with an accident,

525

in the hospital. He cannot wait tfor the
detention which takes place -in the hospital,
and a shore doctor has ta be employed and
paid for. The awners say: "We have paid
the doctors' bills for attendance to, aur officers or seamen; now we are taxed by the
Government $200 or $100 in addition, when
no service whatever has been rendered."
There are other vessels which may came
in thrce or four or half-a-dozen tîmes; for
instance, passenger ships which come in ta
land a few passengers. It is quite true they
are charged only three times. Stili a sumi
quite sufficient for the maintenance of the
haspital would be secured if the ane cent
and a hall already chargcd should be exacted.- Vessels of large tonnage-mail line
steamers, for inistance-will inake five or six
trips or more in a year. The amaunt taken
from themn is limited to three trips. Perhaps if the charge extended over the number of trips made it would flot be a very
large sum. But certainly the objection is
that the amount împosed on vessels of very
large tonnage is tao great in proportion ta
the service rendered.
I mighit cail the attention af the ininister
alsa to the fact that at Halifax the Government has noa hospital, -but the hospital is
maintained by the provincial gavernment,
the Dominion Government having the right
ta nominate, on the recommendation of
certain ïphysicians, seamen framn ships ta
be treated. Only a proportion of the expenditure is demanded from the Dominion Government thraugh the Marine and Fisheries
Department.
I arn nat g-oingc ta discuss howv this tax
would apply ta places like Montreal, or St.
John, N.B., or Sydney. Sydney is certainly in the saine category with Halifax, because steamers frequently cail there for
coal, or for orders whien thiey are bound up
the St. Lawrence, or because of accidents ta
machinery. In those cases, where the stay
is very short and where the tax is altogether disprapartionate ta the service rendered, I thinkz the former rate ai a cent and
a half would be ample ta caver ail the expenditure that the Government would be
called upon ta make in this cannection.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: I suppose that no
anc wishcs ta place any increased cost on
the aperatian osfour ship.ping, and any casts
that are impased are put on because thcy
cannot be avoided. Sick and distressed seamen are reaîly the wards of the country, or
the Government, and it is the duty of the
Government to sec that whcn they arrive at
any af aur ports they are prapcrly attendcd ta. It was supposed that -the fund for

SENATE
sick and distressed seamfen had a surplus
to its credit; but, as the honourable leader
of the Government bas stated to-day, that
surplus was due 10 the fadt that many
charges that ought 10 have been made
against it were flot made--that buildings
and repairs, for instance, which. were
DepartWorks
done by the Public
ment, were charged to that department
and nlot 10 the Sick Mariners' Fund.
The sanie thing occurred with regard to
overbead charges and matters of that kind.
I think, in fact I arn quite sure, that this
extra cost is absolutely required. It is
required because the hospitals--and xnost
of the eail-ors are now treated in the ordinary general public hospîtals in the ports
where tbey arrive-are all charging a larger
per diem allowance for looking after these
men. The consequence is that the cost of
maintaining the sick sailors bas increased
very materially, and so the f unds must
also be increased very materially.
There is enother reason for the increased
cost. 1 think it was the honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche) who
spoke of the medical charges bhein.- one of the
great causes of expense. As a matter of fact,
in the large cities, at ahl events in Halifax,
St. John, Montreal, and Quebec, the medical attendants have neyer been paid anything at ail, and they are begainning to
think it is about lime tbey were paid. I
do not see any reason why the wards of
the Government should be treated as
paupers and be put on the charity of the
mnedical men. There is really no reason in
the world, when you think, of the matter,'
w&hy the doctors of the country should be
expected to treat these men for nothin.
The Government. by mneans of the tax on
shipping, is perfectly well able to pay for
that service. It may be that in small rural
communities where there are no hospitais
at ail, und which are remote from hospitals, the local physician or surgeon ba,
been called upon to treat these men, and
bas treated theni in private bouses or wberever arrangements could be made for their
treatment; but in the larger ports the hospitls are now charginga fully double what
tbey did a few years ago, on account of the
increased cost of living; and that, witb the
attendance fee for the physician, will mean
quite an addition te the expense. In view
of these circumnstances, I think the tax
is a proper one to be placed on tbe sbipping of the country.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: 1 should like 10 explain te my honourable friend, Whio misBon. 1%r. DANIEI,.

apprehiended me, that 1 did not say the
owners of the ships objected to payinig for

seainen if they went int the liospitals; il
was only that when seamen did not go int
a hospilal, and the owners had 10 psy ouIside physiciens to visit and treat thein,
they thoughî they should not be cherged
hospital expenses in addition to the medical bills.
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, this is a very important Bill. 0f
course, there is no doubî about the wisdoin
cf the principle of the Bill. There is a
great deal of truth in what the bonourable
gentleman froni St. John (Hon. Mr. Daniel)
and the honourable gentleman from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Roche) have said with reg-ard
10 tbe eituation. A ship of 5,000 or 10,000
tons, with a crew of from 250 to 400 men,
cornes into a port like Halifax, and il is
found that four or five of the seamen are
sick. The sick mariner's fee cen be paid,
and the men handed over to the authorilies, sud the Government is bound to find
them a bospital. It is true that the Dominion Government bas no bospital; but in
Halifax we have a provincial hospital, snd
the Dominion Governiment, is charged for
every seaman put into tisat hospitai.
Whetbher the doctor receives anythîng or
not I do not know, but. I think my honourable friend from SI. Jobîi is quite right as
to that. At any rate, the provincial hospitls gel paid, and tise Dominion Government is bound to find a hospital for the
men. I 'would euggest tisat -when we go
into Committee on this Bill a great deal
ot improvement migist be made in il. Thse

would
be
for the Dominion Government to appoint a

snd see wbetber tise ftien really wvere sick,
or not; because, in order to get out of the
ship, men frequently pretend tbey are sick
when tisey are not, and in that wsy difi,culty is caused and ships are delayed. As
Ihe isonourable gentleman from Halifax
has said, a sisip coming in for orders or to
lsnd a few passengers, and wsniting to gel
sway quickly, is sometimes delayed by
reason of the fact that the captain has
te send men le the bospital and bas to wait
until tlie doctors are pleased to see thein

JULNE il, 1920
and make a report. If thait is flot done, the
,captain bas to go witbout the nien, and bas
to leave nioney there. perhaps three rnontbs'
pay. so that when the men corne out. of the
hospital they get their money and are 4taken
care of. This causes g-reat inconvenience in
shipping circles.
Suppose we were to say that we would
nlot pass this Bill, and that the ships should
not pay two cents a ton te ta.ke care e! these
men. [t would be an ountrageous situation.
When a 8hip carne in, the rnen, if they were
sick, would lie carried off to. the hospital
without a single cent being paid by that
ship. It seerns ta rne that it would lie
rather better to increase the rate and to
increase the accommodation by having a
doctor paid out of the fund, who could go to
the ship to examine the men, and see
whether t.hey really were sick. Now that
we have wireless telegraphy the shipping
agent couid lie informed if 4he men were
sick.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
Would nlot the
quarantine officers do what my honourable
friend suggests?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: No. The quarantine officers have nothing to do with that.
There is a port officer who looks at the crew
to see if they have any contagious disease.
The quarantine officer sees that the passengers have no contagious disease.
If the
oaptain says to the ag-ent, " I have one, or
two, or three, or a dozen men sick, and want
to send themn to the bospital," the agent
goes to the custorn house and gets a certificate and bauds it to the captain, and the
men are landed in the hos.pital and the
hospital has no take care of .them. As I
said before, these men may be shamrning
sick. A ship may corne into port for only
a few hours, and if any of the men on board
are sick, it rnay nlot be possible to get a
doctor to look alter themn for twentyfour hours; and as the captains cannot go without making provision for
the men, great inconvenience is caused.
I thînk it would be better to increase the
fee than to decrease it, and at the
same time to increase the facilities that we
have to-day. I think we have 'had a Sick
Mariners' fee since Confederation. I know
there lias been such a fee for the last thirty
years, and it lias been of the greatest possible advantage to shipsfroru ail parts of
the world to kno-w that the minute the
two cents a ton fee was, paid the members
of the crew would 'be looked after and taken
care of until the slip returned again. No
one would be more disappointed than the

527

shipping interests if we conternplat-ed wiping this provision off the siate altogether.
I arn sure that my honourable friend from.
Halifax, who lias had great experience in
these matters, will see that an advantage
is to lie gained by increasing the fee. Men
may corne in with broken ar.ms, or they
may break thein in port. I think the principle of the Bill is a good one.
To-day
every littie s/hp that goes to a United States
port lias to get a bill of heaith. A ship
going from. Canada to a United States port,
no matter whether syhe is 50, 100, 200, or
300 tons, lias to pay 85 for a bill of health,
even if there is alo indication at ail of sickness on board. We do not make American
ships bring a certificate to our ports, but
every slip that gos from the Canadian
Atlantic ports lias to have a certificate
from the American consul in order t, lie
able to land at an A.merican port. The
principle of this Bill is good both for the
ship-owner and tfor the seamen, and I arn
sure that they would not want to see it
wiped out o! existence. If we can amend
it so as ta inake it of greater advantage
V-o
the shipping interests I1 think we should
do so.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2.
SECOND AND THIRD READINGS.

,Hon. Sir JAMES ýLOUGHE-ED imoved the
second reading ai Bill 166, an Act for
granting ta Ris Majesty certain suais ai
money for the public service of the financial
3-ears endin.- respectively the 316t 'March,
1920, and the 3lst Ma'rch, 1921.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill ta prox-ide for the voting ai one-sixth
ai the supply. We have aiready passed a
similar Bill this session. It %viii be necessary ta pass the present Bill hefore the end
of the month. The amount provided under
clause 2, as honourable gentlemen will see
in the margin, is $62,900,000. Under clause
3 and under clause 4 epecific dsuins are
voted. What 1 said on the presentation ai
the similar Bilh less than two mnonths ago
is equally applicable ta the present Bill.

the end ai hast ýmonth?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU{GHEED: I understand that the money is required by the
l5th of this month.
Hon

Mr. BOSTOMK

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honiourable gentlemen, this is the second Appropriation Bill
we have had this -session.' 1 hope that iii
future we shahl fot have to pass Appropriation ýBils in this way. It is, I think, veiy
desirable that the Government should cali
Parliament early enough ta permit af voting
the money needed for carrying an the business of the country before the beginning
of the fiscal year, sa that we ehail flot have
to pass interim appropriations of thids kind
I
to enable the Governiment to carry on.
think it is in the in'terest of the whole
country that Parliament should be called
together earlier in thé year, and that its
busiiness should be done at a tîme more
especially
convenient to the -members,
those who have to corne from the West.
T'hey ought ta be allowed ta leave at an
earlier date, in order that they may enjoy
the salubrious climate of the West, which
they so much appreciate, and may help in
the production of the crops which are so
necesary at the present time.
There is another matter ta whichi I should
like to draw the attention of the House.
In pas.sing these Appropriation Bis I presurne we do flot commit aurselves to tlue
différent items that wjll be included in the
Supply 'Biil-such items, for instance, as
the loan to the Canadian Northern Railway.
I have raised this question before in the
House, and I raise it ag-ain to-day in order
that honourable gentlemen uuxay consider it
and express an opinion upon it when the
final Supply Bill is presented. 1 think it
is a niost objectionable procedure on the
part of the Government to ask this House
to pass items oi this kind in a iSupply Bill.
It does not seemn to mie that such an itemn
as a loan to a railway comipany for the purpose of making- up a deficit of the year before, and carrying on its business and ohtaining the necessary eqiiiliiient, etc.,
should be included in a Bill to provide appropriations for carrying- ou the admrinistration of the country.
In the present Supply Bill there are two
or three items that have no ri-lit ta be there.
One is a loan of $25,OOO,OOO ta the provincial governments for the purpose of
enabling themn ta deal witli the Lousing
problem.
I do nnt want ta take Up the time
oi the bouse at present in discussing,
this matter more fully, but I do think
that honourable «members shouhd consider these questions, and tluat w'e ought ta
find saine method oi urging upon the Government that in future stncl itemns shiould
not be put into the Supply Bill, as they have
been for the hast two or thrpe vears.

That he will cati the attention of the Governnment to the necessity of building a branch lune
on the Grand Trunk, froni Victoriaville to M'thabaska, a distance of 3 miles, so that the railway may reach the chief town of the district
of Arthabaska, and inquired whether It la the
intention of the Government to bulld such a
branch lune

He said: Honourable gentlemen, in
putting this inquiry before the House I
would ask the privilege of saying a few
words in support of my position. As perhaps
flot many honourable gentlemen know the
place well, I may say that the town of
Arthabaska is situated three miles from the
town of Victoriaville, which is on the main
line of the Grand Trunk, and that there is,
no railway connection between the tiwo,
towns. The result is that in going to Arthabaska one must drive from Victoriaville. Arthabaska is the chie! town o!
the di89trict of Arthabaska, which. comprises the three large counties of Megantic,
Arthabaska, and Drummond, which have a
population of over 100,000 souls,' including
22,000 electors. The court house is in Arthabaska, and when the Courts of the King's
Bench for criminal business, the SuperiQr
Court, the Surrogate Court, or the Magis-trate'is Court sit, the mai ority o! the jurymen, witnesses, and parties to the litigation
are obliged to drive fromi Victoriaville to
Arthabaska. The Crown Lands Agency is
also situated in Arthabaska, as are the
offices of the Collector of Provincial Revenue, Sheriff's office and the Registry office,
so that this branch line is very much
needed.
Another reason for the building of this
road is that the Government would benefit.
More trade would be dîrected to the railway
at Arthabaska than noNv goes to it at
Victoriaville. If these 3 miles of branch line
were built the people o! St. Adrien and the
township of Ham -swould send their freight
by the Grand Trunk railway, which is now
a Governument road, instead of by the Que'bec Central Railway.
Some honourable
gentlemen may say: "Whyli
did not the
Grand Trunk build this line?" Well, they
always said they had no money to build itand now I believe that. In addition to al
this, there are splendid gravel pits between
Victoriaville and Arthabaska which would
supply gravel for ballast, which would save
moru'y toi the Government. To build this

amendni-mts moade by this Bill do flot
seeni te effeet any great change. 1 think
ffheir purpese is to make some of the sections a littie clearer and to provide for one
or two alt-iratic'ns that were overlooked
when the 3i11 of last sesalon was drawn.
ht seents te me that the most important
amendment that is beingy made is that
which deais with the question of fees, not
only of salicitors and witnesses, but also
Nrith regrard to inspectors. When %%e go

shouid look into that matter very caref nIly, hecvise 1 believe, as a layman-and

HUDSON BAY ROUTE.
RE.PORT 0F SPECIAL COMM1¶1TEE.

Hon. GEOXRGE W. FOWLIER moved the
adoption of the second report o! the Special
Oormnittee appointed to inquire intoo the
navigability snd fishery resources of the
Hudson bay and etrait.
He said: Honourabie gentlemen, eariy
in the firgt cession of 1919 a committee co'nsisting of twelve inembers of
the
for
-this House -vas appoint-ad
purpose of tsking evidence with. regard
to the navigsbilit-y of Hudson 'bay and
ptrait and t.he naturai resources of the
Hudson bay district. This Committee was
continued during the short cession o! 1919,
and again this session, and has now presented7 its report. The evidence taken is
somewhat voluminous. The me.mbers. cf the
Com.mittee were îmbued 'with the idea that
the subject-matter of their inquiry 'was a
very important one. For many years there
has been projected a railkway te the'Hudson
bay and a route throsigh Hudson bay and
strait to the Atlantic and thence te, Europe.
There has been a great deal of discussion
throughcut the country with regard te, this
project for the last t.hirty-five or forty years,
some people beingt in faveur of the
route and others bit'teriy opposing it.

Somne years ago a Bill was passed by this
House authorizing the construction of the
Hudson Bay railway. About 1912, Rlthink,
the railway was begun, and it bas been
continued until steel la laid te about 100
.miles .from the bay and the graing, I
believe, ia ail done te the bay. The work,
however, was allowed te, stop during the
latter years of the war, because the energies
o! this country were entireiy devoted te
winning the war. In 1919, the con-fliet being
over, -it 'was feit by memlbers of the Senate
that sufficient, knowledge had not yet been
obtained, officially at least, with regard te
this work, and with regard to the (probabiiity of the sucoessful navigation o! Hudson bay and the strait leading into the
Atlantic, and aiso the, resosirces o! the Hudson bay region. This, Committee was therefore appointed. The Comrnittee held many
sessions and examined many witnesses, and
the result cf its inquiry is now before
you. I ohall take the liberty of reading the
report. It is familiar te ail the members
of the Oo'mmittee. 'I may say it la, almrost
unanimous. Only one member present was
opposed te the findings o! the Committee,
and one member who was not present hasHon. 'Mr. DAMIE L: How man-y members were present aitegether at the ti.me this

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There 'was at ieast

-Hon. Mr. DANIEL:- Yes, just a bare

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A quorum is sufficient te transact business, and a quorum

say whether they approve cf the findings
of this Comnuttee or net.. One member of
the Committee who was not present bas expreésed himseif te me as being opposed te
the report. Ail the other members o! the

The
drawn from ail parts Of the country.
Commdttee had in view acquiring information
on the following points:(1) The length of the season during which.
the bay and strait were reasonably navigable
having in view the presence o! ice, the occurrence and, persisterice off snow storms, the advantages to be gained by aida to navigation
sucit as w1reless telegraphy, light houses, fog
signals and hydroplarles.
(2) The style and size o! vessels to be used
for the carrying trade.
(3) The relative menite o! the two ports.
Nelson and Churchill, and the relative cost of
the developient of each port.
(4) The fishing resources of the bay and

(5) The minerai resources of the country

(6) The utilization o! the country for the

meveral witnesaes regarding the length of the
season o! navigation but mil agreed that the
minimum wouid under ordinary circflfltanTces

would flot likely exceed five months. Voyages
have been mnade through the strait as eariy as
the 6th day o! June, and as late as the fIrst
part o! November with the ordinary type o!

were adsnitted-ly rather exceptional cases. AUl
were agreed, however, that modern navlgating

the route would be able to compete with the
of communication bemore soutiteriy channels
tween titis country and Europe, it would be
necessary to have a type of freighter capable
off carrying from 5,,O00 to 1-0,O00 tons of dead
weigt. and in the opinion of titis Cornsnattee
from the evidence adduced before us, there
wouid be no difficuity in handling so large a
vessel on the route, provided it ws properly
strengthened and protected ln the forward part.

Of course, heretofore only vessels o! smaller

size have been used because ships o! langer
capacity have not been requined.
The concensus of opinion is that Hudson bay
remaina open ahl the year through and that the

ice does not extend beyond thirty or forty miles
from the shore. The strait is aiso open for the

greater part off the year and wouid proobabiy be
open ail the time except for thte ice which cornes
down late, in the autuion from Fox channel
and obstructs navigation in the strait.

That is, the ice is not formed in the strait
itself; it is extraneous ice, which cornes
into the strait through Fox channel.
It was, generaliy conceded by the eight wItnesses who gave evidence on titis point that the
aids to navigation which might be Installed
along the strait wouid greatly facilitate the
passage and considerably extend the season of
navigability.
Your Committee took a large amount of
evidence reganding the relative mnerits off the
two western portq, Churchill and Nelson, and
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

there was a considerable divergence off opinion
arnong the different witnesses as to which of
the two should have been seiected, having ln
view the shorter railway haul in the one case
and the cheaper construction of the port itself
in the other. Churchill was shown to be an
absoIutely land locked harbour entirely protected
fromn every wind no matter from which quarter
it should blow, where a few ships could at ail
times ride at anchor in perfect security. Nelson
on the other hand has no natural protection
f rom the sea, except such as it receives by reason
of Its remoteness f rom the body of the sea,
there being a twenty mile stretch of shallows
between it and deep water. A narrow channel
bordered by wide shallows, connecta the proposed harbour of Nelson with the open bay. A
very large amount of money has aiready been
expended upon the harbour improvements o!
Nelson, but a mucit larger aura ls stili reqiuired
before the present plans can 'oe carried out.
There seeins to he considerabie doubt whether
or not, even when the proposed plans are comnpleted, the harbour at Nelson wiil be an entirely

Churchill It would be necessary to build about
eighty miles of road across a country wliich
haa been described by one witrsess as very
difficult, It having a stretch o! thir.ty miles o!
morass almost impossible to cross owing to the
difficulty of getting a firm foundation for the
roadbed. This ls, however, denied by the testimoniy o! two witnesses, of eacit of whom the
Coinmittee was greatiy impressed. Botit J. B.
and J. W: Tyrreal testified that there was a
perfeotly good and comparatively short route
froin the present route deflecting at a point
sme fifty-six: miles from Nelson and going north
and east to Churchill. The present harbour o!
Churchill ls rather small, but, according to the
evidence of the Messrs. Tyrrell, viicontradicted,
could easily be enlarged enough to accommodate
al the trade likely to offer for many years to
corne.. Beyond the present deep water harbour
there 'ls a large basin of shallow water, the
bottomn of which is composed of hard olay mixed
with bouiVers, which could be eagily dredged
and the resultant harbour would be off its size
one o! the finest ln the continent. The Tyrrell
brothers are very familar with the country
around Hudson bay, having spent several years
each in research and in examination of these
reglons. Mr. J. W. Tyrrell spent one winter at
a station in Hudson strait taking observations
for the Canadian Goverfiment and also looked
over the country from the Pas to Churchill on
beh&îf of a cosnpany who had some intention
of building a railway la that part of the country
sciteme which wa" afterward abandoned.
-a
He had no hesitation ia saying that no difficuity
'whatever would be found in extending the
raiiway to Churchill. It is the opinion of this
Conmmttee that the Government would be well
advised If before expending any more money
on the harbour works at Nelson they were to
appoint a committee of expert engineers and
railway builders to examUine the route to Churchill and. ascertain whether or flot It is really
possible, as the Messrs. Tyrrell say, and what
wouid lie the cost and advantage of ntaking
Churchill the port and terminus o! the Hudson
Bay road rather than Nelson.
In the meantiine, iaying of the rails could be
completed to Nelson, and that part could be used
for the present ln its present state.

other words, we do not propose that the

of this enterprise

While no one was able to speak with certainly
as to whether the codfish were plentiful in the
bay or nlot, there is n doulit as to the etrait.
AU the rivers flowing into the bay team with
fIsh, and walrus and seal are aiso found In large
numbers In the strait. No doulit as soon as the
Hudson Bay route la establshed, a very large
and lucrative fishing Industry will lie established
there. Recent discoverles have shown that the
country surrounding Hudson bay la etrongly
and richly mineralized. particularly In gold and
copper.
Mr. Stefansson, the distlngulshed polar explorer, gave evidence before your Committee.
He 1s a devcout bellever In the posslbulity of
utillzing what have always been known as the
Barren Lande of the North, and the Islands
within the Arctic Circle, In the cultivation of
-the reindeer. cariboo and ,nusk ox for the
production of meat. He gave evidence as to
the splencdd quality of the fleeli of these
animais as food for the people, and es to
the cheapness with whlch Il miglit lie produced.
He sald that the wlId lands of the north whlch
have always been looked upon as worthlew
could, carry at least fifty million head of reindeer
and,. tee million head of music ox., a.nd that the
cost of handing these huge numbers would lie
trlfllng in comparison with the profit to lie made.
The effect of this upon the world'a food supply
would lie tremendous, and your Commlttee would
strongly recommend that the ma.tter lie energetically* taken up by the Government.
1 eee in the meantime that the Government have passed an Order in Council mak-

îng a certain grant ýf territory to Mr. Stefaneson for thirty years, fifteen of which are
to be without remuneraticin, and the last
filteen years with considerable remuneration.

This, gentlemen, is the report of the Gommittee, and connected therewith is a precis.
of the evidence taken, thrown into narrative form, eliminating ail maLter that did
net Louch upon the questions at issue, and
thus made more readable and attractive. I
submit that every one of the findinge of the
Committee is supported by the evidence.

The desire in preparing the report was that
it should be absolutely supported in every
instance by the evidence which accoinpahies
.it. While in anme instances there waa evidence both pro and con, including evidence
that the season ef navigability was, shorter
than we have found here, yet there is evideuce to support the finding of the Commit-

tee as to the season of navigability. We wilI
always find differences of opinion bet-ween
witnlesses, but after caret ul consideration o!

ail the evidence placed before them the
Cernmittee came to its findings. There was
a question in the minds of sorne gentlemen
-about 'the voyage in the strait being a
early as the ath of June, but Mr. J. W.
Tyrreli spent a winter there, making observations on behalf of the Government, and I
wiI1 read, for the benefit of one membher of
the Committee, who challenged the statementHon. Mr. POWER: What year, please?
Hon. Mr. FOWLKR: On the 5th of June,
1886. This is what Mr. Tyrreil said:
1 was still occupying my shack at Ash Point
(in the Hudson strait) and a whaling steamer
came Into the strait and anchored right in
front of our station without knowlng 'we were
there. The ]ce in the harbour was still firm.
but there was no Ice to be neen In the strait.
The captain told me that he had not eeen a pan
of le In thse Hudson strait up to that time, and
he passed on next day to the west. The shlp was
a Dundee whaler, I think she wa-s wood. He
got through ail right. and returned In the autumn.

Bo 1 say in every case you will notice
that our findings are supported by evidence. Speaking for myself-and I say
this knowing that my words will be taken
down, but 1 arn prepared to stand by themn
-I have the utmost faith in the feasibility
of the Hudson bay -route, and aliso in îts
future success. We have people who lack
faith in the resources of this3 country, and
even in the country itself. When the Canadian Pacifie railway was buiît, 'the masses
of the people lacked faith in the enterprise.
but against the doubts of the majority of
the people, soine of whoin were representatives in the House of Commons and in the
Senate, 'a feiv strong men, nation-builders,
by the force of their personality were able to
carry the project through. The reports sent
out by the Hudson 'bay people with regard
to the countrv that is to-day the granary
of Canada, and te some extent the granary of the world, were te the effeet that
wheat and such grains xvould not grow in
that country at al]. We were told that
everything would be frozen up and nothing would grow. Well, the refutation of
such statements is found in the fact of the
mighty West ve have to-day, on which
-%ill largely turn the future of this country. What was true at that time of the
WVest will be true. in my opinion, of this
northern country in the future. Geographically, there is every reason to have faith
in i-t. 'It is much farther -south than
many parts of Europe which are supporting a largze population and adding
mat-erial]y te the -%'ealth of the world; and
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

those regions and those waters, which are
looked upon by some of our Eastern friends
as frost-bound during a great portion o]
the year, and therefore unfit to be navigated wjth commercial success, are net se
frost-bound as many parts of the territorial waters o] northern Europe, which
are navigated cemmercially, to the great
advantage o] a very large and increasing
population.
Would
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
you mind giving us a resumé o] the arguments on both sides o] this most interesting subjeet-not only your conclusions, but
the evidence that was given before the
committee?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It would be almost
impossible, I can assure you.
Hon. Mr. LYN'OH-STAUNTON:
the argument on both sides.

I mean

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
There was flot
mueh argument. You will hear the argument frein our friend the genial and handsome member fromn De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain), who was one o] the, opponents, and also frorn one of the genial members f rom St. John, who was also an opponent. They will give you the dark aide
of the ghield; I amn showing only the silver
sîde. You may be sure, when the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière gives
his views, it will be exhaustively done. 1
understand I will have an opportunity to
reply at the close of the debate, although
I arn net so sure it will be necessary, because I believe the arguments that can ha
brought forward against this measure will
not ha sufficiently cogent or important te
cal] for an answer frein nie, their basis
being se flimsy that I do net see how an
intelligent argument can be founded upon
them. I wvould therafora mova that this
report be adopted, and that rule 100 be
suspendad in so far as it relates te the
printing- mentioned in paragraph 9.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: The honourable gentleman has very much impressed me with
the agraeable and convincing way in which
hie has axpressad what was brought before
him; but I should like te ask what was tha
charactar of the witnesses who said that
tha strait was net navigable for four
months. Were they amateurs or visitors,
or wara thav vessel-masters, and experienced people of that kind? That would
have a great influence on tha findings of
the Commnittea as te the period of navigability.

JUNE 15, 1920
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: In reply to my honourable friend 1 might say there were a
f ew men who said they did flot think the
strait was navigable for so long a turne
as four rnonths. Like their confreres who
held to the contrary, they were shipmasters.
There were others who held the opposite
view, and we chose ta believe the others,

if no ship cornes.". It is 35 years since Mr.
Hugh Sutherland used to corne down here
with the project of the Hudson b.ay route,
but it was not taken seriously. There la no
polifical capital in this queetion.
The
party to which I belonged before I carne
te this *House were just as active es the
other; they etarted the survey, they began
the work, they aven arected a bridge at Le
Pas; but both parties were sirnply catering
te the voters of the prairie provinces, by
offering them aomething, when most men
who loo~k at this question seriously know
there is no possibilîty of that Hudson bay
route ever being worked cornrercially. If
the ýComrnittee had desired, it would have
bean easy for them, Co have called any one
of the managers of the various etearnship
companieS li the country, and get thern ta,

sorne fifty ships, and he said, "'I woula neot

Hon. Mr. CASGRAJN: I have spoken
here so often on this subject that 1 amn almost asharned ta trouble the House once
more; but I mnust say that, althnxgh there
are somne parts of the report with wbich I
agree, there are others £rom which I differ.
For instance, I do not agree with the conclusions of the report; but I agree
with the Cornmittee when they say that
Port Nelson is no place te make ia harbour,
and- will neyer be a good harbour; that it
will always be exposed te an eauterly gale

gale-that renders that port absolutely dangerous. 1 have the authority of Captain

and I -arn glad Vo denounce him in the
Senate Vo-day. There is no sense in a man
coming before a Committee of seriou-s men
and talking of having wheels on a submarine eo that it cou.ld go underneath the

in his head.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is that part of the
evidence?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is what hie
said. 1 would take that with a grain of sait
and I would put the musk oxen and the
reindeer in the submarine under the ice in
-the strait. But, speaking seriously, the
question of the navigation of Hud.son bay is
old. old, old; but 1 will inake the prediction
now that as soon as the rails reach the
shore of Hudson ibay there will be no more
Hudson Bay Company boats corning in to
Ibring -supplies. they will corne by rail.
Hudeon bay' boats have been going 'into
Hudson bay for the last three hundred
years, and very few have been lost-whyP
Because they 'have been small eailing vessels, made saucer-shaped. The Neptune was
made saucer-shaped, and when the ice
eormed and -the pressure came tshe was
simply lifted, bodily out of the water and
,tayed there untiI it pleased Divine Providience to loosen the ice and cha.nge the current. You will find by the report of Commander Wakeham-and I have had inany
cruises with himn. although not in the Hudson bay-that hle went up there in a ship
called the Adventurer, -whicb bad an oal,
rudder 14 inches tbick. Thiat rudder was
snapped off like the steni of a dlay
pipe. His ship was lifteçi cean out
of the water, and reînained there for
three days. She was an iron ship. but
Fshe was built saueer-shaýp&d, and the ice
crowding underneath bier lifted her Up; but
she was bent so ba>dly that you could see
dayligbht through the decks, and the rigg.ing
hung like ribbons from a maypoie. Strange
to say, wben the ship wvent back into the
water s-he resumed bier shape and everythingu becarne tant again. Thiat bappenied
at, the end of July. Fortunately for tbem,
they bad their provisions with tbem. That.
bonourable gentlemen. is notbing new. In
1697 D'Iberville fitted out an expedition to

JUNE 15, 1920
saii from Newfoundland. He was on board
the Pelican, and hiG two other ships were
cruslhed by the ice within his very sight.
1 have often relat-ed tis incident in the
Bouse, and I oniy repeat it for the benefit
of those who -may flot have been here then.
That happened in the latter part of August.
Captain Bernier, who has navigated a great
deal of that -part of the world mn a sailing
ship, with an au.xiliary, says that the inmense volume of water that pours not only
out of the Fox channel but out of the
Hudson bay when -the tide lower8, cornes
down at the -rate of nine knots an hourthat is at the rate of 10 miles an hour; -as
fast as a good homse wi-ll trot along the roa
-and that the ice which is running at that
-rate at the surf ace does not change its
course as it does at the bottom. There are
what they cali growlers, huge icebergs draw-ing 500 or 600 feet of water. Fancy the
pressure of water at auch a depth. These
growlers are carried with the out-going tide
for en hour or two hours after the tide on
the surface has set in the opposite direction. The tide on the surface changes firet,
@nd these growlers, coming et the rate of 4
or 5 miles an hour through the surface ice,
can 'be heard fbr miles.
If a ship
is cauglit in -the surlace ice, and cornes
in contact- with one o! thoae growlers, she
is absolutely wrecked. The only t>hing todo
5s to get into enft ice, that ie, ice that is etspposed to have ibeen forrned the saine year.
Old Ice, that lias been in 'the North for
years, is as liard, as rock, and no ship can
resist it; but if she waits in the soft ice until
the growlers go by, and until a lead fs
opened up, 6he is ail right. Captain Wakeham toid me that one turne when he was
going into Hud-son bay lie was carrying an
officer o! the ]Royal Northwest Mounted
Police. He told this police officer that there
was no use in insisting upon going into the
strait just at that turne, because Le would
gain nothing by it. The other inan was
in charge, however, and lie said, -You are
here to take me into Hudson bay, and I
order you to go in," and they went in. That
was at the beginning of July. They got
cauglit in the ice; sud it was somewhere
about the 2Oth o! July when they got out o!
the i-ce again. Commander Wakeham sayi
that if they had waited until perhaps the
6th or 7th of Juiy they would. not have gotinto this ice.
Nuw, -the Nox'thwest passage and the
navigation of Hudson bay is a very' old
problein. Honourable gentleman may have
asked theinselves why it was that in times

53i

,one by the different nations were looking
for a passage to Cathay or India througli
the North. That is a thing that lias puzzled
many people. The reason the Dutch, the
jEnglish, a.nd the French .too, we're trying
to get through there was because at that
time Spain reigned supreme, and if the
other nations attempted teo sen, vessels by
the southern route they feil a prey te the
Spanieli navy.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would the honourable gentleman indicate about the turne that
Spain ceaeed te be supreme on the southeru
seas; and whether or not there were exipeditionis seardhing for thle northwest passage centuries after Spain ceased te be a
maritime power?
Hon. Mr. CASGRLAIN: I arn very glad
that the honourable gentleman- lias put me
on the track. The first explorer we know
o! was called Corte-Rleal; that w*as in 1500;
but lie did nothing. In 1776, not so long
alfter Spain lost command of the sea,
Frobisher disc-overed Frobisher's bay. I
will give you somne of the details. I think
I have studied this question probably as
much as -any other honourable meier of
thIs Bouse. Frobisher had two ships of 20
tons and. one o! 10 -tons. Those ships were
about 35 feet -long and about 12 feet wide.
One of our canal boats to-day is 150 turnes
as big as one of those ships. Those slips
were so sha.low in draught that the ice
would lift them. An ordinary -modern 10,000
ton cargo boat with iron &ides would draw
at least 26 or 27 feet of water, and sIe would
not ris-e on the ice when it carne crushing
arbund her. Here i& the ice coming at the
rate of 9 miles an hour; that ship wouid
be crushed like an egg,-shell. Honourable
gentlemen know that the thickness of tbe
skin o! an ocean steamer is oniy threeeights of an inch. Why does the honourable gentleman think the Hudson Bay
C.ompany buiit the sides o! their ships
an -înch-and-a-half thick and ail the
other parts in proportion?
Why did.
they build them so that witî a crew
o! forty men on 'board t.hey could carry
only 45 tons of cargo? They had to be made
strong te resist the ice. Instead of threeeightha of an inch you have an inch-and-ahall o! thickness, and every other part of
the ship is reinforced accordingly. This
report of the Committee ays that the forward part o! the ship could be strengthened;
but what is to prevent the ice corning at
ber in other ways in the eddies? The Chairman of the Cornmittee (Hon. Mr. FDwler),
born by the sea, is now somne distance from

SENATE
the ocean, or he would know tbat. If you
are going ta build an ice-breaker you have
ta make lier an ice-breaker ail round.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would suggest ta
my honourable friend that hie look at the
evidence of his idol., CapVain Bernier, and
hie wi11 se that that is the only part of the
ship that needs ta be strengthened.
Hou. Mr. CIASGRAIN: Captaîn Bernier
bought a boat from the Govern-rnent-Vhe
Arctic. We have ail heard of hier. 1 think
my honourable friend remembers the Arciic
and the afternoon teas with the Esquimaux
ladies. 1 Baw the Arctic, and what was
her construction? She wa& a wooden ship,
if I remember rightly, and she waa a verypoor freight carrier. She was braced with
great big timibers running froni one side
ta Vhe c>Vher, and4 -perpendicularly, 50o
ihat she, would not be cru,-hed in the ice;
cand she was euch a poor treig'ht carrier
that when she lef t Quebec there was. no
apace in the hold, end the ca.rgo, which consisted of food for the erew and coal, had to
be piled on the deck. It was a providence
that it was, the middle of the summer, and
that they had nice, caim weather. While
speaking of coal., I want ta say that 1
believe they did find coal in the North, and
go!, enough ta fill their bunkers a.nd bring
some hack.
I do noV want t.o continue this long etory;
but, honourable gentlemen, thiie is a commercial proposition. Where are you going
,ta get insurance for ships sailing into
Hudéon bay? 0f course, you can ins'ure
anything; but if the insurance is going ta
cost as much as the value of the wheat,
this route will have no advantag-e over the
ordinary route. I have asked some insurance people, Lloyds among others.
whether they would take such insurance.
They say that no one ever Vhought of sendin- a shi.p up there. 1 have asked shipping
men, and they say they would noV considjer
it. The first thing I think the Committee
should 'have done was Vo have got eome
îsolvent, reliable comp.any ta .say that Vhey
,would carry 'wheat up there, even if iV cost
a dollar a bus-hel. 'I amn told that when a
cargo of whea!t is shipped a draft la attached
to the bill o! ladin-, andi that it le honoured
by the bank and the money paid oveor ta
the shipper of the wheat. Well, ibefore the
bank would advance the money to pay the
draft .they 'wouid want 1to know il the wheat
had been insured. Otberwise, if the ba.nk
advanced the rnoney and the wheat or other
cargo -were io-st, rwh, -would repay -the bank?
Certainly not the person ta whom the cargo
w«as oon6igned.
Hon, Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The ban], would not
take the draft unless the insurance policy
wvas pinned on.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is exactly
,what 1 have 'been told. Even this mornîng
a shipping man said to me, -There must
be an insurance policy pinned on." It would
have been easy for the Committee to cal
some insurance men and to ascertain fromn
t.hem at what rate they would insure; and
if the rate had been prohiibitive that
evidence would have been enough. I must
say that the Committee gave very careful
attention to the -work. The members were
very fissiduous in their attendance at the
meetings, and the chairman was very industrious. He asked a great many questions
of the rwitnesses. But that was the kernel
of the thing. When I saw the drift of the
iCommittee I «Must say I 1oot confidence
in it, because it was so easy to have begun
at the beginning by finding out first if there
was any company that would volunteer ta
send a ship -ta Vake out a cargo; and 1 defy
anybody ta find such a company .anywhere
t.hrougahout the iength'and breadth of this
country. I said, "There is really no use in
proceeding further with this inquiry if we
have not started at the beginning by finding
out first whether we can geV ships to go
there or noV." I have inquired of shipping
conipanies and they would not send a ship
there unless they were guaranteed the price
of the ship. That sett.led that point. The
next tihing would have been the insurance.
But there is in the report one good thing
with whjch I thoroughly agxiee. The report
recommends that no more money be spent
on Port Nelson. 1 concur absolutely in that
recommendation. That is a very good thing.
In any case the Government had decided
flot to spend any more money on the Hudson
bay route for tihis year at least. The expenditure had ibeen absolutely stdpped, and I
do not think there is any chance of it being
resumed this year.
With regard to the interests of the people
of the Northwvest, 1 could cite figures ta
show%that the crop of the year could noV
be shipped out, but wvould be there for
eleven .montlhs. It would cost at least 51 or
6 cents for storage, with wheat at the normal
prîce of $1; and iL would be much more
to-d-ay. That would have ta be added ta the
freight charges. On the other hand, as
everyhody knows, wheat has been moved
in normal times from the head of the lakes.
Port Arthur and Fort William, ta Liverpool
for 12 cents a buishel.
As ta the relative merits of Port Nelson
and Fort Churchill, the report states that

JUNE 15, 1920
at a point 56 miles froin Port Nelson the
rail-way line might be switcbed off te the
north and east towards Fort Churchill. But
some say there is a swamp many miles in
extent wvhich could not be bridgaed over. I
do net 'think the swamp will cause very
much trouble. The swar-np neyer thaws out;
se tbere weuld be a good foundation on the
ice. Underneatb tbe mess tbere is solid ice,
on wbicb the sleepers could be built, and
tbey would last a long time, being kept in
a fine frozen condition. There would be ne
trouble in tbat respect. But in Fort Churcbill
tbere is a barbour, tbey say, big enougb to
accommodate ail the steamers tbat would
be used -1-ommercially there. I say -amen te
tbat. I say that Churcbill barbour is big
onough te a.ccomanodate ail the steamers
Ithat 'wiIl ewer go theïre. I agree abeolutely.
O there ere things in -tbe report witb which
I do agree: first the condemnation cf Port
N!elson; tben, tbe statement that Churchill
-is big eneugh. for ail the steamers that will
-ever go .theïre.
However, to be practical, I de net see bow
it can ever be cf any possible advantage
for tbe Government te spend any more
money on. that enterprise. There is absolutely no cb.anee wbatever of its ever being
cf commercial use. I would commend to tbe
members cf this House tbe reading cf tbe
evidence taken by tbe Committee. The
Senate should certainly weigb thie evidence
well before adopting tbis Teport and comnmitting tbe Senate to tbe feasibility cf tbe
scbeme. After &Il, tbe opinion cf this House
sbeuld be werth sometbing, and should be
se considered by tbe country. It is net wise
for us te jump te conclusions, alfter tbe
evýidence of scme cf the witnesses. One cf
the star witnesses was Mr. Stefansson.
After sucb evidence as bas been presented,
it wculd be enly right for this Heuse te
allow the -report te renisin on the Table
seme time fer consideratien. We want te
be taken serieusly. Men engaged in tbe
shipping business, net only on tbe Great
La-kes but on the Atlantic coast and on
tbe Pacific, will tell you-and they knowthat the route is net practicable. Tbere is
a Ibook in the Pairliemen-tary Library called
-The Arctic Pilot," and in that bock you
will find wbat I bave told you. Commercial
navigation is not possible in Hudson bay
and strait. 1 think tbe Senate would be
wise îto leave the repo-rt. on the Table until
such times as tbe members bave taken
cegnizance cf it. Having taken cognizance
cf it, I do net think tbat the Senate in its
wisdom would decide in faveur cf the
scherne, against -what is the almcst unani-

à

mous opinion. Senators might themselves
consuit some of the shipping men and ask
what they think of the navigation there. 1
do not think there is one shipping man who
would say that he would like to navigate
those waters.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable'gentlemen, I was hoping tbat as the years-went
round my honourable friend who, bas just
taken bis seat would lose a littie of t.bat
pesaimism tbat be always eipresses 6o volubly when this subject is brougbt up. My
bonourable friend says that tbe shipping
in H{udson -bay là altogether impracticableim.possible. Ferhaps tbe season is. not as
long there as in other places, -but if everybody followed tbe poliey tbat my honourable
friend advocates tbe country -would neyer
mske any progress. I inyself bave seen a
dozen sbips at one time frozen in tbe ice
in tbe St. Lawrence river in the f ail of the
year-in tbe month of Noveinher. Does
that mean that we sbould not try te navigate
the St. Lawrence during tbe months of
Nevember and December? It bas neyer been
claimed tbat you can navigate Hudson bay
a*nd £tirait ducring a long season of the
year. But if they can be navigated for four
montbs in tbe year, is not t 1hat an advantage? Does our western produoe go out by
the St. Lawrence? How mucb of our wbeat
goes out by the St. LawrenceP It goes by
the United States. If we can send more of
it out tbrougb Canadian ports, will ïV flot
be an advantage te do so? And my bonourable friend must not forget tbat for between
two bundred and three bundred years tbe
eýudson's Bay Company navigated Hudson strait and Hudson bay and lost
only two vessels. That is net a bad record.
I sgree .tbat. they 'vere lo-t 5,000 or 10,00
ton vessels. But you can build vessels that
wvill in ail probabilit-y stand 'the conditions
of navigation there. and there are men in
this House who will live te see a big trade
done on that route. There are in the Hudson bay district resources tbat wil1 naturally
employ 6bipping, and many sbips will go
out througb Hudson *bay and strait for
about four montbs of the year.
I do not say, bonourable gerflemen, that
1 arn greatly impressed witb the value of
the Hudson bay route -for tbe sbipping cf
wheat. Some wbeat, I tbink, -will go tbat
way. lIn the early days, wben we were advecating tbat route, there 'was a great sbipment of cattie from the West to the Old
Count.ry. That trade bas fallen off-bas
practically ceased. Few of our cattie now
go te the Old Country. The cattie tbat we

SENATE
export go to Buffalo .and. Chicago, chiefly .to
Chicago. But the day will corne again,
ne doubt, when we shall be export.ing tens
of thousands of head <if cattie from the
western plains to the markets in the Old
Country. When that day cornes we ehall
have in the Hudson bay line, the best possible route for shipping cattie. Anybody
who has had any experience knows that
one of 'the difficulties in shipping cattie
across the Atlantic la the long railroad haul,
which us particularly hard on -the cattle
when the weather is warm. The Hudson
bay route ~Will ho a good cattie Toutle, bwecause it is 1the shortest and 'the coldest.
But I want to point out that even if there
were neyer a bushel of wheat exported Irom
Canada by the Hudson bay railroad an-c
K>ut through thie st.rait. the rail-road. would
stili be" worth building. 1That road will
open up the country and develop trade -as
a colonization line. I cani rernember very
well, honourable gentlemen, the time when
people living out in the West, or many of
them, had liftie or no ifaith in that country
west of the province of Manitoba. They
claimed that w.heat could net be grown in
any part of what is now the province of
Saskatchewan, or in Alberta. Over forty
years ago I settled in Manitoba. I was there
for four years and then moved out fafther
west to what is now Saskatchewan. I wus
neyer on the trains going back and forth
but there were dozens of ipersons who would
say te me: "Why did you make such a mistake as to go ouft infto that country? You
can neyer grow wheat out there. 'It is to

would .be frozen even if it did grew." An<d

Hon. JOHN W. DANIEL: Whatev-er importance may lie accorded to this report,
tor whatever opinion we *may hold as to
its fairness, eo far as it is supposed
to show the trend of the evidence
the Coinwhioh was taken before
mittee, we muet admit that the project
itsellf is very important, flot alone to the
people in the Northwest who are specia.lly
advocating it, but to the whole of the people
of Canada who will have to pay for building
1the raîlway and iprovidiRng the port, aflVerwards making up any deficit Vhat may
accrue from the carrying out of the projeet.
I have alwaye-4aken a very great intereet
in ships and navigation, -and everything
4hat pertains thereto. It bas been my
fortune to make eeveral trips across the
Atlantic, three of which I made in isailing vessels, one of themn occupying eix
week8,. and the last one in a large
full-rigged ship, heavily laden with railroad iron, which took no less than
nine weeks Vo go frorn London to New York.
I have seen the Atlantic in ail its moods,
have enjoyed the pleasure and co-mfort of
running before a fair breeze and with a
eree-fiowing saii, and the reeas following
alter. 1 have also experienced the discoinforts and dangers attached Vo weather that
compelied the iying-to of that ship for no
les6 thlan thre-e days at a time in a storma
as severe as ev-er came on the North
Soý -far, as being somewhat
Atlantie.
familiar personally with matters of that
kind, I have at least that experienýce
Vto guide me. In ell those trips, I
-had oniy one ex!perience of iog and ice
icom.bined: that was on the lasrt trip 1 made
in the old Virginian, the io.st comfortable
ship I was ever on. Alter a pleasant voyage
until we came near the shores on Ithis aide,
and beg-an Io approach the Straits of Belle
Iele, -we sudd-enly ran into la dense black
fog, just such a fog or miet as has been
described by 'those naviga-tors several of
whom appeared hefore -the Committee. i
thought it veRyv strange, when the captain
Hon. Mr. TtItBIFF.

o! that ship flot only slowed the vessel
down, but brougýht her to -a dead stop; but
the matter of ice neyer occurred Vo me at
that time. We were delayed by the fog
for quite a long time, and finally a breeze
sprang up and blew away the mist, and 'we
emerged into sunshine. On doing so we
found ourselves absolutely surrounded by
icebergs of strong, clear, hard, Ârctic iSe.
That ship could anot have gone on in that
eog, either at slow speed or at amy other
ppeed, wîthout crashing into ioe. Therefore,
when 1 hear civil engineers, or engineerýs in
charge of terminal works, and all that,
giving advice that tramp steamerg, which
are nothing, but floating tanks, can go
through log with safety at slow speed, when
ice conditions are prevalent, 1 feel that they
are entirely ignorant of the conditions on
which they are giving their advice.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 would like Vo know
what part o! the water the honourable
gentleman was in when he wjas surrounded
by those icebergs.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Coming towarde the
Straits o! Belle Ilie. As !I say, in those
matters 1 rely entirely upon the advice and
knowledge of the navigators, the captains,
the men who are responsible, for the safety
of their shipe and of their cargoes, and the
crews that manage t.he ships, rather than
on mere landsm-en who, in order Vo push
*forward an operation, would send tramnp
eteamera into Hudson etrait a.nd aldvise

come and say:
p&nd vet gentlemen
"Oh, there is neyer any ice in Hudson
strait; you cau navigate iL in the winter
time," and ail that sort of thing. It seems
utterly absurd that people should make
such statements without smîling Vo themselves, for everylbody should know that they
were épetaking. at random.
IL gave me a grea)t deai of pleasure to. le
present at meetings àf the 0ommittee.
With the experienie that I had h.ad
on the wa.ter I was able to take in
the evidence o! those navigators. Take,
for instance, Captain Fireakiey, a muan
who has been in'the empioy of Vhe Hudson
Bay Comnpany, travelling and commanding
ships in that region for Vwenty years.
It was a great pleasure to hear those men

JUNE 15, 1920
who lied been there and knew what they
were talking about. Those are the men on
whomn will depend the navigation o! those
straits; not men who remain on rhore -and
tell them they can do this, that, and the
other thing. The evidence showed that the
whole scheme'is dominated by the conditions
of the straits. If honourable gentlemen
will compare the evidence we have before
us to-day with that taken yeare ago by
Committees of tItis Senate with regard to
this very subject, they 'will find no difference whatever in the conditioné in Hud8l>n

doubt as to that, and, to use a vulgar terna,
I am not making any kick about it, for it

nothing Wo say about it now. My remarks
are not in criticism of the undertaking, but
they are in criticism of this report, because
1 do not consider that it je based upon the
evidence which was taken before the Conimittee. We know that the influences which
operate on the succese or non-success of
tItis -route are the length of the soason, the
safety o! the route, the size and capacity

Now, there is a statement that 1 hold is
entirely contrary to the evidence taken by
the Committee. It is, on the whole, contrary
to 'the evidence of which this compilation of
evidence is full from one end to the other.
That is one Teason why I say that this
House should not be called upon to pass a
report without having an opportunity of
reading the evidence for tihemselves, and
II do flot see how they can intelligently take
any other course. The matter ie of importance, and if this report does flot coincide
with the evidence that was taken, why
should honourable members of tItis House
be asked Wo pass on it without having an
oppoz'tunity of informing theniselves? The
report winds up witlh the request that this
9e'nate o.rder 1,000 coipies-of what? Of -this

accompanies the written report of the Committee-the partial report .which the Chairman, and I might say the .majority of the

apparently do flot feel satisfied that the
niembers of this chamber should be afforded

is one which xnight very well have been

The minimum period of navigation, accoýdlng

Then we have this report saying that
all the witnesses said that the minimum
season of navigation would be four months.
Two, and a hal! monthis was Mr. O'H1ara's
statement. In order to substantiate that
statement I amn going to quote a littie more
from the -authorities, some of whom gave
their evidence before aur Committee. The
captains referred ta in O>Hara's, report are
principally Newforundland captains, men
who have been enga-ged in that business
for many years. Captain Webb says:
From. the last week off July until the 1Sth of

to those who were taking the optitaistic
view of this undertaking than any other
witness we heard. He maltes this remark
with regard to the navigation off the strs.it:

That is, navigation is open for Auguset,

witneffs ,coincided in the opinion t.hat four
monthe was the shortest period.
Now, with regard to matters like ice in
the strait, 'which la aIl part of this question, if the honourable gentleman wishes
to look it up, I mnight say that on page 2
Captain Anderson says:
On account of the presence of ice in Hudson

strait at any time of the year vessels trading
there ought ta -have tixeir own bowc apecially
strengthenied to resist the e.

Also at page 25:

especially at night, and a vessai coming In

There is more of that; but I want ta eall
attention ta one witness lbhat j amn now going
He la a gentleman
to bring ibefore you.
'whom you ail know; I think the honourable
gentleman fromn De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr.
Caegrain) said that he was in the Chamber
this afternoon; 1 refer to, Colonel W. P.
Anderson. We ail know him and have perfect confidence in bis opinion, because we
know hae would not express an opinion for
which he had not good grounds. At page
156 of this book, Colonel Anderson is asked
this question:
Pe:rm your study of the reports and from the
gencral knowledge that you have acquired from
various sources, what le your opinion wlth regard ta thc navigability of the bay and strait?
-AL The concensus of the testimony that has
been given le that the bay and thc strait are
navigable for a minimum of thrce xnonths, and
a maximumn of four anonths in the year.

Stili this report of the Committee says
that every witness agreed in the expression
of opinion that the minimum was four
months. Later on Han. Mr. Sharpe aske
Colonel Anderson:
aEVIaSD

Q. With proper aids ta navigation could not
that time bie cxtended greatly?-A. Na.
Q. What makes you say that?-A. SimplY
what I know of !ce conditions in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, In the River St. Lawrence and
an the Great Lakes.

Colonel Anderson afterwarcls aaid that
while ahl these aidé might facilitate the
passage xy! a ehip here and there they coulti
mot extend the period of navigation, because they would not have any effeet on
the climatic and physical conditions. His
reasoning in that respect, of course, was;
absolutely correct. Ha wae asked by Mr.
Campbell:
What would be the period of navigation of
the strait? From whcn to when? You gave
the time. but you did not say from wheni to
when?-A. From the lst of Auguat to the lst
of Noveniber ta thc normal period. You <night
get Ia a few days before the lot of August and
yau might get out a fcw days after thc let of
Novernber.
Q. The original navigators wcnt la there ln
June In sailing vessels?-A. WeU. I know that
a few years ago Captain Anderson tried ta get
In at the end of July with a powcrfui steamer
and did not get through the sirait until the
middie of August.

Then the Chairman says:
1 suppose If It in late In starting. it Je late In
flnishing?-A.- Not neceecarily, I think. 1 don't
thlnk no.
Q. 1-f you couil not get through until the
middle of Auguat. Uic season would- hardly be
t-hree xnonths?-A. It was the middle of August
the year I sent up a mnan wlth aids ta navigation-.-'wii2i automatic lights, unwatched lights,
ta bie put u-p at saltent points In thc strait and
bay. and he was so much. dclayed In getting
the work Ibegun that lie could not finish it
that year. That is how 1 lbappen ta be so sure
about It.

This .book ia so full ol tha:t sort of thing
that -I do not like ta weary the House by
re-ading any -more remarks; but I want ta
eniphasize the importance of the suggestion I make, that members shouid be provided with a copy of the evîdence s0 that
Colonel
they can read it thems-elves.
Anderson speakis again about t1vi aids suggested by 'Mr. Camnpbell:
Q. It bas been suggested that an aeroplane
station be cgtablished on Mansell Island, and
w1reless aids ta Investigate thoroughly the te
conditionc ln the strait?-A. That won't aboqjsh
the iee, though, will it?
Q. No, but what do you think of that Idea?
-A. I think tt ought ta be a val uable aid, but
'only during the navigable ceasan. I mean ta
say Pt would not ia any way Increase the navigable seasan.
There ia the opinion of a man whoe

opi!nion we aal respect and treat with the
greategt confidence. I spolie c! Captain
Freakley as being a witness in whom 1
placed a great deal of confidence. He also
refera ta this matter. At page 133 hae was

EDMlON.

SENATE
Wouid it be possible for an ordinary tramp
steamer such as we know to trade to Nelson
and back just as she is, without any strezigthening on her?-A . Ordinary traimp steamers
have been employed by the flepartment of
Railways and Canais to run between Halifax
and Port Nelson, for instance, the ss. Alcazar,
es. Sinbad, as. Sheba, es. Sharon, as. Durley
0f these the
Chine, es. Cearense, as. Ailette.
Cearense was wrecked at the month of the
river on September 13, 1913, and the
Nelson
Ailette, leaving Port Nelson on Septemnber 14,
1913, encountered tce and damnaged her bows.

Now, with regard to the Ailette. She was
a tra*mp steamer, and ber bones are stili
bleaching on the ahores di Port Nelson. Inquiries were made in the Committee whether there had been ,any investigation into
the cause of ber loss, and it deveioped
that there biad beein none. The reason
is very obvioeus. I think when I tell you
what h ppened te ber that you will rea'dily
understad why it was quite unnecessary.
It wouid be quite unnecessary to hold an
inquest into the cause (À death of a mnan
who tuntbled out of a tenth-storey window and was killed by falling on a pavemnent~.

The Sheba mnade, the 1atest departure from Port Nelson. 6he ýwas a tramnp
steamer. She Ileft on October 22nd, witb
two isealers to ck)nvoy ber; when they got
to Manaell TIand they met a beilt of ioe
12 miles wide, and if it had nlot been
for the two "ealors ahe could net have
got through. Captain Freakley says:
The only icre encountered by these shlps was
a beit 12 rUiles wide. enoountered by Manseil
Island. The ses lers assisted the Sheba In makIng a passage through IL.

Then he goes on to speak of the Milette.
He says:
During that samne season the tramp steamer
Ailette which left Port N-elson on the 7th of
near the
Manseil
October encountered ie
Island, and recoived a hole In her bow.

Is it any wonder the captain turned
around and beached ber, in the middle of
October? What else could be do? I presume he came into Port Nelson with bis
pumps working to their fullest capacity to
keep ber afloat. There was no accommodation ready for ber in the way of docks, and
ail be could do was to run ber ashore.
That is wbat be did.
I feel diffident in detaining honourabie
gentlemen, but this book is absolutely full
of such evidence. The report says that
every witness agreed to tbe same tbing,
wbereas wbat tbey agreed to was entireiy
different from the statement in tbe report.
Our old friend Captain Bernier, I tbink,
refers to this matter too. He says that the
average season might be four months. Captain Bernier is the only one that I b ave
Hon. Mr. DANIEL.

read so far who spoke at ail of four nionths;
the rest of the witnesses rnentioned three
nionth s.
There is a special point to which 1 desire
to caîl your attention. The report niakes
this ctatement, -which is, I think, not warranted by the facts:
Voyages have been made through the strait
as early as the 5th of June.

That statement is made, as I understand
it, on the strengtb of some testimony that
is. not contained in the book at ail; At is
the testimony wbich was given by one of
the Tyrreli brothers. This Mr. Tyrrefl had
wintered at a place cailed Ashe Inlet, wbicb
is on Big Island, on the nortb coast of the
Hudson strait. I believe it is about onethird of the way through. The testimony
of Mr. Tyrrell is that be saw a Dundee
wbaler that bad ancbored in-front of bis
place. He states that bis harbour at tbe
time was -irozen absolutely 8olid, but in
front of that the strait was clear, and this
Dundee whaler entered tbere on the 5th
day of June. He says that she leit there
the next day and went west. That is wbat.
ho said-" went. west "-and that ia ail he
knew about ber until she came back again
in the autumn. Nobody knows wbat time
she got into. Hudson bay. Nobody knoat ail events, nobody bas given testimony
that she, ever went into the bay at eil. She
a
.'was wbaler seeking whale-s.
Thon there is another reference, on page
230, not to that vossel specially, but to what
I cali the June bugs. Mr. B-owden is describing the construction of a 6hip cal'-ed
the Diana. He says she was a sealer of
extremoly heavy construction:
He arrlved off the eastern end of the straits
on June 22-

That was in the month of June, but it
was the 22nd-and had no difficulty in entering and passing the flrst third of this distance through the
straits--

In other words, be got te exactly the same
place on Big Island-Ashe linileithe encountered ice with which he
-when
battled until July 10, most of the time being in
mid-straits about the region of Big Island; after
which he got free from the tee and got through
to Manseli Island on the l3th of July.

Commander Wakeham was sent in there
to make as oarly a passage through as h
possibly could-to see bowv early he could
get through and how lato in the fail be
could corne out. I bave no doubt ho got
into this favourable stretch on the northorn
part of the strait, probably with a no'rthern
-wind blknwing the ice, away. 'He got in

JUNE 15, 1920
so far. but no farther. That ie how former
vesseis, whaiers and others, often gat that
far in the early part of June. But that ie
entirely difierent from getting through the
strait inta the Hudson bay. So I say that
the etatement nmade in this report, that a
vessel got through-mind you, that Dundee
whaler must have got into Hudson bay on
the 5th day of June to make this statement
corret-is utteriy absurd. But the st.atement is put in such a way as to be misieading in the extreme, end 1 for one
object to having a statement like that put
into a report as being taken froin the evidence presented before our Committee. It
is not ao No veael ever got th.rough at
that date. There is no evidence in. this reporlt, nor, I believe, in any other report, to
show that a.ny vessel went thro'ugh thfé strait,
.that is, inbt the bay, on the bth. June, or
on .any other dlay ini June.
I thi.nk -we mnay eonclude, e 1 have
airéedy stated, that thiree mo'nths is about
as long as you can depend upon navigation
in that strait, and bhrough the strait and to
a Hudson bay port. The seaaon wiii extenid from August te p-exhaps the end of
Oc4e.Very many ciever suggestions
were made iwith regard to ships getting
.thièugh the etrait with thé aid of aeroplanes, hydroplanes, 'wireless, and ail thoe
things. The evidence given was that they
would facilitate the passage o! an individual ship here and there, but they could
not possibly, in theÎr -nature, extend the
time of navigation.
So much for that. Here je one sentence
in the report with -which. I agree:
The strait Ls also, open for the' greater part
of the year and 'would probably be open ail
the tinie except for the Ice which cornes down
late in the autuinn frarn Fox~ chajnti.

TFhat ie as mucli as to eay that if it had
not. been for the ice in the strait there
would not -be any there. That, I think,
is correct.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is very cierver.
Hon. Mr. BOYEIR: Gospel 'truth.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Then the report expresses -the opinion of the Committee that

you could not do any bueiness with -what

.As to this Churchill-Nelson conti'overay,

way, anid ineide is a saler and better har'boux, than Nelson. I think eveTybody 'will

reason why the Governnient engîneere
chose Port Nelson, in preference. Without

do, -to give the statements of these eng-ineers

By the Chairman:
Q. You were tellhng us to what extent you
would have to build over this turtdra 7-A.
There was anather obvious factor determined
that the construction to Churchill meant a
longer lino. Sa unless Churchill offered positive
advantages there were good grounds for a preferemtce for Nelson. Nelson, had #.he obviaus and
positive advantage of being a shorter b-ine.
By Mr. Ca.mpbell, M.P..
Q. Would this be a good point qat which to

between the two.
By Hon. Mr. Daniel:
Q. Prom where would that be measured?
Le Pa-A.Yes. That la the difference between the length of the two Unes. The seane
line would be used to a. certain point on the
route from whlch the branches would turn

-that report wae published ithere was stlU nme
surveylng ta be dons and the work was contlnued for several years later. The actual final
determination as between Nelson and Churchill
did not. take place until the cantract for section
3 of the Hudson Bay railway was lot.

The motion for the adjo)urnment of the
debate was withdrawn.

Now we corne down to the final determination aïs ta the port:

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Make it to-morrow,
if we -are not going on to-nîght.
Hion. Mr. DANIIEL: Well, honourable
gentlemen, if you want more of it, I shal
have ta give it ta you.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I was cammencing
to say soinething about the contraversy as
between Churchill and Nelson. Personally
I have no~ special interest in that matter
at ail. I stated that the engineers gave the
reasons why the Government chose Nelson
in preference ta Churchill. For my part, I
think the reasons given -were very good, and
they were deserving of the attention which
they did receive at the hands o! the Government.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Would the hionourable gentleman be kind enough ta state
some of the reasans?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I arn going to read
thern ta you.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: I should like to
know what they were.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Here is one extract
froni the evidence of Mr. Bowden, the Chief
Engaineer a!, the Department a! Ilailways
Hon. M.r. DANIEL.

The cail for tenders was made on alternative
routes. The drawings exhiblted showed a line
ta Churchill and showed a lino to Nelson. The
contractar was called upon ta bld for each and
It was not until the tenders for thîs work were
received that the definite and positive decision
was reached. Previaus ta that though there
had been naturally a good deal of questlonlng
as ta what the Governxnents intentions were,
and, in general, I think, pretty definite preference for Nelson he.d been shown before the
cantract was let, although the decision had flot
been at ail final.
The caîl for tenders was issued in August.

Hon. Mîr. CROSBY: What year?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1912. Oniy a rnonth
was given for the preparation of estimates,
and I expressed the opinion that that was
a pretty short time. He eaid:
There were no feaitures
1 don't think no.
other than transportation ta cansider. and the
contracte had been lot for previaus sections.
Any cantractors who purposed competing for
the work would have had their representatives
out loaking over the character of the country
long before they were callefi upon for tenders.

JUNE 15, 1920
iNow here is the point:
Our estimates showed the Nelson line to bo
about $3,000,000 cheaper than the Churchill
line. The contractors' tenders made a StilI
greater difference. The contractor's tender, extended, amounted to $3,668,000 and sanie hnndreds for the Uine to Nelson, and $7,7-98,000
for the lune to Churchill. At the saie Urne.
It iras feit that although a very emnaîl deveiopment-- snoh a very amail one s would not justify the construction of the Hludson Bay railway--might be made ut Churchill at a less cost
than ut Nelson, an adequate deveiopment wonld
probably coet less at Nelson than ut ChurchilL

There, in a nutsheil, 1 think, you have
tihe reason wh.y Nelson was. chosen-that
for a smaîl business it would net be neceasary to spend much mouey on Churchlill,
and it would be cheaper to go there, but
for an adequate development, fore a large
business, it would cost more ta provide
f acilities at Churchill even after you had

that is the principle. He goes on te say:
In view of tht difference In the tendier conta
ther>e iras a etrong proference for Nelson. IIowever It &a on the econornie vide that Port Nelson bas the chief adrvantugo over Chburchill; ire
wreo flot building a harbour, ire irese building
a porit. The exipenditure on tht Hudson Bay
system la not for the purpose of furniéhing protection -for vesqela, but ta get the graIn oversea" as cheaply as possible; and the extra îlength
of lins te Churublil und the extra cost of maintenance, which la unquestionablo, would offset
a very considera-ble capitail expenditure at Nelson. I am nfot at tail sure that for 10,00G0,000
busheis developmrent -ChurchiLI would not be
cheaiper than- Nelson; but a large enough deveiopnient. looklng forirard to the future, ont

ruilway, us shown by the tenders. bas an advantage of $4.100.000; and the operating preferce la ail In favour of Neison.

1 think I have said sufficient with regard
to that to show the reasona 'why Nelson wa-s
ehosen and why Nelson should be retained.
Tht cost of the undertakiug thus fur was
given to ns last year, up to the 31st of
March, 1919, as $20,851,816. 0f this, $14,526,560 iS for the Hudson bay railwuy, and
$6,125,256 is for the terminai ut Port Nelson. Tht railway, as yen kuosv, is not coinpleted. I think it requires about 90 miles
te get into Nelson. The terminais ut Nelson are not completed; I understand they
couid not be completed, nder &bout four
years, aupposing they had been gone on

of the expenditure that mu.st be undertaken in the future even to get this port into a position to test iA as to its commercial
ability. 1 -would net think it advisable,
evez in the in.te-reat of the undertýaking itself and of those who are -anxious te see it
carried throngh. to have a -break in it that
would stop the business for an indefinite
length of trne, until engineers and railway
men could go ail over that country and
locate a line and tell us how much it was
going te cost. lIf I *were a menwber froinm

gentlemen, I desire te make a few remarks,
which xnight or might flot lie lu order when
we went inte Committee, regarding the outside service. if I am in order I would
prefer 'te addreses mysel! te the ¶Iouse rather
than te the Coînmittee.
Hon. Sir JAM-ES LOUGHEED: If m'y
honourable friend desires te make -any remarks, 1 ivould prefer, that lie make them
in Gommi.ttee. I understood from, a ruling
given by the honoumblhe the Speaker the

'The Hon. the SPEAKER: 0f course it
must be by consent of the'Ho use. My ruling
the other day was that there inight be a discussion regarding the principle of the Bill
onfthe mtiona to goý into Conittee.
'Hon. Mr. POWER- This Bill does not
toucli the principle of the Civil Service Act
at ail; it is simply a Bill to qmake modifications in certain clauses, of the Act, and
does flot affect the principle, on which, RI
think, the honourable gentleman from Selkirk. purposes addressing the House. As I
look at it, there is nothing in this Bill
which. deals 'with the appointment of civil
servants or their promotion, and, as I understand, these are the subjects which the
honourable gentleman from, Selkirk intends
to, discuss. My view is that they do not
corne within the rule 'which Bis Honour
laid down the other day, tbecause this Bill
does not affect the principle of 4he Act at
all.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: May 1 lie permitted to explain? The honourable gentlemani from Halifax has anticipated, or thinks
he lias anticipated, what I w-as going te
say. My desire is te refer ito a matter that
afftdh the ounty that I once lied lhe
honour of representing, and this is, I presu-me, the only opportunity I shahl have
of referring to it. 1 wish to call -the attention of the Government te the mariner in
which appointments are made in connection
with some of the works in that, constituency,
and as ithis is the only Bill which will give
me anyr rigbt 'to ýaddTîese 'the Hou.se on .the
question, perhýaps the honoura-ble leader of
the Bouse will agree to my discuss'ing it
now.
Soine Bon. SENATORS: Go on.
Bon. Mr. BRADBURY: 'Honourable
gentlemen, the Bill that is before the Bouse,
providing for certain amendiments te the
Civil Service Act, gives us- an opportunity
of expreseing our opinion on different phases
of that Act. I desire to take up just, a few
moments in calhing 'the attention of the
Bouse to the scheme outlined for the reorganization of the Civil Service of Canada.
The -Civil Service question lias been mooted
for years. Every honouraible. gentleman
who knows anything about the organization
of the service, especially here in Ottawa,
bas feit that it was overmanned. Tt la
remarkable that, in face of that indisputable
fact, thousands of appointments have been
made te the service during the last two -or
three years. Notwithstanding the object

fication made by the American experts, secalled, the Govern-m'nt now proposes, I
amn told, 'to 'bring hack practically the
samne men under a different namne.
That would be a joke if it were flot worse.
1 contend, honeurahie genitlemen, Vvat the
day bias arrived when a thorougli reorgenization ei the service should take place; but I
submit that it la within the knowledge of
every honourable gentlemen in this House
that we have men in Canada competent to
do the work. We have the great Canad-ian
Pacifie railway with its wonderful organization anti its efficiency men who corne tram
that eervice--meni who. ha-ve mnade that
service one of the finest officiai services in
the world. If the (Ievern.ment decideti n n
to employ mnen in the Departments to make
the reorganization, why could not they ask
the Canadian Pacifie railway Vo boan them
tWvo or, three of their effi'ciency experts.
Would it be asking too rmxch to ask the
Bank ot Montreal or the Bank of Coininerce, those great financial institutions
which have Vo keep their staffs at
the highest point cf efficiency, te lenti the Government ont or two experts to accomplish this
much desired werk? I believe that in that
way we could secure a Board that could accoanplish the organization in a manner
much moire satisfactory to the country for
one-tenth the esuin that we would have te
pay te these American se-called experts.
Beforé leaving that point 1 would like to
inphasize this fact. While therie is a great
deil of stress 'laid upon the inefficiency et
aur present service, I have neyer heard eny
man get up and try Wo place the responsibility where it belonged. If you want
efficiency, you must have efficiency at the
head; land il you hawi deputy inieiters
in the Service who are incompetent to controil snd reguliate tiheir departnnenlls, how
in the waoeid are yeu going te get an efficient
service? I submit, honourable gentlemen,
'that when this reorganization takes place it
sheulti start among the deputies. We sheulti

Dominion's laborers, whether they be returned
soldiers or any others.
No man wîth a family can live in decency on
a wage of sixty dollars a nionth and give twelve
hours work in daily raturn.

I desîra to emphasiza that article, if it
neetis emphasizing. This work happens to,
be in my own olti county, andi 1 understand
every phase of it. The pre.-war wage for that
wcirk was $75 a inonth, and in the face of
the increased cost of living they ofier these
men $60 a month, when they shoulti receive
at lesat $90 a month. To my mind it is
abaolutely absurd, and I cannot understand
wçhy the Civil Service Commission should
undertake to endeavour to secure men te
parformi this, very important duty at such
wagea.
-Now, honourable gentlemen, bat me tell
you in just a few words 'what this work is.
St. Andrew's dam, and bock is a -work that
coat this coun'try close te $2,000,000. It was
undertaken by the late Government and was
almost completeti by them. before thay went
out of office. lt is one of the finest -places
of engineering on this continent; in fact,
I understand that there is only one other
work bike it on the continent. The machlinery i.n connect>ion with the work ia very
intricate. The gates are lowered and raiseti
by mieansa f electricity. The men employed
thera mnust ha competent, sober, industrious
and trustworthy. One careless move could
easily destroy thousands of dollars worth
of public property. In view Mf that fact you
will realiza -the importance of aacuring efficient help; andi to offer maen $60 a month
ro work twebve hours a day in performing
this important 'work la, as the ediltorial
says, bittle short of a public scandai.
Is that waga
Hon. Mr. DANDUIIAND:

Ho-n. Mr. BRADBURY: Rl prasumne so.
The advertiésaiment of be Civil Service Comnmission appeared on-ly on May 5th, under
the new Classification. Those who have
given any study te the Classification will
realize the absolute absurdity cf it. The
men who came here te classify this great
eervLce were absolute'ly it sea in regard te

success sélect these m~en for the 1<ock6 and
conl;rol this work is the superintendent.of
the workc. 1 represented that ccunty, and
I would flot have taken the responsibility of
putting a m'an on that work without the
consent of the superintendent, because 1
realized the very great importance of -the
position and the fset that a mnan so
appointed inight be the cause of serjous
klamage and loas to the country. Ever since
tit lock and dam were- built, even du-ring
the days when patronage was supposed to
belong to mambers of Parliament, the superinitendbent has dhbisen, his own xnen; and up
to -the lyresent fume e, bhar. made a greait
ucoms cdf -the position Wtich he hais occupied.
I this connection R, want to draw the
attention of the Government te the fact,1 do not know 'whathaer it is worth whila
,drawing the attention of the Commission to,
it-that the Superintendent of that great
worlk, before the Classification was made,
was receiving a salary of $ 1,8W0 a year and
a free house. When the gentlemen antrusted
with the Classification came on the scene,
without ever seeing the work, or without
knowing anything at ail about it, they fixed
his maximum. salary at $1,8W0, or exactly
what lie has been gettîng for some years. 1
submit, honourable gentlemen, that the
maxrimum salary of the superintendent of
that work ought te be not less than $2,500,
and the salary of his assistant ought te -be
flot les than $2,100, or $2,200. These two
men control this very valuable work, and~
thay should be placed in a position to render
good service te the country without serious
sacrifice te themselvas. My main complaint
la this, however, that no group of men
situated in Otdtwa is competent te choose
the men te be amployed on works of this
kind. They cannot know the f acts. That
is ab6olutely impossible. The idea of advertiaing for labouring men is absurd. If
a iman left that -lock te-morrow the superintendant -would have to sand -word te the
resident engîneer at Winnipeg, and would
have te 'wait until ha got instructions te
employ a ïman. What I have said, honourable gentlemen, applias te public works al
through the western provinces, and I suppoSe to warks i-n aRf parte W tihe Dominion.
The town of Sellirk la the head-quarters of
four or five dredges. They requira fromn 100
te 150 men avery spring. Since this Classification came intoeaff ect the superintendent
there has had no authority te engage one
man. They ara ail obtained by means of
advertising andi those employinig them do
not know whoui they are picking out. The

SENATE
consequence is that the cre-t s on many of
those dredges m~ust be orway b)elctfw the mark;
the dredges cannot perfori 'the work, ihat
they used to perforni; they are endangered
by the incornpet-ency of serne of these mien,
and the whole efficiency of the public service is very much impaired.
In view oyfthese factis, I submit th-at something ought te be done, and done at once,
to, take the outside service from under the
authority of.the present Civil Service Commission. 'I have not one word tc, say against
that Commission. 1 helieve the Commisfioners have more work than they can
possibly perform. If they were given only
the Ottawa situation te, deal with and to
reorganize, t.hey would still have their hands

hono'wable gentlemen, tihi6 is a serious

patronage away, as, it was. said that patronage was & great crime; and what did they

away with patronage; they have simply
transferred it from the members, w*ho were
legitimately autÉorized to deal with it, who
Ne're elected as irepreýseniativesq; but under
tihe present sy.,tem 'those men are brushed
a6ide, and are praeàtically told: "Yo'u don't
know anything about your county; these
four or five men sitting in Ottawa will pick
out those men for yeu." I say the thing
is absurd, and abselutely impracticable in
the best interest of the counTtry; and 1 have
ne hesitatien in addîng that under the

hundreds of thousands of dollars more te

1920, from the Minister ef Trade and Commerce, submitting as foilows:*
The contract made with Arthur Young and
Cempany by the Civil Service Cemmission la
about to, expire, and flhc work therein contractedl
for has been very ncariy conipleted. This work
included the production cf a system cf classification ef the Civil Service, and the reorganization of the Department of Publie Printing and
Stationery. The question now arises as te whether or net the work of organizing other departments of the publie service shall be proceeded
with.
The matter bas been discussed by a smal
comnuittee consisting of Sir George Foster, the
Hon. J. A. Calder, the Hon. N. W. Rowell, the
Right Hon. A. L. Sifton. and the Hon. M. Burreli,
which has given careful censideration to the
work already donc. and more especiaily as regards the reerganization made in the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. Arthur'Young and- Company have transferrefi te
Griffenhagen and .Affociatee. Limited, that
branch of their ivork which especialiy has to do
with the reorgnizatien of municipal and governmental civil service and the erganization
of business corporations In respect te staff organizatief. and Plan werk of the A4rthur
Young Company upen the saine plans and with
the same cfficiency as the original company,
and is prcpared te continue the reerganizatien of the Public departmcnts ef the Government aleng the lines pursued in the Depart-

555

ment of Public Printing and Stationery. The
comm ittee referred to has no besitation in commending In the strongest possible way the work
ef Arthur Young and Company In connection
with the reorganization of the Department of
Publie Printing.
As a result a total saving In labor atone of
$,5-00,eûG0 per year has been made, which during
the next year will be increased by an additional
$250.OO, inakIng a total saving of $*70,0O a
year in that establishment atone, with the resuit that a larger output and a more efficient
produot Per man and per machine bas been
atte.inedl under the reduction effected. The company iteif,, basing Its statemient upon is previous expericuce, and the work actually accomplished In the Department of Public Printing, in of the opinion that .mfny millions of
dollars can be savedl In the opcration of the
Government departmcllts lby an application of
up-todate and scientific principles of organization and operation.
The committcc. after careful consileration.
la of the opinion -that a very substantial BaviTIg.
together with mnuch more efficient and orderly
work,. would resuit from fihe reorganizatioti of
Government &epartments on the Uinee pursued
by that company. They are of opinion that the
services of Griffenhagen and Aspociates. Limited, should be retained. and that the reorganizatien of .the departments at Ottawa should be
proceeded with, takting up for commencement the
îwo Departments cf Poet Office and Custoins,
the former of which. hs some 24,00O employeca
and the latter nome *4,OOl odd.
The comnpany i. of the opinion. and thue committee sees no reason for disagreeing therewith,
that comlrpencing thue reorganîzation of these
two departments. savings will begin te be
realized gradjualiY aftcr twe or three menthe
of work, whlch in the end, In respect to the
Pont Office Department, may well reach ma.nY
hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. with
proportionate saving In the Customs Department, and the comnmittee believes that bascd
upon the results aiready obtalned, and the expenditure alrcady made In respect te the classification of the whole Civil Service. and the
reerganization of the one branch which has
now been nearly completed. It is uvise, If not
imperative, that the work shall be carried on
and the benefits extendcd gradually to the
other departments. They therefore recommend
that the services of the above na-med 'Company
be retained, and that they proceed ta, reorganize
the two departments mentioneà above, and that,
whilst engaged, in that work, they also make
their observations and examinations with a
view te preparing a general plan for the reorganization of the departmnents as a whele, whinh
may, at the option of the Governmcnt, be undprtaken and carried out.
lit Is thought aise, that under the circumstances, the company's operations should be
carried eut under the supervision of ànd in
connection with a committee of the Cabinet In
order that quickcr despatch. zay be had than
wouli be attainabie If they worked under the
supervision and direction of the Civil Service
Comnmssion. Besides the werk alrcady pressing
upon the Civil Service Commission In carrying
out the classification of the service is quite
as much as they are able to handle with efficiçncy and despatch.
The staff that would be necessary in order
te carry out the abeve programme would consist
cf seven principal experts and four associates

SENATE
of the company. These wvould work on the
general organizatifln referred to above, wlth
one principal and one associate on the plan of
accounting and financial control, which would
be applicable to ail the departments, with one
principal and one associate; ivhich, would also
be applicable to ail departments; two Principale and one associate for the organisation
and system of the Post Office Department; and
two principals for the organization and systema
of the Department of Customis and Inland
Revenue; these making Up the total above referred to.
Âssociated with and under the supervision
of these experts the departmente would be asked
to furnish some mnembers of Its staff who have
a knowiedge of the constitution and technique
of the departnient, who would work ln conjunction with the experts and ln the course of
the work would flot only give clerical assistance
ta the experts, but would theniselves acquire
a knowledges of tbe xnethods and plans which
wauld enable tbem afterwarcls to undertake a
large part of the organization work of the
future and render It unnecessary to have a large
amiount of expert work for future aperations.
The company wauld be prepared ta organite
and commence their work on June 1, and they
have submitted ta the commlttee a statement
of the expenses which would bie lncurred ln
respect to the work above inentioned. The coinmlttee are strongly of the opinion that the
work outlined above should be undertaken at
once and carried to completion. leavlng the matter of further reorganization for future conelderation and action.
As ta the caste of the above work carrled
on wlth Vie staff indlcated therein, the chargeç
wauld be $10,»GO Per month, lncluding ail fees.
and charges, except actual travelling expenses,
based on the assumption t-hat the work would

and that the cornpany wouId be relrnbursed for

in travelling to and froni Ottawa and fromn point

ln connection with their work on the Post Office
and Customis Departments. The above es&timnate
as compared with the Unit charges, for the
Prlnting Bureau work, is froni ten to fifteen per
cent. lower.
The minister therefore recommends that a
contract be éntered Into with Griffenhagen and
Associates, Limnited, for the above nientloned.

-What 1 want ta point out to the House
is that when we passed the Act establishing
the Civil Service Commission, and gave
themn the powers of classification and reor*ganization of the departments, we asgumed
that the work -was going to be handed over
to thal oSmaivission. This OrdeT in Couneil,
however, would lead -me to think that the

to this quetion of 'eorgaizeaion and are
taking the work entirely out of their hands.
I woul«d judge, frazn this Order in Council,
that the Civil Service Commission is flot in
any way responsible for the employment of
Griffenhagen and .Aseociates, Iimited, and
that the reorganization af the departments
in %o be cairied on s.bsoluteIW independently
of that Commission. I thought it was, right
ta, bring this ta the attention of the House
in order that the present position of the
matter might be understood. R[noticed the
other day that -the honourable Minister af
Labour, when speaking on the second reading of this Bill, drew a distinction hetween
thie question ai reorganization and that of
classification. The Civil Service Commission apparently have carried out a classification, biut the ireorgamiztion is t<> be
haindled by tihis Coniilttee indempenklently
af the Commission.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Did I understand
from the Order in Counicil that was read, by
my honourable friend that those experts
hadeffected a saving af $500.000 a year, and
would possibly save a further $200,000?
RHon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The Order in Council says:
Ag a resuit a total saving ln labor alone of
$500.000 Per year bas been made, wbich. durlng
the next year will be Increased by an additional
$2o,0000, maklng a total saving of $7H000 a
year in that establishment alone.

That refere ta the Department ûi Public

the reorganization made by the Arthur
Young Company under the direction ûf the
Civil Service Commission.

of years ago to investigate the Printing
Bureau and make a report. That commission, composed of two or three Canadians, made a thorough investigation and
showed in its report where great saving
could be effected. It is the carrying, out of
that commission's recommendations that
has effected the saving; and that commission has cost the Government very
little. My understanding is that the work

under the former system will compare very
favourably witb the character o! the mnen

Ancther thtng. Patronage being in tbe
bands o! tbe representatives o! the people,
it made -men wbo were aimbitieus te attain public jposition take an active pait in

that with bis ability in this respect hie

amount of work thrown upon the repreentative; that, particularly in bard times,
.when other work was scarce and considerable Government work was going on, -there
would be pressure put upon the member
.by persons in bis constituency desiring te
get jobs upon that Goyernment work. But.
.atter ail, most of the Government work is
done by contract, and that, it seems to me,
swould relieve the member considlerably.
.Regarding other positions there would7 be
poine strain, but the honour of repreEenting a great city, or part of a great city,
like Montreal, the leading commercial city
in Canada, ougbt to be sufficient te comnpenaeste ariyone for -a conisiderable amount
of labour expended in looking after the
interests of tbe voters. The strain upon

opinion, warrant the cbanging of the system as bas been done in this case. I do

Honourable
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
gentlemen, whilst 1 thoroughly agree with
my honourable friend from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Power) that this is bardly a subject
for dieaussion under

this Bill, es it dees

SENATE
nat eem te me ta bc germane to it,
nevertheless, as the discussion has gone on,

-and as it is quite possible tbat honourable
gentlemen may not again have an opportunity af putting themselves on record in

regard ta the subjects discussed, I think I
owe it ta myseif ta rise and voice my protest against the action of the Government.
My proposition iis that the reorganizatien
and classification was the work of the Government Sr of the Civil Service Commissien.
Above ail, it ehould not have been ha.nded
over ta people who are not citîzens of this
,country and who have no ireepnsibiity ta
t.he peo<ple cd this cou.ntry. Although they
are probably theroughly honest mnen, they
,are f oreigners. To-day the very rugly and
Irightening hint is. beîng -thrown eut-il -de
not know what ia in it-that some of those
bxceigners are Germans. Are we to-day faced
.with the tact that Germans are going to reorganize the whele .civfl admninistration of
this ço>untxry? Are we going ta ruri the
risk cdfputting it in their banTds ta work
aîl sorts of uilschief in this country for an
almost indefinite periad? Frankly, 1 may
say thet I arn appalled at the situation
which is hinted. at.
When it comes te discuaing ,patronage 1
must confess that 1 fear that I cannat do
so wîth very great moderation or even
patience. During the twelve best years of
my lide I had such a taste of it in the cîty
of Ottawa that I fear I arn prejudiced.
I ra>se ta utter rny strong pratest against
wfbat the Gxv-eruient [have done, and particularly against what they now propose
doing. In the past I have not criticized
the asking af advice frorn these foreigners;
but when I sec the organizataon of the
whole Civil Serviceý abcut ta be placed in
their bands, not only for a moment or a
day, but prvbably indefinitely, I arn arnazed.
These gentlernen from the republic ta the
csouth of us have been consulted for t-wo
or 'three yesaxs past, and ini duture if a.nything goes. wrang they will have te be called
in ta see whether their recommendations
ose being ca.rried out, and if neyt 'where the
troVUble is-whether lt caused iby carne deWet in, 'the eyerLtem rocornrmended oT because
the systern is ndt properly administered.
We are therefore ifaced with the possibility
af having our Civil Service indefinitely in
the bauds of for3isgners, and possuibly Germans at thst.
¶There is another thing wic worries me
'terribly, end bha;t le ifibe confession by Uie
Governrnent-especially after the cxarnple
ot e-fficiency end oaurage and deteTrrinatien and rwiflingnees Ite iface great danlnon. Mr. BELCOURT.

gers end grasve Tesiponsibilities during the
wax-that ftihere is nobo.dy in, this c<untry that can put our Civil Service on a
proper basis, and that we must tiierefore
eall in gentlemen living in the repullie
next to us to do the work for us. That is

a onlession of incompetency emnd weakness,
or a shirking o! duty, of which I arn pleased
to say Canada bas given very few examples.
I arn ashamed to think of what the Yankees will Ba.y. They are saying to-day that
we bad te cail them in te put our house in
arder. -It is amazing ta ithink, that this has
been done, not by Liberal Tebels and traitors, as we vere charged with being when
we proposed the Reciprocity Treaty in 1911;
but by the very men 'who, from one end of
the cornia-y Io the ether, rwere, âhout.ing: "~No
truck nor trade with the Yankees." This
Governrnent since coming into power bas
rushed ta Washington art every opportunity
without the slightest provocation; and I
say that tiE, example of incomapetency and
weakness-I alrnost said imbecility-on the
part of the gentlemen who a few years ago
were shouting that cry in calling these men
ta their assistance, is marvellous. I do
not know which is the most ta be wondered
at-the audacity of the Government in doing it, or the inconsistency of the people
supporting- that Governnsent. 1 airn very
much disturbed over the Muure of this country, when measures of this kind can pass
through bath Heuses af Parliarnent and receive so littie attention froin the people of
Ca.a,. But, is&tr «Il, rwhen we Ilad the
,Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk
railway deals palrned off on us, I do not
suppose .we should marvel at anything. Any
Government that could put those deals
through can put throughi this reorg-anization of the Civil Service. It seeins ta ine
.that there is an indifference or a want of
interest in public affairs in Canada which
is a very bad amen for the future of the
country. If the people of Canada will not
rise in their might and tell the Governrnent
that the time bas corne when they rnust
stop doing these foolîsh things, I do not
know what will happen. As I said iii opening, I rose ta voice rny protest; and I cannot make it any too salernn.
With regard ta patronage, I cau hardly
speak with mnodération. Far twelve of the
best years of rny life I was a merniber of
Parliarnent for this city. During that
periad, every day, irorn the tirne I gat up
in the aorning until I gat into bed at
night, I had ne re6t. I have frequentlY
left rny office a few minutes before 3
o'clock ta walk up te Parliarnent, which

JUNE 16, 1920
occupies five ininutes or so, aud on inany
occasions 1 did not arrive at the building
until the House was about to adjourn at
6 o',clock. I could tell you somet.hing,
honourable gentlemen, of what it means to
be a member for this city, and yet I did
no0 good to anybody. I, spent twelve years
of .ry lufe scrubbing the floor and washing
the dishes, polîtically speaking, and did no
good.to anybody. 1 had no0 opportunity of
attending the sittings of the House or the
meetings of Committees of wbich I *was a
member, for I was seldom allowed. to sit in
my seat or attend a Committee. That,
honourable gentlemen, will give you somne
idea of mny views on patronage. I arn one
of those who welcorned the esUtblishment
of the Civil Service Commission, and today I arn sorry to see this Commission
shorn of its powers and the means o! doing
the service it is called upon to render, a
service which 1 have no doubt it could rendeu if it were left alone and not 'worried and
bothered by foreigners who know nothing of
the situation. What position is the Civil
Service Commission going to be in hereafter? Without any responsibility at ahl,
they are going to be called upon to put into
effect a Classification and to carry it on.
They are going to be called upon to execute
plans formulated by someone else; but they
are to have no direction or coritrol.
Hon. .Mr. FOWLER -What the lionourable gentleman bas said is not true of the
Classification. The Civil Service Commission appointed the -men to make the
Classification. This is simrply a reorganization. It is just as bad frorn the standpoint
o! nationality.
Hon. MT. BELCOURT: The two things
are so irtimialely re.lated that you cannot
seipara-te thern. The Classification has
everything to do with the Civil Service.
It must be -nade upon a &cientific basis;
there mnust. be some scientific principle at
the bottom of it. The Commission wiîli1 be
bound by the principles laid down in the
Classification, and I leave i- to you, honourable gentlemen, to say with wfhat interest,
with what willingness, they will put into
effect a Classification with which. they have
had; nothing 'to do. The whole thing is
absollutely %vrong, and I arn amazed that
the Government ehou.ld have done this
thing. It eeems to me airnost inoredible. I
sornetiimes, have to ask myseif if it is, xe.aly
go tLhat any Government could put t.brough
a mesure of that kiind and stick to it. I
think the Gîovernrnent owes àt to the coumntry
to drop these foreigners. Their work is

not going to sartisfy anybody, and it is
going to destroy the efficiency -of the Civil
Service. If the Goverrnent will listen to
what is being said, not onlly in Parliarnent
but on the streetis throughout the chties of
this, country, it will drop these gentlemen
frorný the other aide as quickly as possIble.
Hon. GIDEON ]ROBERTSON: Hoinourahie
gentlemen, the remearks and inquiries, made
by -the hoinourable leader of ithe Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Bostock) merit a reply, and the
observations of the honourable gentleman

The honounable gentle"Reorganization."
mon. f-rom Otteswa a, moment ago pmexlV
refeérred, to the necessi-ty of a classification
of civil servants being beseld upon sorne
principle. FSr u-ay yess perhaps ever
since ODnfederation that principle bas been
length o! service: the longer a man was
in the Service the more annual increases
he received in salary. and in consequence
his sail.asy increased with aength of service,
regardless of his qualifications aind abi.lities.
The result w"o that aged and infirm. and
crippled, and iompetent icivil servants were
receiving the highest salaries, wheres the
yo'ung, virile, competent men, the men, who
were doing the work, wvere reoei-ving perh-aps
hailf what others received for doing nothing.
That evide-ntly wa~s not a proper or just princLiffe upon which ît base the classification
of ci-vil servants; therefore an investigation
was ordered, and an experienced firirn of
accounta-nts-, Arthur Young & Comp.any,
were eniployed. Notwithstan-ding the fact
that their headquarters happen to be established, in the city of Chicago, both Arthur
Young and his partner were bon ùlu Glagow. Arthur Young & Company were engagied. for the rea-son that they had been
ca.rrying on this sort of efficienicy work in

Service Commission, wvho in turn reported
the findings to the Government, and very
largely the reorganization proposed bas beenl
carried out in some details, peiThaps not

Hon. Mxr. BFLCOURT: Are those gentlemen to be credited entirely with that?
Hon. Mr. ROBE.RTbSON: It was ail the
resuit of the fact that there was a Minister
on the job, and he caused the rotten situation that existed to be cleaned Up.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Why did not that
apply to the rest of the Civil Service?
RHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It does, and
I arn coming to that.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would the honourable gentleman permit a question? Was
not the Immigration Department organized or reorganized by a iCanadian efficiency -man?
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTS ON: That situation
was not entirely eimilar. I think when

Hon. Mr. FOWLFER. Would it not have
been ia. fai pollUcy tb Rb&ve inquired how
iar succcessful. this Canadian was in doing
this reorganization work, so that it inight
not have been necessary to engage those
foreigners?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assume that
that must have been done, because the
Miistý&r o1f TImmigmrUmon, whc. coeiductied

,was a member o! the sub-committee o! the
Cainel which hiad ito do with tlhe eîmployment of the Arthur Young Company
on the Printing Bureau. I happened to be
associated with him; therefore I assume
that from his experience in bis own departnent hie deemed it dlesirable that this
other plan should be adopted.
It bas been suggested by one or Vwo,
bonourable members who have spoken this
afternoon upon this subjeet that in engaging the services of a firma such as
Griffenhagen or Arthur Young and Company, the Government and tbe Civil Service
Commission are surrenderingu to those
people absolute control, and are under
.their authority, and compelled to carry
into execution their decisions and recoinmiendations. 1 desire to dispel any such
vies'-, if beld serious]y by honourabl-e
gentlemen, because those people are only

563

cng-aged to makze investigations an>d propose such plans as their experience and
ability, because of their training, may
enable tbem intelligently to make. The
Committee of the Cabinet as named, in
co-operation witb the Civil Service Commission, may act upon such recomnmnidaïtiooe gmd ougget t!hem tu this
House. In regard to the engaging of these
experts, I will not use the ternirny honourable friend used, because I do not ýthink
it is even decent or courteous to the gentlemen wbo have been engaged on this work,
a considerable number of whom are Canadias, itx suggeMe IhMi ghe <overnimesit is in
any way exiling itself from actual control.
Whatever action is finally taken as to reorganization of any of the Departments
will be the action of the ýGovernment, and
flot of any committee o! experts that have
been engaged.
.Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would my honourable friend allow me to ask a question?
lHe mentioned that the Committee o! the
Cabinet was working with the co-operation
o! the Civil Service Commission. What
I tried to make out was that, so0far as

The sitting having been resumed:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON (resumning) : Honourable aentl'emen, in conclu ding the remarks I was making in reply to the honourable gentleman from Kaýmloops (Hon. Mr.
Bostock>, I desire to observe that the
subject of the reorganization of the Civil
Service is flot referred to in any way in this
Bill, or concerned in it in any way. The
amendments contained in the Bill now before the House are amendments to the Civil
Service Act, which are necessary to keep
faith with the Civil Servants, aid ta carry
out the pledges given to t.bem more than a
year ago; and I sincerely trust that they
will be promptly concurred in.
Honourable gentlemen must have noticed
in the press reports of the unrest that
exists because of the delay already incurred
in the pa.ssing of thjs legislation. It was
anticipated that the new Classification
would have been passed at the session of
Parliainent last year, and that it would
have been effective as from the lst of April,
1919. The bonuses which Civil Servants received last year, and which they have been
receiving up to the present time, wvere
The
based upon the new Classification.
Civil Servants have not yet received the iiicrease in salary that the Classification
grants to them as from that date. Many
of them have represented, and probably
properly sa, that they have gone inta debt
in anticipation of receiving this compensation Nvhich was assured ta them, and which
they needed i order to live. To refrain
now from implementing the promises
made and the pledges given wonuld in my
opinion result in very seriaus consequences
eio far as the Service is concernied.
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. WILLIAM ROCHE: Honourable
gentlemen, I listened with g-reat interest ta
the explanation made by the M1inister wvho
bas just vacated bis seat (Hon. Mr. Robertson). With regard ta the system of noinination to Civil Service employrnent that lias
been spoken about by my honourable friend
from Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) and others,
to contrast that with the system .in
vogue may be af interest. Those who were
nominated formerly, when the members for
the counities had the patronage, were ta some
extent known, and their qualifications were
known, ta the -nominators before they recommended the appointments ta the Government. I understand that now the candidates who are proposed for office have ta
pass certain examinations; and I believe
that those who have the duty of selecting
the successful candidates have based their
selection rnainly upon the university qualifications of the candidates; so that if a man
lias a college deg-ree, or bias passed through
a college, that fact is a desideratum which
in any chance of selection places him far
above and beyond persans wha may. nat
.have enjoyed similar advantages. Now, a
man having a college education may be able
ta criticise the enumeratian ai a strophe of
Sophocles, or lie may be able ta operate a
differential or integral calculus, or calculate the parallax of one of the new stars,
but he may be totally unqualified for the
practical work of a Department, which may
consist of the adding -up of a column of
figures, estimating inaterials or the amount
ai wark that can be done in a day, or very
many other matters; and his efficient
practical knowledge is discounted, and the
orname.ntal or exterior knowledge -that is
not useful in a departmnent is the qualîficatomn which entitles a candidate for office to
receive it. That there is thorough unrest
in the departmnents and thorough dissatisfaction witb conditions and the rates of
pay that individuals receive is quite patent
to every'bady in this House, for it is well
known. The men who do the work ai the
Departmnents are lef t in the background,
and frequently have no substantial addition
ta their salaries. The ornamental men, or
men who have the favour and patronage of
some person, re-ceive preferment and advancement, and, it mnay be, are transferred
to some more lucrative employment, while
the drudge goes on year after year and the
other man gets the credit for his work. Now,
when these experts -make their report, what
do they repart? Do they know -the man vwho

of others. I wili just read, for the informa.tion ai the Senate, the definition of the
duties of the Sergeant-at-Arms in the House
of Gommons:
To act as chief executive officer of the flouse

That is ahl right.
To preserve order in the galleries, corridors,
and other parts of the Parliamentary buildings.

this s.aored chamber of the Huse of Coinmens, under the superintendence of the
present Speaker, is too sacred a place altogether for even former members to corne
to, let alone members of the *Senate. In

plead for this sort of thing: I arn not
anxious, and do flot care if 1 neyer see
the inside of the chamber of the House
of Commens. 1 arn content with my position
as à member of the Senate of Canada;, I
find it te be the greatest position in Canada. I trust that honourable gentlemen will
pass. without opposition this very proper
arnendment which 1 have offered.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE.ED: Honourable gentlemen, may I be permitted to
point out to my honourable friend frorn
Kings and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) a
diffioulty whieh possibly hie may not have
foreseen in movtng the amendment which is
now before us? The passage of this amendment would place the Senate in a most
anomalous position. We would be, like
between

have restate of suspended animation. WVe
pealed the rights iwhich we possessed under
the British North Amierica Art and under
the Revised Statutes of Canada whereby we
had control over our own staff. etc. Having
pasased the CÇivil Service Act of 1918 and the
Civil Service Amendment Act of 1919, we
have handed over te the ICivil Service Comnmission the rights which %we enjoyed by
ct-atute, 'which were given to both buses by
the British North Amnerica Act. and afterwards elaborated upon in the Revised -Statutes of Canada, chapter 10, 1906. Now, it
is quite rnanifest that if we pass this provision it does not revive the righits which we
have already sacrificed or lost by the passage of the former legislation, and we are
therefore facing that peculiar difficulty.
I mnight point out to my homnrable friend
tha.t the centrol previously exercised b-y
the Senate was under section 18 of t.he
British North Aniierica Act, wvhich reads
as followvs:
The privileges, immiunities. and powers te be

Britain and Ireland and hy the 3lembers thereef.

That section was repealed in 1875 by the
following section:
Section 18 of the British North America Act,
1867, is hereby repealed, without prejudice to
anything done under that section, and the following section shall be substituted for the section $o repealed.

The substituted section rea.ds as follows:

passing of such Act, held, enjoyed and exerclsed hy the Commons House of Parliament of
the United Kingdomn of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the membera thereof.

'Then, by section 4 of the Revîsed Statutes
o! Canada, chapter 10, we legislated as follows under the heading of "Privileges and
Immunities of Memibers and Officers":
4. The Senate and the House of Gommons
respectlvely. and the members thereof respectlvely, shall hold, enjoy and exercise,(a) such and the like privîheges, Immunities
and powers as, at the time of the passlng of
the Britleh North America Act, 1867, were held,

Parliament of the United Klngdom, and by the
members thereof, so far as the same are consistent with and flot repugnant to the said Act;
and,
(b) such privileges. Immunities and powers
as are from time to time defined by Act of the
Parliament of Canada, flot exceeding thoee at
the time of the passing of such Act held, enjoyed and exercised by the Gommons House of

members thereof respectlvely.

My honourable friend will observe that
if we pas.sed this amendment we would
have no authority.

that the acceptance of the amendment

Consequently, 'if the principle of this
amendment is to be enibodied in the Act, it
will have to go very much further: it wilI

of em.ployees, officers, etc. I fact, we wvill
have to restore the legisiation under which
we were previous Ito the passage of the Civil
Service Act of 1918. 1 sirnply point that
out so that we may not hastily adopt an
amendaient to the Act which would place
us in a very embarrassing position, and
thus render us helpless in the matter of our
staff. There has -been put in my hands
the Civil Service Act of 1918, section 34
of which, reads as follows:
So much of this Act as relates to appointment, transter and promotion, and to salaries,
increasee and classification and the provisions
ot sections thirty and thirty-two, shali apply
to the permanent officers, clerks, and employees of both Houses of Pariament and of the
Library of Parliament. and wherever any action
la authorlzed or directed to be taken by the
Governor In Council or by order in council, such
action, wlth respect to the officers, clerks and
employees of the Senate or the House of Comnmons, shall be taken by the Senate or the
House of Gommons, as the case rnay be, by
resolutiofi; and with respect to the officers,
clerks and employees of the Llbrary of Parliament. and to such other officers, clerks and employes as are under the joint control of both
Houses of Parliament, shall be taken by both

action is required during the recess of Parliament, by the Governor In Council. subjetŽt to

is made to the various branches that are
under the Commission.

Il *xy honourable friend can suggest an
improvement, he .tnay do so. I commend
this to the. consideration of my honourable

J would like
(Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
very much to find the principle upon which
the amendment of *my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Fowler> is based.. We discussed session after session the desirability
of establishing the Civil Service Commission and entrufsting to it the appointment,
classification and promotion of the Federal
Governmnent employees. The House of Coinmoins paseed the Civil Service Bill and we
accepted it. We transiferred to that Commission the rights which the Senate and
the House of Comimons pos;sessed regarding
appointments to their respect.ive staffs,
thereby affir.ming our preference for that
system. We feit that it was in the interest
ôf the country that ail of the departmnents
should -be administered, and we were willing that the House of *Conmori, and the
Senate should likewise be administered,
under that general Civil Service law. Are
we now deciding that we were wrong in
establishing that general principle for the
varjous departments of the Federal Government? E! we are, let us say so. But will
it not seem strange that, -after adopting the
principle of that new Lystem, and before it
has been Put into full operation, we should
declare that what is good for ail the other
departments of the -Governinent la not good
for the Senate, 'and that we will .. ithdraw?
What principle are we laying down if we
decide thalt the Civil Service Act should
apply to ail the departinents, but flot to the
Senate or the House o! Gommons? I would
like to know why it ought not to apply to
us when we stili dling -to the principle 'that
it is good for the other departinents of the
G;overnment.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I -arn not in accord with the amendment of my honourable
friend <Hon. Mr. Fo'wler) or the anmendmient proposed by the honourable Senator
froin Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
-Hon. Mr. .BELCOURT: Il did not propose it; I merely made a suggestion. I
would flot like to propose it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Or with the suggestion mnade by the honourable memiber

571

froin Ottawa. I agree with iny lionourable
friend who bas just taken bis seat (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand). If it is flot right that
the Civil Service Commission should look
after appointments in connection with the
Senate, then we ought either Vo amend the
Civil !Service Act or get rid of it. 1 do nut
think it would be gcfod policy to withdraw
the Senate from the operation o! that Act.
That would be practically saying that it is
good enough for others, but not good enough
for us. The Act ehould be given a further
trial before we take tany sucb drastie step.
But, as the question has been brought
up heîe-, I desire to say that I f eel very hostile to the action o! the Gommons in refusing to allow Senators, members of the Parliament -o! Canada, Vo enter the lobby of the
Hlouse of Gommons. I have heard it saidperhaps it was my -honourable friend the
leader (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) who
said it: "Wait until we get into our own
Permanent quarters, then we will take
similar action." I do not think that would
be good policy. I think it wvou1d be ratŽier
beneath the dignity of the Senate Vo retaliate in so, smail a matter as that. I
think the Gommons have acted in a very
small way. If the members of the House
of Commons generally had understood what
it meanit, I do not believe for a mnoment they
would have agreed to it. I understand it
was practica.lly the work of one or two officiais of the House of Commons who agitated
for that and got it passed. My principal
object is to ask the honourable leader of the
Government, or the honourable the Speaker
o! the Senate, if he would not agaîn take up
the matter. The Gommons have now had
a trial of the arrangement, and I arn sure
it is not vewy satisfactory to. them. I agree
with my honourable friend from Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) that they would
not be very much concerned about the
matter. Surely members o! the Senate of
Canada should have a rigaht Vo enter tihe
lobby o! the House of Jomnions if they
,o desîred. To my mind it would be much
better Vo take the matter up and bave it
properly arranged, if possible, than Vo think
o! any ret-aliation'whien we enter our own
permanent quarters.
Hon. Mr. P'OWER: There is just one
point with respect to the amendment suagested by the honourable gentleman froml
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), which I tbiink

Civil !Service Act of 1918. The honourable
gentleman prohahly 1o->t siglit of the fact
that the complete control which this House
h.ad of lits officers iv'as given laway in 1908,
and if the arnendment that hie lias suggested
were passed we Ehould nlot again control
those officers; we should be back under

the rule that prevailed under the Act of
1908.

My feeling about this matter ds that

it is better not to be in a hurry; it is better
to stop and think a bit. I understand. that
the mnembers of the House of Commons are
flot satisfied with the existing conditions
as regards their own staff. If we passed
thie amendmnent te the Bill whieh amendment, by the way, iis flot germane te the
Bil-if we passed this amendment, saying
that appointrnenls to the Senate staff and
the control of the Senate employees sheuld
flot be in the hands o! the Civil Service

Commission, we could niot expect
amendment to be concurred in by the CoinThey would naturally say, -We

have -a righlt to centrol our staff toco," and
the prohabiliÂes are thal nothing would
be done. I sympathize very much with
the sentiments of honourable members who
have felt that we would be better if we
were back under the condition of things
existing before 1908, but I think the busineslike and practical way is te, corne te, an
understanding with the bouse of Oommons
and have a ineasure introduced after due
consideration and fair notice; not le have
an amendînent sprung on either bouse as
this is being sprung. Then nexl session,
after the two bouses could agree, we could
gel back to our old position ýof-self-determination, 1 think, is the proper word.

I arn afraid that the anmendrnent proposed
by my honourable friend fromn Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) will hardly iieet
the situation. But we have been in difficulties ever since the passage of the Civil
Service Act in 1908, when the Sonate and
the House of Commons were brought under
it. 1 thinik that was an~ afterthought. When
the Bill was first intoeodueed in Parliament
the S'ýenate -and the House of Comnrons
were not included in it, but they were
brough-t i dater. At that time, as honourable ge-ntlemen will remember. the
powers of the Commission wvere not ne.arly
so great as they have been since, and
we did not lose nearly as much of
our authority regarding appointments to
the staff, or control of the staff, as
we have since delegated. to the Commission. The Civil Service Commisision may
be eaatisfýactoiry so far es the Government

malter for the Governmient theinselves to
determine. Th+3y may t.hi-nk that administration by a Civil Service Commission is
the hast wethod of dealing- with appoýintmentes te the various departments, amd with
departmental organization. But 1 do think,
that the Senate and the bouse of
Commons should keep in their own
hands the control of their own -staffs. The
Houses of Pa.rli&nent ought to be capable
of managing their own e7nployees. A distinction ,.houild lie dra,,wn between the employees in the Governinent departments
and employees of Parliament. Thiat distinction should be made as clear as possible,
and I would like 10 see somne amendmient
made that would mreet the szituation. But 1
an 'afraid that my honourable friend's
aniendment does flot do -o.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLEII: Honourable gentlemen, with re' ard to the amendmient, 1 suippos--e 1 have be-en in a certain
sense te blame for not having familiarized
mvs-elif with tihe former legfisiation before
aýccepting the amendmenl and nmoving- it.
The amendiient was not of my iiaking. il
wa.s made, as I understand fromn the person
%vhohanded it to me, by the Parliamentary
Counsel. As I say, 1 did not take lime 10
famniliarize mnyseif with the leguislin, but
supposed that the amendmient, comning froin
the Parliam11entairy Counsel, would hae al
right. bowevear, I arn satisfied now that it
ks not ail right. But I do think that the
change proposed by the honourable mem-

JUNE 16, 1920
ber for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt> would
answer the purpose. At any rate, I arn
stili convinced that it. is a bad thing, frorn
every standpoint, for us flot to have the
control of the permanent officers of this
House. 1 think it would be a very good
pl.%in te -have a conference with the House of
Commnms. 1 have no objection te that. I
have ne objection te amy neans beicng taken
t'hat will bring about the deired iresuit. 1
arn net, the rosi Lather of thwt amendment;
therefore 1 do not intend te defed it when
I do not thiink it is defenaihie. I inight
make an effort to defend it, if 1 had TealLY
drawn it-even though it were nlot defensible; but under the circumistances I do not
intend te make t.he effort.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: For the accuracy
of our records, I do not want to be put down
as proposing the amendmnent, which 1 read.
Rfread it merely for the purpose of drawing
my honourable friend's attention te it as perhaps a better means of reaching the end he
had in view than the amendrnent hie propo-sed. iI have nlot made up my mind exactly
what I would do if that amendment were
really put. But I certainly do not desire
te have it placeci on record. at this stage,
as honourable gentlemen have repeated
several times, that I arn proposing the
amnendment. While on my feet may 1 add
test if hope the staff of the Senate wiIl be
saved from the reclassification or reorganization to be made by this Grieffenhagen
firm.
Hon. '-%r. FOW.LER: The lionourable
gentleman need not be afraid of having te
assume the responsibility. I arn prepared
te assume tee responsibility and run the
risk of whatever criticism rnay resuit, hocauae t.here is absolutoly no question in rny
mind as te my attitude in this matter, and
I ar nflt afraid te state my attitude xvben
I. have once takon it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourablo gentlemen, I arn in faveur of the amendîment proposed by the honourablo member for Kings
and Albort (Hon. Mr. Fowler), provided
that hie adds to it. somothing which wvîll
revive the powers of the Sonate that vere
destroyed by pa-st legisiation. I think thg
honourable leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Bostock) lias given the answer to the
honourable Senater frorn De Lorîmier (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) with regard te the reason
why wo should have one rule for tee 'Sonate
and another for the departments. The distinction as between the two, as, hias been,
pointod out by the honovirable leader of the

b,

Opposition, is that this is a legfisiative body ý
it is nlot a department, of the Goerninerit at
ahl. A Governinent department hias new
ministors from time to time. 0f course, we
have new 'Speakers frorn time to tiinie, but
this is a more -permanent body. To my mind
there is a very clear distinction between a
logisiative body and what is, aftor ahl, a
departmont of the executive.
My main reason for rising, howovor, is.
te say this, in answer to the honourable
gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power),
who suggests delay, and a conforenco with
the House olf Commons, and perhaps a
separate Bill. In my humble opinion, if
you want this arnenâment, you had better
insert it in this Bill; othorwise you inay
neyer get it at all. What is going on now
in the Heuso of Commons? After Bil have
been passed in thia House and are sent down
there, they are smothered. We passed a Bill
introduced. by tee honourablo gentleman
£rom Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) with
regard to criminal appeals. Jt went, down
thore: not.hing is heard of it. There is another Bill, with which 1 had, I think, a
good deal to do, with regard te the judges.
It went down te tee other House: it is neyer
heard, of again. There wero two divorce
Bis passed by a very large .rnajority in
this Hou-se at the present session, and nothing hias been heard of them. I do nlot
know how the House of Gommons would
hlike it if we woro to treat their Bills as they
are treating, ours. One of these days we
may have te do something of the kind-refer
a Bill that cornes up frorn the bouse of Coinmons te a special conunittee and let it, lie
thore until thoy corne up and ask us what
has bocorno of it. Then wo can ask thern
wbat has becomne of soine of 'the Bills that,
we senft down. Rfar nft saying thoy ought,
te pass a Bill because we passed it. What
I do say is this. The 'Minister of Justice hias
a Bill which is coming- up hore, regarding
crirninal law. If hoe ex-pects that to be
treated with courtesy by this House, thon.
tee Bill relating to criminal appeals ought
to ho taken up by hirn and submitted by
hirn to the Houso of Commons, and either
voted or voted down. And the saine *with
regard te the divorce Bills. 1 do not say
that the House of Cominons ought. to swal-.
low them because we approved of 'them, 'but
I do say that it is about time for teem toe
take them up and to do eithor of two things
with thom-either reject them or pass thein
into law. WVe have in the prosent Bill. a
provision, szection 5, that you will flnd is
imperativo. I think the honourablo the
Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson)

SENATE
pointed out tha:t it la of great importance
that this Bill should pass. Now, if you want
this amendment, put it into this Bill, and
I will venture to say that you will have it
passed; whereas if you put it into a separate
Bill and send it down to the House o! Commons, that will be the last you will hear
of it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Draw anl
amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: The présent amend-ment,
moved by the honourable member for Kîngs
and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) is ail right;
ail he bas to add to that is a provision to
the effect that the powers and privileges of
the Senate with regard to their èstaff should
be as existing in and prior to the year 1908.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I arn willing to accept anything that -will give us control.
Whatever may be the concensus of opinion
as to the p'hraseolop-y neccssary to bring
about the desired result will be acceptable
to me.

Hon. Mr. WATSON: 1 do not know. Appareiitly that is a rule of the Civil Service
Commission, or a rule made by the Chicago
people. From the expressions of opinion
to-day I arn inclined to think that most of
th 'e meinhers of this House are strongly in
favour of the control of our staff remaining
with ourselves, and 1 think th.at if repre-sentations were made to some authority in
the House o! Gommons we would encounter no0 difficulty in getting this amendment
passed. 1 think the House of Commons is
in somnewhat the rame position as we
ooeupy, and 'would like to have the control
of its staff. I believe an understanding
could be arrived at, and if an amendment
were inse.rted in this Bill the chances are
that the House of Gommons would accept
it.
Hoi. Sir JAMES LOUGEEED: Honourable gentlemen, inasmuch as I have charge
of this Bill it is but natural that I sbould
de!end it. It has occurred to me since the
discussion bas taken place, and sirice my
honourable friend from Kings and Albert
(Hlon. Mr. Fowler) moved bis amendment,
that there is really no0 evidence before us
to justi!y us in making the very radical
depaxture which is 110W proposed. We not
only passed the Act o! 1918, but we passed
the Amendment Act o! 1919, and we approved of the principle of the Civil Service
legislation when we were charged with its
consideration. The only evidence before us
that would seem to make a change advisable is the fact that there was an unfortunate appointment made in the case o! a
translator. The same thing mi.ght very
easily have occurred if tbe appointment had
been In the hiands of one of our comniittees. It happens that an Order in Countcil was passed by the Government o! the
day giving recognition by way o! preferince
to returned soldiers in ahl appointments,
and this particuar transîctor, being a returned soldier, was selected by the Civil
R-ervice Commission on account o! the regulations passed by the Governor in Council.
The Civil Service Commission were compelled, so to speak, under the peculiar conditions which invested the case. to appoint
a returned soldier. Outside o! that particular case I bave heard o! no dissatis!action.

I entirely agree
*Hon. Mr. WATSON:
w'ith with the opinion expressed by the
honourable gentleman from Micdileton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) that it is 110W or neyer.
I think that what we desire can be accomplished now more easîly than next year.
The longer wve wait the greater will be the
1
difficulty. Having býeen a member of the
Internal Economy Committee for about
twenty years, and having had corne littie
experience in the Senate, I b-elieve I arn
safe in saying that the administration of
the staff o! the Senate by the Internai
Economy Committee w-as fairly satisfactory
Vo the members of tbe House and Vo the
members of the staff as well. I -think that
if a-e had retained our control o! te staff
the service would to-day be rnuch moreý
satisfactory than it is. If possible, I think
that w-e should take the staff out o! the
control o! the Civil Service Commission.
We have plenty o! time to look after such
matters. Only this session Hic Honour the
Speaker made a request for a translator. A
tranclator was secured ithrough the Civil
Service Commission, and, as honourable
gentlemen w-ill rem-ember, that translator
turned out to be o! no0 use. The Civil Service Commission were wvrong in that case;
the inan could noV do hic work. I dare say
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would that account
that if the Internal Economy Committee

JUNE 16,1920
the position of transiator has been satisfactorily filled by a temporary appointee,
and that consequently there is no pressing
necessity for immediate action.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We should have
direct action.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I agree
with the position taken by my honourable
f riend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who very properly points out that
the Senate has approved af the principle af
this Bill. We have passed the 'Act removing the patronage not only ai members ai
Parliament but ai the minîsteriai heads af
departments, and likewise we have taken
out ai the hands ai Deputy Ministers the
power which they exercised over their
staffs. We have cammîtted ourselves unalterably 'to. the principle ai this Bill.
Non. Mr. FOWLER: Not unalterably.
Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOIJGHEED: Until the
present time we have. Naw we deliberately
say ta the ministerial heads of departments,
ta members ai Parliament, and ta ail others
whose patronage has been removed: -"Notwithstanding the iact that we imposed upan
you the duty and obligation of sacrificing
the patronage which you formerly exercised, we, one ai the branches ai Parliament, are prepared ta revert ta the exercise ai patronage, but at the same time we
expect you ta submit ta the provisions ai
the Act." This, it seems ta me, would place
the Senate in a mast anomalous position.
*We shauld be prepared ta say that what is
good enough for athers is good enough for
us, or that, if the prînciples ai the Civil
Service Act are not good enough for the
Senate, we should repeal the whole Act. I
think if the honourable gentleman from
King-s and Albert had moved a resolution
along those lines it would have been perfectly consistent. 1 suppose that most
legisiation is more or less inconsistent, and
that occasionally members ai Parliament
find themselves occupying .an inconsistent
position; at the same time, I amn bound ta
say, being in charge ai this Bill, that consistency is a jewel and a principle ta be
abserved in this case.
Gould the honHon. M. DA-NDURAND:
ourable gentleman, for the enjoyment ai
the new Senators in this Chamber, relate
the littie comedy ai the Internal Econoiny
Gomm-ittee as ta the appoint-ment o! a barber ai the Senate?
ban. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
entirely recali that incident. Such things
will occur. Think ai the position in which.

57,'

w-e would be placed, having regard to the
encomiums which have been passed upon
this Bill in this very House. Honourable
gentlemen in this House have been clamouring for years for the rernoval of patronage.
They have been condemning in the strongest language the exercise of patronage by
Min.isters, 'members oi Parliament, and
others. They have heen clamouring for the
removal of ail those evils and have extolled the principles af the Civil Service
Act ta the seventh heaven. ,Notwithstanding the position which we have taken on
the subi ect, are we to-day prepared to revert -ta the aid principle of -"ta the victor
belongs the spoil '"-the prînciple of the
dominant party exercising the patronage?
It seems to me, hanourable gentlemen,
that we are confronted with another diificulty. This will involve legisiation. We
cannot bi a motion revive and place upon
the statute book the legisiation under which
we previously act-ed. This motion is equivalent ta a new Bill. It will have to be sent
to the House of Commons ta receive their
concurrence before it be-comes law. 1 ask
honourable gentlemen ta consider that phase
of the quéstion.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOÇK: They might join
US.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think they would
join us.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
House of Gommons cannot amend their own
Bill. Having, sent that Bill ta the Senate,
it is too late for them to amend it and join
with the Senate in the action which. is proposed.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: We hs.d better include the House of Gomxnone, in the a.mendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUJGHEED: I coinmend ta my honoura'hlefriend the further
prabl«m af getting the -co-operation of the
bouse of Gominons.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Does my honaurcannot arnend the
able friend 'dlaim that mwe
Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My argument is that the amendment would have ta
pass the House of Gominons, and that the
bouse af Gommons could not take themselves from under the provisions af the Bill,
and do what we propose doing, because
they have already parted with the Bill and
sent it up ta this House.
There is a further problem ta be considered, and that is the question ai the House

sary supplies for the maintenance of our
staff, and se on. Unless the House of
Commons wili adopt legislation similar to
what we are proposing we will be facing a
very peculiar situation, particularly in having our supplies voted. I simply point out
these difficulties.
I feel particularly sympathetie ta what
my honouraible friend .from Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Ross) has pointed out. I think
probably a good purpose is served by directing attention ta this matter. I think it is
very unfortunate that Bills- sent by the
Senate ta the House of Commons should
neet a premature death in that HouseHon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not altogether new.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -without
having even a chance of lite. At the same
time, wrongs of that kind do not justify us
in adopting such a radical step as the one
now proposed, unless that step is defensible
on other grounds.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The leader of the
Government has made a very fair argument; .but be has not succeeded in convincing me, and I am sure he has not convinced himself, that his attitude on this
occasion is the right one. I am satisfiednot from the remarks that have fallen from
his lips, because I know he is generally a
very sensible man-that his heart is in sympathy with the proposed amendment-and
no sensible man, I think, could pos'sibly
entertain any other view. I have 'consulted
with some af the gentlemen who are well
versed inthe law, and as a resuit, with tle
leave of the Committee, I will add the foilowing words ta the proposed amendment:
And the powers and privileges of the Senate
control,
relating to the appointment, promotion,
and
and classification of its permanent officers prior
and,
eiloyees shall be such as existed in
to the year 198.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I should like ta ask
the honourable gentleman how an official of
this Chamber appointed by the ,Governor in
Geuncil would be affected. There has been
a good deal said this afternoon in reference
ta the Sergeant at Arms. I may ibe mistaken, but I had the idea that the Sergeant-at-Arms-and there may be othersvas appointed by the Governor in Council,
nat by the Civil Service Commission. I am
not very well versed in matters of that
kînd.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They would net be
affected by this amendment. This is only
a restoring clause. Officials who were appointed by the -Governor lu Council wouid
not be affected.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

All ofHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ficials except Deputy Ministers are now
appointed under the Oivil Service Commission.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: We are getting back
to the good old days when we had control
of ithis House ourselves. The fact is that
the whole Civil Service is becoming demoralized under the existing law. In the
old days a Deputy Minister had control of
his staff. I suppose under the existing
law, if I ask a boy to bring me a book
and he declines to do so, thalt instead of
appealing to the Speaker I would have to
appeal ta the Civil Service Commission.
We are only getting back to what has got
to come in tthe .House of Commons and in
the Departments as well as here-the principle that the man at t'he head o.f a Department must have corftrol.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: As the
leader of the Govçrnment has pointed out,
we may be embarrassing the House of Commons in sending this amendment to them,
inasmuch as they have no power fto amend
their own Act. But they certainly have
by
power ta amend our amendment, and the
including the House of Commons in
amendment we can accomplish what we
desire.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend from Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) has
used the word "permanenit" in his amendment. That may be misleading.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I agree with my honourable friend from Ottawa. I think the
word "permanent" might come out.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That would
not matter. I understand 'that 'at the

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I was going ta sugge.t thalt possibly it would be better ta let
this matter stand until to-morrow so that
we could have a proper amendment drawn
up. I must say thalt I do not exactly understand the position at the present time.
I think we have first of all ta repeal the
legislation that has gone before, and then
we have ta revive the privileges of the

Act, as read by the leader of the Government. 1 would like te point out ta my

Colonel Amery dlaims, the British Government wish to show their good ýwill towards
Canada, why should not the Canadian
Government apply to them for a certain
tonnage to bring the Nova Scotia coal to
Montreal and other Canadian ports? The
object of my inquîry is not to find any fault

Hon. P. C. MURPHY: Honourable g-entlemen. I think that this is a timely inquiry
on the part of my honourable friend fromn
Inkerman. He speaks about the conditions
in Montreal, and there is nobody in a better
position than he to explain the situation
just as it exists. Down in my own province,
which is almost within a stone's throw of
the mines at Sydney, importera wired the
other day for five cars of coal, and they
wvere informed: "Absolutely impossible to
supplY you.'- This coal is required for the
ruinning- of our lobster canneries, lobster
Canning beine- one of the chief industries
oif the 'Maritime Provinces. I overheard miv
honourable friend from Inkerman the other
evenin.c discussing the matter, and I wvas
amiazed to learu that the situation m'as such
that it might at any time become acute. and
that the industrial establishments of Montreal mighlt even have to shut down for wvant
of bituminous coal. This is a situation -with
which the Government should grapple.
The conditions are serious in the Maritime
Provinces when we cannot get even five car,ý
of coal, but what about the 4,000,000 or
50,000O tons required to run the industrial

only to speak in commendation of the
action of my honourable friend from Inkerman in bringing this question to the attention of the honourable leader of the
Governmient, who I believe will bring it
before bis colleagues.
Hion. R. S. WHITE.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honiouîýable gentlemen, the inquiry made by myi
honourable friend fromn Inkerman is ver %
pertinent to the situation whichi we unfortunately are facing, not only at the port of
The
Montreal, but also at other points.
Government is doubtless aware of the different conditions mentioned in the inquiry.
Unfortunately they are known only too well.
through the experience which the public
have had within the last couple of years.
As a remedy for the aituation, the, Prime
Mini6ter has introduced ini tJie House of
Commoe, w1thin th-e l.ast day or so, dýegisl-ation which would permit of the Govern.ment
dealing wi-th conditions such as have be-en

Hon. Mr. FOWLFJI: Oh, surely flot.
My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend from Kings and Albert
was flot here at t:he time. I venture te say
that if he had had the experience through
-hich mostf of us 'went some years ago
he would be lessa ardent in suggesting this
very radical change w*hich is the subject of
his motion to-day. I amrn ot one to take
exception for a moment te the improvement
of legisiation or to a departure froin say
well-est.ablished routine or practice, but I
naf.urally do ask myseif what good reason
is there for the proposed amendment, and I
do protest against our making a very substantial change unless there be some good
reasons for it.
I have already pointed eut that we are
taking a very inconsistent position. I do
flot mean to say that we are precluded fromn
refracing the sfeps which we have taken in
former years in regard to this legisiation;for the progressive mind must neeessa.rily
recede frequently from positions already
taken. But we have consistent ly supporfed
this Act from the finie of its introduction in
this House down to the present. The -Seriate has been a greater champion of the
Civil Service Act than the House of Commons or any other body.
I recali that

mnade as rigid as possible so as miot to admit
of any elasticity whatever. 1 rememiber

that distincfly. I had ne desire to infrude mny
opinions at that timie upon the Commnitfee.
but I did fake the liberty of sug-gesting to
some few members that in my judgment

the Bill was f00 rigid, and would suifer
from that rigidity if some fiexibility were
net imported int-o it by allowing ministers
and others charged wif b the administration
of the departments t0 exercise their discretion to some ext ent, but nof without :the intervention of the Civil Service Commission.
However, I remember, as thbe Journalis o!
the House and üHansard will show, thaf
when the Bill was broughf froma the Commitfee te the House it had nmany champions, and my recollecf ion is that nof a
word of dissent was uftered .against the Bill
on that occasion. Therefore if seems to me
that from the origin of this Bill in this
olhamber down f0 the present time, wifh the
different amendmenf s wbicb have been
made te if, the Senate has been the champion. ef the policy of the Civil Service being,
vested in the Commission; and up te the
present time, with the exception of the one
case referred te, the appointment ef a translator, no abuse has been shown respect ingthis Acf.
1 cannot fake my seat without saying a
word as te the manner in whicb the Act
bas been administered by the Commission.
When we take into considerafion that thiF
was an experiment of a mosf radical
character, that if involved the whole
patronage sy.sftem being attacked and practically wiped eut, one can very well understand and appreciaie the overwbelmino
fask which faced t he Civil Service Coinmission. They had f0 deal wifh something
like 60,000 appointee.s, I understand; my
recollection is that that is approximately
fhe number of Civil Servants in Canada.
Tbey liad naturally to face the opposition
net only ef members of Parliament, who
bad been accustomed te exercise patronage
on a lavisb scale, but also o! organized politicai partieýs and other bodies throughout
the country. They had te face an army ef
critics te wbicb 1 believe ne other public
measure could possibly have been subjecfed. not only during its discussion, -but
even since the Act was put into operatien. Yet I venture te assert thaf ne public duty could have been more satisfacto-rily' discharged by any public comnmission than bas heen the case with the
Civil Service Commission, although there
are iselated instances where perhaps proper

J UNE 17, 1920
discriîninaitiol, was not sho-wn. I speak with
personal knowledge of the gentlemen who
constitute the ýCommission; and, while I
have not seen eye to eye withi theni iii respect to mny own appoiintments, yet 1 know
that tthose gentlemen have 'lovally and
capably applied t.hemselves to adrninistering
this Act; and I for one, 'who did flot view
with very sanguine expectation the successfui administration of the Act, have had to
express my surprise at the success it has
met with throughout the entire country. 1
venture te say that the entire press of the
Dominion is to-day in support of the policy
embodied in the Civil Service Act, and that
the Benate, in moving to take itself eut of
the Act, will be placing itself in a position
of defiance against public opinion, against
public policy, and against everything that
makes for the building up of a desirable
public service in the government of the
country.
I therefore regret very niuch that I cannot view this matter in the same way as
my honourable friend who has mnoved this
amendment and those who have expressed
thei.r support of it. The very fact of my
honourable friend amending his amendnient, as he has aiready done this afternoon,
demonstrates how completely g;uccessiul
the Civil Service Act. has been in dealing
'vith ail the ramifications of the public
service, because it has extended to the
Civil Servants benefits and advantages to
-which exception cannot be taken, but which
nmv honourable friend is importing into his
amendment.
Now. if the Senate wishes practically to
say that the Civil Service Act shall not
apply to itself, se far as ifs public servants
are concerned, what remains to ju.stify us in
taking the step we are now considering?
Is it that the Senate may ébe simply charged
with the responsihility of appointing and
controlling a sm.all body of m essengers and
inferior officers?-because the superier officers of-the Senate are praeti-cally appointed
by the Governor in Council. I ask myself
the question, honourable gentlemen, and I
ask you the question, if it is worth while. if
that be tihe object which we have in view'
Is it worthy of the Senate of Canada, and
are we justified in placing ourseives in opposition 'to a public policy se desirable as
that involved in the Civil Service Act?

of the very few members who speke againist
the Bili; but after it beeame Law, having
being appoi.nted, on the Committee, I 'sas
anxious te do everything I could.
Hon. Sir JAMIES LOUGHEED: That is
the -stage te which I referred; I know my
honourable f riend did take that position.
Hon. Mr. FOWILER: Because 1 believe in
the iule of the oeajerity, and the majority
having docided that the Civil Service Ooimi-ssion ehould have charge of all theee matters, I, as a good subject of the realm, in
duty bound, bowed to the wiskes of the
rnajority and eaid .no more Lniopposition.
In the Committee I tried to give the Comnmission as strong a Bill, that is, as much
power, as was possible, so that they might
flot have their hands weakened by anything in the -Bill which would prevent thein
f rom carrying out the desired. legislation
that had been passed.
I cannet quite believe that the picture of
former years in the Senate is quite as black
as has been painted by the leader of the
Government. In a sense it is a very strong
arraignmient of the character of the men who
compose the officiais and employees of the
Senate. To listen to the honourable leader
one would think that the chief thing sthose
officiais did was te lie in 'sait for the innocent and unwary Senators as they passed
through the cozridors of the building,
get them into a corner, and importune themn
for increases of salary or promotions. Surely
the business of the country was net neglected during that time. I was not a member
of the Senate then, but as a member of the
ethier House silice 1900 1 kept in eomewhat
olose teuch wit.h the doings of the senior
branch of the legisiature, and I feit that,
somre good. work 'sas being- donce ail the
timt(- in the Senate-soine good -legisiation
'sas being passed and other good legisiation
'sas being initiated. Therefore I do net
think the honourable -leader of the Government shou3d, have <made such a sweeping
charge as he did. in saying that the Senate
wvas un-able te transmact the necess&ary business of the country thiat came before it by
reason of the time of its members being
talkn up by importunîties ef officiais. It is
very easy to get rid of that sort of thing. I
have neyer been importu-ned by any officiai
for an inocrease of pay. or a promotion, or
anything of that eodt. and if 'se revert te
the old order 1 do net think Guceh evilis 'sili
foiiow as t.he honou-rable gentleman hms
stated.

SENATE

1 think we have now had enough discussion about this, and for iny part I do
1
flot propose to carry it any further.
onily wish to set mnyself right, and to say
that 1 amn net ectuated by an.y feeling
against the Com.mi"iion. 1 think the gentiieren who compose that Commission
have done wonderfulfly well, considering
the mnagnitude of the t.ack before thero. 1
know two of them well, and those two had
aoonsidierable par.Ldamentbary experience which
fittied them wel for the taek they had before
t.hem. Knowrng t.hose gentlemen. I know
they oire aclmted eoliely by a. desire to do
what is best for the Service and for the
COUntry, and'I know they have the ability.
I wish to pay that tribute to those gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Now t.hat my
honourabie friend bas taken up this anatter,
it might be well to Tefer to the expeTience
we had in this House in the passing of
the Bilb in 1908. 1 do flot think the mnembers of the Senate realized what xvas done
under that Act until it \vas put in
force. I think-the older members of the
Senate can remember that after the Act of
1908 came into force we had a considerable
number of discussions in the House over
the question as to who really exercised
authority -under that Act, and whether the
Intrrnai eonomy Conaxittee of the Senate
had anything to do with the staff of the
Senate. Those discussions took up considerable time and sometimes were not altogether pleasant.
Then, honourable gentlemen will remember that when the !Bill of last session n'aë
before the House, we arranged that the
question of the promotion of the officiais of
the Senate should be leit in the hands of the
Senate. I think that also applied Vo the
Hour-e of Commons, which I understand is
in a different position from the Departments in regard to this inatter. There was
some objection taken by the honourable
gentiemen in this chamber to the clauses of
the Bill, and al6o to the classification, and
wher the Bill was before the Committee of
the vhole Senate an atteinpt vas imade to
give :Ministers and lleputy iNinieters_ more
power in the matter of appointments in the
Dep.artments, and I rather think that my
honourable friend the leader of the Government vas in favour of that.
The Senate, therefore, has shown considlerable dissent f romn the Bill. as it stands at
present. 1 think there were a large numHon. Mr. FOWLER.

ber of members of the Senate who would
havc liked to change some of the clauses of
the Bill fromn what t.hcy arc in the present
Act I think I arm right in stating that the
Department over which my honourable
friend the leader of the Government presides is not at present controlled by the
Civil Service Commission in the same way
as soniie other Departments. After what
my hononraible friend bas said in favour
of the Civil Service Act to-day, and the
commendatory way in which he has spoken
of the Civil iService Commission, 1 presume he will be quite ready to rectify that
omission at once and put the matter
straight.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no;
because those are ail tem.porary employees
in the Department to wbich I belong. They
are being demobilized at the pre6ent time
-at least flot 'all, but they wiII be shortly.
It vas becaflse they were flot permanent
appointees that they were not put under the
Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Wit.h regard to
what has been said about the work of t.he
Civil' Service Commnission, I thiýnk everybody agrees that the meinhers of that Comimiison have hsd very he:avy work piaced
on thei-r shoulkders, they have had a treniendous nurnber of difficulties to overcome,
and they -have shown themselvesç capable
of handling the situation to a very great
extent; but I think that the Senate is
iustified in desiring to keep the control of
fus own staff in its own hands. As 1 pointed eut yesterday, we want te make a distinction between the employees of ýParliament and the employees of the Government. That is one reason why I favour the
amendment moved by my honourable
friend. Further, the Order in Council
which I read to the House yesterday shows,
I think. that the Government consider
that the Civil iService Commission have
teo niuch work at present, and are therefore takzing the task of .reorganizing the
departnients out. of their banda and assuming charge of it theçmselves, under a
com.mittee of the Privy Council. To my
mind. all tihose different points are arguments, in Thvor cd the Senate taking the
action pyro-posed under tihis amendment.
Hon. Mr. OLORAN: I would hike to
know from the leader of the ýGovernment
if the mnen engaged. ini this House are to go

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHF.ED: Wlien
the Civil Service Commission entered upon
t-he reclassification o! the Service, it was
anticipated that the work wo>uld be completed in the early part o! 1919, and the Classification was based upon that assuruption.
The work proved te be more overwheknming

1920 if rny memnory serves nie riglît, thai
the Classification was concluded. In the
meantinme a large .body of public servanîts
who had been anticipating- an increase in
their salaries, -and so on, haci cea-zed te
make f urtiher demands uipon the Government, expecting that the Classification wou1d
ha retroactive Wothe lat of April, 1919. The
BiJl was aso prepared, but when it came into
the House of Commons *Hon. Mr. Maclean
thought it would be better to make it operative f-oom the let of April, 1920. But apparently many Ministers .had committed
therwelves to ite coxning into operation on
the date which 1 have mentioned, and an
Gixier in Coundi-l was pagsed on December
3rd, 1919, Wo that effect. It seerns to me
that Hon. Mr. Maclean, who had charge of
the BigJ in the Houee of Gommons, and who
gave instructionis that it was, Wob anmended
and to be made applioable only after the Ist
of April, 1920, mnurt have overlooked the
Order in Council. The Order in Council
reads as follows:
The Committee of the Privy Council have had
before them a memorandum, dated 2lst Noven-.
ber , 1919, from the Minister of Justice, reparting
upon reference ta him of certain memorandum,
prepared in the, Post Office Departrnent ixn
regard Xa the application of the new Classification schedules ta the Civil Service, that In his
view the effect of section 13 of the Civil Service
Amnendment Act, 1919, as amended la the Senate
and adopted .by the Bouse of Commons, is that
the classification thereby ratified and confirmed,
will flot become effective with regard ta persons in the Civil Service at the time of the
comIng Into force of the Act. until the lst
day of April next, except such persoa as may
have been or are appointed or promoted ta any
position in the Civil Service after the lst day
of April last. and that the class of persoa
included in this exception are entitled ta be
classified and paid In accorda nce with the provisions of the said classification from the dat.,
af their appointmerit or pro~motin.
The minister observes that the effect is. therefore. that persoa appointed or promoted aftei
the lst of April last, are given preferential
treatment over those appointed or pramated on
or previous to that date.
The minister is unable ta perceive any sauna
hasis for this distinction as it appears ta hint
that If the Classification is ta relate back ta the
date of appointment or promotion in the case
of persona appointed or promoted on or after
the 2nd April last it should contain not less
favaurable provision wlth regard ta persoa wha
were in the Service previaus ta that date.
,Moreover, It seems ta hlm that in view of
certain assurances which were given in the
Bouse of Conflons and in correspondence
passing between the Civil Service Commission
and the several departmnents of Gavernment
there was some justification for the assumptioti
which appears ta have existed in the Civil Service that the classification schedules when
ratified would become operative as of the lst
of April, 1919 , and further it is ta be observed
that the Honourable Mr. MacLean at the special
session of Farliament recently prorogued, made

JUNE 17, 1920
the statemient that this Inatter would in the
recess receive due consideration by the Government.
In view of this situation the Minister entertains the vjew that the Government should take
such action as lies within its power t0 provide
a remedy.
The -minister, therefore, recommends that the
Government do undertake to submit such legîslation and to ask for such appropriations at
the session of Parliament as wîil provide for
the application of sald classification schedules
to the Civil Service generally as of the lst
April. 1919.
The Conmmlttee concur In the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.

This Order in Council will make clear the
reasons wvhich have led the Government to
commit itself to the Classification coming
into force on the lst of April, 1919. 0f course,
the amounts receivable by the different
employees of the Government wi11 be as
shown by the Classification; that is to say,
the Classification will determine what each
man will receive. If hie hgs been classified
for a higher salary than hie hias been receiving, that salary will date back to the
lst of April, 1919. Under the circumistances
it seemis to me flot unreasonable that this
should be done.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There is another
question that I should like to ask. Last
year
we
confirmed the Classification
that was drawn Up by the experts of the
Civil Service Commission. Are there any
amendments to that Classification to be
confirmed this year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. The
Classification is in the hands of the Civil
Service Commission. They can vary it as
circunistances miay warrant themi in doing.
It is under the power vested in the Civil
Service Commission that the duties of the
Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons
Mwill bie rnodified and the officers o! this
House placed upon a parity with the officers
of the House of Commons.
Section 5 was agreed te.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Section 33 o! the
Act reads as follows:
The Commission shall by regulation prescribe
working hours for each portion of the Civil
Service. and there shall be kept and used in

each branch of the Civil Service a book, sys-

tem or device approved by the Commission for
preserving a record of the attendance of the
employees.

1 move to add, as clause 6 o! the Bill
the following-:
The Civil Service Act of 1918 is hereby
amended by inserting therein. immediately after
section 33, the following section;.
33a. The followlng days and none other shall
be the holidays t0 be observed In and by the
Civil Service: 1. Sundays; 2. New Year's Day;

587

3. Good Fridlay ; 4. Easter Monday ; 5. Victoria
Day: 6. The birthday of the reigning Sovereign
the
of
or the day fixed by proclamation
Governor in Council for the celebration thereof;
7. Dominion Day; S. Labour Day; 9. Christmnas
Day; 10. Any day appointed by proclamation
of the Governor In Council to be observed as
a general fast or thanksgiving, or as a holiday.

At the present time rnany holidays are
being observed to the great financial loss
o! the country. It is thougaht that if there
are nine holidays, in addition te the ordinary holidays granted each summer, the
Civil Servants will dare quite as well as
people in ordinary occupations in the outside world, and there will not be the great
loss to which the country is now put by
reason o! so many holidays being observed.
The honourable member from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff> seconds this motion.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Before the honourable
gEtntleman sits down il should like to ask
him how many days this cuts off?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I have not estimated.
Quite a few.
Hon. '-%r. CROSBY: Would it cut off
nine?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not know just
how many?
H-on. Mr. DANDUTRAND: Should we not
have a Eist of those holidays, so that we may
knowv what we are doing?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Certainly.
Hon. 'Mr. FOWLER: Do honourable
gentlenien not think there are quite enough,
wvhen there are fine holidays outside of
Sundays? There are 52 Sundays and fine
other holidays; that is 61 days. There are
also three .weeks of statutory holidavs. That
would bie 18 more days, or a total o! 27 days
besides Sundavs.
Hon. Mr. McMeIEANS:
And Saturday
afternoons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will *my
hionourable friend (Hon. Mr. Fowlerý
pardon mie for intervening? I inay say to
the House that my honourable friend who
bias just inoved the amendment spoke to
mie about it, and I have taken it up with
the Civil Service Commission. I understand
it is their opinion that this should bie done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Fowler) asked me a
question. 1 have not decided in nsy own
mmid how miany holidays should be
observed, but I wanted to know what <layes
we have been observing., so that we might
know exactly what we are cutting off.

SENATE
Hon. Sir JAM-NES LOUGHEED: It takes
off four or fiv e days.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the case of
a day observed by the Commons and the
Senate as a holiday, and observed Vhroug-heut the country as a banking holiday, it
would -be quite natural to allow it Vo the
Civil Service. Not having tlhe ]ist beýore
me, I simply wanted to know what we are
cutting off, so that we may be au fait.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I think the honourable
gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) makes a perfectly reasonable
request. If we are called upon to eut off
some of the holidays which are now statutory, we should know -%hat we are cutting
off.
Hon. Mr. FOWTLER: Yon know that there
are fine days observed as holidays that are
not eut off, and there are eighteen granted
as vacation. That is a total of Vwent.y-seven,
besides Snndays. If you siibtract t.hat total
irom the number of davs that are iio%
observed, the residue will be the information yen require.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Wonld that amiendbeincy
ment. interfere wsvth sick leave
garanted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I observe that
some religious holidays that used to be
observed are to be eut off. I have flot the
list of those. I know the Senate sat twice
on Ascension Day-last year and the year
before-while the Commons did net sit.
This year we decided not Vo sit. I %voulc
like to knew before this amendment i«
adepted what holidays used te be observed
as Government, holidays and bank holiday.
s0 that we mav know whether thev are
observed generally throughout the countr\
or not.
Hou. Mr. FOWLER: They are flot all
general-ly obs.erved t.hroughbout the counsrv.
If they are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
observed througýhout the country I do not
see w.by the Civil Service empleyees should
not have the advantage of thein.
Hein.. Sir JAM1%ES LOUGHEED: 1 made
inquiry as te this whe.n I received notice
04f the amendaient; and I find thal the
other holidays are: t.he Epiphany, Aph
Wednesday, Ascension Day. AIiSaint,-' Day
and Conception Day. These are holidays
under tlie Bills of Exchange Act in fihe province o! Quebec, but they -are net Civil
Service holidays. There is ne statutory
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

enactmient of whieli 1 know giviii,, speciflc
holidays Vothe Civil Service. The Commissien lias been under the difficul.ty of determining what ho]idays. the Civil Service

should take. Apparently, in accordance with
custo.m, the public offices frDom the Atlantic
Vo the Paciflo have been closed on
certain of tdmese heolidays, the public being
thus subjected to great inconvenience and
the country Vo very substantiel loss. To
close up public offices on an.y holiday of!
this kind costs this country in tihe-vici.nity
of $400,0O0 a diay, in -addition te the inconvenience, suffered by the public in being
obliged Vo waiV -for the offices toe open. For
instance, I recal a recent holiday when. a
l-arge diedegation had Vo wait ast ont of t.he
hoteis -because,the public offices wiere elosed.
It was Ascension Day, I Vhin.k, esnd the
public offices should have been open. Commiercial' and other business. was going en
just the same as usual. The amendiment
%vhich bas been proposed coincides with,
the view of the Civil Service C.onission.
This amendHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mient is sprung upon the Senaîte. I eau
only say this. When the various provinces
entered Condederation their cu-stems were
to be preserved. Sonie hol'idays have been
ebserved in Quebec which -have net been
observed in other provinces. I caunot
support that amendmnent without ascertaining what effect it will have on the holidays
wvhich have been observed in our province
in accordance with custom and tradition
but noV in the other provinces.
Hion. Mre. BOSTOCK: Do 1 understand
tliat if we pa.ss this amendiuent there wlJ
be ne autihority te grant a holiday on aeny
day thiat is net specificaI'b mientioned' in
;tf

lon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: It can
be done only by proclamation of Conuci.l.
Hion. Mr. BOSTOCK: But it Nvould net
be possible, for instance, to grant .t.o Civil
Service employees in t.he province of Quebec
a, holiday that fa genera.l'ly observed in that
.
province?
Hon. Sir JAMNES LOUGHEED:

No.

Thiat is just
Hon. Mr. DANDUI{AND:
the diffculty. As I hiav-e o! ten stateld, I
would be very careful neyer te attempt te
impose on any other province the mauners
and custom-s o! my ownu province. In the
saine way I would neV waint. fe see any other
province impose its manners -and custosrne
upon the people &~Québec. We had in this

JUNE 17, 1920
Seinate a formidable fight over the application of the provisions of the Lord's Day
Act, and the stand we book was that eacb
province should be free to exercise control
over its own population. Wle succeeded
in having- inserted in the Act a clause
whereby no .proceedings could be started
utnder the Lord'é Day Act without the
consent of the Attorney General of tihe province. Likewise -in. the present instance,
if there is any holiday which the province
of Quebec observed before Confederation and has obseirved te this day, and
whi-ch. the Oivil Servante in Quebec have
enjoyed, I would be slow te accept an
amendinent th-at would vary the pre sent
conditions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHLEED:
My
honourable friend will see the difficulty of
discrininatung amongst the different provinces -with regard to such bolidays as have
been mentioned. What would my honourable friend do withi regard to those persons
whose homes are in Quebec and who are
e.mployed in Ottawa or in other parts of the
Dominion? In the province of Quebec they
have been accustomed te certain holidays.
If my honourable friend's argument is good
with regard te civil servants who are performing duties in the province of Quebee,
it would be equally applicable to those
who formerly resided ini that province and
now reside in Ottawa. The recognition of
such a principle-if it niay be called a prînciple-wvould disiocate the whole publie service. The trouble is that you could not
permit persons wvho had coine ifroin the piùvince of Quebec and were residing ini Ottawa
or elsewhere, and whose duties -were interrelated wvith those of othier employees, to
enjoy a holiday which others, were not
granted. I think, that in this case the recommiiendlation of the Civil Seivice Coinmission niight. well be accepted. The province of Quebec is represented on that Commis sion.
The amiendiinent of 'Hon. 'Mr. Fowler was
agreed te.
Hon. J. G. TURRIIFF: Before the Bull
is reported 1 desire to ask the Governinent
what is their policy wit.h reference to,
salaries of inen and women doung the saine
class of wvolk. My attention basý been drawn
te the case of a young lady in one of the
departinents who passed t.hrough college
with the verv highest bonours as a mathematician. Sh-e bas been for several years
working iii a departdnent and drawing a
fairlv gocKd salary. Under the classification

she is put in a lower grade than ail
the nien ini the saie branch of the
departinent wlbo are doing the saine clasa
of work, and wbose qualifications, te put it
miildly, are no better than bers. The only,
reason that can be founid wby ehe is put
in a lower class is the fact tbat she is a
woman and the others are men. I think
myself that that is rather an injustice. A
similar case occurred here in Ottawa the
othex- day. Under like circuinstances *a
sebool teacher resigned bier position, and
the scbool authorities of Ottawa were coinpelled by public opinion to reunstate lier
and give her the saine salary as a man
would bave received for doing tbe saine clasa
o! work. I would like te aslk what is the
policy of the Governinent ini tbis connection?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No distinction or disciimination' is made at ail in the
classification of employees o! the Govennment. I might say it is sexless.
Hon. Mr. TURIRIFF: Ili that is the case,
this young lady should get the saine salary
and be in the saine grade as the others in
the office whci are doung the saine class o-f
work.
Hon. Mr. F3GWLER: 1 know o! an

mny bonourable friend (Hon. Mr. Turriff),
in wvhich promotion has not come to, a
wvoîîan who was much more capable tban
Sonie in the office who bave been promoted.
Hon. Sir JAMES -LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, a difficulty bas arisen wîth
regard te the interpretation te, be placed
upon the word -ship," and I desire te move
the following amendinent:
Section 38a of the Civil Service Act, 1918, as
enacted by section nine of chapter ten of the
statutes of 1919 (second session), is hereby
amnended by adding thereto the following subsection:
2. In this section the expression "ship of
His Majesty" includes every description of
vesse], however propelled, which is used in
navigation or in the improvemnent of navigation,
and whlch is the property of or chartered or
eml)loyed by His Majesty, or the cost o! which,
or any portion of the cost of which, bas been
defrayed out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
of Canada.

This description is taken frein the Canada
Shipping Act, Revised Statutes, Chapter 113,

section 7.

That is put in on account of British Columbia conditions; the pint is the quantity

British Colunmbia arowvers will have te

AND

REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Sir Jaimes Lougheed,
the Seniate went 'into Conmittee on Bill
127, an Act to amend the Canaida Shipping
Act (Sick and Distressed Mariners). Hon.
Mr. Boyer in the Ohai-r.
Section 1-definition-was agreed to.
On seetion 1, new beetion 382-Minist,.r
may rent and equip premises tor hospitals:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Gan any honourable
friend tel us whether the Government have
any hospitals in connection with this Act,
or whether they use provincial hospitals?
Hon. Sir JAMES JOUGHEED: The Governiment had ten hoepitals in connection
with this Adt, but four are now beiing adminisatered by the Deparitment. It was
found that the si'ck m.ariners can be more
adrvanitageously deallit with in the generad
hospitals of the differen't Provinces than by
mainitain-'ing separate institutions at very
great expense, as those hospitals halve a,11
the adviantages -of first-clasu equipment.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: While I agree per-

fectly rwith kthe general policy of the Bial

as to the maintenance of hospitals for sick
and distresed seamfen, I think the price
per ton to ibe paid 'for the use of hoepitals
should not be êadvanced from one and a
half cents to two cents din certain cases.
Where ships do not put men in the hospitais the charge might be deemed ex'cessive,
on accont of the very large tonnage oi
vessels now, which makee îthem entirely
out of proportion to whart for.merly existed.
Where a vessel does not put men in a
hospital they have to employ a physician;
then they have to pay the tax to the hospital, and if men be put in the hospital
they have to pay for their maintenance
That would be three charges.
there.
In view of the very large tax upon
in the
shipping. amounting to $200
case ef large ships, I think when they do
not put men in, the 'hospital the tax should
be one and a half cents, and if they do
put men in the thospital they should be

charged two cents. That could be easily
colleoted w'hen the application is made
through the custom house for the admission
of seanien, and the one and a half cents
exacted on the tonnage would go te the
support cf 'the hospital, or the sum thal is

to be paid to the provincial authorities for

the use of the 'hosipi'tal. I think that would
be acceptable to vessel owners and those
who have to pay the taxes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The difficulty of adopting a moving tax of that kind
is quite apparent. There would be no fixity about it, and it is impossible to estimate what the expenditure would be under
the changed conditions to which my honourable friend refers. I might point out
that previous to Confederation these hospitals were maintained by the Imperial
authorities, and that the tax was 2 cents a
ton. That tax continued down to 1908. In
1908-9; it was reduced to 14 cents a ton.
Since that time a substantial deficit has
arisen; consequently we are reverting to the
former rate. I need nof point out that shipping rates have increased during the period
which has been mentioned, and that the
cost of maintaining hospitals has increased
in many instances 100 per cent. I know
the experience of the Department with
which I have to do has been that, whereas
at the beginning of the war we were paying
a certain daily rate for patients in the hospital, to-day we are paying 100 per cent
more. That is the difficulty confronting
the Government, and, notwithstanding that
increase, we are simply reverting to the
tax which prevailed from before Confederalion down to 1908. For the assurance of
my honourable friend I might say that no
unreasonable tax will be imposed. Il it is
ascertained that a larger amount than is
really necessary is being collected for the
sick mariners, the tax will be reduced.
There is no desire on the part of the Government to have any -excess in hand by
reason of now fixing the tax at 2 cents.
Under the present law, $75,000, I think it
is, would be collected. The Estimates for
the year will be $90,000, - and we have to
collect the difference. This is largely an
experimental measure, and it is estimated
that the deficit of $15,000 can be made up.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Are there similar
taxes in foreign ports?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I have no doubt that
the leader of the Government feels perfectly certain that what he has stated is
accurate, and I think that probably it is
accurate in a way; but I notice that during
a discussion in another place the Minister
who had charge of the Bill admitted that
up to 1919 there had been a surplus from
this tax, and that it was only during the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May
I point out ta the honourable gentleman
tromn Halifax how this works out? He
pointed out the other day that this ivould
bear very heavily an the larger shipa. A
statement, has been placed in my banda
showing the bass which. the Governfmeflt
incurred in carrying out this work, particularly having regard ta some af the
larger sbips. These figures are for 1919.
The Montcalm, a ahip af 5,371 tons, and
67 af a crew, paid $ 186.54, while the
Governinent had ta pay out .$310.50 for the
treatment af its sick marinera. Tbe Emipress of Japan, a ship of 3,030 tons, with
247 afi.1 crew, paid a revenue of $136.77,
w~hile the ýGovernment incurred an expeniditure of $25-4. The Empre-sa af rBritain,
of
a ahip of S,023 tons, having W61 a crew,
paid $361.08, while ;tbe Governmeint expenditure was $254. The Montfort, witb a
tonnage of 4,126 tons, and a crewv af 67,
paid $184.67, while tbe 4livernment paid
'Me Mottiâf ont, a ship of
out $20.6.
4,228 tons, having a crew of 48 men, paid
in revenue $ 190.26, and we paid out $670.
1 migbt go on aIl along the hune, and show
that the increase of tbe tax by half-a-cent
is not very material, and it is very doubtf aI il it will meet the expenditure that
the Government has been called upon ta
inake.
As the bonourable gentleman irom, 4t.
John bas painted out, there was an apparent surplus because certain expenditures which were made and which should
have been chargced to, capital accaunt were
charged againat the Department ai Public
Works. Had thase expenses been cbarged
against this particular account, as they
should have been, a very substantial deficit would be shown.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: The shipa named
are all passenger shipz, and not at allof.tbe
clasa af ships wbich I bave indicated.
They were running to the part, and they
proaaly baud returned troapa on hoard,
Furtherrrore, possihly the Gavernment had
the whole expense and the haspital had not
made its claim on the ships for the maintenance af these people in the hospitals.
That is a very imnortant difference. I arn
only sne-0,ýng 4) the casual vessels.
[Horn. Mr. ROCHE.]

,Han. 'Mr. CROSBY: There is no one who
know s better than 'the houe urable gentleman fronm Halifax that if there is an excellent principle upon -wýhich to base a
tax, it is the principle embodied in this
Bill. It is an excellent principle because
it provides a guarantee to the shipping
people that their men wvill- be taken care
of. The leader of the H1ouse has read a
statement regarding >some of the ships.
If wbat the C. P. R. ships, for instance,
psy for the treatment of sick seamen were
ai bulked together, there would possibly
be a surplus, and rightfully so. But w'hat
la the positionF The honourable gentleman frorn Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche), who
bas had a large experience, knows as well
as I do that it wonuld be a great disaster
to the shipping interests for thjs tax to be
remfoved altogether. The Montreal mnen
want to have it Temoved. I cannot understand why. One or two af themn spoke
to me about it, and I. asked them. how
the removal of the tax wvas goîng to be
of advantage to themn. It la a amaîl tax.
As the leader of the G3overnment has said,
tramn Coniederatian up to 1908 the tax was
2 cents; then it was eut down toa& centand-a-half. We ifind now tbat'the country
has been keeping up four, or ia it eight
hospitals? But there is a changed condition. and. as the leader of the Government bas said, if thexe is a surplus this
year some adjustment can be made. My
own judgment, és a man having somne experience in shipping, is that instead of
decreasing the rate of the tax, we should
rather put it up another half-cent or one
cent a ton.
The ships that corne intao a part nowadays
are large and are equipped with wireleaa
telegraphy. A captain coining into Halifax
or any other large port with fa ahip af 5,000,
10.000l or 15,000 tons and with froin 200 to
500 men, can cend in notice that hae bas
a certain number of sick men on board.
My idlea is that it would ha, well ta have
a doctor -appointed at each et the principal
ports, so that whe'n thia wirel.ess message
camne in t.he doctor would go on board the
vessel and be able ta e-ee how msny of the
men were really sick; for it frequently
happens that men on board a c-hip pretend,
to be sick when they cre not sick at. ail.
Under the present regulations, the agent
go0es ta the cnistom bouse, entera bis sick
a.nd pays the sick -mari-nera' tees. Then hie
gets a certifleate trom. the cellectar et
customs ta the effect, that there are a certain
nuier of men, who are s.ick. During the

JUNE 17, 1920
wvhol'e time the ship is in. port, if any nian
has bis leg broken or mieets w'ith somne other
accident, he is taken in-to hospital and is
ca>red for, and when the ship i.s leaving,

is to board the ship oxnd examine the orew

The Immigration doctor does not go on

On section 1-appeintment of deputy
judg-es:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, this Acf, as I understand if, gives
power to the Governor in Council to appoint a deputy judge in admiralty. It
places the power directly in the hands of
the Governor in Council under any conditions. In the Bill that we deait with a
short fime ago respect-ing the Exchequer
Court there were certain limitations under
which the power inight be exercised. I do
not quite see why a difference is made between these two Bills. As I understand
this Bill, it wîll give the Governor in Council the absolute power to supersede the
judge in admiralty who is at present acting.
No;
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
there is only one judge in admiralt y. But
aIl local judges have this authority. The
difficulfy is that if a local judge shoiild
appoint a deputy judge, and through mental disability or otherwise should be unable to revoke the appointment, the deputy
judge se appointed remains. This has happened, and the purpose of the amendment
is simply to make provision for an alternative power o! appointment and revocation. The local judg-es will continue to appoint their deputy judges just the saine as
heretofore, but the Governor in Council
may infervene if any difficulf y of the kind
which bas already confronted us should
arise.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is there any provision for the appointment o! nautical assessors to sit mith the judge under certain eircumstances?

This

has arisen, and of which my honourable
friend fromn Halifax is aware. This arnendment seems to be the only solution.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The Bill, or something of this kind, is necessary, because the
judge is not only incapable of acting, but
is, I think, incapable of appointing a
deputy. The only thing to which 1 would
like to direct the attention of the honourable leader o! the Governmenýt is that under
this clause the deputy appointed by the
Governor in Council is appointed, apparently, without any limitation of time.

It is

necessary to have him there. It is simply
a very minor appointment.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE:

It seems to me that

the judge in admiralty should not have the
power of appointing a substitute for hlmself. Il is the bench of judges who ought to
assigu certain work to a certain judge or
his substitute.
I xnay say in reference to a remark by the
honourable gentleman from St. John -(Hon.

YUKON PLACER

M-%INING BILL.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill No. 15*2, an Act to
ainend the Yukon Placer Miniing- Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the
object of this Bill is to enlarce the placer
minin rcoulations of the Yukon territory.
The principal amiendment is in section '2,
which is an amendiient of section 91. It
has as ils object the enlarging of the anea
in which a discoverer may explore. It
seems that in the Yukon territory there is
a very large area of abandoned dlaims, and
l
Mit p'ropoled. thal instead of an explorer
being entitled to 1,500 by 500 feet, which 1
understand is the nresent area hie is entitled to take up, hie may apply for -and

territory. Hie will then apply to the Gold
3oinîiissiofler for a liceiise to explore un
that particular area, and it -%vill be reserved
for the work whichi he may do thereupon.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: How long will that
be for?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It may
be for three years; during each year he will
have to expend $ 1,000 in the work of exploring-, or development work, as the case
inay be. This class of territory has already been abandoned by miners, andi it is
believed that if this additional encouragement is given them it will resuit in a more
thorough exploration being made on a
large esection of the placer -round in th-~
Yukon territory. I might say that I havo
asked xny honourable friend from Moosejaw (Hon. J. H. Ross), who wiaffs at one
timne Godd Commiasioner aud Governor of
the Yukon. to give ine hie view on the Bill.
and hie bas expressed himself favourably tre
it. and regrets that it does not go eveni fur.

CUSTOVMS TARIFF BILL.

D RF-AfING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 156, an Act to amend
The Customs Tariff, 1907.
He said: Honourahle gentlemen, it seems
that at one tirne books, stereotypes, electroty-pes, and products of that kind which
were in languages other than English and
French were placed upon the free list. It
je now proposed-and I think my honourable friend fromn Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) wvi11 enthusiastically endorse this legîsiation-that they shaîl he
put upon the dutiable list the saine as
like articles in English and French.
Hon. Mr. BOYEII: English and French
books we pay duty on, but Germnan we do
not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Books
and literature in other languages, and likewise the articles which I mentioned, were on
the fr ee list. The object was to promote
education in languages other than those we
employ in Canada. It is sometimes dîfficuit t-o ânalyze the customs mind, so to
speak, and we therefore wish to place thenui
on an equality with the others.
-Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This Bill, 1 understand, also deals with the question of the
Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

reinîssion of the 71 per cent duty. !My hionourable friend did flot refer to that, but I
think section 3 of this Bill deals mith remission of that duty on those articles from
which the duty was flot taken off last year.
I remember that at the -time the Miniýster
of Finance of that day was making his
Budget Speech hie referred to this duty, and
estimated that he might have a considerable
loss of revenue, from the fact that hie took
the 5 per cent ad valorem duty and the 7à
per cent off certain articles in the customs
tariff. But, although the honourable gentleman at that time wask apparently very
mucih exercised lest we might suifer a dilminution of revenue owing to his takinig off
this duty, 1 think tîhe figurez, show
that instead of the revenue decreasing,
as hie then estimated, it has coneiderably increase-d since -that time. The figures
as given by Sir Thomnas White on June 5,
1919, show that the total revenue for the
year endingô 3lst March, -1919, amounted to
as much as 310 millions, and the customs
dutie.s of that year woul.I arnounit to 147
The estimated revenue from

customes duties for the following year, 1920,
he put nt 145 millions, estimiating that
there would be a reduction in the revenue on account of the iremission of thp
preferential tariff of 5 per cent and the partial repeal of the intermediate and general
tariff of 71 per cent under the Customs
Tariff Revenue Act, and certain other remissions that hie -then made in the custoas
duties. I arn zlad to llnd, however, that up
te the end of the year, 3lst M-Narch, 1920,
in place of the customs revenue falling
down to) 115 millions, as was estimated by
the Minister of Finance at that tinie, the
figures show that the eustomns 'revenue
amîounted te 1681 millions. This. 1 think,
us very satisfactory. I think it also shows
the way the rountry is pro,-ressing when.
instead of a reduction, rwe have an increase
in customS revenue. Honourable g-ent-lemen on the other side of the House are
rather afraid cf reducing the duties on articles coming into thi- country. but I think
our customs tariff has arrived at a pitch
where it ývould be very much to the benefit
of the couninry generally that reductions Tl
duties should be made, and I think the,
Governiment is to be coxn,,ratulated on takin, the duty off in this particular instance.
The benefit, to the whole country of reducmec the tariff in this way will be very eonsiderable, I think, apart from the fact that
the figures 1 have quoted show a verY
consîderable increase in revenue. In fixing
a tariff for the purpose of raising a revenue

JUNE 17, 1920
the abject is ta arrive at a point wliere t.he
reduction of duty will bring in the greatest
amount af revenue. I think the experience
af every country has been that where the
tariff is tao high you eut off trade in
consequence, and instead o! increasing you
rather decrease the revenue. The figures
I have given show t.he great ibenefit that
can accrue to the country frrom a reductian
of custoens duties. Therefare I think I
should congratulate the Cxvernment on1 the
action they have ýtaken in this particular
case.
Hon. MT. POWER: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill

BUSINESS PROFITS WAR TAX BILL.
SECOND READING.

Bon. Six JAMES LOUGHEED rnoved the
second reading of B4i.L 157, an Act ta amend
the Business Profits '%ar Tax Act, 1916.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the abject of tiG Bill is to reduce the business
profits war tax oÈ 1916. It involves consideration of the various Bis which -%ve
have paseed from time toi time. and looks
ta a very 'substantial reduction therein.
Inasml2ch as the graduated reduction which
we proposeè making involves comparison
with the different Acts, I prefer that we
ehould postpone that until we go into Comntnittee, when I cmn explain it in greater
detail.
Han. Mr. BOYER:- On any business earning ten per cent on its capital na tax 15
paid. Upon profits exceeding ten per cent,
and flot exceeding- fi! teen, per cent, do you
pay on -the flrst 10 per cent, or are tliey
deducted?
Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: Formerly
it wvas 7 pet cent: when 7 per cent was tealized, then the tex was applicable. That
is now increased ta 10 pet cent; the tax does
flot become applicable until that amount is
earned.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Up ta 10 per cent, by
this Bili, nothing is paid?
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: From 10 per cent up
ta 15 per cent profits the tax k%20 Der i-s0ntP
Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEFD: The tax
becames applicable in a graduated forn
for the balance oi the profits.
Hon.. MT. BOYER: Then do they only
start caunting profits from 10 per cent up?

Sir JAM\ES LOUGHEED: It is frorn 10
per cent up, instead of 7 per cent, as for;nerly.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I im-agine it will be
neoessary ta dàsues the principle of the
Bill in Oaionittee; I suppotse the Governnment wilI; not object ta that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: I amn
quite wi-iiling that tihat ehould be done. It
may be saidl that it is ta soine extent an
invoilved Bill, aud I shail be very glad to
have Mr. Breadner here. But the policy is
a policy of reduction of taxaition, end f rom
what muy honouïrable fxiend bas said I judge
that that podicy would be rather popular.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Can you flot introduce

Hon. ROBERT WATSON. Honourable
gentlemen, I moved the adjourrnent o! the
debate yesterday because 1 wished to mnake
a !ew remarks upon this subject, which is
not an entirely new one to this House. I
probably occupy a somiewhat peculiar position, inasmuch as I have lived èonle thirtysix years since I first took part in a Coinmittee o! the Houfle of Gommons in regard
to the Hudson Bay railway. I ithink -the
cuiticisu' which has been directed towards this project is a little late in the dgy.
Two Governments, two respective parties,
have already corne to the conclusion that a
railway should be built, and it seems a little
late now to consider whether or not the
navigation cof the -bay and strai-t is feasible.
The criticism bas been levelled ag-ainst
the report that it claims that navigation is
open for a longer period than the evidence
justifies. As a member o! the Committee I
want to say that I think the findingas of the
Comrnittee are very moderate indeed in
view o! the evidence adduced. 1 'viii quote
only two or three statements made by gentlemen who have been re!erred to. A statement was filed by Mr. Q'Hara, Deputy Minister o! Trade and Commerce, and among
others -whom hie quotes is Captain Anderson. Captain Anderson reports:

or not it is advisable to g"o on wvith the
scheme.
The question of navigation bas been referred to, buit I prefer to direct my remarks
more particularly to the building o! the railway. Two Governments of Canada, one
Liberal and one Conservative, approved of
the construction o! the Hudson Bay railway, and I think properly so. 1 say that
even if not one bushel of wheat is shipped
from the Hudson bay the building of that
road is justifia:ble. It bas opened up and
is developing a very large territory which
is capable of xnaintaining a very large population and producing a great deal of wealth.
Some years -ago, when the question iwas
raised as to whether or not the Government
was justified"in building it, the then Minister of the Interior, (the Hon. Frank Oliver.
devised a scheme whereby funds could be
secured for the building of the road. A
certain tract o! land.-was set aside -which
was to ibe disposed of by the Government
to settiers for homesteads and pre-eniptions
at a certain price per acre. I have theý
figures as to the quantity of land set aside,
the quantity sold,,and the amount o! money
realized. Ia volume 2 of the House of
Gommons ýHansard o! 1909, page 2961, Mr.
Lake, the present Lieutenant Governor of
Saskatchewan, then a member of the House
of Commons, inquired:
It was understood by this &louse, I think, that
the money to be expended on the construction
of the Hudson Bay railw;iy was to corne froni
a special fvnd te be created by the sale of
pre-etnptiofls.

To which Mr. Graham replied: "'Yes." 1

SENATE
If the delay liad been caused by tlue war
there might have been some exculse for it,
but at no period during the war was construction s1topped.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Where is this la.nd
that was sold? Is it alongside the road?
Hon. 'Mr. WATSON: No, it is in the
northern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The people there will be specially
benefited by the road. The de]ay bas
oocurred since the -cessation of the war. As
a miater of ta-et, in the session ýof 1918 ta
vote was placed in the Estimates for the
purpose of completing- the laying of the
track. Up ta the present time about $14,000,000 has been spent on the construetion
of the railway, and about $6.000.000 en the
harbour. The report of the Commnfttee reoommends that before anything further is
done in the 'harbour thorough. investigation
should be made into the relative merltts
o! Churchill and Nelson. I have no hesitation in subscribing ,to that proposition,
because that is a matter that we do not
thoroughly understand. and upon which we
are flot thoroughly settled. According to
estimates given before tbhe Committee it
will take an immense amount o! money
ta make a safe harbour at Nelson.
In Churchill we have a natural harbour
that bas been used by navigataris for 250
years witb no loas. The harbour bas 60
leet o! water, and we were intormed by
engîneers wbo appeared. betare the Commit.
tee, and whoee evidence ie given in the
Carnmittee's report, that tbey believed that
if the bottom, the bard pan and boulders,
were loosened up, the harbour would be
greatly extended by the inward and outwai-d
fiowS of the tide, wbich would take out the
sult. Hawever, it is ccnsidere.d tbat faT the
present the harbour is sufficiently large for
the purpase of testing- and demonstrating
the navigability ot the bay a.nd strait.
The 'Bouse is not taken by surprise in
being eesked ta deal witb this matter. I
have looked up thbe Journals ot the House
o! Commons for 1884. That is gaing pretty
far back. In the year 1884 Mr. Royal, one
of the members tram Manitoba, asked for
a Committee on the Hudaaon bey, and as a
resuit an investigation was made wbich was
similar ta lhat af the C-omrnite wbose
repart is now before you. The sumaming
up of the evidence secured et that time is
as tallows:
If we sum up the evidence collected by the
Cammittee as ta the present condition of the
navication in Hudson's Bay and Strait, we
find that the great majority of those who have
Hon. ',%r. WATSON.

been there, and consequently w ho know, reokon
the duration of navigation in these waters at
three and four months. For more than two hundred and fifty years. sailors have counted upon
having an uninterrupted navigation of from
two mnonths and one-haif ta tlvree ynonths, and
this wltbaut marine charts, without an accurate
knowledge of these waters, without lighthouses,
without a system of telegraphie communication,
and wlthout the aid of steam. It ls not then an
unwarranted belief, that wlth all the appliances
now at the disposai of nautical science, this
navigation will be prolonged for some weeks.

Amongst othcr statements made at that
time by witnesses who gave evidence, 1
might read rsomething which is known to
probably a great many men. 1 arn sure it
must be known to the honourable member
for De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Caýýgrain),
who opposes this rneesure on every occasion. I may just here remark that I feel,
and the Commrit4ee feel, .rather flattered
that we have had such strong opposition
from that particular source, because we
have reasont tabelieve that he belongs ta, an
organization thet pretty well contrais the
shipping train Port Arthur east. and he apparently fears that this is one of the organizatian.s beinLy buit ýbv the Governent
that they cannot get int-o the merger, and
they may have competîtion.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 tbink I arn right
in raising a point of order on that statement. The honourable member is imputing a motive, and a 4sordid motive too, ta
one of the honourable members of this
Senate for the action he bas taken. I
would ask fer your decision on that snatter,
Mr. Speaker; and if you decide that the
point is well taken I think you should ask
the honourable member ta withdraw his
statement.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: i have no desire
to impute any' motives of tlîat description,
Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I amn ot opinion that the noint of order is well taken,
and I would ask the bonoureble gentleman
fram Portage la Prairie to withdraw his
statemerit.
r.WATSON: I certainly will

withdrawv it. I wish to reter ta the difficulties that presented themselves on the
St. La'wrence river. I find in this report
by Mr. Royal, 'Chairman of the 'House of
Commons Committee:
In 1716, Captain Vautrou wrote that of ail
known c6untries, the navigation of the Gulf of
St. Lawrence was the most difficult and the most
treacherous. From 1684 ta 1730, the wrecking of
seven large vessels, belonging ta the King, in
the Guit was recorded:; the lacs of these vesseis,

description ,several tirnes caused the most extreme embarrassment ta the calanY. of threc
expeditions fitted out by England ta seize upail
New France, and sailing throUgh the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, oniy two werc able ta cast anchar in the harbour of Quebec. Everybody lias
beard of the disaster which overtaok Walker'5
fleet In 1711.

I arn sure that in any of the reports we
have regarding the navigation of Hudson
bay and strait there is nothing to compare with the reports made at that time an
the navigation of the St. Lawrence. Time
and experience and improved methoda of
navigation, which are referred to in that
report, wiU no doubi assist the mariner
in niaking bis course thîough the Hudson
bay and strait. As I saîd before, I think
it is now too late in the day ta discuss the
navigation o! the Hudson bay route. The
Govcrnment of the country ie comniitted ta
il, and what I wou]d urge on this House
and on the Government is the rapid construction and completion of the railway to
Hudson bay. As I have stated, $20,000,000
have been spent on it up ta the present
time, and there are only about 992 more
miles of rail ta be laid ta the bay.
As ta the value of the country, I need
only. poin*t ta the minerai deposits that
have been d-iscovcred as a result of the
construction of that road and the consequent exploration of the country, which,
in my opinion, would not otherwise have
taken place. Millions of dollars worth of
minerals have already been taken out of
that area. The total length of the road
from Le Pas ta the bay is 424 miles. There
are &r. miles of! steel already laid and 214
miles o! railway ready for operation. I arn
glad ta say that, as a result, I think, of the
representations made by a large delegation
that waited on the Governmnent a few weeks
aga, the Goveînment are at the present
time putting that '214-mile section o! the
road in condition for operation. It must
be remembered that some of the track was
laid six or seven years ago, and unless it
is kept in repair it will ail go ta ivaste.
Tics last only sa many years, and some of
the tics on that line may have rotted.
I have said that bath Governmnents are
comsnitted, ta the Hudson bay route. 1
would like to place on record a petition
which was prcsented ta the Government in
1919, enlibicribed ta by practically all
Senators and menmbers o! the House o.f
Commons from the West, urging on the
-Goveinment the neccssity of proceeding
with this work. The petition points out
that the Gavernment is under obligation
ta carry it out, and amongst other zcasons

they refer to the fact that the contract for
building the Hudson bay road was let by
Hon. Mr. Graham, as Minister od Railways
under a Liberal Government. As honourable gentlemen remember, that was prior
to the general elections of 1911. It was apparently thought by some people that there
might be something wrong with the contract or that the proper route had not been
selected. The incoming Governiment therefore stopped Mr. MeArthur, the contractai,
for a few months. Mr. McArthur had got
in some supplies, but 1 do not think that
the construction- had actually begun, although the first sod had been turned by
Hon. Mr. Graham at Le Pas. It was suggested that there should be an examinatian into the contract and into the route
before the incominga Government alawed
the construction to proceed. That was donc,
and aftcr a thorough inspection of the road,
and aftcr Mr. Cochrane, Minister of Railways, had gone there hixnself and inspected
it, it was concluded that the Toute had been
prope-.1y salected and that t'he, contract
was fair, and Mr. McArthur was directed
to proceed.
Moreover, the inoom-*nu Government had
pledged themsclves on certain matters
affccting thalt northwest country. In the
platiorma on -which Sir Robert Borden appealed to the country in 1911 he stated:
The Conservative party has been cammitted
ta the construction of the Hudsafl's bay railway since 1896. The raad wifl be built bY the
next Conservative administration without ane
days unnecessar-y delay. It will be operated
by an Independent cammission an behalf and
in the Interests at the peaple with full cantrol
af rates.

That was Sir Robert Borden's announcement ta the people of the West. Ba both
Liberals and Conservatives are cornmitted
ta that selieme.

Ag-ain, I find that the Grain Grorwers'
Guide, rcferring to Mr. *Cochrane's visit. to
the Hudson bay district, said:
Mr. Cachrane is taking hoid of the road ta
the bay In a businessiike manner. He has investigated'the needs of the West this suznmer
and realizes that the western farmers were
right in their demnand for a Government-awflcd
ta the bay. It will probably
and apcrated roa
take thrce years at the lowest estimate ta open
the road for trafflc, and by that time every outlet tram the west wlIl be taxcd ta the utmaost.
Mr. Cachrane will have western sympathy In
bending every effort ta a speedy construction of
the road ta thc bay.

Han. Mr. McMEA-NS: You have the Conservatives, thie Liberals, and the Aigrarrian
party.

CIVIL SERVICE BILL.
THIRD READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOUGHEED moved the
third reading of Bill 53, an Act to amend
the Civil Service Act, 1918, and the Civil
Service Amendment Act, 1919, as amended.
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: Honourable gentlemen, b-efore this Bill is read a third time,
I would miore that the Bill be not now read
a third tinie, but that it be referred back
to the Commiiittee and be amended by inserting Epiphany, Ascension Day, Al
Saints Dav-, and t.he Ixumacula.te Conception, as legýal holidays. Those days are
)
observed 1 people of the Catholic religion,
and I hope the House will permit that
action.
*Hon. S'r JAMES LOUGHEED: nMy honourable friend has moved, as I understand,
that the Bill be not noiv read a third time,
but be reommitted te the Committee. I
may say Nvithout entering into any discussion that I am opposed to that.
Hon. '-%r. BOYER: Would it flot meet
with my honourable friend's ideas if we

SENATE
were to say that those days should be observed in the province in which. they are

holy days?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My lbonourable friend will see the difficulty of
that. We wou'd then have one province
obserying certain holidays and the other

provinces of the Dominion not doing so. It
would entirely dislocate the public service.
It seems to me that there is no good reason
why those holidays should be observed in
one province when they are not observed in
the others. My honourable friend will siee
the difficulty of discriminating- in that
way.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I understafld that
this Bill compels Roman Catholics to work
on these holidays.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: No.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I think it does.
Hlon. Mr. BRADBURIY: They can stay at
home. They do not have to work.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I understand that
they are liable to disinissal if they do not
workl.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would the leader
of the Governmertt toi us what the positiof
Nvould be? There s-eeiiis to be a misunderstanding. Honourable gentlemen on this
side of the House say that Romnan Catholies
Nviii be oblig-ed to attend to their duties; on
these days. Is that so?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: NO.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: If they are not legal
holidays, they will have te go to their offices
and Nwork. Tbey will have to go to their
offices on Mll Saints Day, which. la cne of
the miost sacred days. It is like a Sunday,
and public servants, for instance the staff
of the pogt office in Quebec, would be
cbliged to go to the offce on AIl Saints
Day if it is not a legal holiday.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: There are religious
holidava which are not legal holid-ays.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I amn not going to ma.ke any motion.
I think that ail Christians recognize the
fact that Ascension Day is a great feast,
and I regret that the honourable gentleman

fromi Kings and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler)
should have stricken out that day. Some
other days, for instance the Immaculate
Conception, the Sth ef December, are
Hon. Nr. BOYE-R.

purely Catholic holidays and are not looked
upnn as great holiday-s even in the Chur.ch
to which I belong; but I -do thinkHon. Mr. FOWLER: Would the honourable gentleman permit me a question,?
Hon. Mr. POWER: Will, you adlow me?
Then you can go on.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Thank you for the
courtesy.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I say I regret that the
hoinourable gentleman should have stricken
out Ascension Day. As Io the others, 1 have
no particular «ibjecétion. 'I do not wish to
make people go and WOTship in my church,
but I think, ail Christians are supposed to
observe Ascension Day.
Hon. 'Mr. FOWLER. I 'was going to a*k
the honoura-ble gentleman a question when
he rather discourteously refused to permit
it. I arn not very well up in these matters
myself, but I understood that Ascension
Day was u-zually .celebrated on a Sunday.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: No, no. I beg my
honourable friend's pardon.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: The honourable gentleman has just said that he does not know
anything about it, and he has proven his
statement.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I have been so informed by probably as good a mem;ber of
your Cburch as yourself.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: He is rnistaken.
,Hon. MNr.FOWLER- He .may be mistalsen, and I do not profess to know anything about it. In mo-ving this resolution
I "vas moved ýby the fact that there are
many public holidays observed to the great
loss of the public service. That is an unfortunate thing. I was once lu a country
where they had about a h.undred and fifty
holidays, and we will .pretty nearly approach that condition here if *we permît ail
these holidavs. There is no reason -why a
man who takles, his religion seriously-and
every man should take bis religion seriously
-there is no reason 'wvhy he should not
go farther. He would be makzing- a greater
sacrifice if he gave up bis day's pay, and
there would be no difficulty as far as his
employer was eoncerned. The day of al
that I would think would be observed is
Ail Saints Day.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: Epiphany aiso.
*Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If you take that,
you talke practically ail, because the only

609

JUNE 18, 1920
days eut out are Epiphiany, Ail Sairits Day,

Conception Day and Ascension Day.
Hon. Mr. CHAP.AIS: Five days.
Hon. Mr. FOWIEIZ: Five d-av. loss to
the Civil Service cf Canada which ernbraces 60,000 people is a pret.ty imiportant
matter, and I think is flot one to be treated
lightly.
Hon. M-r. BEILOOURT: Might I put it this
Would my honourable friend conway?
eider it a very light matter if *hiehad Vo
disobey the teachings or commnands of his
Church? Would be take it very lightly if he
were placed in the position of having to
chose between doing that and possibly
losing his position?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A mian would noV
lose hie position.
Hon. Mr. BEL4YJ'URT: I submrit t.hat he
would. If the Civil Servant does not attend
on Ascension Day or Epiphany he is
absent witlîout leave, and lie miay be disrnissed if lie is not at his desk. (I do not

con.sider that a very lighit matter. He wil
have Vo choose between running- the risk
-of iosing his position or disobeying

the

order o! his Chuçrch.
Hon. rMir. FOWDER: And it is not a light
matter for a country that needs to save
ail the money it can, to make -ail these days
legaal holidays in order to nieet the religions
scruples of this one man. No inan would
be dismissed froin the ýService whio failed
te attend on a day which was a holy day
of his Church.
Hlon. -Mr. LY.NCH"STAUNITCN: It seems
to me that when it is a choice between two
hoiidays and one of themn is a holy day
to a portion of the coiibnîu.nity, you should
choose to observe the holiday whïîch is of
no moment to anybody as a inatter oif conscience. Easter 'Monday is stili preserved.
Easter Monday is nothiîîg at -ah to anybody.
Hon. '-Ir. LAJIRD: Strike it out.

Hon. 'Mr. LYNCH-STAI1NTONý: I sugges't
that we strike out Easter Monilay, and substitute Ascension Day.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why flot strike
out Good Friday and add Ail Saints Day?
Good Friday is flot a feast of obligation. My
honourable friend iproposes the change ais a
matter of conscience.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHR-STAUNT0-N: 01 course,
there is, no mass on Good Friday, but I
would consider that it should be observed
in preference to nearly -any other day.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-S'rAUNTON.

Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-"Debtor:"

JUNE 18, 1920
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the change
made in that section?
The
Hon., Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
change extends only to the addition of the
words "except by leave of the Court" in
limes 21 and 22.
Section 2 was sgreedj.o.
On section 3--"Locality:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This section amends paragraph 10 of .section 2 of the
Act, merely interpolating the Word "either"
li lime 32 and subatituting the vwrds "«at
amy time" for the worde "«&or the longest
period" in the second lime on page 2; alBo
adding alter the Word "«situate," in lime 7,
"or where the debtor resides."
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-Affids'vit:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This section is merely changing the procedure. As
the Act stands, the affidavit must be made
by a creditor or somnebody on his beh-alf;
ini the amendmemt the affidavit may be
ma.de and served as prescribed by the rules.
Hon. .Mr. BOSTOOK: Does not that make
it very much 'rider? Ia there amy particular
objet ln. letting other people than the
creditor make 'the affidavit? The creditor
would be the person interested, I should.
imagine.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-6TAUNTON:
cred.itor ought to make ît, too.

The

Hon. Mr. -BOSTOCK: 1 do flot know what
the rules are.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seeins
Vo me desirable that a niatter of procedure
of this kind should 'be regulated by the
rules, and 'whatever t.he rules cail for will
be complied with.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Thére is
no mecessity for rules in regard to that at
ail.
Hon. Mr. BOSTiOCK: 1 understand the
old clause read, "The petition shal 'be yenified .by affidavit of the creditor or of some
person on his behalf." So that the object
would be covered by the old clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED: Iît la
sîmply a matter of verifyimg the proceedinga, and it. seers 1,o me that -the situation

might be met veryr much better by the
adoption of a rule than by a rigid form of
statute. We can only gain experience as
to 'what should ibe dome alter the Act is
put in operation.
,Hon. Mr. BO&TOCK: The Act has noV
been adrnistered. ai ail so far?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE]): No, AV
is not to corne into operation unitil the let
of Jiily, and. the general opinion expressed
regarding the MtV is that it is desirable to
have elasticity, so that it écan be adjusted
Vo*var-ious conditions t.hat may arise, consistent wilth the stability that should be
given to it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Whoever was, re6ponisible for rnaking this change must have
had some reason for changing it from tihe
Act of last session.
Yes.
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUiGHEED:
Ail ttheie changes are due to the consideration which mwas given Vo thea Bill of last
session fby judges, chambers of commerce,
boards of trade and those who could speak
with authority upon *the administration of
an Act of this kind. The Bill is the outcorne of suggestions which have been given
f rom those various sources as Vo improvements that might be made in the Act which.
has been already plaoed on the statute book.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Could we definitely
know Who shall have the right of making
that affidavit?
Hou. Mr. McMEANS: The office boy.
Hon. Mr. POPE.- The man li the street?
Hon. Si JAMES LOUGHEE'D: A creditor might make it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHFBY: It is an ohliga tory forrn in the original Act; this

Hon, Mr. BELCOURT: It would not
prevent the judge from exercising his discretion.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If a man goes to
the wrong court why should he not be
requàired to take the case out of that court
and bring it to the proper one?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is just a question of costs, that is all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The objeet of this is to prevent proceedings from
being invalidated by reason of having been
commenced in the wrong court. The proceedinga may ihe transferred to the proper
court if it is found that an error has been
made. It seems to me that is comnon
sense.
What
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
does it mem?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If a lawyer can
go into any court he pleases and if the
petition is. recognized by this particular
clause even when he has made a mistake,
he will not care whether he goes to the
right court or not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
think any iawyer would wish to risk his
repuitation by starting proceedings in the
wrong court.
When
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the bankruptcy law is passed there will be
a rush to undertake winding-up proceedings. A man may start proceedings anywhere
in Canada. Does fthis elaÜse refer to the
wrong court in a province or the wrong
court in the Dominion of Canada? That
is what I would like to understand. Suppose
a person takes proceedings in tuhe Yukon
and lets them lie dormant there, and then
sme one else takes proceedings in Quebec,
where they are properly brought, can this
person come up after an order is made -and
say, "I had my application filed first in
the Yukon and I want to have it come up
ahead of this?" I would ike to know what
is the meaning of this section?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
meaning, I think, is apparent in the language of the amendiment.
Surely
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
somebody can explain the reason for putting
it there.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
reason for putting it there is tihis. Tiane
and again proceedings are instituted in the
wrong court. Invariably an application is

made for costs of the proceedings, which
may be large; and frequently delays are
occasioned through a mistake of that kind
heing made, particularly when there is a
multiplicity of courts. This is a new Act,
just coming into operation and it is, I
involved.
considerably
must confess,
Through the inexpertience of those who
would be called upon to act eidlher for the
parties concerned or for the winding-up of
the bankrupt estate, it may happen that
proceedings are started in a court which
bas no jurisdiction. That will not be
unusual. This will permit of the proceedings being transferred to the proper court.
Hon. Mr. LYNGH-STAUNTON: Does it
refer ito proceedings started in the wrong
province?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; it
means in any of the courts in this Dominion.
A very nice question may arise as to
whether tihe proceedings should be started
in the province of Quebec or in the province
of Ontario. Business is now not as insular
.as it used to be; it is interprovincial; it is
practically international. Large businesses
extend through all parts of the world. It
is a comparatively smali business in Canada
that is not in operation in almost every
province of the Dominion. Consequently
there is this convenient ar-rangement whereby, if s mistake has been made, in applying
to a certain court, or if it is inconvenient
to hear the case in that court, it may be
transferred to 42ie proper court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It seems to me
that the only matter involved is a question
of costs. That is the only question that
can possibly arise here. Costs are always
left to the discretion of the court.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend pardon me for poiniting
out this? It may not be Limited to the
question; of costs. There may be aiso a
questioni of delay, or a question of priority.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I agree with my
honourable friend, but what I mean is that
the only ultimate question would be one
of costs.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
would not say that.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I thoroughly
agree with my honouraible friend. Allow
tme to put it in another way. I quite agree
that there may be a question of delay,
perhaps of great importance, and the purpose of this amendment is to prevent the

SENATE
results which might be occasioned by delay.
For instance, if there is a delay in the proceedings, the assets may be dissipated, and
in the meantime the estate turn out te be
much worse than it otherwise might have
been. I dan see that one purpose of the
amendiment is te prevent that, and I ani
in favour of that provision. I can see that
it s necessary in that regard, and perhaps
in other respects. I think this clause should
not be 'limited to the courts in one province, because, after all, there eau be no
harm, resulting from enabling a judge in
the Yukon, for instance, to rtefer the matter
to a court in Ontario, if proceedings have
not been taken in the right court. If they
are itaken in the wrong court, no advantage
can be derived from that, as suggested by
the honourable menraber from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton). The only disadvantage pointied out so far, and the only
one tihat I can see, is that the question of
costs will have to be settled; sud that
question will be left to the discretion of
the courts. If, for instance, somebody in
the Yukon, merely for the purpose of seeking an advantage which he should not have
under the statute, commences proceedings
there instead of taking them in Ontario,
when the matter comes before the court
the question of jurigdliction will be decided.
The court will decide whether the case is
proper.iy taken in the Yukon or in Ontario.
If the judge finds that there is no jurisdiction in the Yukon he will refer it to the
Ontario court, and it will bea for the judge
in the Yukon to. determine whether or not
the man who brought tiese proceedings
had any sort of justification for doing so.
The judge will award costs accordingly.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would like to
ask the honourable gentleman one question.
T.ake, for instance, a case started in the
Yukon in which a judgment ha, been given
there. It i then transferred to the province of Ontario on an appeal. Where will
that appeal be from? The court in the
Yukon or in Ontario?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think my honourable friend is wrong. I do not think
this contemplates any transfer after judgment has been rendered.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Let me ask my
honourable friend another question. Suppose a man has a judgment against some
one and thait judgment is registered and is
a lien on the property. It is registered in
Ontario. Suppose proceedings are started
in the Yukon. Under the next clause, the

moment an order is made it takes precedence over al attachments of debts by way
of gairnishments, etc. If the case is wrongly
taken to the court in the Yukon and an
appeal is made to the court in Ontario,
you see what a mix-up there will be. I
think the applicent ought to select the
proper court in the first place.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Yes, he ought
to do so, and if he does not he will pay the
penalty in having to defray the costs. But
this transfer must necessarily be made
before a judgment is given. The clause
does not contemplate a transfer after
the judgment. It cannot contemplate that,
because after the judgment is rendered no
judge cea make any order; the case is out
of his court.

this wvas up before several of us pointed
out that this section as origin.ally passed

Mr. Justice Middleton and another judge,
who recaist the section. It was protested

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 stili think that
three months is too long -a time. It leaves
the titie in an unsettled state. One party
to the transaction might be perfectly innocent and hie might have transferred the
property and given a warranty deed to it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS. Yes, but under subsection 2 it does not mention any time.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That would show
that the party receiving the conveyance was
aware of the bankruptcy and that hie was
being made a preferred creditor. The party
to 'whom the liability is due might be perfectly innocent of -the whole transaction. He
takes a transter of the property to cover his
debt, supposing the man who makes the
transfer to 'be perfectly solvent. In the
ineantime lie disposes of the property to another person. We -will say that it is real
estate and that hie ulves a warranty deed.

Hon. Mr. FOWVLER: The party receiving

certain property. The creditor takes it in
good faith, thinking the debtor ie still solvent. He makes a transfer to sone third
party, giving a warranty deed, and this
party comes on him and soaks hin in
damages because the transfer is declared
fraudulent by this Act.
Hon. Mr. MdMEANS: It could not affect
property in the hands of an innocent purchaser for the value without notice.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If the transaction
is fraudulent, then it is no transaction at
all.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend's interpretation is different
drom mine. It deals with the debtor giving
such creditor a preference over the other
creditors. Now, could a condition arise in
which the debtor gave to the creditor a
transifer of land with a view to giving him
a preference without the creditor being
aware oi it?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why, yes, easily.
Supposing a man had been a great friend of
the debtor, and had become bis creditor to a
large amount. The debtor says to himself,
"I am likely to become insolvent, and I
want to protect Jones, because he is a good
friend of mine." Without telling Jones he
is insolvent, he selils him some of bis real
estate. Jones takes it perfectly innocently,
thinking the debtor is perfectly sovent;
still the transaction is treated as fraudulent.
I say that both parties should have a knowledge of the fraud.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should
think anyone would learn that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The provision is
there in the law for anybody. to read. A
man who gets a conveyance Mrproperty or
money in eayment of a debt ought to inquire what the condition of bis debtor is
in order that he ma.y know that such conveyance or payment is not made against
the provision now under discussion.
It is his duty to make inquiries and
rmake sure that he is rnot acquiring a title
that is open to objection. I think that 99
creditors out of 100 would realize that when
they were getting their debts paid and
others were not, there would be a pretty
strong assumption that there was a preference.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That would mean,
then, that every man who took over property or purchased from a person who

now; it will. be inconvenient to pay the
money; but here is this piece of land; I will
sell you that for $2,000"-why, it is absurd.
He suggests it, and Jones eays: "No, I
cannot; I must go firet and examine your
books;. I muet get a list of your creditors; I
must go to the bank with which you are
deading and find out just how your account
stands there." It seems to me you are putting a tremendous burden upon him, and
if you wanted to bring about the bankruptcy of a person you could not take a
better way of doing it, because the very
inquiry that this man would be making to
protect himself would make people suspicious, and they would eay, "'By Jove, Jones
must be in a parlous way, and we wil
refuse him credit."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It seems
to me that there is a great deal in what
my honourable friend bas just said. Any
payment made within three months might
be deemed fraudulent and void. Suppose a
creditor. who lives in Quebec receives a
cheque for $5,000 from his debtor, who lives
in Manitoba. He accepts the money, and
an order in bankruptcy is made within
three months of that time; he is bound to
disgorge that -money, no matter how innocent both parties may have been. That is
the way I interpret that.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Surely: no question
about it.
Hon. M'r. LYNOH-STAUNTON: That preference may be on the part of the debtor
alone. He may intend to give a preference
to a man who bas treated bhi- wel, and the
man, who takes it innocentdy, and perhaps
gives him more credit on account of getting
that payment, may be put out. I an very
diffident about disturbing this statute, because the la.w is the result of so many years
experience and so many lawsuits that it is a
very serious thing to disturb it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It bas been the
law of Ontario for a quarter of a century.
Hon. Mr. T:HOMPSON: Why ahould a
debtor have a right to make a preference
because another man 'has done him a good
turn, when the law has adjudged him insovent?

ail !he lawyers througlhout the Dominion
of Canada. A new practice is going to be
inflictedl on the province of Quebec, which.
does not understand anything about the
practice in the province of Ontario. You
must remember that the Iawv costs are
mnade up on a tariff. I pledge my word
as a lamyer of thirty-five years' experience
that in my opinion there is no more extravagant bill of costs anywhere in the
Dominion of Canada than the one which
bas been passed by the Governor in Council and has been attached to this Bill. It
shows that the originators and promoters
of this lariff have had thoughts, flot at all
of t.he interest of the estates, but of the
interests of the people who are winding
them np. Mr. Justice Middleton in the
province of Ontario drew -up a splendid
bill of rosts. on what we cali the block
system, and if the persans who prepared
this had had the intsrest o4 the people in
view they would have followed that form
of bih of cost- and not this one. Let me
point out to yoii item 84 of this tariN. You
inust iinderstand the making up of a bill
of costs to appreciat e what thîs is:

mother of enormouq costs. No such thing
should be perinittctd. No such thing la

of costs that I know of. No such wide
latitude is given to aa'ybody. The only

'S to carry out the system which we adopted last year. Let the parties pay as
madch coEts as they choose within reasonable hinits. Section 40 of the Act was
passed tinalnimously by this House alter
a thorough discussion by ail. It was approved hy those who were interested in
the Bill; it wvas approved by the -Government. An effi<'er of the Government came
down here and redrafted it. Yet before
the Bill is put into operation the whole
i.hing is to bc struckc away and a new
section Dut in its place. The section
which clause il o! the Bi11 proposes to repeal is this40. (1) The trustee in bankruptcy or In any
other proceedings under this Act shall receive

621

such remuneration as shall be voted te him by
the creditors at any general meeting.
(2) Wherç the remunaration of the trustee
bas not been fixed under the next preceding
subsection before the final dividend, the trustee
mnay insert in the final dlvidend sheet and retain as bis remuneration a sum not exceedlng
five per cent of the cash receipts. subject to
reduction by the court upon application of any
creditor or of the debtor.
(3) The remuneration of tbe trustee for ail
services shahl not under any circumstances exceed five per cent of the cash receipts.
(4) The disbursements of a trustee shall In
ail cases be taxed by the prescribed authority
unless such taxation ls walved either by credîtors at a ceneral meeting called prior to the declaration of the final divldend, or by the Inspectors.

If YOU shlOW the trustee to receive more
than five per cent what are you doing?
You are inducing him to protract the
winding-up unti h.. can some be.cre the
court wîth 'hsfifa-&dzen years o! work tio
be paid for. That was setua41y done in the
case o! one of Pie banka in, Toronto, a.nd,
if I recahi correctly, the trustee was aliowed $50.000 for one of bis claimns in
wind'ing up that bank. If the trustee knows
tihat there ikg oni.y five per cent ini it for

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: WVhat about the
dishursementz?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Leave
the disbursemnents as tlhey were. Under the
other Act we provided for the disbursenients.
Honu. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable genatlemien, when an amendment, of this
kind is niade to an Act of Parliament it
is to bc assuîned that there is good reasont
for it. I would invite your attention to
the words which have been inserted in this
section:

SENATE
Unless otherwise directed by the creditors
or inspe'flo's in any case in which the dividende
paid by the trustee under section thirty-seven
hereof amount ta less than one hundred cents
on the dollar, or unless otherwise ordered by
the codrt ln any ather case.

When an estate hbas been so successfully
wound. up as to realize one hndred ceints
on the dollar, and the question is brought
before the creditors, to whom the e.state
lias been, pr.actically tranffferred, la there nLny
good reawn, -why tbey should, not exercise
their discretion in making inquiry into the
duties involved and in considering the high
ciase of a-bility which, bas been brought to
bear in the winding uip ci the estate?
Hon. Mr. POPE: And they pay for it.
They
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
make the poor debtor pay.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Let t.hem inquire antd
let them -show their appreciatian by paying.
T
Hon. Mr. LY.MNIH-STAYN OXN: Tbey will
want ta take it out of the debtor.
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGH-EE.: RYseems
to me that if you fix an arbitrary commission you are not going ta eet the best service from those upon whom rails the duty
of winding up the estate. 'The presumption is, according ta my honourable friend's
argument, that th ere is a uniformity n-f
work in -winding up ail estates. That is
not the case. There may be an ertirely
different condition of affairs as between
different estates. One estate mnay be very
mucb involved, another -considerably less.
Section 40 of Ithe Act places ail estates,
whether involved or not, upon a parity.
In other activities remuneration is paid
on the (basis of the service rendered; but
in this parlticuiar matter, at one 'fell swoop,
we wipe out %vhat is apparently a very
well-established practice in tremunerating
for services rendered, and we declare that
ail services shall be assuined to beof equal
value.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNriON: No; we
fix a limit.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 'My honourable friend's answer is that -we limit
the remuneration, but if the commission
for the winding up of estates is fixed at
five per cent, I say unhesitatingly tthat five
per cent will 'be charged in ail cases. On
the other hand, the maximum may not be
sufficient to remunerate for the services
rendered. Consequenitly an estate that wouid

creiditors, may not be deait with 80 attentively or with such abilitty that the maxi-

mnum may be realized upon it if the trustee
considers that the remuneration be is ta
receive will be inadequate Ita the services
ie renders. la it not according ta human
nature for a man to consider at the very
beginning whether hie will receive sufficient
remuneration ta compensa)te him lor carrying out properly and auccessfully the work
which confronta him?
My honourabie friend (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) aays there is no difference between an insolvent estate and a solvenit
eatate. Why, there is ail the difference in
the world. The reason an estate is insolvent, the difference between it and a solvent estate, is that there are complications
and prdblems which the debtor bas not been
able ta meet successfully; it la the mess,
6o iao apeak, into which the estate has fallen.
The insolvent estate is in an embarssed
condition, but the solvent estate is in
such a condition that be who runs miay
read of its succesa and of its ineans ta meet
its obligations. 1 arn satisfied. that if rniy
honourable friend, as a practising lawyer,
had the choice of winding up either a soivent estate or an insolvent estate he would
not hesittate for one moment as ta which
bie would accept.
This suhject, I understand, bas been subxnitted for an opinion ta some o! aur niost
eminent judges, wbo have had more experience probably than many others in the
winding up ai esltates. Tbe question is,
I confeas, a very important one, and we
attach importance to 14, not because of our
solicitude for the trustee, buit because ai
the desirability of realizing as inuch as
possible for the creditors and doing the
beat than can be done 'for tbe debltor, who
is quite as mucb interested. An estate
may have been so successfully wound up by
the trustee tbalt the debtor profits thereby.
That is ta say, if tbe creditors are paid in
full, there may ibe a balance in favaur of
tbe debtor. The staltement nia-le ta the
officer representing -the Governinent who
has h-ad charge of tii Bill is that this
provision would -work out satisfacitorily. A
distinction is drawn between tbe administration of an estate under this Act and lthe administration ai the ordinary estate wound
up by a trust company. Here is an Adt
wbich provides for the winding up of bankçrupt estates by trustees or others who would
not naturally bave so much experience
in this respedt as trust campanies 'have
in the winding up ai salvent estates.

JUNE 18, 1920
Hon. Mr. LYNCH STIAUNTON: But the
trust companies wihnd up solvent and insolvent estates alike. They do not deal
only with sollvent estates.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But we
must remeniberthis. Here la an Act coi-'
ing into force under whi.ch there will be,
1 venture to say, very few trust comfpaIlies
w.indd.ng up estates. They will be, inl ny
judgment, wound up largely by individuals,
altbough provision ie made for the winding
up of estates by trust companies.asyucngt
In support of the view which bas been
expressed it hias been contended that under
the Surrogate Court Acte and the Trustee
Acte of the various provinces the ameunt
of recompense to the trustte was fixed at
five per cent. Assuming that to be correct,
there would seeni to he good reason whY
a flat Tate of live per cent should be fixed

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I sui unaware that I can Bay anything more upon

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The trouble ie that
theee authorities differ in different places.
Som would think 3 per cent would be -adequate, and corne would think 10 per cent
was adequate. It is well to have it fixed;
then everyone knows what the remuneration will be, and in that way an estate can
be protected. I arn etrongly impressed by
the learned argument of niy honourable
friend froni Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton), and I chall certainly vote for

Mr. POWER. I think that if the

my mind was that commercial nien ail over
the country were looking for an Act of this
kind. I am a humble member of the Board
of Trade in my own city, and I did not
hear there, or in fact anywhere, any expression of a ctrong desire for an Act o!
thie kind.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
was none.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The statement made
Hamilby the honourable gentleman froni of this
*ton goes to show that, ins'tead
measure being the result o! the keen desire
of the commercial public, it ie juet an
expression o! the wishes of quite 6elfish
mien. However, just now we are flot concerned with the motive. But, taking the
clause which je before the Comniittee:

ceed 5 per cent oSf the cash receipts unless
otherwise directed by the creditors-

That is a comprehensrible thing.
Hon. 11r. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That does
not apply to estates under $5,000. In such
cases it would bie 10 per cent.
Hon. Mr. POWER: As 1 understand it
now, the feeling, probably not of the commercial public, but of the gentlemen who
have been chiefly instrumental in having
the Act passed, is, that they would. not get
enough under the law as if stands. Then
we get this, that the remuneration of the
truetee shall not exceed 5 per cent o! the
cash receipts unless otherwise directed by
the creditors or inspectors. The rest o! the
clause I do noV quife understand.
Hon. Mr. LYNGH-STAUNTON: That la
where the joker cornes in.
Hon. Mr. POWER: It says:
-In any case In which the dividends pald by
the trustee under section 37 hereof amnount to
less than 100 cents on the dollar, or unless
otherwise ordered by the court in any other
case.

If the est ate pays one hundred cents on

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The l3ankruptey

believe, that up to the prescrit time it has
flot been put into operation. It wa.s provided in the Act cdf last year that tihe remuneration of the trustee was not to ex.o

that that would *be too small a remuneration, but 1 do net thin-k his argument

~or trustces niay lie quite logical, and ace.ording to the vote of flie Senate there is
a good deal to be said in that regard; but
wVhen we consider section 67, whieh is
being amended, there is an en-tiTely differont prohleni; not that the legal profession sbouli be treated differently from
the vocat!on of trusteeship, so to speak.
but the situation ie entireiy different. Let
me illustrate this by an example. An
estate is being wound up; llve per cent
is the maximum that can be paid for the
agrregate services of the professional man,
w'hether he he attorney, solicitor, or counseilor. A piece of litigation is beingbrouglit into court. say a dlaim for $6,000r
-n the recornmpndation of the trustees,
inspectora and credilors. for the purpose
o! prosecuting a $5,000 daim, say againiat
a debtor, in the interee of the estate.
Now, the imodt that cari b>e paid for al
services in that litigation. even if the case
goes from the original court up to the
Supreme Court, is $250, although the litigation rnay be cf the most complex character, snd. Ray invoive counsel attendîing
court M~r several dlays. Does any sensible
znar who has had business exper4eoee, more
particularly one wbo lied been engaged in
or in touch with the prof ession of law,
think that this litigation could be carriad
on for $250? Why, it ia absurd upon the
face of' t.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
not what the section says.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:statute provides that where hie succeeds hie
may recover his costs from the other side.
Hon. S'ir JAMES LOUGHEED: But suppose he does flot succeed? Both aides cannot succeed. Then is the estate going to
drop the claim? No trustee or creditor or
inspector would nuthorize the prosecution
o! a dlaim for a substantial sum of money
in view of this clause. I simply cite that
as a practical illustration of tying down
the remuneration for services rendered in
the arbitrary and rigid inanner mentioned.
Ail I can say is that in cases o! this kind
those against whomn such litigation m4ght
be directed wouid with impunity refuse to
pay the estate, simply say.ing, "'There is no
probability o! the estate prosecuting us for
the recovery of this amount, because the
Act limita the compensation to five per
cent." For instance, take an estate of $50,000; the utmost that can ho paid for attor-

said that that .is ample compensation for

be, so in the great rnajority of cae;but
t1iere wili lie clains of -a litigious character
which m'ust lie prosecucted, and which -the
trustee ûnay not f eei himself justified in,
.prosecuting if that Ibinit is fixed.
Hon. Mr. POPE: There is nothing in this
Bill to prevent the creditiors frm paying
the trustees oS the solicitora any aimount
they like out o! their own pockets.
Hon. SiT JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. MT. POPE: Then let themn go to it.
H-on. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If an
estato is losing a huudred cents on tlie
dollar the credîtors have te pay it. If
a trustee lias a case which he thin-ke shouid
lie prosecuted, and bis lawyer will not go
on because there is not enough money in
it, the creditors can say, "Well, we wil
a-utihurize it." Tliat je the cu-stom now.
There is a provision o! the law which allows creditors, te prosecute at their own expense, and then tliey get the benefit of it.

my lionourable friend bas spoken of; tliis
applies wliether there is any litigation or
not. Thle honouraba~e leader did not take
any exception to the amendment tlie last
time tliis matter wvas up, and there is no
reason wliy it should not stand, because
if it stands they will be getting sufficdent
remuneratien. If -an estate is under $5,000
there is 10 per cent allowed; if its over $10,000 there is 5 per cent allowed. That is the
amendment wvhich was passed last year
unanimously by this House.
Hon. Mr. McýlMEANS: I would like to
point out one thing thlat the Government
may flot have taken dnto consideration. If
a trustes authorizes a solicitor te etart procesdings to set aside a conveyance, and the
litulgation takes perliaps a week or ten days
in court, in Manitoba not more than $300

property were saved after ten days litigation, he could. not colleet against the opposite party more than $300. Who is to pay
the balance?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:- They
neyer bave cases like that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes, the woods are
full of them. Take a case where the first
decigion goes against the trustee, and he
takes it to the Court of Appeal, and counsel
argues there for probably a week, and the
trustee sucoeeds in the appeal, ail lie can
recover is $100. Now, I do noi. believe he
could get the services o! the honourable
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) for $100 for three or four days in
the Court of Appeal. Then who is to pay?
The fees in the Province of Quebec are
very high, but in the western provinces
legisiation is being passed almost every day
te-ecut down the feeis of lawyers.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Stili you -are ail gettîng

rny hontrable friend hoid the saine o>pinion as I do. I know that was my object.
In presiding over the deliberations of this
Coommittee 1 was as impartial as a onan
possibly could be, I think.
The honoprable member from De Lanaudière (Hon. MTr. Gasgrain) went out of bis
way to make an attack on one of the witneeses who was before that committee.
That wes Mr. Stefansson. He flot only refused to accept the general opinion
of Mr.
Stefansson as being a ma.n who deserves
very well of the country, but he denounced
him as a fraud, as an inîpostor; almost in
that language. And why did he denounce
him? Recause, he- said, of certain s4tatements which Mr. Stefansson made before
the committee with regaird te the use of
6ubmarines in those northern waters. Ha
did net read the evidence, but I intend. to,
read it, even though it may ba of some
length. In falirnese and in justice te MT.
Stefansson, who bas been so traduced by
an honouralfle inember of tLhis Housa, I
intend to read what'he acttrally did say withi
regard te the use of suzbmarines ini that
section. In the latter part of his& evidence,
on page 127 of the printad voluime, he says:
With regard te the -navigation of the Straits,
1 think you have perhaps flot consldered the
possibility of the use ef submarines. I do flot
know whether this committee bas taken up the
question of submarines or not. That la a matter
to whlch I have given a great deal of thought
for the last three or four tronths. 1 have' interviewed some of the best submarine.men. I went
te Washington and Secretary Danlels very
kindly introduced me to bis best submarine
man. I bave also read books on the subjeet, and
have conferred wlth Simon Lake, who la one
of the best known living sulimarine lna'entors
in America. and we ail agree that the presence
of ice is an advantage and flot a~ dlsadvantage
10 the submarine;
that the submarine can
navigate any sea Irrespective ef the tee. In
other words, when Hendrick Hudson dlscovered
tbis bay ha was looklng for a short route to
China, and be failed, as many others had falled
before and after hlm; but the short route te
China that people dreamed about, acreas th6
pole, bas now been discovered through the subý
marine, and If Germany bad had the samb
motive for sending the Deutschland to northern Siberia, or Alaska, that she ha*d for sendlion. NIr FWL

ing ber to New York, there la ne reason, so far
as we can see, why cbeuld she net have gone
acrosa.

That doeý flot sound like the ravings of a

section In Washington lias Wrltten me a letter
In whlch ha says that If I plan to cross thé
polar sea frem the Atlantic te the Pacifie and
if 1 have a submarine ef approved construction
I would have no difflculty In getting volunteerr
froin such men as ha bas under hlm.

Those are men in the submarina lina.
I mean, they look upen It as a fairly ,:ossible
thing.

Ail of thase things have te be tried eut.
Then I sbould say It would ba a profltablc,
thing perbaps for Ibis committee te consider
the poslbility of submarines in winter for
llmited cagoes, eucli as mail. Tbey are a wonderfully perfect invention when you corne tt
examine tbemn. The subrnarine Is an Invention
that, you know, was used In the American Revolutionary war, and even for centuries before
that, and the submarlne bas been brougbt to a
mucli hlgher degrea of perfection than the
aeroplane, for instance, although the eyes of ail
are now centred on the aeroplane. The submarine is a more hlghly developed Invention
and is capable of great posslbillties. Now, I arn
flot an authorlty on the subject. but 1 bave
been able te give Simon Lake and others soe
information about Iee
which together
wltb
what they know about the construction of the
subrnarine. makes us ail agrea that voyages
under tce are possible. Simnon Lake bas hlmself had a good deal of axperience on the nortb
cost of Rlussia at the time that Russia waa
under'the government of the Czar. He bas done
a good deai of under-ice work with subrnarlnea,
In connectien
wlth Icebound harbours. The
Czar's Government was very mucli alive t0 that
question before the war.
Hon. Mr. Tbompson: In a place like that
channel up there, the depth under the tee
would lie very different for the sulimarînes from
what it is between Prince Edward Island and
the shore, wbere the ice reaches almost 10 the
bottorn.
Mr. Stefansson: .1ubmarines would flot beý
successful. of course. except wbere there is deep
water under the Iee It Is a question of the
depth of the straits. There are rnany types of
submarlnes. One of Simnon Lake's Inventions
bas wheels on the bottom. Altbough a sulimarine
carnies a cargo. Say, of 500 tons, sti11. by adjusting the huoyancy of il. il will weigh only
halt a ton on the wheels; that is, only halt a
ton welght will rest on the wheels. Ha dlaims
that uslng wheels over the bottorn ia v,3ry
satisfactery.

Mr. Steifansson is not giving his own ides
with regard te this; he is sirnply giving a
statement ef what was saîd by Mr. Simon
Lake, a well-known inventeor in connection
with submarine 'work.

JUNE 18, 1920
Hie dlaims that using wheels over the bottomn
le very satisfactory If thîs channel were well
sounded. he could get bis submarine rlght on the
bottom, If the channel la not too deep. and by
watching bis depth gauge he could always keeP
in. the channel, because he can always see wîthIn two feet how deep he le.

It is on the strength o! thot statement,
mode in that way, and just as 1 have readà
it, that the honourable member fromt De
Lanaudière denounced Mr. Stefansson. It
is not necessary for me to defend [Mr. Sbe-,
fansson. 1 suppose il -this mni were like
smre others, a miracle worker, a modern
Moses, who înstead o! striking living water
froin the rock strikes volumes o! watered
stook, then. the bonourable genýtleman would
bestir himself and spend sleepless nights
and weary doys. in getting up banqueta and
other tihings te do honoirr te sucb e mani.
But because tfhis is e mana who epent
years in the unknown regions o! the north
acquiring information, w.hich. he has given
ta us, about our nortbera empire, lie is
to ho snoored at and traducod, and abused.
I think the honourable gentleman from De
Lanaudière ought to be ashamed.
My honourabie friend also made sme
statemonts -with regard te insuTrance on
ships:- you could not possibly get any insurance; nobody would imaure. This is a new
route. IL was very difficuit te get insurance
on the St. Lawrence when the St. 'Lawrence
was first used in commerce by steamers. Insurance on the St. Lawrence to-day is Iiigh.
That i6 quite reasonable, and quite right.
But the Goverrnnent itseif shouid i-n'sue
until this route lias been proved te be safe,
as I believe it will eventually be pro-yod to
be sofe. So thero wiUl be no question about
that. Lo-t the Govemnment take the risk
with regard to the insuronce.
The honourabie gentleman wants to know
what will be shipped by this Hudson boy
route. As other persons spea.king on thîs
matter have olready said, if there were
nover a pound o! wheat shipped over that
Hudson bay route, yet it would be valuable.
It wouid open up an exceedingly valuable
country. The evidence that we received
showed that. Other evidence there is in
plent-y to show its value.
At the risk o! being somewhat prolix, I arn
going ta rood from a statement made by
Sir Wilfrid Laurier with regard ta the
future, in which he showed himnoalf, in this
case at least, te be a statosman o! vision, and
right vision:1 hope that 1 shall live to see a city at the
terminus of a Hudson'e Bay Railway . . . . It
is not enough for us to confine our views to
Canada that is now settled, we must look ahead,

we must push northward as far as colonisation
can go. I have great confidence that before many
years are past we shall see towns and villages
on the shores of Hudson's Bay. as we ses on
the shores of Norway, where people will be
prosperously engaged in the lurnberlng business.
the pulp industry, the fishing Industry, the
mlnlng Industry, and others. This Is what I
hope Canadians wlll see ere long.

That is the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, speaking in the ýHouse o! 'Commons, on April 3,
1906. Sir Rodmond Roblin says:
The benefits of this route to Europe. when
completed, especlally te this provincemeaniing the province of Manitoba-cannot be over-estimated.
Where is this Hudson bay situated' Have
we anything to guide us, in the experience

But far beyond the region where the Gui!

Hon. Mr. DANIEL- What is the name

Hon. Mr. DANIEL:- By 'whom le it written?
Hon. "Mr. FOWLER: A. H. de Trémaudan.
No~w we corne to the question of the
climate. In 1774 Arthur Dobbs, the historian of La France, said about the Hudson
bay:
There rnlght be comfortable settlernents nmade
in niost places, and very tolerable even In the
worst and coldest parts of that continent. which
are the northeast and northwest sides of the
bay: but on the southern and western aides of
the bay there niight be made as conifortable
settlernents as In Sweden. Livonia. or on the
south side of thp B~aitie and farther Into the
country southwest the climate is as good as the
southern part of Poland and northern part of
Gerniany and Holland.

In 1752 Joseph Robson, the architeet of
Fort Prince of Wales, said:
I have seen a small pea ,growing without any
culture at York Factory. Most kinds of garden
stuif, particularly peas and beans, grow here to
perfection. 1 arn of opinion that barley would
flourish. Gooseberries and red and black currents are found in the woods growing upon
such bushes as In England. I should expect by
no more labour than would be proper for my
health to procure a desirable livellhood, not at
all doubtlng of my being able to raise peas and
beans, barley, and probably other kinds of grain
on Hayes river. The natural produce of Hudson
bay grows very fast, and cornes to perfection
much sooner than that of England. There is no

and grown very well the sunimer following.
Elack cherries also planted here have grown

Sweden. Denmark, Russia, Poland, and North
Germany.

Now, I will quote a

man nearer our own

tirne. Mr. E. Mosher, of Halifax, was at
Churchill from September 2nd to January
7th superintending the construction of
builldings for the Royal Norrthwest Mounted Police. He sa.id:
So far as the weather is concerned. 1 would
as soon have spent the months In Churchill as
in Halifax.

He did flot find the cold any more severe
than in the Eaist. Avcording to bis observatione, the loweat terniperature registered
was 39 degrees below zero.
Then we corne to Profe&sor Macoun,
who says:
In conclusion, I rnay say that the clirnate of
the whole north land is a stable one. and as
local conditions change It will Improve. and
where arnall spots are now called good land
whole areas will take that terrn.

That is the history of the West, as has
been. pointed out again .and again ; yet. the
honourable gentleman frorn St. John (Hon.
Mr. Daniel) and the honourable gentlem-an

sneer at this whole proposition.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I rise to a point

Kingp and Albert bhas made a staternent
wvhi-ch is absolutely incorrect, and which I
challenge him to prove. I arsk that that

the Hudson Bay route, but that my criticieni

Professor Macoun continues:
The low altitude and the long day are fixed
conditions and will always be the samne.

"The long day"-what does that mean?
It refers ta the long period of sunlight when
crops will grosw, and gro>w xnuch more
rapidly than in our southern country.
Other men have borne testimony te the
f act that in that country the temrperature

GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANKS.
THE RATE 0F INTEREST ON DEPOSITS-MOTION.

Hon. L. G. POWER moved:
'That. In the opInion of the Senate. it Ia the
duty of the Government te Increaae the rate of
interest te ha paid te depositors In Post Office
and other Geverrnnent Savings Banks to 4 per
cent.

He said: Henourabie gentlemen, I donot
propose te trouble the House very long in
dealing- with this matter, altheugh it is an
important oe. This is net the first time
that this question bas been brought before
the Senate. I had the henour cf bringing it
up in 1912. in 1913, and again, at considerable length, in 1916. However, there are a
number cf honourable gentlemen here who
probably were net here when the question
.%vis discussed before, and, at any rate, those
%%-lie were here have forgotten whal, was

i

said; so I think it only right to put the
position as it stande to-day.
There is an impression, I think, in the
minds of some honourable gentlemen that
it would require a statute te alter the
present rate of 3 per cent paid on deposits
in the savings banks. If honourable gentlemen will look at the Act respecting Savings
Banks, chapter 30 of the Reviaed Statutes.
they will find, in I think the last section
of the atatute, that the Governor in Côuncil
shall fix a rate net to exceed 4 per cent.
Up to the 3Oth of September, 1889, that
rate was paid on deposits in the Post Office
savings banks and in the Government savings banks. The rate of interest payable to
outside lenderg was less than that. On the
3Oth of September, 1889, 'the rate payable
to the depositora was made 3j per cent; and
on t.he lat of July. 1897. the rate payable
te outeide tenders by the Government having
fallen te 3 per cent or thereabouts, the
Finance Minister of that time, Hon. Mr.
Fielding, reduced the rate te 3 per cent, at
which it stands new. When he reduced it,
the rate payable te lenders te the Government was, as I say, net in excess of à per
cent.
Evidently the reasonable thing is that
the depoÈ~tors in the Government savings
banks, who are as a ruie reputable citizena,
people who have contrived te save semething, but net very much, should get some
of the benefita, which accrue te wealthier
peopie, who are now getting 5k and 6 per
cent. The last loan that the Government
made was only a short-time -ban, and was,
I think, at 6 per cent. If the Gevernment
pay American capitalists 6 per cent, and
their own fellow citizens enly 3 per cent,
does not that, horraurable gentlemen, seem
te yeu te be on the face of it an unreasenable and unjust attitude te take? It does
se strike me, and I think it muist so strike
people general-ly.
I look at the Canada Gazette and ether
sources cf information and find that at the
end cf May last there were in what aie
known as the Post Office saving-s banks
S30.310,000 and in what are knewn as the
Dominion Government savingas banks $10,764.000; making ait-ogether $41,075,000. An
addition cf one per cent on that ameunt
would be $410.000, which weuld be distributed amongst people who, I think, constîtute a very deserving class. Naturally the
banks, which ail have savings departments,
will net pay more than the Gevemnment
pays; se the attitude cf the Government

JUNE 21. 1920
Hon. HEVVITT BOSTOCK: Honours.ble
gentlemen, 1 thjnk my honourable friend is
to be congratulated on his perseverance in
tAlUS matter. As hie ha-, -aleady told us. this
ie the third or fourth tîrne he has brought
up th-is question and tried to iinpress on the
Governmrent that it is their duty to pay a
higher rate of interest te depositors in the
Post Office savings bank8. My honourabie
friend pointed dut that tihe rate of interest
was reduced in 1897 because the Government
fou1nd they were able to get nioney in the
or.diniary way by lower rate of interest than
4 per cent. This shows that at that time
the Government took into consideration the
rate st which money could be borrowed in
the open nmarket. It seems on±ly logical
and reasonable, therefore, that the Government ehould likewise take into consideration
ai the present time the rate st which rnoney
can be borrowed ini the open market anid
should raise the rate of interest in the Post
Office and other Govern.ment savings banks
to 4 per cent, or even more, inasrnuch as
the Gove-nLment, if they go iLo the open
xne.rket to bor.row mc.ney, have to pe.y a
considerably higher interest rate than 3 per
cent.
My honourable friend referred to the question of bonds, but he overlooked the savinga
certificates which the Governrnent are
issuing at the present tirne, and on which,
I think, the purchaser gets 5 or 54 per cent.
I arn not sure which rate iL is. The savings
certificates should be of some advantage to
the ordinary depositors in the Post Office
savings banks because they bear a littie
higher rate o! interest than is being paid on
deposits. The savings certificates, I presumne, can ha turned in at any tirne, and
their cash value allows o! 5i or 5j per cent
interest on the money. So there is a certain
advantage to the ordinary depositors in the
Post Office savings banks in understanding
the arrangement with regard te, savinga certificates.
Rf think the Government should take this
question into serious consideration, and see
if they cannot meet the views of my honourable friend fromn Halifax.
Hon. GEORGlE W. FOWLER: I think
there is one elernent that has been lef t out
of consideration so far, and that is the fact
that the chartered banks will have to follow
suit and pay 4 per cent, or the rate, whatever it is, to which the bank advances
interest on savings accounts. That means
that the banks will charge a higher rate cf
discount if they have to pay a higher rate

Dai

for deposits. Perhaps it is selfish on my
part, but that is the only end of the banking
systemn that I arn interested in; and 1 think
iL would be a rnîsfortune to put so heavy
a tax upon business. There are many persons who in their business are obliged to
borrow large surna from. the chartered banks.
These in turn get the mbney !rorn depositors,
who are able te save. If you raise the rate
in one case it must be raised in the other.
IL is te the credît of the banks that they
have not advanced the rate. Although the
cost of everything e"s throughout the
country has been advanced, the banks have
rnaintained the sarne rate o! discount.
Now the depositor, for whorn the honourable membet for Halifax pleada, lias an
opportunity te invest hie sa.vings at a
larger rate o! intere-st than 3 per cent if he
wishes. He cani invest thern in war bonds
and war savings certificates. go nobody
,s hurt, and I do not thiînk there is very
mnuch demand for a raise in the rate of
discount.
r hope that the Government
wil! flot raise the rate, and will turn a
deaf ear to the pleadings of the honourable
senior niember for Halifax, and let the
rate remain as it is in order that business
men will not be hampered with a too bard
rate o! discount.
Hon. JAMES DOMVILLE: Conditions
have changed materially frorn what they
were before the war. I speak subject to
correction, but I undexrtand that our patriotic people are buying Germain marks at
10 cents on the dollar, and they calculate
bc get a thousand per cent. They do flot
need to put their money into the savings
banks. A gentleman who spoke in another
Nouse did not seem te understand where
ail the coin ivas. Already paper is getting
dear, and tiierefore the printing of those
bank notes is going to cest a lot of nioney.
I agree with my honourable driend from
New Brunswick (Honourable Mr. Fowler)
ihat it is nôt a serious question to-day as
to the rate paid in thec savings banks, because depositors have other opportunities
of getting- big interest.
They can buy
Dominion securities ai 5i par cent or 61~ par
cent, or provincial bonds ai 6 per cent. and
take their knoney 'frorn the post 'office
savings hsnks, but those banks are an
advantage to people who have a srnall
amount o! rnoney, as iL is perfectly sale,
and they are happy when they have a
deposit to their credit. Those savings
banks are !or sma]1 depesitors, net for
speculators or traders. Down our way they

SENATE
have beeni ver.Y successful andl -ive a great
dleal of sý.tisfartion, and 1 do flot think
there need be much kick against the
Government, in regard to them. We can
kick them, on something else, but not on
thRt.
Hon. J. G. TURRTFF: I think my
honourable friend from. King-s and Albert
(Hon. Mr. FowIer) has dorgotten one phase
of the subject. He says the banks are not
charging more interest than they formerly
did. My experience is rather different
frorn that; and, besides they are flot
paying any more interest for their money.
The banks get the bulk of their money for
notbing, or at a very low rate of interest.
First of ail, they can issue paper money
up to the full amount cf their capital by
paying te a guarantee fund of 6 per cent.
Ail those $6, $10, $20, and $100 blls they
g."t practically -for nothinz.
Hon. Mr. DOMVI'LLE: Fiat money.
Hon. Mr. TURRIEF: Then, again, the
banks let ail the current money accounts,
ainount ing to hundreds of millions, for
nioth-.ngc. I think that is right enougb, beciuse '.hey bave te keep a large amount
of fluid assets in money. in oi-der to meet
the cheques; but on the great bulk of
the saving-s, while they are suppesed to
pay 3 per cent, they psy only an average
Mf 21 per cent; so 1 arn told by bankers.
For instance, a depositor puts $100 inte
a saving-s accounit on the 5th of the month;
be gets no intercst for that month. If he
'ir ws ;t out on the 25th of any month, no
intere-t. is paid for that nionth. 6o that
the higli-st rate the banks pay for any of
fheir money is only 21 per cent, and to-day
they are losninga it out at 7, 74, and 8 per
cent. To rny mind that is too big a margin.
In th-~ T'nited ýStates the banks pay 4 per
cent on deposits.
Hon. '.%r. FOWLER: The great bulk o!
the money is ]oaned at 6 per cent.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Very littie nowadays.
Hon. Mir. TURRIFF: I dû flot think the
bulk is loaned at 6 per cent now; but.
even granting that it is, there is- toc niuch
'nargin w-hen we consider that the banks
get thc amount of their capital for the
cost of printing bis and a guarantea of 6
per cent, and the current-accounit money
which +bey get for nothing. In the United
Stat.es the hanks pay depositors 4 par cent
-mnd dc not charge any hig-her interest for
*iscolints.
Hon. Mr. DOI&VILIýE.

Hon. '.\r. BEIQUE. I wou]d like to kiow)what 'banks pay 4 per cent?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: When I was in business in the West 1 livad near ithe boundary
line, whe're the banks paid 4 per cent on
ail deposit rnoneys, and 1 arn satis'ed that
if thay paid it thare they paid it in other
partts o! -the United States as well.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Canada paid 4 per
cent then.
lion. Mr. TURRIFF: No' this was subsequent to the time that Canada was paying 4
par cent on de.posits. The banks are in a
good position and could easily afford to
psy 4 per cent on savings deposits without
incommodinga borrow'ars to any degree
either; and I arn sat.isfied that if they had
to pay 4 per cent the rate to borrowers
would not necassarily tbe raised. About
1897 the interest rate was lowered from 4
per cent to 3 par cent, and rightly enough
at that tîme, because the Government ceuld
horrow nionýy in Fnzland for 3 or 3j per
cent. If that wvas a propar action to take
then, I leava it to the Housa to say whethar
it would not ba proper now that the Governnient should increase the rate, because it
is paying or has paid as high as 7 per cent
in the United States for money; and if the
Dominion Government cannot borrow monay
under 5j or 61 per cent, why net give 4 per
cent ta the people of Canada who have
money on dqposit? That seams ta me only
fair in view cf the reverse action we teck in
1897. It is a question well worth consideration, and I quite agrae wîth my honourabla
friand the Senator from Halifax m-ho bas
action
brou.ght this mattar up that soe
cught te be taken. Tha matter was brought
up in the Commons several times whan I
was there, but tha Government never saw
their wvay clear te act; and it seerns te me
only fair, now that the Govarniient has
adoptad the pclicy cf borrowing in Canada
tha money it needr, that the rate should
be raised on 6avingas bank deposits when it
is paying 5j per cent on its bonds, or nearly
double what it pays on deposits in the
savings banks.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: But the deposits
banks amount to a mare
bagatelle. Does the honourabla gentleman
mean that bis argument sbeuld appîy te ll
the deposits in ail the banks?
iii the saving-s

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: What I mean ir., let
the Governmient psy 4 per cent on their
deposits, and then if the public choose te
put their money in the banks at the average
rate of 21 per cent, let, them do it; but the

JUNE 21, 1920
banks would have to pay 4 per cent. 1 think
the motion of the honourable Senator from
Halifax is very opportune.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: I cannot agree with
what has been said by the honourable
gentleman froul Assiniboia (Han. Mr.
Turriff). If he takes the trouble to inquire
froin different banks he will find that aiter
the banks have administered the money
which is deposited in their savings departinents it costs thein much more than 3 per
cent; as 8 rule, it costs abo.ut .3j per cent.
As to the banks.in the United States paying
4 per cent, he is altog-ether mistaken. I
defy hum ta find in New York any bank in
good standing that pays 3 per cent, or even
2j per cent for its maney. They wvill not pay
it; they pay a very sinail rate ai interest.
In England flot a cent oi interest is paid for
deposits in the banks; in fact, in a number
of banks the depositar bas ta pay something
to get theni to receive his maney on deposit.
In France the same is the case. Those are
countries of as large experience as tbis
country; and if it were such a misfortune
ta the Canadian people flot ta command a
hi.-her rate than 3 per cent in the banks.
one might wonder why the people ini France
or England might nat command that interest or even a rate af 1 per cent.
The hanourabl%- gentleman from Assinibois and t.he honourable gentleman fram
Halifax lose sight ai the duties incumbent
upon the banks in receiving the savings af
the people. They must keep in reserve, ai
the maney which is in their coffers, at least
25 per cent, and even 30 per cent or 40
per cent, to answer ail the calls that are
mnade on thein.
I have heard the honourable gentleman
fromt Halifax repeatedly make the statement that the banks pay high rates ai
dividends ta their sharehalders. Well, they
pay high rates of dividends because those
dividends are paid flot anly on t.he capital
but an the reserves which have been accumulated frain year ta year; but if the
hanourable gentleman inquired he would
find that the dividends do flot, as a rule,
ex.ceed 6 per cent on the money that bas
been invested by the sharehalders.
The
stocks of the baniis are distributed over the
wliole country, and it is open ta any persan
living in this country tao invest in those
stocks; and if t.hey are sa attractive or
remunerative, people who have money on
deposît with the banks can buy them, and
the mare bank stocks are baught the better
for tbe country, because the industries ai
the country, flot only manufacturing but

639

agricultural and others, depend upon the
credits accorded by the banka ail over the
count.ry.
II t.hink t.he people ai Ibis country are
proud ai aur banking institutions. They
have been refldering valuable service ta
the whole casmmunity, because as a rule
they have been well canducted and have
been established and maîntained an the
proper principle, and it is that very principle that the honourable gentleman Epeaks
ai -froin year ta year. I think it would flot
be in the interest ai the people at large
ta dîsturb that positian by inducîng the
Gaverninent ta pay a high rate ai interest.
It is open ta depositors in Government
savingas banks or in chartered banks ta buy
either 5 per cent or bi per cent Daminion
bonids. Why do they not? Because they
are depositing their money under such conditions that they can cammand it at any
time; tbey put it an deposit and the next
day tbey can draw a cheque upon that
deposit. and purchase what they desire,
whereas they feel that if they were to purchase bonds froin the Government or deposit
their money with the Gaverninent they
would not have the saune facilities. If the
hanourable gentlemen who have propounded
the view ta which I refer were ta study more
carefully the conditions ai aur banks, and
the financial conditions that are required
in the interest of the country at large, they
wauld see that the rate ai 3 per cent is a
reasonable rate, mare especially when depasitars have at their command the means ai
placing their maney at 4, 5 or bi per cent,
with the guarantee af the Gavernment.
It lias been stated that the rate ai interest
for money bas been raieed. Wel, I have
had sometbing ta do with banks; I think
I know what ia being done in the chartered
banks ai this country; and I say without
fear ai contradiction that the rate for money
bas flot be-en ra.ised. The money which was
obtained ail through the war and Mfore the
wer bas been et the same rate that abtais
at the present day in the different banks,
and I tbink the banks are flot pratected
more than what is in the general1 interest
ai the country or more than the bank
themselves are entîtled ta.
Hon. L. McÎMEÂNS: II rise, not 10 dis.
cuacs this financiail question with the honourable gentleman who lias juat taken hia
seat, but xnerely ta euggest that if the Governinent ai this ountry wants money it wiil
have ta pay a little more interest, for this
reasan, that the provi.ncial governments are

S ENA TE
eliterin.g the fielid andi are recelvling
money on deposit and paying 4 per cent
for it. The Manitoba Governrnent is taking
deposit6 at 4 per cent and lending money at
6 per cent. 1 do nlot know that 1 can say
whether that is going to be an unqualified
sjoess or otherwi-se. The honouýrable gentlemen fTom Assiniboia spealcs about a bank
rate of 6 per cent or 8 per cent; but it must
be borne in mirid that that las compounded
every 3 xnonths, so that at the end of the
year itïs a very much larger rate than 6 or
7 per cent, or whatever the rate of discount
may be. To my mind the question is, how
much the Government of Canada require
money. If they want it they -will have to
increase the interest.
110w

Hon. V. RATZ: Most of the depesitors
in the Post Office savings banks -are not
business men or moniied men, but generally
speaking are poor people-workingmen,
widow women, etc.
My honourable friend says they could
invest their money in bonds. So they could,
but they are not business people; in fact,
many of thoGe people do not know hou' to,
go about getting the money from those savings banks unless eome one telle them.
Some of them have not iuoney enough to
buy a $50 bond, even if they were right on
the spot. As most of those depositors are
poor people with emall accounts I do not
see why the Government shouild .not pay at
least 4 per cent on those deposits. That
would seemn only reasonable a.nd right.
I do not know mnuch about t.he banks.
and do not propose te speak about
them, but I know that I neyer figure on
any interest at all from them. If I want te
pay a cheque 1 can get the money quickly
f rom the bank, but if I have money te invest
I do not invest it with banlos. They are
god for aeeoiniodation, and we need thiem,
but their reserves are paper money, and
they do qot lose much by it even if they
have to k-eep considerable amounts in reserve.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourive

Mr' Power) any furtiher assurance than I

Government ine.reaised t.he -rate cf intereszt

charrtered .banks cof the Domzinion $ 1,20W,000,
000. The increase in tihe rate of interest
njp<n those deposit& to 4 per cent would
zeguit in the .ban<s having te pay $ 12,000,000 a year extra to keep peace with the
Governanent. I amn net now oounting upon
t.he extra înterest whi0h tihe $40,000,000 in
the Goverument Institutions would represent; that would be $400,000 a year. But if
an added buuidon of $ 12,000,000 'anal
were unposed upon the ehartewed banks of
this Dominàon, by theïr being coonpeIled to
pay 4 per cent insteaid of 3 per cent, there
je ne doubit tjiat the public rwou.ld have te

Hon. Mx. DOMVILLE: The banks pay
10 -te 12 per cent dividends.
Hon. Sirr JAMES LOUGHEED: I venture
to aay lihat -there is no ba.nk in the Dominion paying dividends at that rate.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The Bank of Nova

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My inpression le ýthat the everage dividend. cf the
banks upon the âhares wou.ld only represent about 5 per cent. I do net think that
the Bank cf Montreal, that odid and 'weflestabdi-shed institution, is paying more than
5 per cent upon the araket value -of each
share. But, although a bank advertises it.s
di'vidend st 10 iper cent, hono-uiable gentlemen mxust remernber that thie purohasers of
its sharee upon the market only receive a
dividend of 5 or 6 per cent. In ny jud.gment it is not desirable that great inducements -shoÊ~id be held eut te depesitors,
eîtlher by thie Government or by tlhe bankcs,

those who

-,ish to deposit their funds and who do not
desire to place them. in business enterprizes
mnay receive between 5 and 6 per cent. It
goes without saying that an investment in
government secuxities is practàcaly the same
tihing as a deposit in a Governinient savings bank except t.hat the money realizes
a Iligher T~ate of interest. Under these circum stances it eeems to mne that the Government has kept fully in view the necessities
o! t.he public, so far as paying a fair riate of
i.nterest -is conoerned. If the peo4ple choose
to -put their deposàts in the Governîmne
savings hanks at 3 per cent they are at
liberty to do so; on the other biand, the
Government -sav&: - Buy Goverrvment securities, and we vil pay you a percentage practically equal to bank divide'nds." Under
*these circunstances I think the publ1ic are
well protected.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not propose to detain -the flouse
at any lengt.h; -but I w'ish Vo refer to 'one
or two points mnade by the honourable
gentlemen frorn De Sa:laberry (Hon. Mr.
Beique). He aUleges that xnoney costs the
banks mnore than 3j per cent. Well, te
banks would 'be cipen to receive deposits,
even though they bore 5 per cent interest;,
and he is probably rather exaggerating te
position when he says he tbinks that -te
taking do these deposits would cause a
qnarked increase in the cost cf rmrnning te
banks. The banks are there for'businese,and
whet-her they are paying 3j "e cent or 4
per cent for deposi-ts reaily does not rmake
any material differenice in the work or in
the ceet.
The honourable gentleman undeiltook
to say that 4 per cent wvas not paid in the
United States. As to that, we have the
authority o! the honourable gentleman from
Assiniboia (Hon. M.%r.Turrif!) who lives
near the boarder, and who is personally
aware of the fact that in the United States
4 per cenàt is paid in the savings banks;
and I know the same fact from another
source.
The honourable gentleman dre(iv a picture of the serious thîngs, that might
happen if the banks were compelled to pay
4 per cent; but the honourable gentleman
mnust realize that it is noV compulsory. If
t.he banks do flot wishi to psy 4 per cent,
they need not do so, and then the people
who have made deposits in the savinga
department.- of the banks will make their
deposits in the Govérnme'nt, savings banks,
and the Government will be getting a large

sum of money at -a very low rate of interest,
and when the Government next issues bonds
it will raise the money -without going outside
and will get it at 4 per cent instead of at
51 per cent.
As to the banking system o! this country,
Ra-ni quite aware that it is a good system.
It was a good system when 4 per cent was
paid, and when 3k per cent was paid, and
it is stili a good system, and would continue
to be a good system if the rate of interest
went back to 4 per cent.
The leader o! the Government said something about the fact that people could get
bonds. WelI, s the honourable gentleman from North Middlesex (Hon. Mr. Ratz>
said, a very large proportion of the people
who make deposits in the savings banks
are people who' do not know how to go to
work to get bonds; and, further, the money
cornes to these people in small amounts and
they wîsh to bave it put where they can
get it again if occasion requires. -So practically the bonds are not. available to them.
Then there is the fact, honourable gentlemen, notwithstanding ail these supposed
rnet.hods of gettîng rid of their money, that
there are $ 1,200,000,000 of the people's money
in the savinga departments of the chartered
banks. I think that ia the best evidence
that the honourable gentleman is mistaken.
I must say that 1 arn not just able to
see the point that the leader oi the House
is undertaking to make. He told us that it
was dlésired to haves the n>oney conserved.
Well, the savings bank is a good place in
which to conserve it. Later on he said that
if the Government adopted the policy cmbodied in this resolution, it would interfere
with the development of the resources of
the country. If the money is going to stay
in t.he banks just, to be conserved, I do not
ame time be develsee ho-w it can at the -oping the resources of the coundtry. The
truth is that the banks are now protected,
and the people who are not capitalists have
no opportunity to deposit their imoney in a
safe place where it will bring in anything
like a decent return, and the temptation
is to put theiT money into speculation where
it rnay be lost. I think the case is a perfectly plain, clear one, although some
honourable gentlemen have apparently been
t.rying to beeloud the issue. I xnove the
resolution, seconded by my honourable
friend !rom Liverpool (Hon. Mr. Farrell).

The motion of Hon. Mr. Power was negatived.
REORGANIZATION 0F ýGOVERNMENT
DEPARTMENTS.
MOTION.

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF mnoved:
That, in the proposed reorganization of the
varlous departneflta of the Governrnent, it is
the opinion -of this House that men with
expert ability of a high order can be secured
in Canada who are capable of doing this work
In a thoroughly satisfactory suanner.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I wish

ta eay at the outset that 1 arn quite in favour

ai the proposai1 of the Government ta reorganize the various departments. I think
that if there is any work that the Gavernment should take up and carry ta a conclusion it is this very work. There is no doubt
in my opinion that a great deal can be
accornplished a great deal of money saved
by the reorganization ai the various departmxents. The main question is how it can
best be done-whether by men in Canada,
or whether w-e have ta go to the United
states to -et a Germnx-American flrm to
do work that we in this country sure]y
ought ta be able t-o do. I have. no doubt,
honourable gentlemen, that this firm could
do very good work and could effect very
great saving; but are there no men lin
Canada otheýr than these Heaven-born experts who can do this work which is c0
badly needed? We have hiad some little
experience of these gentlemen. They were
employees cf the Arthur Young company,
who made the reclassification and who have
heen working for a couple of years and
have rnanaged to draw a couple ai hundred.
thousand dollars out ai the treasury ai
Canada. Tlinkiling, I suppose, that they
liad accornplished -ab-out ail iýhey could do
in that- line that would look well, they
assigned -this work ta this Germaxi-Ameriýcan hranchi of theirs, and apparently t.he
Goveriiment proposes to faîli lxi ne and

be their victiini, and to allow thein to go
on arid do 'tIie work oi rporLar izing fixe
different departmerits.
I will give credit to Arthur Young and
Company for accomplishing ane good thing.
Prior f0 the reclassification, officiais doingthe same class of work in different departments were paid a1together difierent
salaries. In one department a clerk doing
a certain class ai work would get $800; in
,another department another clerk doing
exactly the same clas,9 of work would get
$1,000; in another department another clerk
doing the same kind of work wauld get
$1,200; while in stili another depaltment
another similar clerk would g4~ $1,500. That
condition has been done away with, and lin
that respect 1 think a great deal of good
will result when the reclassification is put
into force. But if we are to judge oi the
work of this firm in classiiying the difierent
individuals in -the different departments, by
the i act th-at they give. $4,000 to one marn,
and $2,000 or $2,500 to another who la doirir
far more important work, I think wve shall
corne to t.he conclusion that they have not
done very good work. If this branch of
their firm is flot going to do e-ny better in
the future than the parent company has
done in the past then I say, honourable
gentlemen, thai it would be pretty hard
to pick out a committee of three mien in the
Dominion ai Canada who could do any
worse. And look at what it is proposed to
pay them.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Who are the
men? I have flot heard yet.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Griffenhagen and associateg. I do notknow who Mr. Griffenhagen
is, but the name is a very German-sounding
one, and I see it bas been stated in the
other branch of Parliament that this firin
is. a German-American institution. I think
it is rather unfortunatýe that the Government should advertize to the wliole woric
the fact that we in Canada cannot produce
a committee of three men who hav.e bramas
enougah, common sense enoug-h, arid courage
enough to reorganize a couple of Goverriment departments, and that w-e have ta

think the Goverriment must have a very
poor opinion ai the ability of aur people;
in fact, I thlnk it is rather worse than
that.
During the past five or six years, as you
ail know, Canada was engaged in a very
seriaus war. We sent across the water s--orne
half a million of mnen and sixtv o.dd thousand of thein, sleepig their last long,

sleep in France. They hielped to save this
country -and the Empire. It seerus to me
t.hat. if the country cannot produce a coinmittee o! mien who can reorganize a department without send-ing to t.he United States
fo.r assistance, it is a question whether the
country was worth saviug. That is, somnething to think about. Was the coun.try
worth saving if we have not got men with
brains enougli to reorganize our Government departments? I know that we have~

the
Post Office and the
I know that my honourabbe 4friend the Postmaster Generail bas bramne enough and.
common sense enough, and I think that if
h-e were let alone *he would have courage
enough, te make a -reorganization. My honourable !riend k-nows that a reorganization
is in order, that àt, la badly needed, and
that hundreds o! thousands o! dollars can
be eaved by it. And hie has knowu that, and
the Goveranent has known it, foýr years,
and it bas flot been done. Now~ they propose to hand over to an Amerîcan firm the
work that they have not donc themselves.
My honourable friend the Minister o! Labou-r (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who is on that
Cornmittee, o! Council who are looking after
thiis nmatter, isaid that we have uobody in
Canada wi*th the necessary experience. In
the sarne breath he stated that there were
four -Canadians; amongst thoise men whom
it is proposed to, engage to do the work. Has
it corne to this. that Canadians have to be
sent over to the United States to go through
an apprenticeship before they acquire brains
enough, sense enough, and ability enough
to reorganize a departrnent? I do not think
that às neeessary at all.
Ânother thinig. In this Order in Council
that the Governmen-t have pasz-ed takzing
authority to, do t.his work they lay stress ou
the good work that Arthur Young & Comnpany have done in connection with the
Printing Bureau. Doca anybody here believe that it is Arthur Young & Company
who have done the good work in connection
with the P.rinting Bureau? At Ieast I do notflot for one momient. Sone ofyouiiiay reiiember that I brought up this question o! the
Printing Bureau two sessions ego, and there
wa.s appointed by the Government a commi't.tee o! t.hree Canadians to investig-ate the
working o! the Bureau. That committee
wNas coinposed o! Mr. Lewis,. o! Ottawa, Mr.
Tarte. o! Montreal, and the late Mr. -Slack,
o! Montreal. at. that time general manager,
I thijnk. of thie Montreal Gazette. They

were master printers and knew something
about printing. They made a report to,
Parliament. I have that report. and 1 arn
going to reaà a few extract-s from it to show
you what they recommended to the Government. If the Governrnent had carried. out
their recommnendations there would be no
need Êo have anybody else at work reorganizing the -Printing Bureau. They found that
the Printing Bureau -was in a very sad state.
That Tepooet wsis made, I think, over two
yeare ago,. and until quite lately nothing had
been doue. This Aimerican firrn was sent
down to, the Printing Bureau alfter t.he cornmittee's report was made, or aiter a great
deal of their work had heen done. The
comrnittee's findiings were pointed, out to
the membere of the Amreric-an fi.rr, and they
went down and questioned the men i the
Buireau-and there are a lot of good men
in the Printing Bureau.. They sucked the
brains o! those men. Then the Government,
in thie Order in Council, give them. full
credit for everything that has been done in
connection with the Printing Bureau, that
is saving $500,000 a year and will go on te
save ariother S200,000, making a total saving
o! $700,000. No credit whatever. in any
shape, form. or manner, ie given to the
men who did the wotrk. Why sbou.ld the
Canadians flot be given credit for what they
have done? Why ehould this Germanu-American firm be given credit for the work that
the Canadians did do?
What is the cau-se o! the great unrest in
the Civil Servi-ce to-day? I think I need flot
clai-m to be a special advocate o! the Civil
Servant, for I amrn ot. I have always gone
on the principle that if mnen, or women
either, are flot eatisfied. with their positions
in the Rivil Service, it is open to, them, to
do as I did when I was not satisfied-to get
out.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: And ýcorne into

HNon. Mr. TURRIFF: But there is much
dissatisfaetion and unrest throughout the
Cjivil Service to-<lay, andAi has béen large]y brought about by the ernploying of
foreigners ta do this reorganization, which,
in my judgrnent, could have been a great
deal better done at home. I ar nfot in
favour o! appointing- a cornmittee of Civil
'Servants to reorganize the service. I arn
in dfavour o! appointing outside men o!
standing and ability, wvith a fair amount
o! bra ins, some common sense, and a considerable degree of courage. If you appoint

Hon. Mr. DOM-NVTLLE:

To Hull.

Hon. MxTURRIFE: Well, I think
there would be some fairly expensive
junketings: it is only human nature. And
these meni stipulate that for the reorgan:zation of the two departrnents they must
be paid for not less than twelve months;
so there would be $120,000 to the principals.
Then, the Government bas to provide ahi,
the cle-ks-to supply men from the various
departments to give them the necessary
information. What sort of reorganization
could they make if they did not have the
brains of the departmnents to assist them?
In view of these facts is the proposed reorganization by this flixn worth whîle?
The Minister of Labour, who la a member of the commnittee o! the Privy Council,
stated the other day that the bargain was
not definitely made; and. I arn bringing
these facts to the attention of my honourable friend and the Government in order
that they nîay look into the matter further
and (see if ;t is not a inîistake to employ
these odt.siders -when we have good men
at home.
While this is only a business matterand I arn dealing with it altogether ais a
business -natter-I want to say this to the
Government, from the political standpoint.
As I said a moment ago, there are 60,000
of our men sleeping in France. They died
for this country. Tîxere are in Canada
200.000 or 300,000l o! their rehatives-fathers
and mothprs and brothers, sisters,' wives,
and sweethearts. Do you think these relatives ivili take kindly the action of the
Government of the country that their men
gave their lives to save fromr being overlorded hi' Germany? A great many of these
people IVill not know whethcr Griffenhagen
is a Gern-n or not. I do not, but the
.,nme sounds very like a German one. I
know that some o! the men who are working with him are German Americans. Will

country, or helped to save it, take it kindly

would bring about such a reorganization
as would be a credit to the Government,
and, as this American firm shows, would
save to the Government millions of dollars
in the years to corne.
In order to prove what I say about the
work having been done in the ýPrinting Bure-au by this Canadian committee, let me
read a few extracts from their report, Nvhich
was printed, and a copy which w'as sent to
every Senator and every member o! the
House of nommons. It is a report that,
should be read by every member of this
bouse and every member of the other. It.
is an illuminating document and is well
worth considering, and if the recommendations cont.aiiied in it had been carried out
there would have been an end of the matter.
Right at t.he first they say:
General conditions In the Printing BureauThe conditions found to exiat in the Printing
I)epartnient, viewed from the standpoint of
commercial efficiency, niay be briefiy described

Whien these men point that out, would it
have been a very serious matter to remedy?
Soiething« lias been done along this line.
Last. year, or this present year, quite a

of the causes the Qoînmittee give are:
First. the publication of matter of littie or

In addition to the appointment of Ihese

the line of cutting down the expenditure.
They showed where printing couid be saved.
They showed also how the cost of pri-hting
had gone up between 1913 and 1917 from
$1,274,000 Wo$2,401,000. They stated that in
the printing cf the Civil Service List there
could be an annual saving cf $4,000; in the
Adulteration of Foods bulletins, an annuai

On the staff we find school-teachers. lawyers, notaries, doctors, a machmnist, a musiclan, a baker. and a dry-goods clerk. It appears
to have been used as a durfiping-ground for

You would think, honourable gentlemen,
that il. would be a simple thing for the
minister in charge of the department, if
he had any backbone, ta take that Teport
and just go to work and reorganize the
department and save a large amount of
money. But, while the work was done by
Canadians, the pay and the honour must go
te this firm from acress the line. They
instituted coniparisens between the work
done here and that dene in the Gavernment

That was the idea of this Committee. But
the idea of the Government is flot ta rend

I arn sure such information would be very

Bureau. Instead of that, the Government
must go down and bring up a firm who

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: They cannot be
reorganized anyway.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: In rnost of those
country offices there is, oniy one person working; sornetirnes there are two; but I do not
,think any of thern would have more than
t.wo or three. They could be dividpd into
classes. There -wouid be ithousands, for instance, in the dlase that sdil $100 worth of
stampe and -wouid get $,35 per annurn, I
suppose; then those that seli $500 worth;
those that sell $1,000 worth; and so on. IV
wou]d noV be necessary to go ta see one
of those men; they could just be figured
out in teni, fifteen or twenty grades accordinga ta their revenues. The chief work
would have relation to cities like Ottawa,
Montreal, Quebec, Halifax, St. John, Toronto, London, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon,
Calgary, and such places. The reorganizers
wouid have to visit these cities and cee
what wi>rk was being dane and how many
officiais were necessary, and they wouid
have to cut the staffsa dc>wn te the number
thaýt could do the work. I would not
expect Vo overioad the Civil Service with
work; you could not anyway; but you could

fairly eut down the number. That ie where
the work wouid be, but it wouid not require
a vear to do it but for the fact that there
is an aliowance of $10,0o0 a rnonth and
expenses in doing it.
My honourable friend the Minister of
Labour -laid a great deal of stress on the
statement that we had not anybody in
Canada with the necessary experience for
this reorganizing work. When the war
broke out we had nobody in Cariada with
the necessary war experience. In the last
fifty years we had two rebellions i the
West and we sent a saal contingent of
men to South Mfrica; but that was ail the
experience we had hadl. Now, what would
any man, wornan, or child in this country
have thougit of the Government if, in
August, 1914, when we neede&d our contin.aent for the war, the Government, had
begun to say: "Canada has had no experience; we have no0 men here who have hiad
experience in war; the United States had
a war with Cuba not long ago; they are
experieneed, and they are Heaven-born
artiste; therefore we will send to the United
States and .-et sorne German Americans to
corne over and organîze aur arxny, and lead
them in France and Flanders"? That wouid.
be just as Esensi ble, honourable gentlemen,
as what the Governrnent proposes to do today; it je just the came thing. When the
Ujnited States went into the wvar in 1917,
three years after we had been at war, what
did they do? We had had three yeare experience; did they' send over Vo us for a comrnittee Vo go over there and raise and lead
their armies? No; t.hey sent miiitary experts to Canada to find out from our miiitary people how we had done certain things,
and what mistakes we had, made; and
these military experts carne and got the
information, and they .were thus able ta
keep frorn rnking the mietakes that we had
made, aithough the United States made
m.any mistakes atter they got start.ed, as
every country had done. But that je what
they did.
Now, if this Griffenhagen and Associates
are such wonders they must have accomplishled great thinge in the Governinent
offices of the United States. Possibly they
put the Printing Bureau there on s good
foundation Eo that it can turn out t.he work
cheaply. If they h.ad done great work
in the United States, why did not this
Cornmittee of Council send over two or
three -men f romn Canada to see what they had
- done and find out if they had anything
new? TheUnibed States are a friendly nation
and would have been glad to give us any.

1 saw the gentlemen who were engaged in
the task of classifving the various positions
in the department, and I must say that I
was not iimpressed with their personality or
-with.the idea that they were supermen. WVe
heard a great deal about supermen before
the war began, and of a -certain nation
whioh, according to their foolish -newspapers, vias composed aknost entirely of

1 am surprised, I nmay say, that the honourable Mister of Labour should thinkl of

meration te themnse1veýs, would gladly jindertake the work of recastingc or reorganizing
the Civil Service of this country.
That the Civil Service needs to hae recast
and reorganized no one will deny. Even
niembers of the Civil Sérvioe themseivesthat is, certain mexnbers of it, mren in the
Civil Service who are devoted ta the Civil
Service and arixious ta do their duity-will
say it*ehould ha .reoast -and reorganized. Let
me tell hon<>urailyle gentlemen of this Houise
that there are a good rnany men in the
Civil Service who are just as devoted ta
lîheir duty, just an anxious ta perform. itheir
servicei in the best i.nterest o! tiheeountry,
as any mnan rwho sits within the wadlsI of this
Chamrber.
Hon. ?Mr. DOMVILLE.: And women too.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, end women
My always chiva]wo'us friend from
Rothesay (Hon. Mîr. Domnville) neyer îforgeta the women. I supposed t.he men embraced t1he woman: tixat àa why I did net
mention them specially. There are in the
Civil Service people who are faithful,
patriotic, and anxiorus ta do theiT duty; end
in the Service there are dirones. juist as
the(re are in a busy hive o! bees; and it
would 'be -the duty of the Commission, or of
anyone who was reorganizing the Service,
to see that that shouild haq>pen ito the dirones

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Put thein out of

-who is not wiling to wvork-and there are

they ware doing theiir duty ta their country.
Hon. MNr. FOWLE1I: You did not say
the ladies wvere raisin" big families. The
ladies in the Civil -ervice are flot allowed
to raise big families; they have to get out
o! the Service whan t.hey start in the

no sympathy with the people in the

which they are paid; but 1 have every
sympathy fo,-. the men who are doing their
duty, who are devoted to the Service,
and who, in sorne cases, are flot receiving
as *much remuneration as they should and
-have the humiliation of seeing other men
who are not doing their duty receiving larger
remuneration than they.,
Now, as I say, ail this work of reorganization couild -be done by a com'mittee
of the Senatte; but if the Governmcnt bas
not that confidence in the members of the
Senate to lead themn to pass that duty over
to the Senate, 1 say they can find in this
country, withiout goin ' abroad. men with
business sbiiity and business acumen %vho
ca-n reoirganize and recast these de partinents. We talk about Canada for Canadians; we talk about greater production
in our industries; but the industry bf
raising men is as important an industry
aq we have. and if wve raise men they
inust have employment,_ and we should
protect that employrnent hy not bringingmean froi abroad when wve have at home
those who are, capable of dioing the work.
The other day 1 qu.cte.d from the Classification to show that the Sergeant-at-Arms
o! the adjioinin- 'House was claiming aufhority over f his Chanmber, and in fact'over
the whole of the Parliament buildings. 1
apîpears in the

their diffes atnd what thev did, and I snpposed that course had been followed in
this case. But the C-ergeant-at-Arms of
the iHniiq of Commorrns assures me that

duties he performe4, and that this Clas5ification %vas made up by themn without
his being ccnsulted or asked about it. and
.,hat the flrst he knew of it was when herzaw it in print. In the interest of that
gentleman, Colonel Bow.ie, a gentlemnan fer
whomn 1 have the highest respect, and considerable affection and ret-ard, I arn very
glad to niake this explanation. 1 criticized
him and bis cond'ict as 1 did hiecause I
thought he ha-d presur.ned to take too much

jealous of Rny encroachment upon the
rights of this bo:Iy es if I had belonged to

explanation because I ivould not want the

I do not knov Nhether or not it is the

will fakze notice of the temper of this body,
nt least with reirard to this matter, and
by that will be able to judge of the temper
of the people of this country wifh regard
te it; because I imm sure if is flot in aceordance with the be.st Canadian thought

why at least eleven men are speciflcally

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK. What is the particular firtm the <iovernment is dealing with?
Hon. Mi. ROBERTSON: The Government,
as I explained somne few days ago, deai
with the Arthu r Young Company.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It deait with the
Arthur Young company before, but now?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Grill enhagen
and Associates, who were associated with
.Arthur Young and Company, are efficiency
engineers, whereas Arthur Young and Company was origins.lly a flrm ai expert accountants. While they are working in close
affiliation, we dealt with Young and Com.pany in regard ta the reclassifi cation; but in
the other matter the negotiatians 'have been
with Griffenhagcen and Associates instead
ai Arthur Young aud Campany.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: Arthur Young and
Campany are uaL. in any way respansible
naw if this arrangement goes throughP
Mon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I Lhink they are
indirectly interested. The hanourable gentlemnan framn Hamilton (Han. Mr. LynchStaunîton), who, -4 not in 'his eat,
urgently requested the other day that information should be obtained as ta the nationality of 'Mr. Griffenhagen. At that time
I assured the House that Mr. Griffenhagen
Nvas an American citizen, and I eudeavoured
ta gel. information an that point, but he had
leit the cit.y. I xnay say, however, that I
arn informed by the Civil Service Commission that Mr. Griffenhagen's father was
born iu the United States mnd was an
mericai cit.izen. &>o it ris quite unta.r
and unbecoming, I think. ta endeavour te
hitch up any German influences with this
firmi.
I -wili net further take up the Lime ai the
House in deaiing with this maLter, because
I t.hink, generally speaking, each ai the

6t15i

points referred te te-day, and dwelt upon by
the honourable gentlemen who discussed
t.hem, were dealt with when this matter wvas
under consideration a few days ago, and
that it would only be repeating largely what
was said at that time. The Government have
no desire other than te improve and render
as efficient as possible, at as small a cost
as possible, the neoessary public service for
the people of Canada, and it is believed that
engaging the services of a firnfi of expert
efficiency engineers who have men cornpetent and skilled and experienced in the
ivarious lines of investigation that will have
to be taken up, will be useful and beneficial
te the Service.

gentlemen, there are one or two phases of
t.his matter te 'which Rishould like to, draw
the attention of the House. Whatever may
be true af tihe ability ai individual Canadians, or a group that might be gat together ad hoc, sa to speak, to deal' with a
particular question, there is hxo doubt that
there is not in Canada any organ-ization
trained ' te carry eut work of this
The exarnple w*hich

hrs been given of printing does flot apply.
I a~m in entire sympathy with the inover of
th-a motion in his statement that the coinmittee of three expert master printers who
inivestigated :the Goiveinent Prinyting- Buriea'u deal.t vïtih it aïdjequlatiely and, owinig te
thqir knowledge of local conditions, did the
work better than it could have been done
by any outsiders who night be brought in.
But the art o! printipg in Canada is in a
very high state. Canadian printin£! in -ail
its departments is thiorouLhly good. The
Printing Bureau was an isolated institution,
not SEriously larger than, possibiy not so
large *as, the variaus printing estqbiishmentR with which those three gentlemen
were lhoroughly familiar. But the Civil
Service is an emi>loyment reciflirinLr srecial
org-anii ed focîlities and special experience
ta dea' wvith, and local men have flot such
facilities and ex-Derience.
Objections have beenï made ta the hringing in of persona from the United Stntes ta
do this work. It ic an accident that the
United States, to a greater deý,ree than any
other country, have oarried on the analysis
of business methads in L formai, organized
way, that can be applied from one industry
ta, another. But the art of auditinag and
keeping accounits is one in which, notwitbstanding the great size of that country, they
are away behind England. The consequence is that ail the princiuDal firms of

their finger tips. The application by Cariadians of the principles followed in other
countries might be just as good, but there
is a, great deal of Lime saved by ernploying
the experts who now have the information.
Whether you save money or not 1 arn not
prepared to say; nor amn I dealinz at ail
with the question whether or flot this firm
is the best available to do the work. I saw
some of these gentlemen last year in connection with the committee of this flouse on
the machinerv of -Government, and 1 arn
bound to say that in discussing with them
various phases of government organization
and administration 1 was verv much imnpressed -witli the extent of their knowledge,
and how thev had thot knowledLe at their
ingers' ends.' What -we in Canadla want, I
think. is the best we can 2et, wherever we
can obtain it to the best adv-antaLye.

to the advantage of Canada; and if ;e can
get persons from the United States who are
bettier Ilhaii ony otlhers, ore w-ho aire the îm<>st
available, we certainly ought to utilize their
services.
A great deal bas been said about Government departments. I regret that the honourable leader of the House bas not left
for the moment, as I know that hie is a
modest man. We have ?îow an absolutely
new department o! the Government which
grew out of the Hospital Commission, with
<wucih I 'ans teively oýoniecled, and I
amn perfectly certain that the honourable
leader of the House as Minister of Soldiers'
Civil Re-Establishment is in a position
from day to day, or from week to week, to
tell how the business o! that department
is carried on-its overhe-ad cost, the cost
of ts medical services, the coat of administration, the number of persons that hie
ha-s-as promptly as the head of any bank
or railway or any industrial institution in
Canada or the*United States cani tell about
his business. The system bas grown up
from very humble beginnings. It grew up
through the ability that Sir James brought
to iL, the way in -which his staff was selected, and the loyalty of that staff. But Sir
James did not îhesitate when there were
any question of organization. His department has a perfect system of accounting, a
system the sheets of which I took, over to
England two years ago, when I had the
honour to rep)resent the Commission at an
international conference. There was no
nation represented there that had anything
to compare with them. The perfecting of
that system was brought about largely
through the fact that from time te time,
whenever iL was necessary, ;Sir James employed an expert on accouniting, on organization, on administration. He found an

Honourable
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK:
gentlemen, I do not wish to take up the
time of the flouse much longer, but there
are in this question one or two things that
My honourable

the officialsz of the Arthur Youiig Company
were so far astrav in tlieir estimate as t-o
the time the work would take, and how
much it would cost, does nal give me confidence in lhem.
As3 fie miinister bas
stated, the Artbur Young Company are a
flrm of chartered accountants, and Mr.
Griiffenhagen and his associales were the
members of that company w.ho looked afler
fie industrial eiliciency work; but, as I
understand, the present position, if the Government m-ake an arrangement, il is with
Griffenhagen and Aesociates, %%ho are no
longer members of the flrm of Arthur Young
& Company. Therefore I think the minister should tell us what responsibilily these
men have behind tbemn. Nobody up ta the
present moment knows anything further about them than that Mr. Griffenhagen bas been an officiai ai the
Artihur

and
that

it would bo poeéible to build up a proper
Civil Service on business lines and to make
it thoroughly efficient. In Part I o! the
Civil Service Act, clause 3 deals with the
appointment of the commission, and clause
4 deal.s with its duties. Paragraph c of
clause 4 eays that one of the duties o! the
Commission shall be:
(c) to report upon the organization or
posed organization of the departments or
portion of any department or of the civil
vice, and upon any .proposed change In
organization.

pro-

any
sersuch

Then paragraph d says:
(d) to obtain the assistance of competent
persons to aBsist the Commission In the performa.nce of Its duties.

I consider that when xve passed that AcV
we put the whole organization and reorganization of the departments in the
handa o! the Civil Service Commission. 1
can find in the Act of Parliament nothing
that gives the Government power to set
aside the Act and the Civil Service Commission or to override themn by Order in
Council. During the war the Government
had on the atatute book the War Measures
Act, which enabled themn to override Acts
o! Parliament and to do aIl sorts o! things
by Order in Council; but the War Measures
Act has been iepealed and we have now got
back, I hope, to the position in which an
Act of Parliament represents the law o! the
land. The Government must abide .by Acta
of Parliament juat the same as any member o! this House or any individual in the
country. 1 do not see that Vhere is anything
in the Civil Service Act which permits the
ýGoverament to pasa an Order in Council
such as that khich I read to the House the
other day, taking the orgaanization o! the
service entirely out o! the banda o! the Civil
Service Commission, as iV is evidently the
intention te, do under this Order in Council,
and proceeding to reorganize the service
without any reference to the Commission.
I think that the ýGovernment should explain
the situation Vo the House and show where
they derive authority to act as they have
done.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemnen, I would like to go on record as being
in favour of the principle laid down in this
resolution, particularly as it appears froni
all the information obtainable up to the
present that 'the members o! the Government as a whole are not posted as to xvhat
has been done with this firmn who have been
brought in to reorganize our service. It
seems to me that throug-h too sublime a
confidence in advisers they are being led
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

soniewhere they ought flot to be led. As 1
.see it, the initial mistake was made when
the Government perrnitted the Civil Service Commission to go outside the aut.hority
confided to themn by IParliament. so far as
that authority was expressed, and, as the
honourable leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Bostock) has just said, to transfer to
some gentlemen from Chicago the duty
which Parliament had entrusted to them. It
seems to me that when the Civil Service
Commission were given charge of the outside service in Canada it was essential for
~them, in order that they might intelligently administer that service, to make themselves familiar with the conditions o! the
Service throughout the country. 1 know it
was rthe confident expectation of the members of the Service outside the city of Ottawa that they would do so. Instead o! that,
we find the Civil Service Conmmissioner'
taking no steps to post themselves, but entrusting the duty of getting in touch with
the Outside Service solely to a body of
strang-ers coming to Canada for a temporary purpose, as represented to uS, and, even
though strangers, being at no pains to make
themselves personally acquainted with the
conditions in the Canadian Service.
I.,peak as a business man with some knowIedge of and experience in the management of aff airs when 1 say the resuit is
precisely what any business man mîght
have expected-tha!t these strangers did not
make a proper classification of the outside
service; hence it became necessary to continue their services in order to correct and
apply that classification, and there la no
evidence up to the present time that anything like a complete job bas been ma-de
or that the classification will be of permanent value to the Service in Canada. The
other day I read in a newspaper which la
held in respect wherever it is known in
Canada, that the action o! the Civil Service
Commissioners and, of the Governiient novi
in entering upon the transaction referred
to in this resolution, la making of the Service "a collection o! atrophied automatons." It seemed to me that the description very accurately fitted the case, and
that, instead of having entered up-on an
era of Civil Service reform or iniprovement,
o! which we have been talkinga lately, we are
going as far as the legisiative authority
can go to paralyze the Civil Service and
reduce it Vo a level of absolute inefficiency.
I find the opinion expressed in this resolution :

1 have no authority to speak for the gentlemen -%hom I propose to mention, but it
is niy opinion that df the Government

would give similar authority to that conferred upon the firm of Arthur Youn-g &
Company in connection 'with the recent
Printing office investigation, to the permanent heads of the two departmnents now
about to be reocranized-the Deputy Postmaster General an the Commissiofler of
Customs-they would be found to be much
more capable than the whole of the elevenl
experts combined. Those experts are to be
put upon this job, if Parliament sanctions
the contract, at what seems to ine a most
improvident bargain. They are to be paid
$10,000û per month, or an average of close
to $1,000 per month per man for eleven mren
whom we do flot know; whose very namnes
we cannot get, no matter how diligently we
apply for them; the details of 'whose accounts while in the employ of the Civil Service Commission we cannot obtain-because
I myself have applied for themn here. Knowing that the return made to the Senate did
not begin to cover the emolurnents received
by these strangers for their services iii
Canada, but only covered one head of it, I
placed a motion on the Order Paper which
might have been answered in two d.ays, because I am sure the accounits wcre audited
and added up; but last Session passed
without any return hein.- made, and this
Session has thus far passed without any return. I am satisfied that the flrm of Arthur
Young & Company ran absolutely out o!
control while in the employ of the Civil
Service Commission; that they had that
Commission, and through them the Government, at their mercy; and that if this contract be permitted to be completed-if it is
flot completed yet, and no one will admit
that it is 'completed-the new firmn will run
absolutely out oyf control in this service,
and that we will have, as a resuit, jusi as
little efficîency as we received from the
classification, snd even a larger bill.
Somethîng- has been said about the reor-g7anization of the Printing -Bureau. I
think, it was the Minister of Labour whio
told us the other day that we 'would save
from $500,000 to $700,000 a year because of
that reorganization; and 1 wondered at the
Minister's complacency -when he told us
that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I correct
my honocurable friend? I read from the
Order in Council; they are not my ýfigures.

Hon. Mr. 'TAYLOR: I think, it is significant, honourable gentlemen, thalt when
i gures which, I believe, are in the Order
n Council upon which this proposed appointment is based, are quoted in this
Flouse, they are repudiated by the responsible Minister, who is one of the sub.'comnittee of the Cabinet.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I .beg my honcurable frie'nd's pardon; they are not repudiated; I believe them to be true; but
the hono'urable gentleman stated that they
were mny figures, -and nobody else's, and
that is flot the case. The figures are correct, I believe, but 1 did not compile them,
and did not announce them on my own responsibility as being a statement of a fact.

that I wondered at the complacency of a
Minister in tellinga this House that we were
to save $500,000 a year, or $700,000 a year,
through the reorganization of the Printing
*Bureau; because as far back as I can remeinher the condition of the PrintingBureau has been known to every person
interested in the subject. Two years ago
an expert committee of mnaster printers
made a det-ailed. report showing what could
be done with the Printing Bureau if the
Government, applied itsel1f to the task; and
th'l4h 'w'hat ould -be saved is es4irnated
at $500,000 to $700,000, we are given no explanation why two years wvere a.Ilowed to

in one week and that it was not neces.sary
to pay any large sum of money to any body

is very èood authority, that the resuits we
g"ot at the Bureau did net corne from those

presented, were very crude indeed, and
alimost impossibr'e; and that it was only
the brains supplied to them by officiais
adrninis-tering- the Printingc Bureau that
brought about the measure of reformn that
we have there now. It seemas to me cruel,
honourable gentlemen, that a recommendation involving this further huge expenditure shoudd be made, without any inquiry,
without even the knowledge of the Minister
responsible for reporting to Council, without
any precautions whatever to see what we
are coin.- to get for our money. The proposed expenditure is $1O,OOO a month, eure,
for salaries, with probably an equal amount

flot exist, until the Order in Council was
produced-and aise a very large amount,
in salaries of assistant clerks, in rents and
other expenses, representing an expenditure
of a quarter of a million dollars a year for
an indefinite number of years. It seems
to me cruel that that should be entered
upon in this haphazard way, without any
real knowledg-e on the part of the Governnient as to where this. step is leading us.
Now, in sf1l sincerity 1 mvo'uld urge uipon
the representatives of the Governmnent in

having an opport.unity of veting upon it.
There is no urgency connected îvith a contract of this kind, wvhich. is just about being

the inatter being formally laid before Parliaieiit for adoption-or rejection, which
I think it is not impossible would be the

Hon. Mr.

On eBctàcn l-anoiit. cf tax jhangel:
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As honourable gentlemen will see Ithis reduces the
taxation under the Business Profits 'Nar
Tax Act. By subsection 2 we are exempting 10 per cent instead of 7 per cent. The
tax at present commences ait 7 per cent;
hereafter it ivili commence at 10 per cent.
In the next paragraph 10 per cent supersedes 7 per cent, and 20 per cent as mentioned there supers edes 25 per cenit; that
is to say, there shall be paid a tax equal
to 20 per cent of the profits, whereas today we are imposing a tax of 25 per cent.
In the next paragraph:
'Upon any such profits exceeding 15 per
centum pier annumn and not exceedkng 20 per
centumn per annumn upon the capital employed,
there shall be paid a tax equal to 30 per centum of such profits.
Thiîty per cent takes the place of 50 per
cent. That is to say, we are to-day imposing a tax of 50 per cent, and hereafter it
will be only 30. The next paragraph imposes a tax of 50 per cent in place o! the 75
per cent charged at present. In the fol*lowing paragraph 60 per cen~t is im.posed in
*placeeo! 75 per cent. In the next subsection 20 per cent is substituted for 25. So
it will be seen that the policy of the Governiment is gradually to lessen the tax until
we reach a minimum.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Did my honourable

piaced on section 5 of ohapter Il of the
statutes of 1916, which is at present saint>what involved. A business engaged ini
manufacturing or dealing in munitions ol'
war cames under the tax.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Was -it - not subject to the tax before?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. Th*,s
simply carnies out the poli-cy fallowed before.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Making the provision rather clearer?
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As myu
haonaurable friend will see, the previous
legislation is very complicated. There was
sanie doubt as to its meaning. The purpose of this subsection is ta clear up the
statute on this point. Section 5 o! chapter
il of the statutes of 1916, the clause under
which that tax was imposed, reads:
5. The businesses to which ibis Act applies
are all trades and businesses <including the
business of transportation) of any description carried on, or partiy carried on. in Canada
whether continuously or not except:
<a) the business of any persan the capital

accounting period leas than fifty thousand dollars. other than a business whlch or twenty
per centum or more of which. Is or bas -been
the manufacturing or dealing In munitions of
war ar in materials or supplies of any kind
for war purposes...

I read that clause and found it difficuit
ta arrive at its meaning. Subsection 4 o!
the present Bill makes it much clearer.
That is ba say:

-a

Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOOK: Under subsection 9~

any business with a capital ai less than

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. -Mr. BOSTOCK: Why is this necessturTy eat iaal? Mhy shbu¶id 4his distintioei
be made as to the profits?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Be-cause

It seeqns to me that the saune resuit would

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; because doubt would 6tili have existed as to
what was t.he meaning regarding the 20
per cent of profits arising out of the -manufacture or dealing in munitions o! war.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Have the Government 6tili to collect taxes under this Act
of 1916? I suppose that is wba.t it nieaas.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHI3ED: Yes, any

as to whether we were entitled to colleet

On section 3-capital in case of merger o!
companies:
Hon. iSir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
simnply ta prevent water in stock of any
companies that may enter into a merger. It
places the muerging companies in the samne
position as they occupied under the
adpreviaus leg-islation, and gives themn the
Yvanta.-e ai any increase ai capital which
may be employed in connection with the
business. It is simply ta exclude anything
like watered stock.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I take it that it
is actual capital?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEI): Yes,
actual capital.
Hon. -Nr. BOSTOCK.

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Soie one called
my attention to the fact ýthat it is made
retroactive to 1916.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, because ail those companies are stili hiable
for more or less of the tax which has flot
yet been collected. It can only apply to
a company that has not paid its tax, or a
merger or groùp of campanies that have
not paid their tax.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But in making this
retroactive is 'the Government going ta tax
companies more than they were taxed before?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; the
law as it is to-day on the statute book, will
aRply ta those companies that have flot yet
.paid up. We must necessarily protect oureelves as ta those.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Supposing, in the
-case of a merger, that twa or three coinpanies have been merged, one with a capital of a million, another with two millions,
another with three millions, and the one
with a capital of a million hbas a reserve say
of another million; if, in making the merger, that reserve is taken in and stock is
issued ta the members of that company s0
that it practically brings the amount up

taxedP
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, that
is part of the capital, under the Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But that will work
a hardship. The reserve has not been
taxed as capital up ta the present, 1 understand.

You will notice, honourable gentlemen,
that the estimate of £14,000 is, fo.b. in
England, whereas the estimate of Taylor &
Company ie for the carillons complete and
installed in thle tower. However, there la a
great discrepancy, and we feel that there
may be some misunderstanding- in regard
to the latter quotation. While the -question
of transportation ha& to be taken into consideration, t-he estimate o! Gillett & Johnston is just about haîf of that of Taylor
& Company, and the difference suggests
the wisdom of caution in further negotiatiens.
The Chief Architeet, U;L. Pearson, who was
before the Commit-tee, spolte in glowing
termis of the wonderful memorial rooxn whieh
hie proposed t-o finish in the tower. The
inside of t-he roem is -to be finishled with
stone or earth taken from the battlefields
of France. There will ho, on the ivalîs

cont.aining- Uhe naine and ranx of every
soldier who gave up bis life in the defence
of the principles) which the eivilýized wcrld

Mr. Pearson, who ivas, present at t-he
nmeet.ing of your Comrnittee, said, while discussing this question:
What more fittlng finish could there be to
this mexoorial Chamber than the magnilicent
carillon proposed.

This, gentlemen, 'would lie the finishîng

that

visitors ta Canada iromr ail parts af the
world would want ta corne ta aur national

by the carillon.
It may be urged, in consideration ai this
report, that it is largely a matter ai sentiment. Well, honourable gentlemen, I can
agree ta that; but, alter ail, was it not ta
a large extent sentiment that called forth
500,000 ai aur cîtizens in defence ai aur
liberties? Is not sentiment a large part ai
aur national life? National sentiment is an
greatness.
national

Material wealth alone does not constitute
a natian's greatness. WVe need only ta recal
the great empires ai the past ta know that
their fame which has corne down in.histary
was not a matter of material wealth, but
rather greatness ai ideals and sentiments.
Music, art, paetry, science, scholarship,
statemanship-these are the thinga which
make for the greatness ai a nation; and if we
are ta have a strong national sentiment we
must pramote these things. whih, alter
ail, figure largely in the national patriatic
spirit ai aur people. It la my opinion that
the installation in the memorial tower ta
be erected in connection with aur national
capital buildings would be a fitting compiement ai that memorial tawer, inasmuch as
it ivould say to every Canadian that there
is a true national spirit in the Dominion ai
Canada. Since the Parliament buildings
have cost sa many millions ai dollars, it
seems ta me that the amaîl amount which
would be required ta instaîl a firat-csass
carillon, the best that we could buy, ta
complete the memorial feature ai aur tawer,
should nat be a deterrent in compariaon
with the large cost ai the builidng.
Another fact, ivhich I think the chairman
ai the Committee did not mention ta-day.
is that the architect informa us that the
tower will be ai such construction as at
present designed that no added expense
w-ould be required for the installation ai a
proper carillon, and that the tawer wvill be
ample in sîze and st.rength and ail other
qualifications ta admit ai such installation.
I therefore believe that the bonourable
members ai this House will at leasit adopt
the report, inasinuch. as it simp]y reommenda the desirability of*the installation ai
a carillon, and requests the <3overnment of
the Dominion, if they eee fit ta appoint
a Committee, campased ai members ai the
bouse of Gommons and of the Senate ai

Canada, tao take further int-o their consideration the question of the installation of a
carillon. Personally I hope that t.he desire
of the Gommittee in this respect may be
supported by the honourable members of
this House.
The motion was agreed to.
POST OFFICE BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. P. E. BLONDIN (Post.master General) moved the second reading of Bi 167,
an Act ta amend the Post Office Act.
He said: This Bill la brought before this
H.ouse in order to increase certain charges
which for a long tirne past have been inadequate and out of proportion ta, the cost to
the de.partment of the two items mentioned
in the Bill.
The first deals with the rate of registration
of letters. In the past it bas been five cents.
According lo the report of the department
that Branch hias been carried on at a loss
of hall a million dollars yearly. In the
Unit.ed States and Europe the rate for the
registration of letters. is tten cents. The
Department believes that by increasing our
rate from five cents to ten cents the cosst of
carrying registered letters will be met.
The second section deals 'wîth the rate on
newspapers. In ithe firat years ailter Confederation a privilege was granted ta the
newsqa,pers, which at that time had to face
a situation that does flot naw exis't. Daily
newspapers were smaîl; they had ta be distributed through a sparse and scattered
population, and advertisements did not take
the place they occupy in modern newrspapers
in assisting that busýiness. The last report
of t.he Post Office Department states that the
carrying of newspapers costs the country
from five to six millions, while the total
amount of money paid by the newspapers
to my Depart;ment does not exceed $261,000.
We are charging the people of *Canada 2
cents an ounce Rbr carrying their letters,
which means $32 for 100 lb., and for the
carrying of third-clasa: -matter $8 for 100 lb.
is the price also exacted from the public; but
ever since Canfederation we have been charg.
ing newsipapers only 25 cents per 100 lb. lIn
this we. have been following rat.her the
American Post Office system than the European or British system. It seema that in
Europe the principle is admitted that the
main busine.-s of the Post Office is to, sec ta
it that a letter is brought to the four corners
ai the -country in the speediest and cheapesit
way; the carrying ai newspapers and parcela being incidental. R think that whatever

SENATE
incidentai servicýe the Departnment chooses
to enter into must be madle ta pay its cost,
in order that the service of letters and postcards te the people of the country be flot
curtailed. If you look, at the reports of
B3ritish or European post offices, you will
see that the charge for the carniage of newspapers averages between 7 and 8 cents. They
are flot sent in bundies, as American and
Canadian papers are allowed to be, but nequire a starnp on each paper; and as a mnat,
ter of fact t.he mails are flot used -in Europe
or Great Britain for the purpose of carrying newspapers, it being too oostly; soi the
newepaper owners use the express, and they
have to, make their ewn distribtItion. In
Canada the department estimates that 60
per cent of the expenditure -of ýthe large post
offices and 60 per cent of_. the carrying of
mails on the railways is chargeable to the
newspapers. We would require two-thirds
less épace on any baggage or mail-car -if we
had not tJhe du.ty of looking after nemrspa pers.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: For letters, for
which we charge the public $32 per 100 lb;
while for the newspapers we are charging

I muiclt explain why I have not increased thp rate to a lnger extent than
I have don.c bv this Bill. The first proposai

ttates, wýho have hem? forced, in the face,
of a large defleit, to change their method
and increase the postal rates on newspapers. For the last there or four years,

they have reachied to-day a rate of Il
cents; but the 'v have miade this distinction, -which at first strongly appealed te

the administration of the .Department; but
it is my intention te have this rule strictly
adhered to in ithe future. I must point
out, however, that the United States, with
their large population. can try experiments
on new systema. The Postmasten General
of the United Statesq is dealing wvith a population of over 100,000,000, and the mails

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
General I would be giad if -the House of
Gommons and the Senate would. see their
way to fix the rate at five or six cents at
once; but t.his wouid mean that under
present circumstances you wouid put al
these ,papers of Canada out of business
immediateiy. I find, after long discussion
and after giving wjth my officers, the best
of my thought to this matter, that there is
only one way out of the difficuity: it is to
admit the prinicipie that the new'spapers
must be notified that in future they wili
have te pay a.nd shall be made te pay what
they oost te my department. The only way
is te make a graduai annuai increase as
is proposed by this Bill. This year the
increase is to one cent.; next year it wilI be
te li cent. I ho.pe that hy t.hat time the
conditions wvili have become more nearly
normai and that Parliament wiii be in a
better position te determîne what is the
exact amount that ought te be charged the
newspapers, in order that they may pay
the cost of transportation.

Everybody knows that.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The iast clause of
t.he Bill deais with the franking privilege
extended te iegisiatures. For the information of the Senaîte I should say that there
was a provision for the purpose of rendering
miore difficuit. the use or the abuse of the
franking priviiege of the members. fIt is
neediesa te refer to that provision; it has
been sitruck out by the other Chamber. This
clause deals with the priviieges which in
the pas-t have been granted to the different
legislatureis of the Dominion. The effeet
has been that the Post Office Department
has had te. carry ail the officiai matter of
the different legislatures. It is, I think,
sufficient to mention that fact in order to
appeal to honourable gentlemen that such a
state of aff airs shouid no loriger be tolerated.
With. these expianations, I move the
second reading of -the Bill.
Hon. L. McMEXN-IS: la there flot a very
large deficit on the carrving of parcels fromn
the departmentai stores by parcel post? la,
the revenue from that source sufficient to
offset the expenditure? It see.ms te be verv
unfair that these departinental stores shouid
get their parcels carried at the expense of
the public. Their parceis are sent at a very
low rate and are distributed throughout the
entire country. Those stores are in competition with the smaii storekeepers. It seems
to me that if -there is a deficit the publie la
payin, for the delivery of the parcels from
the departmentai stores.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN": The Department
considers that the parcel post service is
self -sustaining, and I must say that the
large deficits in the Department do not
come from thiat source.
Honi. W. PROUDFOOT: 1 would likze te
sav a word on the question of parcel post,

JUNE 22, 1920
because I have taken some interest in that,
and I would like to know if the Postmaster
General lias considered the question of increasin.. the rates o! parcel post. We all
know that a great injustice is done to the
storekeepers throughout the rural municipalitdes; and 1 find that, 'while increases
have been made in the salaries of postmesters in cities and towns, no, increase
whatever has been made in the ernoluments
o! those in charge o! the smali post offices..
As an illustration: Most of them are paid
by a commission on the stamps that they
sell, and in the course of their business
they are obliged to handle all the parcels
which. come fromn the various departmental
stores. I[t may be quite satisfactory to compel newspapers to pay an additional rate,
but why confine the increase to the newspapers? I think that where departmental
stores enter, as they do, into competition
with other businesses, they should be required to pay fair carrying charges. My
information is that the departmentad stores
do not pay sufficiently; that la, the Post
Office Department carnies a large proportion of the parcels at a continual bass. Possibly the Postmaster General cam tell me
if m.y information in that regard is correct
or not?

fi

to the Governrnent by the local mnerchants
that the parcel post rate should be inicreased. I think the principle on -wllich
the system was based was the reduction of
the cost of articles, and. any attempt to increase the present rate 'would not meet
with the approval of the publie. I think
it 'would be ini order, honourable geritlemen, to defer these questions for a few
minutes, in order that they can be more
appropriately discussed wlien *we go into

nearly $3,000,000. But I do flot regard that
as a surplus, because it is but fair to deduet froin that a proportion derived from
the war-tax st.amps, which I figure amounts
to about $6,000,000 of this year's revenue.
If the war-tax stamps had not beenl inexistence this year, the Department would

This Bill also deals with the subjeet of
expropriation. As honourable gentlemen
can very (%ell iinder6tand, extpropriation
must necessarily Ibe a Jfeature of carrying
out any projets of this kind; but, bescause
these 'projects are ail of a publie or 6emipublie character, and involve, the absorption oif individual rights, there i6 in the
Act a classification of thie purposes for
which iwater may Ibe acquired. There are
superior (purpoeeo and purposes that are
subordinate, and it -will be -clearly appreciated that we must acquire the inferior
properties for carrying out any large projeet that may be for the public service.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, ahi -of us, especially those of us fromn
the West, undersItand that the question of
irrigation is a very important one, and that
it is necessary to have our legisiation in
such shape that t.hose,%who have to deal with
the question may understand exactly what
their position is, and may .know whether or
net they have a proper titie te the waters
which they have to use.
My honourable friend ha& said that the
question of irrigation is more or lesel a new
one. lIn -certain parts of Canada irrigation
lias been carried on almoýst isince the time
of Confederatien; in fact, 1 think, befere
British Columbia cme inte Confederation
there was a good deal of irrigation wvork
done in the different parts ef that province,
aitheugh, of course, the work was not done
on t.he saine -large scale on which we are
doi.ng ît to-day partic'uiarly in Alberta.
1 do not va.nt to take up the time of the
Hoiiae unnecessarily, but I want to point
eut te my honourable ýfriend that there are
isomne very objectionable features in this
Bill. One is thatý-its provisions are retroacetive te 1894. 1 hope my honourable
friend wihl be able te -explaà,n to us why it
is neicessary te *adopt legisiatien ef this
kind. 1 think we are ail pretty well agreed
that is net a desirable kind ef legisiation.
a.nd that it zhould only be pasced in exceptional cases.
The mnotion was agreed te, and the Bill
wvas read the second tiime.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG'HEED moved the
-second reading of Bill 168, an Act te amend
the Irrigation Act.
He said: -Honourable gentlemen, it wil
be recaiied that some years ago, we placed
upon the statute book a generai Act touch'ing irrigation. Irrigation in Canada is
something no'vel, the -full development ef
whlch must be reached by experience.
Since its introduction eeveral large enterprises have been carried out involving the
expenditure of a very great deal of rnoney,
and it has been found desirable te secure
amnend-ments te the Act.
Interpretations %%bieh have been placed
on many of the sections of the Act have
st certain. doubta upon them and have
rather embarra-ssed the Department of te
Int-erior. It is therefore proposed. to amend
the general -A£t in order to give more
lucidity te the provisions aiready passed,
and under which we -have prpceeded te adminieter the Act. In fact, all tbe amendments are in a sense ef a technical character, se far as interpretation is concernied,
and iwould enly be -appreciated by those
hav.ing a knowmledg.e of irrigation. Inasn-uch as each setion deals with a peculiar
feature of the practical working eut of the
Act, I deem it unwise te enter inte any
iengthy expianation *as te the purpose ef
the Bill, except te say -that it is te make
the g-eneral Act more worka.ble. and te
give greater dacility te .projects ef irrigation uqien which capital hais been expended
in the West.
A very controversial point, and one upon
which more or less doubt has. been throîwn,
is the extenit to wthich the Crown may appropriate water for the purposes et irrigatien. The language used in the original
Act was intended te aive the Cro'wvn authoritv over ail available -waters in lands ever

'On motion of Hon. Sir Jamnes Lougheed,
the Bill was referred to the Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs, and Harbours.
PICTOU HARBOUR BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On -motion of Hon. 8ur James I.ougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 121,
an Act respecting the Harborur of Pictou, i~n
Nova Scotia. Hon. Mr. Murphy in the
Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hon-ourable gentlemen, at the reqquest of my
honourable lriend from Kamloops (Hon. Mr.'
Bostock) yesterday, I said 1 would obtain
certain information ini regard to thiG whair!.
It seemns that the expenditure involved in
-inaiýntaining the wharf exceeds the revenue
derived from ît. The revenue .lromn 1913 Vo
1919 amouinted to $3,388 and the cost of
Tepairs alone aimou-nted to $3,840. IV Geemas
that under the legisiation by which this
wharf is administered te coSt of repairs
muet noV exceed the revenue, a'lthough s.pparent.ly iV,has done so.
lt, la propoeed Vo make a transfer of tItis
wharf to the Dominion Government. The
financial statemient of the wharf on De.cember 31, 1919, shows that there was to the
credit of the wharef, or Vo the oredit o! te
Harbour Commnissioners, I pre6urne, the
.eum o! ç2ffl.25, and four harbour buoye of a
value of q300l; and that the estimnated value
-of the wharf was about $5,000. There is
S-43

no reoently approved valuation of the
wharf, the fig-ures which I have given being
approximate. IV is therefore noV such. a
public institution as is susceptible o! maintaining it&elf, so to speak; hence the Goverriment findis it neessfary to take iV over.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
f riend bas not told us whether thîs Government originally built that wharf, -or whether
it was buit by te Harbour Commissioners.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
built, I think, by te Dominion Government, and then a Harbour Commission was
appointed to administer it, and they have
heen administering it under the unfortunate
conditions that I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: So they would get
back the munificent sum o! $280?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That will
be carried to the credit of te Government
for future maintenance.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Those wharves were
all built by the Commisioners without any
aid from the Government, and 'they have
always been xnaintained without such aid.
The Dominion Government is really getting
a large asset, and the Harbour Commissioners had no liabilities whatever: in tact they
have some moneys eoming to them. The
principal reason, as I understand, why the
Government is taking over the supervision
of tItis Harbour is that a very large expenditure has been made to dredge out East
River near New Glasgow. That expenditure was commenced under the Laurier
Govem-ment. 1 Vhink nearly a million was
expended to make a ship channe]. I understand that large interests have developed,
and, as the houndary extends Vo New Glasgow. it 'was decided that the Department
should take over the whole supervision of
the harbour. and incidentally they get those
wharves. w-thieh are valuable a.ssets and
have noV cost te Government one cent.
Sections 1. 2, 3 4, and 6, the schedule,
the title,. and the preanible were agreed Vo.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
CRIMINKL CODE AMENDMENT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the

the Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill

REVISED EDITION.

SENATE
parently, Nwith respect to soie provisions of
the Bill, the Senate lias flot been -able ta
see eye to eye with the bouse of Comimons;
consequently there has been more or iess
disagreement as to these particular sections,
to which 1 shall afterwards allude. The
Bill embodies quite a munber of amendments, which affect many features of the
Criminal Code, and therefore 1 cannot deal
in a comprehensive way with the policy or
principle of the Bill, because of its 'beingvery largely a matter of procedure.
The first section deais entirely rwith definitions of Appeal Court, owing to legisiation
in the different provinces contstituting courts
of appeal.
There is a proposed, amendment ta the
provisions of the Code deaiing with firearms and unlawful weapons, enlarging very
considerably the law in that respect.
There is also, a provision dealing restrictively with the making of affidavits, with
penalties attached.
Then we corne ta sections 4 and 5, which
have ta do with the offences ta which 1
have referred. namely, the seduction of girls
between 16 and 18, the seduction o! jeemployees, and the 8eduction of
maie
girls of more tender years. We have deait
with those two sections on many occasions,
and 1 direct the attention of the Seriate ta
their having again corne before this Chamber ta be considered.
Section 7 of the -Bill contains saine elaborate provisions as ta betting. This section
is very largéely the auteome o! the inquiry
which was -made recently into the whole
subjeet by Dr. Rutherford, who was appointed a Commissioner for that purpase.
This section 7 may be said ta lie midway
between those who advocate say an open
door in regard ta betting, and those who are
opposed ta it entirely. I think a perusal
of this section will lead honourable gentlemen ta conclude that the public interests
affecting marais, etc., wili be well protected
under this section, more particularly as At
is designed ta promate the legfitimate interests of breeding.
An amendment is made ta the provisions
dealing with whipping. There is also one
as ta the unlawful wearing of decorations or
uniforms, growina out of the late war.
There are other provisions, perhaps o! a less
important character than those ta which I
have referred, dealing largely -with procedure. When we go into Committee we
can enter into the details of ahl those provisions.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 do not propose ta
discuss this Bill on the second reading, belion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

it better in
cause 1 think we can deal it
committee. I have not been able ta understand why subsection 2 of section 2 is inserted, caliing for the insertion after the
word "weapon- of the words "firearm, air
gun,' because the definition of "weapon"'
or "offensive weapon- in theCrîminal Code
includes bath of those terms; therefo 're euhsection 2 is -merely a duplication of words.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED- I shall
have that iooked into.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I wish ta cail the attention a! the I{ouse and the Minister ta
section Il. It reads:
Na warrant- or othier pracess shall be
664.
lssued In any province for the arrest or sumnrnoning upon a criminal charge of any persan
residing In another province without the approval of the Attorney General or a Judge of the
Superiar Court or of a County Court or of a
District Court. of the province where It Is
sought to issue the proceas.

When we go inta Committee I would like
ta have a pretty full explanation why this
section is inserted, and just what persans
are meant ta bie covered by it. To me it
seems somewhat ambiguous, and I fear a
certain construction wiil -be put on it that
strikes me as subversive o! what 'has aiways been a principle of our criminal lawthat a man shall be arrested and tried
where he commits the offense. If the section -means that a man may commit an offence in New Brunswick and be prosecuted
in lBritish Calumbia, and taken there ta be
tried, I abject ta it. I caîl that ta the attention o! the House so that honourabie
gentlemen -may consider it.
Hon. 6ir JAMES IOUGHEED: Wit-hout
entering inta an explanation of its application, I may say that this section was discussed at iength in connection with some
liquor legisiation that we passed, I think a
couple o! sessions ago, and my recollection
is that the Senate amended that by providing that the process should not be effective
without the consent o! the Attorney -General af the Province in which. the accused
lived. I think my honaurable friend from
Middieton i(Hon. W. B. Ross) was large]y
responsibie for urging an amendinent of
that character. I cannot recoliect at the
moment whether that amendment was
made, but I remember it was very iengthily
discussed in the Senate at the time.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 wiIi say this, that
when the Liquor Bill was discussed there
was a clause which. had a resembiance ta
this, and I endeavoured ta have it struck
out altogether. The amendment was nat

JUNE 22, 1920
mine; it originated on the other side of the
House. When we corne to deal with this
matter I want tîo discuss it f ully again.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If a crime is comrnitted in one province you cannot arrest
a man in another without the consent cf
the Attorney General: is that it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, you
cannoe prosecute 'without the consent of the
Attorney General of the province into which
it is proposed to bring the aecused from
the other province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In connection
with paragraph a of section 2, 1 want to
know if my honourable friend and the
Governrnent have considered the advisability of eliminating the words, "elsewhere
than in bis own dwelling house, sho.p, warebouse, counting-house or premises, or is
carrying concealed". I would think it
should be made a criminal offense for
anyone to have one of those weapons,
whether in bis house or on bis perscn or
anywhere else. Why should he be allowed
to have a "sheath knife, bowie knife, dagger,
stiletto, metal knuckles, skull cracker, etc."?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think there is
a gentleman in Toronto by the name of
Rosenthal who very much wished be bad
such weapons in bis possession a few
evenmngs ago.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
suggestion was made in the House of Commons t.hat it would prohibit a man from
having a collection of weapons. There are
many collectors who have a great number
of antique firearms and knives, and so on.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: But those are not
dange'rous, because they have become wholiy
unfit for use. I imagine, however, that rnost
of the skufl-crackers a fe.llow would have in
bis bouse to-day would be useful, and -would
be likely to be used. I do not see wby anybodv should bave any such arms in his
bouse, in his ceilar, on his person, or anywhere at tail. .It seems to me the sooner we
do away with allowing people to bave firearms and weapons of this sort, the eooner
we wvill reduce the criminality of this country. We bave many people coming from
foreign lands, Italians and others, wbo
are in tbe habit of carrying stilettos, and
wbo use those and other weapons in this
country, witb tbe resuit that the criminality
among tiiose people generally is mucb larger
on accounit o! the tact that they are allowed
to carry on in this country as tbey did in
Europe. I would strongly urge that those

675

words b)0 struck otit. aiid that the carrving
of any such we-apons anywhere be mnade a
criminal offence.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do I understand
that my honourable friend would be opposed
to a man having in his own home a revolver
for self-protection?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Would that not
be practically a broadcast advertisement to
house-breakers that they can go in witb
impunity, that tbey can be stopped by
notbing, that practically the owners o!
bouses would be "hands up"; that iso long
as people were forbidden to have revolvers
or any other weapons the housebreakers
would be sure to meet with no possible
opposition; that the proprietor would have
notbing that would bring any danger to,
tbem; that he would be an easy prey; thiat
they could go in and steal. and make
tbemselves absolutely at home in bis
residence, ransack everytbing, go away
wvith everything, and bid good-bye without
encountering any danger? It seems to me
that the spirit of our legisiation is very
different from that. A man in bis domicile
is a king. He bas a right to protect bimself.
The privacy o! bis bouse is bis own. It
seems to me that this is the bàsis of the
criminal. law that écornes from England, and
no man bas the right to break in or even
go into that domicile if the proprietor does
not want bim to do so. It is a very different
tbing when a mnan.is, at large in society. 0f
course, he bas then no right tobJe armed; I
understand tbat thoroughly; but Nvhen be
is ait home he is not to be deprived o! those
firearms required to protect the sacredness
of his home, and bis own property and
cbildren. It seems to me the distinction is
very wide.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUERT: lMy honourable
friend assumes that my proposition is that
the burglar oan obtain and carry firearrns
tbat other people cannot get; but rny proposition is that the housebreaker or the
burglar should not be allowed to have thern.~My honourable 1friend argueses if I wanted
the bousebreaker -to have a privilege o!
which I would deprive others. That is not
my object at ail. . ly argument is that
nobody should be allowed to have or carry
firearmas or other weapons.
Hon. Mr. BFAUBIENI: My honourable
friend is very candid about it. When a law
is paýssed it must be observed by everybody; therefore, when we solemnly in-sert
this clause in the statute, it wiIl ai, once

SENATE
forbid ail persons te carry fireariis-t-he
person who abides by the lar a well as the

persen whio breaks the law. Sureiy xny
honourabie friend's argument is flot offered
eeriously. My honourable friend knows
very well that the per-sons whio would break
into a house are those who would have no
regard for the law, but t.hat the immense
majority -of the people of Canada, are iawabiding, and have a right te protect their
domiciles 'against law-breakers. The Crimmnal Code has been -made for that very purpose-to protect the good people agauist -the
had. In my opinion the difference between
the two classes is, as I said. before, absolutely seif-evident.
Hon. L. G. ?POW;ER: I agree with the
honourable gentleman froen Montarvilie
(Hon. MTe. Beaubien). I dare say the
hono;urabie gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Beicourt) also agrees with the honourable gentleman f.rom Montarville as to the
correctnes cd the statemient that an Englishman 's home is hie castie. That is true in
a sense; but unfortunately nowadays our
people do not live in castles as a rule.
There is no chance either te raise the drawbridge oT let the .portcullis fail. If one
could do that, if one could shut the outsidc
world out co.mpletely fromn the privacy of
hia house, the viewof the honourabie gentleman fromn Ottawa might have something in
it. But that is not the ca.se. Our bouses
are flot like castles. in that respect, and I
quite agree that it wci.ld be a th-ing very
prejudiciai te sound sleep to have te go to
bed with the feeling that any burgiar or
murderer might get in, and that one had.
no ineans cf defending himself.

so we mnight bave avoided some of the discussion that has taken place. My proposition necessarily implied the impossibility

SECOND READING.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading- of Bill 165, an Act to regulate the Sale and Inspection of Commercial
Feeding Stuifs, Bran, Shorts,Midns

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this ie

Lt corresponds to

JUNE 22, 192
soine extent with the legisiation which bas
recently been passed regarding pure and
unadulterated food for human beingé. Ilt
is well known amongst breedere of stock
that a large number cf deleterieus feeds are
prepared and seld for stock feeding, and
the purchaser of a feed cannot tell how injurieus may be its effect upon his animais.
It îa proposed by thie BilI1 that hereaiter
the sale cf leeding stuf! s shall be largely
under the control cf the Mdinister cf Agriculture, who may enforce regulations regarding the analysis and registration cdf
feeds, and the safeguarde neceseary te insure that what is fed te our live stock shall
be cf geod quality. It surrounds the importation cf feeds with a like protection. In
a word, it insures, s0 far as is possible by
human ingenuity, that the live stock industry shahl be protected. This mèasure
has the streng support o! those who are intere6ted in the industry. My honourable
friend from Brockville <1-on. John Webeter), than whcm there is ne better authority, I1 think, in the fDominion, has expressed
himseif as very strongly endorsing the Bill,
and 1 shaîl be very glad indeed if he will
.faveur the 'House with a few observations
upon it.
Honourable
,Hon. JOHIN WEIBSTER:
gentlemen, I muet congratulate the Gevernment on the manner in which they have
risen te the occasion in intreducing Bill 165.
This is, in my humble opinion, one cf the
inest important and far-reaching measures
which this House has had te deal with
during the present session. The ordinary
man net engaged in the great industry cf
live stock production may net realize what
a serieus effect poisonous feeds have had
during the past five years in this country.
Legisiation was passed at last session for
the protection cf purchasers of feeds manufaetured by the large milling companies cf
Canada; but the definition placed by the
WVheat Board on the product that the millers
boughit from the elevators as No. 1, gave
the millers the epportunity te seli feeding
êtuffs as beîng cf the samne quality. But
ne pereon 'knew exactiy te what extent
nexious wveed seeds were mixed with the
bran. The resuit has been a serieus loss

a feed that had killed hall a herd, and I
sent il, te the publie analyet here, who had
it analysed and t-old me that it contained
five distinct tracesz cf poison.

The destruction of live stock affects not
only our domestic supply of milk, cream,
butter and cheese, but aiseo our expert trade.
It. causes a decrease in the returns to producers of miik products. In my section of
the -country dairying is the principal industry, and the farmers of that community
are deeply interegted in this particular Bill,
for sorne of thema have suffered severe loases.
In the town from which 1 corne there is heid
a weekiy Cheese Board, at which. there is
aoid within a iew hours' time at this season
of the year $160,000 worth of cheese producets. And cheese is only one product of
the milk supply. That vA11 enable you 'to
.unders'tand the situation and appreciate
hciw deeply these people are interested li
this legisiation. None of the farmers in
that comrnunity grow sufficient feed for
tfheir herds. They are cornpelled to patronize the feed stores, in many of rwh.ich these
poisionous feeds are sold as the No. 1 article, but they have found it is f ar from being
No. i.
I thinýk that on the board which will enforce the provisions of the Bili there &hould
be one practical veterinary who would understand better than the ord'inary individual
the importance and the rnethod of treating
cattie and hogs affected by those poisons. I
have myself abserved how certain herda of
milking cows are affected. First dysentry
occurs, then paralysis sets in. The resuit
is that alter three days you have a dead
cew. The hog is affected somnewhat differentiy; with him it is paralysis from the
start-and you ail .know what that means.
If any meinhers of this. honourable House
will take the trouble to read the report of
the analyses made *by the Public Analyst
in Ottawa, they will see that more than
one-haîf o! the sainples have contained
poisons. Therefore I think tha:t the Government should endeavour at, once to protect these who have succeeded iii building
up to ils present stage the live stock industry, one of the areatest in Canada to-day.
The mani who i& feeding- what mnay ibe t.ermed grade cattle, or coivs that are net milk
preducers, may not be so much interested in
this Bill; but those who are building up
the dairy industry and the cattie tirade cf
Canada and are proïlucing cows of the highYou
est standard are deeply concerned.
must rememnber that a cow giving 100 lb.
of milk every 24 hours consumes 3 times or
31 times the qjuant.ity cf feed that is consumed by the ordinary cow producing only
30 or 40 1b. cf milk a day; and in consuming that large quantity cf feed the cew is
three times more exposed te poison than

sENArE
shie -would be if she were being fed pure
gýrain. So I iiuist cong-ratulate the Government in bringing in this legisiation, for it
is one of the most important Bis that I
have had the pleasure Mf reading since I
have been a member of this honourable
body.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can the honourable gentleman tell us if the product from
those animais that eat that poisonous feed
is likewise affected?
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER. I think the effect
is shown in the infant mortiaiity of the large
cities ofCanada. I think that is the resuit.
Some of you honourabie gentlemen may
be interested to know that within a few
miles of the town I comne from we have one
of tihe most valuabie'herds in Canada or
in the world to-day; that is, the herd of
Mr. A. C. Hardy, of Brockville. He has
fthe honour of owning the champion inilch
cow of the worId. He has had the good
fortune to seil a cal! of that co'w for $106,000 to an American corporation, and in turn
last week bouguht a cal! for which he paid
$50,000. I had the plea-sure of looking at
that caif last Sunday.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What?
Yes, on , SunHon. Mr. WEBSTER:
day-I will be truthful. That man's cattie
are ail exposed to thowe poisonous seeds,
because he has to buy largely to feed his
cattie. There are 150 cattie in his herd; so
you can see how much feed he buys. That
is the sort of business that the people in xny
section of the country are trying to develop.
Where is this feed
Hon. Mr. BLAIN:
grown?
lon. Mr. WEBSTER: In the Northwest.
These noxious weed-see&is ali corne from the
elevat ors.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: You buy themr
mixed in bran. in miiiddling.s, or in shorts.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Do you
not crow any iioxious -weeds in Ontario?
lion. Mr. WEBSTER: Not in such large
quantities. In Ontario the grain is consumed on the farms on wvhich it is grown.
It doe-s nof. go ;to the- elevators at aIl.
We have flot enoughl for our own requirements.
Hon. Mr. W'ATSON: I notice that in the
discussion on this Bill in another place it
was stated that the inanitfacturers of miii
feeds in Ontariolion Mr. WEBýTSTriR.

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: The Northwezt.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: -that they objected to the elevator men flot being penalized
for shipping noxious weed seeds in car lots.

This Bill does not provide any penalty for
the man Who ships noxîous weed seeds in
car lots. It imposes a penalty on those
millers in Ontario Who buy thie noxious
weeds fromn the West and mix them up in
concoctions that kill the hiogs and the
cattie. of my honourable f riend. It will be
observed that the Bill does not penalize an
elevator man for selling noxious weed
seeds; it simply penalizes the miller Who
makes up the mixture to sell, perhaps in
Ontario. That is a point that we might
well consider.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is that
not provided for in the Seeds Act?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think you will
find that it was claimed in the other House
that the mutler could protect himseif. But
if. is a great mistake to permit the indiscriminate shipping of noxious weeds or seeds
for any purpose. The Government of Manitoba, realizing that fact, vould no t permit
a bushel of noxious wee.d seeds to be taken
from the elevator, even by the farmer Who
grew the s.eeds, unless the seeds were
crushed. Anyone who knows anything about
noxious wveed-seeds knows that it is almost
impos.sible f0 get a crusher fine enough to
crush them. It is a question whether we
might not weli consider penalizing anyone
selling these seeds for any purpose.
How can the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
separation be made?
Hon. Mr. WIATSON: These noxious weedlseeds are sniali seeds taken out of wheat,
oats, and barley in the elevators, and they
are bagged and sold by the carload to miilers4: and feed manufacturers who mix
themn with wvheat, oats, and bariey. As the
honourabie gentleman from Brockville has
said, many of these seeds are rank poison.
That has been demonstrated not oniy by
analyses, but by the fact that stock have
died after eating theni.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED inoved the
second reading- of B3ill 135, ani Act to aniend
Pie Railway Act, 1919.

679

JUNE 9-3, 1920
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in dealing wvith the Railway Act, I think it was
last session, Parliament, wit.hout appreciating the difficul'ty which to-day confronts
us, legislated so as to bring certain provincial tramways or -suburban railways within
the authority of the Government of Canada.
The situation which at present exists was
ziot discovered until the British Columbia
Electric Railway Conpany made application to the provincial railway commission
for permission te increase its rates. It was
then found that by the legislation of last
year we had included that road 'within
Domiinion jurisdiction. This Bill is designed te replace it within provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourablo
qeader of the Govemsnt -bas intimated that
this Bill appiies simply te the railway in
British Columrbia.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I did
nlot intend to put it that way; what I inten-ded to say was that 'this particular
railway was included, anIong others. At
the time the legisiation was passed, we had
in view the Quebec 'Central railway. We
passed the legisiation in general language,
and it has sinoe heen found to cover the
class of railway to which I have referred.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I am one of those
who are inclined to think it might be just
as well te have ail these raîlways under
the general Railway Act and under the
jurisdiiction of the Dominion Railway iCommission. Possibly, as the .extension tof
these lines goes on, on account of the
business that they will be doing with one
another, it wiIl become almost necessary
that they should he in the same position
as the steam railwayê. But apparently
this legislatien has been asked for, and,
as the Government have seen fit to agree
to it, I arn not going to raise any objection.

INLAND REVENUE BILL.
SEDCOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMTES LOUGHEED mnoved the
second reading of Bill 178, an Act to amend
the InIand Revenue Act.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, owing
to the dry legisiation which. has been passed, flot only hy the Parliament of Canada,
but alqso by many of the provincial legilslatures, -the long-settled conditions of the
hIland Revenue Depart.ment have been
somewhat dîsturbed, and it is necessary to
me.ke more ample provision than we have
on the êtatute book to deel with the various
branches of act.ivity in thet departmnent.
Additional attention wil.l have to be given
to -the manufacture of commercial alcohol
o! different kinds and the regulations which
mnust neoessarily attend the manufacture of
that clase of liquor. It iis proposed also to
pees further legisiation with reference to
the regulatiun of etilla and warehou8es.
This is necessitated by the legisiation paesed by the various provinces of Canada,
which in many instances required the abolition o! Iong-.established. warehouseff and
brought about a change in conditions.
It is likewise proposed by the Bill to deal
with the su<bject of tobecco, which la bécoming a commercial produet of very great
value in Canada. The Bil1 contemplates
making certain amendments to the existing
Act respecting the importation and the
regulation of the trade in raw tobacco.
When we go into committee, more ample
explanations cani be made o! the various
clauses.
Mon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourable
the leader of the Government has given us
somne explanation of this Bill, but 1 do flot
think hie bas dealt with what seems to me
the most important part of the measure,
that dealing with the manufacture of denatured alcohol.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
called that commercial alochol.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I did not catch
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 used
that termi to express what I meant. That
is what I had in mind.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCX: In the western part
o! the Dominion notices have been sent, I
underst.and, to ail the people hand-ling
gasoline and oul to be exceedingly sparing
in their sales. It is not et ail a question
o! the Imperial Oit Company or the other
companies dea1in-z in oit raising- the price
Hon.. !WI. DA.NDURAND.

of oil1, but they are t.rying to npress on
the public that they must conserve the oit
to the greatest degree possible. It iseems
to me it is most important for us in Canada
to try to find something that will take the
place o! oil, and if the manu!acturing of
alcohol can be done in such a way as to
make it commerci.ally feasible to replace
oil with alcohol, that woutd be a most
lpudable undertaking on the part o! the
Government, a.nd I hope would be sucoessf ut.

Hon. Mr. DOMVIILLE: 1 might supplement w'hat my honourable friend says. He
bas touched very lightly on the question of
oil. Why is it necessary to raise siieli a
dust over this question of getting oul when
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are fuît
of oit' Have they had any sympathy? Have
they lied any assistance? You talk about
alcohol: you cen get that out of potatoes or
cabbage, or wherever you can get rtarch. I
do not want to teke up your time more than
a few minutes. 1 am tcrld tbat in Montreal
the dealers will not sell oil now, but are
reserving it for the ships. Why not develoD
wbat oit we have? Must I plead all the tirne,
like Peut before Festus. to ask the Government to investigate and sec what we have.
In this respect we give the impression
abroad thet either our hands are tied by
some combination or that there is unwillingness to do enything in the matter. You
cannot get any other impression abroad. If
we want to devetop our resources in oil,
why do we not take up the question? There
are many things te be considered in this
respect; but with these resources right
under your eyes 1 have brought up the
question year efter year and have spent
a great deel o! time t.rying to educate the
country and te place be fore this honourable hody the suhject in ail its bearing-s;
yet there it lies dormant like a dead crow%.
Nobody even picks the bones. My honourable friend the leader of the Government
gave us great encouragement on a previous
occasion. I do not knoîv whether hie bas. the
necessary influence or not, or what hie bas
to do in order to get the question taken up.
Wbat have we to do te get this national
question taken up in some practical wayThat is the question. I would hate to tbink
that we have not talked about it sufficiently.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER. Honourabte gentlemen, in addition t.o what mny lionourable
friend lias said, I would point out that the
Imperial Oul Company bas from month to
month given notice to importin- «firms in
Quebec, where I live, that it would not

JUNE 23, 1920
furnish theni with any more oil. If there is
such a scarcity, and if Quebec cannot get
any more oul, the gas company will not lie
able te supply gas to their custorners. It
wifl be a disaster to sorne of the cihies if
they cannot get any more oul. This shows
the importance of the Government trying to
encourage our native oils as inuch as
possible.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Why in your
opinion do they not do if?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND :.-I may observe
that the Government is dealing with the
manufacture of alcohol for chemnical purposes. This recalls to my mind the fact that
when the United States fixed a date after
which alcohol could no longer be kept
thousands and thousands o! gallons were
shipped by Canada te the United States.
At first there was such a deluge of alcohol
in Montreal that the warehouses were overflowing. But the Government were made
aware o! that situation and required the
duty to be paid at the border and not when
the alcohol would be taken ont of the
bonded warehouse. If would be interestingte learn what quantity of alcohol was thus
imported into Canada after the United
States had prohibited the keeping of alcohol
in any shape or form. It would be interesting
to learn also whether or not the Government has kept its eyes upon that immense
volume of liquor from tihe United States
which was sent te Canada for use in chemical processeis. I put the question particularly because of my great concern for the
vîrtue of Ontario and other provinces, which
should be protected against the invasion of
that alcohol from Montreal. I do not know
where if bas gone, whether its course bas
been followed, but I know that carload aiter
carload came to Canada from the United
States-to such an extent that cars were
requisitioned as far away as the Gulf of
Mexico to enable the manufacturers o!
alcohol in the United States to save their
product by warehousing it in Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I amn sorry
I cannot give my honourable friend the
desired information as te the amount of revenue collected by reason of that unlookedfor condition that arose and to whic~h he
refers, except to say that the Governmnent
quite recognîzed the capacity of Montreal
te receive alcohol.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: They have iît
yet.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand that it has arrived there iii im-

measurable quantifieS, and so far as practicable a reason-able distribution is being
made in the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. CLORXN: Oh, oh.
The motion vas agreed to, and the Bill

it is true that for years past the department

money invested in that way is entirely lost.
An increased rate ineans that newspaper
readers from one end of Canada te the other
w.iU bie obliged- te pay very considerably
more for their papera, because the pubiahing- business is eimply a commercial undertaking, and if a newspaper cannot be made
to pay the publiahers wi'll net supply it at
the figures they have been charging. I
think almost every honourable gentleman
will agree that unless a paper is mnade to
pay it will very soon be diacontinued. Why
ehould we charge the newepapers an additional. rate while other commercial businesses througahout the country are being
eupplied, with the public service at considerably less than cost? It tnay hie in the intereast of the public that there should be
an increase in the rate, and that the people
who are eupplied wi.th papera ehould pay
that increase; but before we reach that
point weuld it not be well te consider if
,some other source o! revenue -cannot be
6ecured. I think such a source could be
found by increasing the present parcel post
rates, which at présent are very low. The
regulatiens show that the charge on the
parcel post is 5 -cents for the first Pound,
one cent for each additiona-l pound or fraction thereof up to 4 pounide, and 2 cents for
each subsequent pound up te Il poundG,
within a radius of 20 miles from the place
of mailing, irrespective of provincial boundaries; then, 10 cents for the first .Pound and
4.cents for each subsequent pound or fractien thereof to all peints in the province
in which the package is posted, outsi de ef
the 20ý-mile radius; and 10 cents for the
first pound and 6 cents for each additional
pound or fraction thereofHon. Mr. BOYER: I rise te a point o!
order. There is no question raised in this
Bill on parcel post; it ie just newspaper
business.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Quite true.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Newspapers go by
postal rates.

argument to show why thiýs House ghould
flot increase the rate upon newspapers
w~hi1e other commercial enterprises are

than eost.
The honThe Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
ourable gentleman should confine himself
to the section under discussion.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I thought 1 was
doing se, 'Mr. Chairman. I arn advancing
these ressonts as an argument why we should
not increase that rate.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The section
on-ly refers to newspapers and periodicals.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Quite true, but
I arn pointing out, as a reason why we
shoiuld not increase the rate, the position
we oecupy in reference to parcel poet. I
think -that is quite within t.he aubject under
discussion and bas te do with this particular
section.
Hon. '-%r. BOYER: But there is another
objection; this is a xnoney Bill; it is a
question of raieing revenue; we nave no
right te discuse it or amend it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: While we are
not in a position te introduce a morney
Bill, yet iehen the (JonTmons aends a Bill
te the iSen-ate we have a xight to consider
the money aspect of the Bill. ýWe would
have a right, if we saw fit, te reduce or te

us, as I understand it, fromn int.reducing a
rnoney bill, but once it gels lhere we cani
deal with it in .any way we.think fit.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: You cannot amend
it.
Hon. LMr. PROUDFOOT: I think we can
amend it. Certainly we cani, amend the
Bill that is before us, either by rejecting
it or by cutting down the figure. At~lea6t,
that is my understanding of -the situation.

Hon. 'Mr. MURPHY: H1e lias Wo
his point.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have now
given vou the figures showing Nvhat the
parcel post rate is, and if newspapers oould
bie carried in the saie way I would hope
that a change wouId be made in that respect.
I wish also to point out tio the Postmasitex
General that it was neye-r intended that,
the postal service should include freight
or express-carryiiig service, but that is the
position it is now in. We fin& that the
public mail service is i.nterfered 'wîth to a
great extent by carrying -a large amount
of parcel post business. A few yeaxs ago
one mail-oar was sufficient for almosi. any
of the lines in th-is -country, but we nov
find that rw.ing to thlat inoreased service,
brouglit about by the low rate, the mail
service lias become very much hampered
and interfered wiffi. As a mat-ter o! Wct,
the letters now, so far -as bulk la concerned,
occupy oniy a very smaîl portion o! the
space required to carry what is looked upon
and said to be the mail o! the country,
wbile the mail service in icarryiug the parcel
post at a very great loss. According to my
information, millions of dolars everey year
aie ,placed in the pockets of departronrtal
stores and mail order houses. That la un£air flot only to Canadian newapaper publishers, w-ho are interested in having theilr
papiers carried from one section of the country to t.he other, but it is also unf air to ainother very important clasa. of people--those
carrying on business in country stores in
the various provinces of Canada.
Certain difficulties arose a couple of years
ago in connection witih the carrying brade,
and es to the rates that were being paid to
the railway companies, and in 1918, throughi
the Domninion lla.ilway Board, the railway
companies- secured an increase in their rates
of 433 per cent; yet we find- that there lias
been no increase, in the paroel post rates.
There was an încrease o! froin 2 cents Ïto 3
cents on ordinary lettexs; but the complaint
is not so much in that respect as in the
ni-anner in Nvhich goods are carried by parce. post. The Railway Board in 1917 were
înstructed to make an examinsfion, and
they did -zo and made a report. We find
that by the parcel post, caps, hats, eand
other liglit. niaterlal. are carried from 400 'to
1,000 miles at from 16 cents to 22 cents ln
separate boxes, and the boxes containing
tîhose articles occupy -a spece o! two cubic
feet. To carry those articles by express
would coz-t et. le-ast 50 cents each. Then,

catalogues, which wveigh froin 4 to 5 pounds
each, are shipped to distributîng- points
eîther by express or by freight., and* the.re
handed over -to the post office autihorities
and carried by mail for 8 or 9 cents froin
that distributing point to any point
if
miles.
within ta radius of 20
were obliged
the mail order people
to send those parcels, by express they
woul'd have to pay at, lest 50 cents;
but inatead of that they Becure the service,
at the expense of thie cou-ntry, for less than
half what it would cost them by express.
That in itself le a discrimination against ou~r
country merchants, and in that respect it la
un! air. If the Post Office Departinent ia
oing to resolve it.self into an express coinpany, or a company for carrying freîght,
well .and good; then it should charge the
saine rates as are charged to country merchantis for a similar kind oi service; but I
say that the present eyetemn is an injustice
to the country merchants.
1 want to refer for a moment to reports
made by the Railway Board on the 5t.h of
July, 1919, and the addendum made to it
on August 29, 1919. Under the Order in
Couaicil whereby the arrangement was made
'for the carrying o! mail the rail-way coriparties were paid for a whole postal car at
16 cents a mile and for hal! a car at 9 cents.
The report made on the Sth of July,, 1919,
shows that a very considerable volume of
evidence was taken dealing with this very
eubject, to ascertain whether or flot the
rail-way companies were receiviflg proper
pay for the mail service. I find. in that
report that the Comnmisision used this expression:
Giving due oinederatiofl to the avereiges
involved and the eiuTInnt of judÂgmenlt concerned
ti dealwng with the question au to the Prcoper
,paffirtiVoetlon of the mail service Lni geuiei
e<osts, it woiitd appeair liot unroasoni-e that
the ra-te aecepted by -the board f or the kkLaed
exprs service in -the geinerfaul express judgment
shoid be adopted, tha.t is a rate of 34.7 cenits
for a full miail-car mile. It would appear also
.not unraaonable that the char~ges for the otiier
services set o.ut ii -the Order in Cou-nolft es
contalned in the reference ta the Board, should
be iunreased in each case -by the saie percobeas the 34.7-cent -raite repreemts over
the 16-cent rate.

So that on the representation of the railway companies the rail-way board, on hearing evidence not only on hehaîf of the railway companies but on behalf of the departnient, came to the conclusion that th.e rate
being pa.id to the companies for the railway
service was wholly inadequate, and they
recommended an inicrease o! more than
double ivlat it eost. I. do not know what

684 .SENArE
arrangement was subsequently made by the
Post fifice Department; but I gather fromn
this report, and from the fact that the railway conipamies were per-mitted an incease
o.f 4321 per cent in the ordinary carrying
rates, that they also received a very eonsiderable increase from -the Goverument for
postal service. If ao, why bas the rate flot
been increased for the parcel post service?
If that service was carrying for from 16 to
22 cents parcels taking up a very considerable épace, then why bas that rate noV been
increased? It Wequite clear that it 8hould
be increased. It iis only fair Vo, the country
t-hat peuple who are securing goods by parcel
post ehould pay thxe cost to the country of
carrying those commodities.
The Hon. t.he OHAIRMIAN: I arn afraid
the ' honourable gentleman is wandering
f rom the eection a1toýgether.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: No, he is flot.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: He bas wandered,
but he is back ag-ain.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not think,
Sir, considering my premises, that I have
departed from the proper rule of debate aV
aIl. I think I arn keeping myself quite within
the Une of my argument. IV ail goes Vo show
that if some commodity is not paying a fair
rate. then we should noV increase the rate
against the newspapers.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The honourable izentleman will understand Vhat that
is perfectly correct in discussing the principle of t.he Bill; but we nom, have before
uis clause 3.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFO;OT: IV is clause 3
that 1 arn trying Vo deal with.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I hope the
honourable gentleman will confine himself
Vo that.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I anr doing the
best I can.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
ig.ht. occasionally say -as to clause 3V"
Hon. MIr. PROUDFOOT: Then, coming
back to clause 3, 1 will cali the attention of
the Postnmaster General to the reason that
I have for thinking that he can probably
secure a couple of million dollars more oi
revenue. Parcel post packages certain!y
zhould not be carried at less than it. costs
the country to provide the service. I say,
therefore, so far as the Post Office Departmient, that these parcel post packages
should not. be carried at ail. The object of
the post office is the carryîng of letters
Hotn. 'Mr. PROUDFOOT.

and mail miatter. It was never initended t.hat
the Post Office Department should develop
into an express or freight, business such as
iV is at the presenit time.
Now, what injustice does t.he course
followed by the Department at the present
time do te the country merchant? We al
know that it is highly desirable that therE
should be country stores. Country stores
occupy a very peculiar position. They are
like the newspapers in that they are educational to the people in their own particular
section of the country. People meet there,
and as a rule wait for the mail Vhere, and
they discuss public questions of the day, and,
after tbey have received their newspapers,
they meet there and discuss the various
issues presented by the newspapers. The
effect of delivering parcels as they are
delivered to-day is toecut down the business
of these stores to such an extent that in
many places througtiout the country the
storekeepers have been driven out of
business. The country sterekeeper bas noV
the short hours that a storekeeper bas in
a town or city. Frequently you will find
the country sterekeeper running his store
14 or 16 hours a day; but under the present
system of the parcel' post bhis business is
diminishing, and, as I said before, many
have been driven entirely out of businesS.
Some time ago, when Il was a member of
another body, which had power to pass a
different kind of legislation, I was in favour
of imposing a municipal tax on the mail
order bouses in each municipality wvhere
they did business. Unfortunately 1 was noV
able te secure legislation of that nature; noV
because the majority of the members did
noV believe it would be good legfisiation, but
because of the fact that so many people
throughout the country received parcels
Vhrough the parcel post that the members
were afraid that such legislation might
affect them in securing votes. In this House
we are noV influenced at ahl in that wvay,
and are in a position to bring before the
country legislation unaffected and untrammelled and free from any restraint which
migbt affect us, if we were looking- for the
votes of the people.
Another reason, referring agaîn to clause
3, why we should Vax the parcel post
business is on account of the fact that the
people nrning- these businesses receive
cash on their orders as they come in, while
the country merchants are frequently
obliged te sell on time.
But there is a furt.her reason. I consider
that it. is not. healtby, ýnot good, business,
Vo accumulate millions of dollars in cert-ain

JUNE 23, 1920
centres, drawing that money, as they do,
aw-ay from varjous parts, of the country, and,
in fact, almo-st bankrupting those sections
so far as local business je concerned.
I do net desire, (Mr. Chairman, te %takzeup
yery much more of the Uime of tihe House
in dealing 'with clause 3. 1 want, however,
to make it as clear as 1 can to the Postmaster General tha~t there às a nieans of
securing nmore revenue. More Sevenue is
what the Government requires at the present
time. Knowing as we do the position which
tihe newspapers occupy at present, the bard
tîme they -have had in securing supplies,
and the tremendous expenses .they have
been put to, we should net increase their
expenses in this w-ay. Knowing, as we du,
that they are doing a good public service
ail -the time, much of 'wihich they are net
paid for, and iauch of which is. for the general benefit of the public, why should, we
increase, the taxation upon them' I know
from experience t.hiat in many paits of the
country ne-wspapers have gone out of business. They have done so eimply because
they have ibeen foreed out of d.t. The
expense of carrying on a news;paper iS. 80
great at the present time that many of
them, owing to the increased cost of paper
anid labour, have been unable te carry on
their business. Why should we -make their
condition worse than it is at the present
time, 'when we can readily secure far more
revenue from another source and in such a
way as to not injure anyone in particular?
Nobody can successfully oontendl that the
mail order businecs is an leducator of the
people. lIt is nothing of the kind; and. I
beldeve tihat the Postmaster General, once he
considers the question from -the standpoiLt
which 1 have at.tempted Vo place before hlm,
and when he -&ees that revenue can be secured in the way I have melntioned, will
see fit Vo miake the necessairy changes.
The otiher day, when this matter oame up,
I thoughit of bringing in. an amend:ment Vo
the Bill; but, after considering the matter
and. discussing it with the law clerk of the
House, I decided, as the emendment which
I proposed -would be an erntirely new subject, that I would net introduce it in this
Bill, and tihat the only way Vo accomplish
what I desired would be Vo have it initroduced in another House. I desired, however, to place the facts. before the House
ao that some relief mig.ht be gîven aloxig
the line t.hat I have mentioned,
Just enother word or two in conclusion.
If the parcel post delivery were placed on
a fait basis, and the mail order houses

685

wvere chatged rates in keeping with express
and freig-ht rates-t.he same rates that -are
ch-arged to houses distributing goods through
the festablished ohanneis of trad--the retail
country merchant would more ithan compete
with the mail order houses. But the mail
order houses et present have such an adivantage over the country merchant that lhe
cannot compete with them. My idea is
that the charges for this service should be
at an.y rate equal Vo the express rates; if
they were the country merchants would have
no rîght 4,o complain. But I »ay that nlot
only the country merchants but also the
newspaper people have a .right Vo complaiu
if the expense. of a service sudh as that Vo
which I have referred is charged .against
another branch of ithe business.
Hon,. Mr. BRADBURY:
affect the consumer?

Hoçw doles it

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do nlot know
that we have anything epecially Vo do with
the consumer at the present time. We ail
know that the consumer must pay at any
rate. The consumer paya every thing, se
fat as that is concerned. It ils only another
way of compelling the consumer or the
mail order house to pay their proper proportion cf t.he public taxation. My honourable friend aayr., "How does this affect the
consumer?" The consumer who secures a
parclel by post at half what it Bhould cost
is receiving an unfaîr advantage, and is
getting eomethmng that he lshould not get
from the public. If he ja receving a benefit
in that way, he certainly ehouid pay for it.
The resuit of the change euggested, in my
opinion. wouLd keep the people cf the country
where thieir money La.. namely, on the farm,
and in the 'villages and émail, towns; thus
these districts would be buit up, whîch
would be in the intere-st of the country at
large. I do not say my honourable friend
La responsible for the injustice which la
being done at the present tinte. It is possible that it is a resuit of the system wvhichi
-vas handed over Vo him when he took office.
But I think we should .remedy that condition, and in the meantime we should express
our disapproval qf increasing the Trates
referred Vo in clause 3 by striking it out.
Hon. Mr. RATZ: Honourable gentlemen,
I should like to ask the Postmaster General
a question or two. I understood, when the
Act in regard to the parcel post system wus
passed some years ago, that the Post Office
Department was called upon to pay eome
millions extra on alccount of it. If that is
the case what is the probable revenue de-

SENATE
rived fromn the parc-el post branche Is there
a ioss -or a gainl?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Up to the present
tiine the carrying of parcels has been a payin- proposition. The revenue derived fromi
it by the departmeint bas been greater thaii
the cost o! operating it.
I beg to, thank my honourable friend <Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot> for the suggestion he has
madle. I thought that he recognized. that it
would be impossible for me, even with the
best possible intentions, to meet bis wishes,
because it would mean an increase in taxation, which muist be taken up flrst by the
House of Commons. I should like 'to point
out to him, however, that the parcel-post
is not thse main business of thie post office.
It ie absoluteiy incidentai, just as the carryîng o! ne-wspapers is incidentai. As 1
atated yeaterday, the main business o! thse
post office is the carrying o-f letters in the
cheapest and, speedist way possible, even
to the remotest and poorest hamiets, -within
the four cornera o! this Dominion. Those
who have seen the soidiers in the tranches,
and have seen their eagerness to get their
letters, often prefering them to their rations, wiil appreciat-e what a letter means
in many homes in thie country. That is
why ail the energy of the department must
be directed firat towarde -that object.
The main object of introducing the parcel
post eystem was to reduce the cost of
living, and to permit people to bring certain
articles into their homes at the least possible cost of transportation. It was thought
that the post office, havîng a complete
organization for the transportation and the
distribution of letters and newepapers
cou-id undertake the service in the case of
parcels up to a certain limit o! weight and
dimensions without incurring any loss and
possibly et a profit.. It is very iseidom that
a railrway mail car is filled to i.s full capacity with the regular mails. There la aiways Gpare room, and ini the majority of
cases the requirements of tise parcel post
do not necessitate the obtaining o!f greater
space than we were aire-ady using. We are
using no additîonal help, and the distribution is made by our rural mail carriers and
our postmasters; without any substantiel
increase in cost to thse department. This
can be done so long as we do not ls czight
of the fact that there is a limit to the weight
and dimensions of parcels beyond whieh ws
cannot go. Il that limit is exceeded. the
Post Office Department will be turned into
an express department. I am firmly o! Ihe
opinion that it would ho a great mistakie to
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

follow the example of the United Stat-es i
increasing the weight beyond 11 poundas of
parceis to be carried by the parcel post.
As to icereasing the rate, I can only repeat that I think the intention of Parliament when the parcel post system -was instituted was to decrease the cost of living.
To-day *we have to meet the dlaims of the
local merchants, 'who think that they are
hampered in their business by the large departmental stores. On the other hand, 1
think there is a larger proportion of the
people of this country 'who would favour a
decrease ini the parcel post rates instead of
an increase. I would point out to my honourable friend that when the parcel post
system was instituted zones were established for the purpose of meeting the fears
of the local merchants, and, outside 'those
zones there is a considera-ble adivance in the
rate. For example, the rate of postage on
parcels xnailed in the Maritime Provinces
to the post offices within 20 miles is 5 cents
a pound; to post offices beyond 20 miles, 10
cents a pound; to post offices in Quebec, 10
ceiics; in Ontario, 12 cents; in Manitoba, 12
cenw.; and the rate increases *with the
weigh. of the parcel up to $1.32. This -was
a protection for the local merchant. The
manner in which this, works can be illustrateci by this fact, that when those large
departmental houss have to send, for example, their catalogues they do not use the
parcel. post at ail. Suppose that the T.
Eaton Company has a large bundie of catalogues to send, say to Three Rivers for distribution in that district; they -will send
that bundie first sby express to Three Rivers,
and then they will use the local post office;
but if they do they 'will be called upon to
pay thse rate that everybody pays on articles of the third class, nanisdy, 8 cents a
pound. I am at a loss to know how I could
refuse to anybody, even ito a departmental
store, the use of a post office which is available to everyibody. I appreciate ail that my
honourable friend has said; and, thougis
it may be that the present rates of the parcel post may ha-ve to, be increased in view
of the increased raiiway rates, bis suggestions will certainly receive on my part the
earnes't consideration which they deserve.
But if I have to raise the parcel post -rates
that will not have anything to do. with the
present proposition, 'because, minci, you, -we
have to meet a deficit of $6,000,000, and this
Bill aimns at the principle that the rate on
papers must be gradually increaseci t& 3, 4,
5, or 6 cents a pound, which we shahl have
to charge them some day if we want themn to
meet the expenditures of the department.

JUNE 23, 1920
Yest-erday 1 was asked what was the
g-reat source of expenditure in the Department, and I stated that the larger expenditure was due te the operation of the rural
mail routes. If you refer Wothe reports
of the Department you 'will see that fromn
1902 to 1914 there vere increasing surpluses
in the Post Office Department. They were
increased, froin $5,000 in 1902 to $1,300,000
in 1912. That is, the year when the rural
mail service -was established. It was only a
year or two a!fterwards that the Post Office
Department felt the result. If you follow
this table you will see that in the next year
there was, a decrease of $200,000; the next
year, $ 1,000,000; and in 1915 when the rural
mail routes were in full operation, there
was a de~ficit of $2,914,000. So I think I am
pretty near the truth when I tell this honourable House that the main reason for the
preseit deficit in the Departinent ia the
establishmnent of the rural mail routes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1s there any hope
of improvement in that respect?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Not for the present.
1 amn sure everybody will admit that it
would be very hard for me to stop the
operation of the rural mail wherever -a route
has been established. 1 have felt in duty
bound to be very careful not te open any
new routes unless the revenues and the
neceasities at the present Lime would amply
justify a.ny such àtep. For the present the
policy of the department is practically flot
to create any new routes untîl better conditions preva il.
The second reason for the increased expenditure in the department is that those
very saine routes which in 1915 caused a deficit in my department of nearly $3,000,000
cannot be served to-day without our having
to pay three, four, llve and in some cases
six turnes the prices that we were then paying for the carrying cf the mails. What 1
mean la- that in most cases the rural mail
contracter would at that time be satisfied to
cover the mail route for an annual paynient
of about $300, whereas you cannot get anyone te do it now for less than $700, $800, or
perhaps $ 1,200. We had Wo
relieve rural mail
contractors on account cf the chang-ed conditionis. The number cf those who have applied se far and whose contentions are being
upheld by the department is about or over
1,200. The third reason for the increase in
the expenditures cf my department is that
it is the departinent having- the largest nuinber of employees, and -consequently the one
most affected by the increases in the wages
of civil servants.

687

Hon. '-\r. PROUDFOOT: Before ieaving
that point, rnight I ask the honourable gentlement a question? You say that the rural
mail routes are costing. more money 1 amn
inforrned thiat one cause cf complaint by the
cf mail matter owing to the parcel post. I
rural mail men is the increase in the bulk
understand that la the principal reason eutside cf the erdinary increase. why they
want more meney for their services.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I would net like
Wo answer my honourable f riend without
making fuller inquiry, but my impression
ia that the argument cf the rural mail contracter is net a very good one.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: If the honourable minister would permit me, I would
be pleased to answer the honourable gentleman from Huron (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot>.
Five years ago you would have to, pay a
young mani W drive the mails $20 a month.
To-day you have te pay him $00. To get a
herse ahod five years age you paid 80 cents;
te-day you pay $2.50. For that horse's feed
you paid 5 years age 35 cents; to-day you
are paying $1.50 a bushel fer caLs. Five
yeara ego you boulght hay at $10 a ton; teday you are paYing $30. So iL la all along
the lime. That accounts for the increase.

a ti'me when the expense of the rural mail
delàvery was, as the minister has pointed
'out, only one-third or en-quarter of what
îît is at -the present time. But the point I
want to malte is this, thst ruiral mail delivery is not as neessary to-day as it was
10 years ago. 1 have heard numbers of men
on free delivery routes say 'that iL was a
questionable advantage te .thema atter ail.
-In many cases ëhey lived halt-a-mile from

'put their letters in the box and geL .t.heir

àn

with
registered
leteters, beoause t.hey ihad te be there at
-the-time -when tee rural mail-carrier passed.
This mani also pointed eut that one man
would go into a railway town 10 miles o.way
and on his way back would bring mail
for three or four o~f hia neighbors. But
since that time there bas been a turther
great change, that ia, in the nuinber of
automobiles the farmers poesess. In my
part of the country where, rural mail routes
are in operation one-haîf the farmers have
automobiles, and they travel into the towns
during eight months ot the year, and.can
get their mail at the post office ivith just
&bout as much convenience es by rural
mail delivery. I arn merely pointing this
out to strengthen. my honourable friend,
Ys possible, in his argument for curtailing
that part of the expense, because it is P_
serious matter if rural mail delivery is
causing a bass of two or three millions ot
dollars a year. I believe the time bas
corne when ail those, sinecures must be
done away with. 1 believe that the people
who use the railw.ays for carrying freight
s*hould pay such rates as would make
those railways self-sustainin-g, and that the
deficit shouid not be charged on ail the
people et Canada. If any part <1f the post
office service ia not self-sustaining, that
condition should be remnedied as tar as
possible, se that the general deficit, which

war tax, would be -iade up. This amount
is tee much to ]ose in one department, and
it should be reduced by making the people
who get the -service psy for it.
Hon. Mr. DYANDURAND: There is semething very illogical in the whole system
that has been described te us. Large commercial bouses that want te' advertise their
wares issue catalogues; but, as they do
net like te, pay 8 cents a pound for sending
them threugh the mail, they ship them
by express te a certain point, and lrom
there use the mail for distribution te individuals. But there la a much easier and
more economical system than that. Instead ef publishing a catalogue singly, they
can publish it in a news'paper so-called,
and thus reach hundreds et thousands ef
readers and under tels legislation pay only
three-quarters of a cent a ipound. It seema
te me that when this la showvn the argument that is used te -enlist our sympathy
for the newspapers faîls te the ground.
In Europe, taking simply France and
England, a newspaper is a paper giving the
news, plus a sheet «or two sheets of paper
which centain political essaye -or articles
on varieus questions interesting, in,forming, and educating the public on
general topics and on questions of the day.
That ia a newpaper as understood in Great
Britain and France; it does net comprise
44 pages, but four, six or oight pages.
Canada has adopted the American system,
and prints advertisements of ail commercial institutions, private and public, and
forces our Government te carry that advertising at a rate which causes a deficit
et six million dollars a year. Now, we are
charging 8 cents a porrd to a mani who
wants te distribute bis catalogue through
the mails; why should we ailow hlm te
distribute it through the press at the rate
ef three-quarters et a cent a pound? We
are complaining because et a shortage in
the production et newsprint paper; but
if we forced the people whe carry on that
sdvertising industry in the country te pay
a proper. charge for carrying- newspapers
through the mails. I amn quite sure we
would reduce the use et newsprint paper
te seuch a point that the whole country
would be served. We have to-day heard
ef some newspapers in the West being

culation we would reduce the formidable
abuse of the mails by newspapers which.
run into 20, 40, and 50 pages on 8aturdaYs
and Sunidays, and wipe out 4that stupendous
deficit which the Postmaster General mentioned.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I arn surprised
ta hear the Postmaster General say that
the parcel post service pays its way. If so,
the 3-cent letters must be a very great
source ai income, because a parcel which
goes by parcel post occupying a space ai
2 square feet would take up the space of
probably 200 1tters. That shows a further
discrimination in favor of the parcel post
as against letters, because in the case of
letters the Department gets a revenue o
$6 and in the ather case a revenue ai 22
cent&.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: They do not occupy
the samie space in the car.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The epace in
the car is another matter. I think you will
find that considerably more space is taken
up in the cars now than before, and that
we have ta pay a good deal more to the
railways. I quite understand why the cast
af rural mail delivery has greatly increased,
and when epeaking I had in mind the
increase which rural carriers demand because af the parcels which they are required
ta carry. Formêly a man with a single
buggy could carry the mail for a number oi
places, but now hie requires considerably
mare space, which bas -greatly increased
the cost. Again, the postmasters in those
small places are paid by mere commission
on stamps sold, and get nothing for handlinga
those large parcels whieh corne by parcel
post. Therefore, notwîthnstanding what has
been said, the question might very well be
considered with a view ta placing the parcel
post on a reasonable basis, of paying in
proportion ta the space it requires.
Subsection 2 of section, 3 was agreed ta.
Subsection 3, as amended, was agreed to.
On section 4-parliamefltary papers:
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: T'hi@ section deals
with the franking privilleges, omitting those
that have been granted to the legisiatures in
the past, but not affecting the privileges of
the members ai either House ai Parliament.
Han. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would like to
know the Postmaster General's reason for
introducing this section. As a former member of a legislature, I may say that we found
it very convenient ta be placed in s
position, during- the recess, of sending out

!'

free of charge to our constituents the
prin.ted matter we received frern the departmnents. The withdrawal of that privilege
means that none of the matter now sent to
the members of the different legisiatures
will pass fromn their particular office or
homne, as it would côst them too much
money, and they do not receive suflicient
remuneration to admit o! their sending it.
As the circulation o! such papers is for the
benefit of the country at large and the
education of the people, I think the Post
Office Department might very well be
burdened with ttiat in the samne way as it
hs been.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I understand very
well that it is the duty ai the IPost Office
Department to carry ail papers of the
different Federal departments as a ma.tter
of administration, without chargîng anything; but I i ail ta see more reason for carryfree the literature and occasional papers
ing&
of the legisiatures than for carrying free of
charge the newspapers of this country. -It
means a very considerable amount of money,
running into hundreds of thousands of
dollars, and we may find it go higher than
that. I would point out further that my
department has received no recognition f rom
the legisiature af any province in the whole
Dominion for the servicee rendered, and
in spite of representations made ta the
dîflerent legisiatures that they should provide service at a fair rate for carrying our
le tter-carriers on the tramways, which are
organized by the province in the cities, or
whose charters are given by the provincial
government. ne action whatever bas been
taken in that direction. That is another
reason for the increase of cost in my department. I arn facing an increase af three, four,
five, or six hundred per cent in dealing
with the different tramway li.nes of this
country.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I quite appreciate that there is a great deal of expefipe
in that connection, and 1 have always felt
very kindly towards the department for
giving us the franking privilege during recess. I do flot know how At was arranged
for duringa tlie sitting of the House, but during recess, -when we received the departmental reports and other matter from the
departinents, it was af very great importance from the standpoint of enlightening
the people t.hroughout the province. AIthough the Provincial Governnents 'have
flot seen fit to do something which. they
,might very well have done with their railways, I do net know that that is a reason

JUNE 23, 1920
why we should now undo something -which
we *have been doing for many years for
the benefit of the Dominion at large.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: I do not understand that there are any franking privileges
to members of either House except within
ten days of the dissolution of Parliament
or ten days before. The Act provides that
ail bluebooke officially published *by the
Government go -free; Vherefore that je no
franking privilege. My honourable friend
misunderstood that.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The only criticism
I have to make on section 4 je that it
enables members of the Senate and
rnembers of the House of Comînons during the
recess of Parliament to send public documents free of charge. We have that raght
while Parliament is sitting. 1 do not ap.
prove of our doing it during the recess, and
1 would suggest that instead of ithe words
«'during the irecess "rwe ehould say "during
the session."
-Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: We repeal the old
law, less the part of it relating to the legislatures.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I have listened with
a good. deal of pati 'ence to the discussions
which have taken place on this Bill, and
1 think it only fair to say that it seeme to
me that the Postmaeter General has nmade
his case good in almost every instance.
Hie replies to questions have been clear
and satisfactory. and he has shown a
reason for everyt'hing that has been done.
I regret that the reform could flot be carried further, but I quite understand the
difflculty there would. be in raieîng the rate
on newspapers to li cents at once. Evidently the intention is to break it gently.

168, an Act to amend the Irrigation Act.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGJ{EED:
Withl
the permission of the House I will bring in
Mr. Drake, who is the officer in charge o!
this Bill.
One of the principal features o! this Bill,
which will be found runnîng through eeveral clauses, is that it je retroactive in
effect. As I pointed out yesterday, some
doubt has been cast on the interpretation
to -be placed upon the language firet employed when the Act was passed. Conse-quently it je desirable to mnake the !anguage, as we -propose embodying it in the
Bill to-day. relate back to the djate mentioned. I arn informed by the Department
that no intervening intereet has -been created, that no veeted right bas arisen, and
that consequently no intereet will be affected. The language employed je simply to
give greater lucidity to the principles which
we have embodied in the original Act, and
to give simplicity ini the interpretation of
the different clauses to which this relates.
On section 1-"Spring," included in waters
vested in the Crown, etc.:
Hon. Mr. BOSTO0K:- I do flot quite
follow my honouxiable friend in the statement he has made. This section sys:

section 2 of chapter 38 of the Statutes of 1908.
shall be deemned to have corne into force and
operation on the twenty-third day of Juiy, one
thousand elght hundred and ninety-four.

Section 6 of the Irrigation Act deals with
-property in and right to use water veeted
in Crown." Then there is a subsection,
"Diversion or use prohibited except in
exercise o! right.- That Act, I presuine,
went into force at the time it wae enacted.
0f course, I have the Revised Statutes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIiEED: The first
Irrigation Act was passed in 1894. For the
purpose o! illuetrating what 1 have eaid,
I would point to the statute of 1894, where
the following section will be found:
After*the paesing ot this Act, no right to the
pernmanent diversion or to the exclusive use
of the water In any river, strearn, watercourse,
lake-

and so on. In the Revised Statute that
ch.anged slightly, and in 1908 apparently another amendment was made. This
Bill further amende section 2 of chapter
38 o! the statutes of 1908. The only thange
that we make now is to declare that the
clause shaîl be deemed to have corne into
force and operation on the 23rd day of
July, 1894; that ie. when the original Act
was

w as passed.

J;ritish Columbia certain rights were granted previously which, under the Act, the
Government had really ne right to grant.
T l'en they passed leg-isiation which practictuIIy gave those rights a standing and put
other holders on the creeks in a very bad
position. When the Government had taken
the property in the water in this way they
undertook to say that they 'would take
water out of one watershed and put it into
another, with the resuit that the water was
taken and there was not enough lef t in
certain parts for proper irrigation. 1 think
it is a principle which should be recognized
that water should not be taken out of one
watershed until it is proved that proper
provision bas been made for ail the lands to
which that water is accreditable, because
in many cases it is impossible ta get any
other water for the purpose of irrigation.
That may be a question that cornes up in
the administration of the Depariment, but
it is sometimes a very serious one to individuals.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no analogy between the two cases. In the
province of British Columbia the water
'was vested in the Crown through the province. In this case the water in the original
Northwest Territory when the Act was passed in 1894 was vested in the Crown through
the right of the Dominion Government, and
the Act was made applicable only to that
territory. The fundamental principle and
policy of the Act of 1894 was declared in
section 4 cf that Act, which is as follows:

Hon. Sir JAMES ,LOUGIIEED: I read
the clause cf 1894. When the statutes were
revised, in 1906, eome'what different language was employed. A further amendment was madle in 1908. Se we have practically three clauses dealing with the same
principle wvhich, it was sought te embody
ini the law in 1894. Now we say the whole
body cf th-at law as laid down in the amending sections shall be in force- as cf the
time the Act was passed in 1894. What objection can there be te that, if there be
ne intervening interests, ne vested rights?
Hen. Mr. POWER: Dees not the leader
cf the Heuse feel that, in order te make
it clear that ne vested rights are being interfered with, there should be added, either
te this clause or at the clese cf the Bill,
somnething te the effect that nething in
this Act shall prejudicially affect rights
existing.
Hen. Sir JAMES ILOUGHEED: That is
the difficulty. Then someone may corne

different interpretation upon this, and mray

On section 4-applications for 'water, etc.:

by whîch 'preoedenoe wae given te the
rights in the lollorwing order: First of! ail,
domeetic supplies; second, municipal;
third, industrial; feurth, irrigation; then,
fer other purposes. It is ef-evident that
the supply of water for domestic censumptien by the 'population is mcst necessary.
Say a municipality desires to secure water
for water services. It should have the
righ t, even at the expense of those who may
have Ihad a prier right, te -abeorb those
prier riglits by compensation. That is te
say, euppose somne industrial institution
had come in befoTe the municipality -was
established, and controlled. practically al

On section '2--permit required for firearrns and certain weapons:
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND: Do the words
"ýpermit in Form seventy-six" refer to an
authorization or license?
Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: Yes. There
is now in the statutes a foirn for tbis purpose.
Hon. Mr. BOSTQCK: Apparently a distinction is made between "gýun" and "shotgýun- in paragraph aa-perhaps the minister could bell us whv? The proviso reads:
"Provided that no Bribish subject shaHl be
required bo obtain a permit with respect
to any shotgun no-w owned by him." But
the 'beginning cf this paragraph reads:
"Has in bis possession any cannon, machine ffun, rifle. -un," etc.
Hon.

Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think tbat would
be a hardsb-ip. There is bardly a settier in

for sbooting coyotes, wolves, etc.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: He can
get a permit.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: It seems to me tbat
shotguns and rifles oughit to be in the eame
class. Amongst British subjects the rifle
is just about as common as tbe sbotgun.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGJIEED: My bonourable friend 'wiIl see that if a rifle could
be used without a permit the purpose of
the Bill would be defeated. The purpose
is to prevent rifles f rom being imported into
the country.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: But 1 arn referring
to British subjects.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I know;
but in case of a tbreatened riot or rising a
great numfber of rifles might be irnported,
and if every British suhbject is entitled to
have a rifle without a permit the accumulation of those rifles ight precipitate a great
deal of trouble and d.ifficulty.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Not in the hands of
British subjects.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: I need
scarcely repeat what bas been stated here
before, that British subjects as well as
others are human, and under certain conditions their minds are inflamed just the
samne as those persons of other nationalities.
The policy of the Act is that no one shall
have a rifle without a permit, no matter
wbo hie is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Even if hie already owns one hie must have a permit?

When these sections were before this House

This House accepted the Bill and put that

5 and 9, as they did two years age.

Hon. Mr. POWER: I arn prepared to
support the motion 'which the honourable
gentleman from Middleton '«Hon. W. B.
Rose) says he proposes to make later. To
my mind the better way would have been
simply to have thrown out section 4; that is
my feeling about this matter. Any one who
knows anything about mef -in cities knowe,

It does not so strike mne, and I have this
feeling about it: I do not think that you

can miake people virtuous by Act of Parliament altogether; and when you pass legislation which enables perhaps an abandoned
woman to exercise what we cail blackrnail
towards a man, who is really not seriously
guîlty, it is a very undeairable kind of
legisiation. I think that young women over
16 years of age should learn fia take care

of themselves, and trust to their own virtue,
and not trust to the chance o! getting
damsges by levying blackmail on an unfortunate young mnan whom they have had to
do with. I think the law goes quite far
enough as it is now. It protects the young
woman Up to the age of 16, and I think
that is protection far enough. I know that
those proposed sections reflect the sentiments entertained by a good many moral
reform associations, but my experience in
dealing with such asociations is that in
trying te prevent one kind of mischief they
often lead ta other and more serious kinds.
I arn sorr that the honourable gentleman
bas not taken a vote straight on the amendment.
~Hon. W. B. ROSS: I entirely agree with
the remarks of the honourable member from
Halifax: I believe that it, is an entirely
viciaus and bad section. 1 gave my reasone

it?
Hon. uMr. POWE1R: Yes.
Hià. W. B. ROSS: I miii second that.
lHon. Mr. DANIEL: il would like ta cal
the attention of the honourable member
for 'Halifax ta the fact that this section
does nat apply ta the kind of girls ta whom
he refers. It refera ta having illicit cannection with a girl of previously chaste character between those ages-not a prostitute
or abandoned girl. I think that should be
taken into consideration. (But I do not see
any reason for the last clause:

be deemed to ho evidence that she wss not of

1918, 75 per cent of the girls committedl have
been between 14 and 16 years of age, and In

years, Miss Brooking flnds that an averagi of
75 per cent of the girls were demoralized lietween 14 and 16 years of age.
From Miss Askew. or the Edmonton Social

of the Home were led astray under 14 years of

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I think that this is
vicious legisiation. You cannot make people
moral by act of Parliament. To my mind
sumptuary iaws, are neyer effective.
Hon. 'W. B. ROSS: For I/he benefit of the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot), I want to read from the
Journal of the Empire's Parliaments of
April 20 the opinion of Viscountess Astor.
She said:
-that women brought into public and private
11f e a sort of moral courage which the men
needed. As to the argument about age. they ail
knew that women at the age of 18 were far
older and wlser in niany ways than the man
at 25. The people wbo dtd flot want women In
public life were too late; there were certain
reformes the women wanted. and they were golng
to get them.

And here a boy of 18 may be taken in by
a girlHon. Mr. MURPHY: Several years older
than hie is.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 think that the objetion of my honouiable friend to myroight
(Hon. W. B. Ross) can be overcom,3. I do
flot think we &houldgo back on the principle
of punishing a young -man who 6educes -a
young girl. Why should hie flot be punished? If we throw out this provision we shah.
be proolaiming to the country that the
Senate thinka that a young man who seduces a girl of between 16 and 18 years of
age should not be punished fox it. I cariflot go as Tar ae that. There is a good. deal
of truth in the statement that a young girl
of 18 is farther advanced in 'life, so to speak,
than a young man of 18; but I think it
woul«d be wise to carry thias etion, and that
when my honourable friend from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) introduces bis new
clause we should adopt it also. By doing
that I think we shall overcome the objection that some honourable gentlemen tseem
to have to pa&-sing this clause.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Just one word. I
would be inclined to accept the suggestion
of the honourable gentleman f romn St. John
in the case, of iseduction,. but the section
before us says:

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. I do not t1iink

are useless?
Hon, W. B. BOSS: No.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAN-D: Is the offence

Hon Mr. POWER: You seduce a virtuous

prostitute.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If you atrike

are useless.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: You are xight.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think we
should be careful to see how this affects the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like
to be, enlightened. I t.ake it that it is one
and the sanie offence.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Not at all. Illicit
,connection is, I m.ight say, a mere mechanical operation; 'but seduction is something
more: it is the act of inducinig a girl ïto take
part in an immoral act. I thj-nk the section
is bad in that it combines two offences. I
Every one over the age of elghteen years le do net agree that you need to change any

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; the
amendment stili reads "under the ag-e of

Hon. L. G. POWER: When a measure
similar to this vias before, this. House a
couple of years ago, the particular point
vie are dealing with now -was considered.
While there neyer had been any objection
te the latter part of the clause--that la, as
te parties viho in respect of their em.ployment or work are subjeclito the contcol or
,direction of the man and are in a cornmon employ-ment with him-the House on
that occasion feit that this clause, as it la
'worded novi, and as it was, proposed to be
worded at that time, would expose eny
householder to 'being blackmailed by a
domestic servant. And I remember there
vias some amusement created in connection
with that matter. We alI know that domestic servants to-day are noV in 'the position
in -which they were 40 or 50 year, -ago. They
are perfectly independent; it is, the master
and mistreas who are now dependent.
Every honourable gentleman knows that teday the domestic servants as a rule go out
in the eveninga, so'metirnes every evening,
sometimea every second. eveningHon. Mr. MURPHY: They would be better in the house.
Hon. MT. POWEIR: -and remain out until
10 o'clock or later; and they are nlot always
engaged in saying prayers vihen they are
out. To hold that the master of the house
is to be deemed liable for the mistake that
a girl of that kind makes is very unreasonable, and, as 1 say, it opens the door
very wide to blackmail. I think this is
really pernicicus legislation. It does not
apply to -quite young people; it applies to
women up to twenty-one.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I cannot see that
there is anything in this section to convey

On section 5-seducing female 8mployees:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I have an objection te this clause.
At first sight, the objection rnay seem verbal,
but if you look into it you 'will see that it la
really cf substafice. The section that you
have just deait with refera to "«a girl." The
section vie are now considering mentions
".woman or girl'." Those viords are not put
in there for nothing, I presume. A girl
presumably mneans a maid, and vioman presumably means a married. vonian. Whatever you can say-and ne doubt a great
deal can be said-in faveur of -some legis,lation for the protection of -a girl from her
employer, I do net see why you want legislation with regard Vo a married vioman. I
move that the word -woman" be struck out
viherever it occurs in section 5. Aflter a
vioman is married and has one or two children it is absolute nonsense to talk cf her

That is the view I take.

the meaning of it is this, that a wom*an

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This was

Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
the boarding bouse clause?
Hon. W. B. BOSS: It was struck out
altogether.
Hon. Mr. MeMEÂNS: This clause rwas
before the Senate laat year and received
very serious consideration hrom many honourable gentlemen, some <>f -whom spoke
for it and others against it, and it was
rejected by a large majority-I think 19 to
6. At that time I -took objection to the
clause on the ground that it made the
offence the regfistration. in a hotel. Evidently this clause is framed for the purpose
of preventing or prohibiting illicit intercourse between a man and a woman in a
hot-el. .Now, it does not make that act
itaelf the offence. As I understand the
law to-day, it is that there, is no offence in a
mnan goi-ng- into a hotel rwith a woman who
is not bis wife and occupying the same
roorn with ber. It is no offence in Canada
for a man to live iwith a woman to -whoým
he ie not maTried. It is no offence, for a
mnan and a woman who are not married to
go into a hotel or boarding or lodging bouse,
or onto a steamboat, or into a asleeping car,
but if a person enters a hotel and falsely
puts on the register that the woman i
hi8 .wifie, or that the man is he-r husband,
that is an offence and tihe p>erson convicted
of it is hiable to a penalty of $500 or 6

JUNE 23, 199-0
months' irnprisonment; whereas the man
.who takes a wornan into a hotel for the
same purpose and does noV register lier as
hie wife goes free. It does seem to -me Vo
*be ridiculous and un! air. If they 'want to
make it a crime -for a man Vo have intercourse wit.h a 'woman, who la noV his wife,
.why can they flot provide in that clause
that it shall be an offence against the laws
of Canada for a man to take a woman -who
is noV his çwife into a hotel for the purpose
of having connection with b~er. I wilI vote
for a clause of! that kcind, -but I certainly
do not feel like aupporting a clause like
thie, which camouflages the whole inatter.
There ia axothing to it, for I amn told that
'the difficulty in any Ihotel ie noV caused
by the.unmarried people rwho corne in and
register as man and rwif e; there le no trouble
caused by that class of ipleople at ail. The
trouble ie caused Iby the man who goes
into the hotel and gets a room, lias the
woman corne in and geV anothex room,
and -then goe from his own room into
hers. That je -where the difflculty ie; but
that la no offence at ail under thie section.
I night say further that this clause should
not apply to any case where a man and a
woman unmarried are living together as
man and wife and the woman le the reputed
wiie and the husband the reputed hueband.
There are plenty of cases of that kind
throughout Canada--cases in which peopie have been living together as man and
wife under circumetancesl over which they
have no control. Perhaps they ca.nnot get
married. There may be the question of the
legality of a divorce; or the wife xnay bave
become s lunatic; or the husband may be lu
mui, or in. the penitentiarv. These peoffle
living together as man and wif e may have
children. If they travel, they go into a
hotel and reg-ister as man and wife. and
corne one w-ho knows the circumatances rnay
go and lay an information against them,
declaring that the man is living at a hotel
with a woman who je noV bis wife. He le
immediately brouglit up, and then the onus
of proof is cast on him. I do noV eee anything Vo be gained by that. If I cen tfind
a eeconder I will iuave, as I did last year,
+hat this clause be struck out. It should
.ot be approved until iV is put into proper
!orm.

this clause covers the case of a large clase
of men who aerved in the army. They are
treated to-day, and were treated ail during
the war, as being- the husbands of the women they had been living wiVh prior Vo enlistment, and their wives were treated as
lawful wivee, and their children as legiti,mate chidren. Besidea tha-t, ail thie associations that took care o! the women and chulddren of tise soldiers treated these women as
if they were married, whereas there neyer
had been a marriage ceremony at ail. I
made inquiry as Vo how many cases camne
f rom Montreal, and I was told by tise Secretary of the Patriotic Aseociatiion that in
Montreal alone there were 180 cases.
Then those men went ta the war, and
they are home again-eome of them may
have corne home wounded, and eome witb
medals-and it etrikes mfe as absiird that
a man who hae eerved in thse war and has
been recognized by thse Government as the
husband of a wif e, and whoee wife and
children are recognized, il hie regieters at
a boarding bouse, ehould be flned $600.
I do flot believe in that. Then there le
the second clase t.hat ie very muais larger.
Tisere are literally thonsanas of people ln
this country who were rnarried and divorced, but tise divorce wae obtainex& on
residential qualifications, by living in tise
United 6tates for eo many inonths or yeare,
and tisey corne ta make a home in this
country, where that divorce le considered
as absolutely waste paper. In England
a man getting euch a divorce might be
arrested and convicted of bigamy, as isappened in a noted English case. You will
find people answering that description in
Ottawa, in Vise Parliament o! Canada, and
ln the provincial legislatures, everywhere.
who are noV fmarried, but who corne under
this section. In those two respects 1 think
thse section ie ahl wrong; and, besides that,
iV le absolutely useless. 1 asked a bote]keeper wbat value this provision would
be to hlm, and he said: -None at ail." He
said: "Mr. A cornes ta this hotel and registers as Mr. A and is assigned ta a room;
Mies B cornes and registers as Miss B and
le assigned Vo her room. There is notising
wrong witis the registration, but later on
Mr. A finds hie way Vo Miss B's room."
I say there je no manner o! use in draiting

hotel in that way. This legislaticri %vould
nlot fit many of the cases he has referred
to, and there is no intention that it should.
Thjs legi6iation is desired to a very great
extent by hotel keepers who want to
prevent thèir hotels being made bouses of
assignation. During the last few years
some of the leading hotels in Ti)ronto
have had a great deal of diffic.iity
with people coming there and registering
as Rman and wife when they were not man
and wife. While a man might go to a
hotel and register, and a woman might go
to the same hotel and register, and afterwards they might occupy the sanis .oom,
you cannot meet a case of that kind in
this Act, and it is nlot so intended. 1Iis
Bill is to prevent people from makirig
ufse of hotels in the way they do now. We
know that quite a number cdt people are
in the habit of going to seine of those
hotels, and the man will register the
woman who is with him as bis wi'e It
is Weprevent that sort of thing that this
legisiation is desired. During the last few
years certain hotels in Toronto took advantage of the card system, and where the
parties aroused 'suspiejous they insistecl c.n
having the cards delivered, with the resuit
that during that time the hotels succeeded
in turning away about a hundred different
couples. They are trying tW get at people
of that kind by this particular section, and
as far as I can see it will nlot affect the
returned soldiers or the man %vho desires
to go to a hotel in the way referred to by
my honourable friend. If he thinks that
if, would, even that difficulty could be removed by strinking out the words "to
whoni he or she is nlot married" in the
nineteenth line, and then going on to the
end of the sentence.

Hon. Mr. *PROUDFOOT: I oibWet te that

previou.s sections by increasing Vhe age of

I th.ink, as a matter of course, that tihe age
should also be increased in subsection 2

add some words whioh did. noV exiaL ini the

tisi particular section.
girls of tramn 14 Vo 16 we are dealing simply
with children; so why should a clause of th-at
kind be added? If you were dealing with
girls of a greater age, there might ber some
excuse for IL. For years Vhe law bas been
that it was a criminal offence to hiave carnal
intercourse wit.h a girl under the ags of
14 ysars, no matter whether shewas chaste
or net. The clause as il, stands deals not
on]y with seduction, but with the offence
of having camnai knowledgs of a girl who,
as Rf saîd before, may be. regarded as a
child. The qualifying clause 'has no place
in this section. Take, for instance, a concrets case. A girl et vsry tender yeare has
been demoralizsd. She is aipprehended and
sent Vo an institution, and is taken came of
for a couple of years. She receives considerable raining there, -and. is able, at
the end of that time, te start out again.
She is taken hold of by some of the =ien
Who had carnal knowledge o! her befome,
and she is again ssduced. 'She le stili under
the age mentioned in this section. Why

d1Jb

should not girls of that description be protected-ý
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Section 301 of the
Criminal Code is untouched. It proteets
girls below or up to the age of 16. IV remains exactly as it was. Under this sectiona new offence is constituted. This dos not
touch section 301, which .protects girls up
to 14 years of age.
Hon. iMr. MURPHY: Whether they are
chaste or not.
Hon. W. B3. ROSES: This new section deals,
'with a.nother clase of girls altogether. Under
the old Iaw 14 was fixed as beirig appmoxi-'
mately the age of Ipuberty. Ail girls below
that age were t.reated as being children, and
they are let t as much under this section.
Ail girls between 14 and 16, and some even
younger than that, have not ettained. the
age of puberty. but there are many of them,
Itaians and Serbians and s0 on, who corne
here, who are fully developed women. All
I say ie that if you are going te deal .with
them, deal with tihem on the same footing

Hon. Mr. PLROUDFOOT: IL is quits true
that you are increasing the age Vo 16, but
my contention is-lion. W. B. ROSS : I do not want te

Section 301 deals with girls up Vo 14 years

years, -and in the othez five years.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The question of
the years of punishment la not so important
as fixing the age up te which children will
be protected. I regard it as a protection o!
echildren, although my honourable friend

raising the age -from 14 te 16, because the
penalty is a severe one in any event.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I ehould like te
repeat substantially what was raid in connection with an earlier clause. As I eaid
before, everyone who lives in a city like
Ottawa or Montreal or Tarante knows that
there are numbers o! girls between the ages
of. 14 and 16 who are running about the

strengthen the position of those misehief
makers. It does flot even say that the girl
should have been of previous chaste character. Any man who offends with any girl

think thaýt is a mnost unreasonable proposition.
Hon. Mr. PROUD FOOT: Il! this amendment is carried, what protection have girls
from 14 to 16 years of age? It is intended
to, add to this section the words, -of previous chaste character." If that la done,
how is the gini protected. if she bas flot
been of previously chaste character? She
has no protection et ahi. I regard a girl of
16 as being no better able te proteet herself than a girl of 14; and 'when we have
increased te age of consent to 18 years. ais
we did yesterday, we should follow that up
by keeping the legislation in line, and increasing the age -to 16 yeara in this case.
The amendment of Hon. W. B. Ross was
agreed ta: yeas, 34; nays, 6.
Hon. W. B. ROSS nioved, that at the end
of the clauee the following proviso be ineerted:
No persan accused of any offence under this

subsection shall be convicted upon the evidence of ane witness unless the evidence of

sucb wltness is corraborated ln some rnaterili
particular by evidence Implicating the accused.

and I move that they be applied te this

The ainendment was agreed ta.
Section 9, as amended, was agreed to.
Hon. W. B. iROSS: As we are dealing
with sections 4, 5, and 9, I would like to be
allowed te go back to section 5. That is a
new section in substitution for section 213
ai the Code. It la not very long, and perhaps it would help us te underst-and the
question if te House would bear with me
while I read it:
Everyane le gullty of an indictable offence
and liable ta two years' imprisonment,(a) wba, being a set-parent or foster parent
or guardian, seduces or bas Illicit connection

That is a pretty wide section, and I would
have thought the provision sufficiently
drastic. I would not object to the section
at ail, with the exception of the use of
the word "wornan." Now you have section
5 of this Bill, 'which it is proposed to substitute:
(b) who seduces or has illicit connection wltb
any woman or girl previoualy chaste and under
the age of twenty-one years who is in hie erm-

ployment. or who, being ln a common, but flot

-and so on, the same as section 213. You
see, t.his is a blanket section. Though the
old one was very wide, stili it had Bme
limitations. This covers household servants.
What I would. suggest is thàt probably tihe
best thing -would be to adhere te the old
section 213. 1 move now to strike out

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: We will have to

have a motion to reconsider first.

Hon. Mr EUFOT: The great defect
in -the -section that we are trying to amend
was that it did not protect women in hotels,
restaurants, laundries, offices, or homes'
The new section does protect them; that is,
the section that we passed, yesterday by
majority vote, as it stands. To be reaJily
effective it should rernain as we left it

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What is the penalty
for the offence?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Two

The motion to reconsider section 5 wais
agreed to.
Hon. W. B. R~OSS: I inove that we strike
out section 5. That will leave the law as
it -is in section 213.
Hon. '-%r. DANDUBAND: But if section
5 was deemed by Parliarnent teo be a good
one for the protection of women under the
control of certain classes of exnployers,
whst harm is there in extending that protection to other ernployees or servante w.ho
are under the influence, direction and control of another class of employers, since
we have .already established the right of

Hon. M.r. POWER: The question of the
honourable gentleman .frorn De Lorimier is
periectly fair and reasonable-as his questions generally are, I night say; by the
change proposed to be made in the Act
employers who are householders are made
liable in case a domestic servant should
core to grief. As 1 said. at an earlier stage
of the -debate everybody knowa that, whatever may have been the case f ty yeas ago.
to-day the master and mistress do not control those who are their servants. The
domestic servant res.hly controls the position of the master and mistress, though
holding a comparatively inferior position.
Everybody knows that in these days domestie servants go out, somepf them every
evening, sme every second evening, and
rernain out of the house for hours. To say
that a householdoer shali be liable in a case
o! that sort simply opens the door te blackmail te a very considerable degree, and I
do not think that we should. do that.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: With ail deference to what the honourable gentleman has
atated. I think he is entirely wrong. One
would suppose from hie remarks that if a
servant girl went out during any evening
and got into difficulty the master would be
responsible; but that is not the claas of case,
that is meant; it is where a master aeduces
or has illicit intercourse. I-f protection was
considered desirable for people in workshops why not have it cover hotels, restaurants, laundries, and offices? Because-that is about aIl this section doesl. I would
draw attention te the fsct that we deait
with this section yesterday,. and withoiit
any new light on the subject-though I arn
net try-ing to belittle the re'rarks made by
rny honourable friend-why should we go
back to a section which we passed yesterday by a very considerable majority?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The motion
is that section 5 be struck out. I. think the
noes have it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No:- one minute. Yesterday I aéked the Hous te strîke out the
word "waman" where it occurred in that
section, anid I arn not sure that honourable
gentlemen understood that -motion. Section 4 deals with a girl, while section 5 deals
with a wornan. Now, you munst give some
rneaning to the word "woman" there as distinguished frorn the word "'girl" as used
in the other parts of the Act. The only
mesning I can attach is the wvord6 "girl of

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Honourable gentlemen, do you not thin-k that the cases
cited by my honourable friend as requiring
piotection under this Act are s0 very few
and the chances of causing a hardship are,
on the other hand, so great, that this word
-"woman"' if hef t in the Act would be rather
dangerous? There are very few married
women under the age of 21 who are in emphoyment, as compared- with the number
from. 25 to 30; and I agree with the honourable gentleman from. Middleton ý(Hon. W.
B. Ross) and also with the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mdr. Dandurand) that the -word "«woman" i5 s0 ehusive that it should be stricken from the
statute altogether. Besides that, I think
that the clause for the protection of the
man that has been, added to another section should be added also to this; that is,
that the word of the woman should not be
taken as absolutehy final evidence, but there
should hbe somne corroboration. Ottherwise
there would be great danger that a woman
employee might hlackmail her employer.
There should be some means o! protection.

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: T2he same

is, after the honourable leader of the House
gave the explanation, the clause was passed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I must
say, honourable gentlemen. although 1 have
charge of this Bill, that I do not think this
clause should be made to extend to a married woman. 1 think a married woman
should be able to take care of herself even
thougah she is in the employ of somebody.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

That is ail right.

Hon. Mr. POWER: As to the point of
order raised by the honourable gentleman

be remembered that the Committee decided
to go back and reconsider this clause. There
is no limit to the powers of the ýCommittee

Hon. 8ir JAMfES IOUGHEED: As 1
pointed out in introducing the Bill, this
clause is the outoome otf the inquiry made
by Dr. Rutherford at the instance of the
Government into the whole question of
racîng. It is well known that there are two
extreme parties, one seeking to strike a blow
which wouid mean total abolition, and the
other seeking- to maintain ail the abuses
which to-day prevail. The intention of this
clause is to do, away with booki-malcing, to

SENATE
have the pari-mutuel machines regulated by
the Government, and to compel them to
make such percentage contribution as may
be imposed by the Government. On the
whole, I think-I say it wîth a good deal
o! confidence-that it has received the sup:port of ail reasonably-minded personsthose who take a reasonable view as to a
sport o! this kind. -It 'is in the interest of
good horse-breeding, and I think it may be
said that, on the whole, it is in the interest
o! good morals.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I find myseif in accord with my honourable friend on thîs matter. If legislation o! this kind is not put through, the
ultimate resuit will be that all racing in
this country will be done away with. Bet<ing is, -[ think, one cd those things that
-ve cannot abolish altogether, and the best
way to deal with it is te see that proper
regulations are made. I think tha't the
dqovernment are te be congratulated on the
decision they have aýrrived at in regard to
this clause.
Hon. Mr. PPjOUDFOOT: In view o! the
statements made by the two leaders, and
of the evident intention on the part of honourable members present to carry this sectien, I will not trouble the House by giving
alI the reasons why many per8ons think

te offer te, it, for I have every ce>nfidence ini
t.he gentlemen who, prepared the -report on
which the Grovernment framed the Bill.
But it has been urged that Parliament
should not put this clause into. operation
until the racing associations have had their
meets. They have made their purses, and
they should have an opportunity te nmake
the percentage which under the 'preelent
arrangement -muet be taken out o! the parimutuel receipts. You can quite appreciate
tihesituation. Toronto -and, I think, Hamilton have had their raesf; Ottawa iis having
its races now; but at other places like
Niagara and Windsor the Tacing meets
have not ye't been held. They rwill have
to, pay >te the provincial govenent a tax
of $7,500 a day; and they have madle arrangements te pay that tax. If we -are going to legalize Tacing and permit racing
associations to hold meets, 'we o>ugfht to see
that the Meulations are fair, and the Governrnent ishould riait bring Vhis Act into
force until after these asso>ciations have
had their spring mee.ts which they have
advertised. I amn informed by people intereeted in -race tracks that on account of
the war there has b>een no racing for the
last four or live yea.rs; the race tracks have
fallen into bad repair -and thousands o!
dollars have had to bho spent 'to put them
into proper condition for the races. If racing is legalized, the person 'who are intereGted in conducting thern 6hould not be
penalized unfairly, therefore I -arn inclined
to think that the Government would be
well advised to delay the operation of this
Act until a! ter the associations have had
their spring meets. I hope that this view
of the matter wil bu approved by honourable members, and 'that we. may prevail
upon the Governrnent te delay 'the e>peration of the Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If it were brought

into force say on the Ist of October-

Hon. Mr. 'MURPHY: That would be al
rig-ht.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think that %vould
be alIl right. By 'that tîme mest o! the
as.sociations would have had their spring
anid fali mneets. The associations that have
advertised their races should bu allowed et
le.ast te hold their spring meets before this
legisîntion cornes into effeet. You can
eaisily understand that, as t'hey have made
if this legialation i4s enup their purse,
forced, tthey will be faced 11with treinendeus
lbases.

JUNE 24, 1920
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I might
point out to 'my honourable friends by 'way
of explanation that this clause is largely
the outeome -of an honest e'ndeavour on the
part of the Government toesuppress many
of those meete which 'would otherwise take
place bebween tihe present time annd the
date in October rnentioned by my honourable friend, particularly those held at
pjlaces adjoining the, American borndary.
I cannot speak with perso4nal knowiedge on
the subject, but I -have suggested to those
who seem to be very much in.terested in
extending tne time te permit of those meets
and the continuance ok-those abuses'that
they should see, the Minister of Jus'tice or
the departmnet charged 'with the préparation of tuse legislation. Tho&e, who approached mne on the subject promised that
that 'would. b, don,, but I have no't ye't been
favoured with any fuTther interview f.roqn
them on lhe question. I iar told. by an
honoura-ble member of this -House who has
an intimate knowIed-ge of conditions on the
boundary that the extension of the time for
the, operation oi this Bill te the, date propoeed would..simply lead to a continuarice
of the, abuses which hiave been a reprcach
to't'he people of Canuda for fsome time past.
Hon., Mr. FOSTER: Il my honourablé
friend who -advocates the extension of! the
time is really .diepoeed to be iriendly to
those who are interested in racing, 1 think
he makes a màstake for himseli and for
.thern. Since racing began in this country
there have been abuses 'which opened the
eves of hundreds of people in Canada who
would have been opposed 'te this legielation in the beginning if .they had realîzed
what it meant. If the people who want to
run race-tracke are well advised they wili
see that the maximum amount of the dishonesty and robbery that has taken place in
certain provinces ceases- and, t.hat êome protection is given to people who apparently do
net know how to prot-ect.ithexrnselves when
t.hey go to a horse-race..
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Honourable gentleThis
men, I amn not here as an advocate.
case was preisented to me by a former member of the House of Gommons, and it seemed
to me that his reasoning was fair. If the
Groverniment are going te legalize horseracing, as- they-are doing by thie Bill -and
as they have done by Acts .passed previously, it seemns to me that if the -legisiation is enforced at once it will catch only
a portion o! the associations who have advertised their race meets, and it will catch
them after they have repaired their trucks

711

and buildings, which have 'been unused
during the five or six yearis during which
there bas been no racing, and after they
have spent money in advertising. I am
not an advocate of horse-racing at ail, but -1
think it is only fair that ithose associations be treateil in the same way as others.
The fact that some of the associations have
met before this legislation is passed would
exempt them, while others would have to
pay the tax. They have made their purs-es
and advertieed their programmes on the
underatanding that they would -have to pay
the province o! Ontario $7,500 a day. They
have *based 'their estimates on that. -tut
now, on top of! that tax comes this legisiation, which will interfere with theii receipts by reducing thepercentage of profit
which. they may take from the pari-mutuel
betting. It seems to me th-at ail the raciiig
associations sh6uld be placed on an equal
footing and have the privilege of cariryinà
on the races as they have already arranged.
A% tio the abuses mentioned by the honourable leader of the Government, it seems to
-me 'that the law of the land should prevent
things of that kind. They are not legalized
by this Act. My only contention is that al
the associations should be put on an equal
footing.
H-on. Sir JALME LOUGHEFID: Would
my honoura!ble friend explain .why those
associations cannot operate under' the
clause which we are now con-sidering? 'They
have not yet paid out their purses; they
stili retain their properties, and il they
are continuîng they will have flot only the
advantages which this Bill proposes te give
them but ail 'the advantages which respectable courses operatîng under this Bill will
have. What is good for the associations
coming under this Bill should be equally
good for those gentlemen. I might say to
my honourable friend furtiiermore that, in
order that every opportunity may be givenl
for full consideration of! his suggestion, I intend not te move the third reading of the
Bill to-day, but will let it -stand until tomorrow or the next day. The parties interested can have a hearîng if there is a feeling in the House that they should have it.
But I cannot mysel! understand why a distinction should be made bet'ween the two
classes. If those abuses have been notorious and have been condemned by the evidence of the public,. as reported by the
Royal Commission appointed to inquir-e
into the subject, why should they be continued? No money has yet been paid out
by those associations. The purses are in

men, I want the House te consider serionsly this section il. On its face il may be
rather innocent looking.. Ib i.s familiar, I

law all over the country.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: When the Crirninal
Code was first consolidaled in the lime of
Sir John Thompson thal was changed, and
il was made possible, provided the crime was
comrnitted in Canada, te arrest a muan and
try him anywhere in the country. That

kind. Il bas become part of the life o! the
nation; and I lhink we are entiled te assume Ihat a law Ihat bas persisted so long
is weli founded, and is a round and good
law.
I have a suspicion as-le where Ibis section cornes frern. because it dates from the
time when the Doherty Act, so-called, was
introduced. If a man were tb seil a bottie
of whisky in the cily of Ottawa tb another
man. knowing that the other man was going

sold the botîle of whisky commilted the
crime and comp)leted it in the city of Ottawa, because t0 have commitled the crime
hie must have s'old the whisky with the
intention o! its being taken te Manitoba.
What the other man did after hie got to
rion. Sir JAMES LOUG(HERD.

Manitoba wvas none of the vendor's business; but the lemperance people ask that
hie be tried in Manitoba. There mighit he
cases in which that would impose great
hardship. It is just as well to understai
what that would mean. A man rnight be
arrested anywhere in eastern Canada and
be transferred teo Vancouver or the Yukon
or any place in the West for trial.
.a1 have always put this, queztion: suppose
taken te Vancouver and tried there and
fnund not guilty, how is he going to get
home? Frorn ail the information I have
been able te get, it would seem that *he
could only foot il home. Some temperance
enthusiast-and they are not ail of the
hi.-liest character, I arn told-goes to thie
Attorney Genneral or to a judge in the provirce of British Columbia, and says, "«We
vant le arrest this man." He. gets an
'Trde:r and sends a warrant down here, aitld
the mnan is taken te that province. Ht.e'
should n!ot be taken out there on the ord cr
oi a judge of a county court or any one 31se
out there; the papers should be sent dow!,

j'uag in the East, who can flnd ouit xviat
the man's circumstances are, where the
-witnesses are, and how the man is te get
home again. If there is going to be any
change irom the existing law, the fair thing
to do would be te provide that if a man is
te be transferred frorn Ottawa to Vancouver,
the transfer should be made on the order
of a judge.in Ottawa. In passing a law
such as Ibis you are only adding to government by Order in Councl-government by
a sort of back-stair influence. Il will be
just as bad as any tyranny Ihat existed in
the dark ages, and there will be n-o chance
of redress or of finding out who is aI the
bottom o! things and is putling the machinI would be satîsfled if

the warrant bas te be backed by a magistrale there. Is that correct?
at the present time?

JUNE 24, 19-20
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. But in that case
the crime is committed in Ottawa. I have
not the slightest objection to that. If you
leave the law that way, well and good: I
will accept i-t without the sligh'test hesitation. But you are turning that upsîde down
and provîding that a man shaîl go, not to
.the place -where the offence was conimitted,
but 'to a place where sorne tenîperance organization says they would like to have hlm
tried.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that we have a 8tatement lrom the leader
of the Government as to the reason for this
amendiment. So far, under our procedure,
we have been able to sen-d out warrants te
other provinces, have thein exidorsed there
by a magistrate, and executed. I quite understand the fear of my honourable friend,
from Middleton, and 1 should.1ike to hear
an explanation fromn the leader of the Goverrinent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: As I understand it, the 'laiw of to-day does not require the sanction of 'the attorney general
of axiy province for the issuance of a warrant. The consequence has been that warrants have been issued, say in the province
of Ontario, under which *mitn have 'been
arrested and carried to a fer western province, where tbey bave been tried and dismiséed, and 'from which they have to find
their way back. It la desirable for the protection of the public that that kind, of thing
should not Fbe done and that no <warrant
should be issued to tLake a man outside of
bis owxi province without the sanction of
some reliable authority within that province.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is what I <want.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: We propose to do that lin this waySome Hon. SENATORJS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn perfectly right. My honourable friend was
perhaps a li'ttle prern-aturely facetious. A
process is ibeing issued in this province, and
it should not he issued 'without the snction of the attorxiey general of this province, who will satîsfy himself that a prima
facie case has 'been made out against the
person against whom it la directed. It seenis
to me that that should be a sufficient sal eguard. If the attorney general ocl the province to 'whom application is made for
sanction is not a reliable persoxi, I do not
know where you will find a reliable person.
He surely is as -much to be relied. upon as a

713

judge. Tien you have the alternative of the
approval of a judge of the superior court,
of the county court, or of the district court.
My honourable friend transposes the whole
procedure. He says, the application mnust
be mnade in the province in which the man
resides. By the tirne that application frorn
a distant province reaches the province in
which the man resides, and by the tirne it
bas undergone the scrutinizing process, and
inquiry, there is every pro<bability that the
accused will have heard of it and, will have
disappeared. It seerna to me that the public
interest is best served 'by the procedure proposed in the section before us. My honouratble friend has not yet pointedý out
wherein it nfight be abused.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I underswtand that
under this axnendrnent, if it passes, a person living in Ottawa inight 'be arrested. under a warrant issued in, British Colum~bia.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHFEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: With the consent of
a judge.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He can be
arrested at the present tîme on a warrant.
Hon. Mr. BE-IQUE: Ncot for a crime cernmitted li British Columbia.
Hon. Si.r JAMES LOUGHEED: He can
be if the warrant is backed. That is done
perfunotorîly without any inquiry or examination beîng made. So this wilIl remove
what maight be termed an abuse.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Will the honourable
gentleman excuse me? Wben the crime is
committed in British Columbia; the warrant
is issued.there. If the man is here the warrant cornes down here and ie baicked to
take hlm to the place where the crime waa
committed. This section provides for something else. It provideB that a, person .may
apply to a judge in British Columbia for a
process to t.ake to that province !or trial
a mani who it ie said has cornmitted a crime
lin Ottawa. There le no use denying that.
1 have discussed thîs. question with the
temperance people, and have a.ked themn to
givea justification of this provision. They
say: "Unless you give up this power we
cannot impose -the Doherty Act; that is the
weapon that we want. He eo4d the liquor
lin Ottawa axid co>mmitted the crjime in Ottawa; but for the good of the peace of
Bri.tish Columbia we want to take hlm to
Manitoba to be tried."
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Was this clause
put in at the instance of the temperance
people?

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.

My

recollection is that in the liquor leg-isiation

which passed Parliament last session or the
session before there is a provision by which
this very th ing is done. I think there is a
clause similar to this in what is known as
the Doherty Act.
Hon, W. B. ROSS:- I.t is not the same -as
thia.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There should be
some very good reason for chang-ing the
procedure in criminal matters. What is.the
evil that this is supposed to recf.ifyP 1
have heard no complaints about the liquor
law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: Clause 662 of
the Criminal Code laya down the ordinary
procedure to be followed when one is out-.
aide of the jurisdiction of a justice of the
peace, 80, 1 cannot quite understand. why
this amendment ie now propoeed. To guard
againat the fear expressed by my honourable f.riend from Middleton (Hon. W. B.
Rosa), this clause *might be amended to
read thusa:
No warrant or other process shall be Issued
In any province for the arrest or sumnmonlng
upon a crixnl charge for a crimainai act cornmitted In such province.

Would my honourable friend from Middileton be satiafied with an amendment of
that kind?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I amn going to auggest to the leader of the Government that
he drop t'his section for this year. If it is
needed it can be brought up again with a
proper explanation fromi the Pepartinent
of Justice as to what it means and what
specific need there is for it.
Hon. rMr. PROUDFOOT: My honourabke
friend froin iMiddleton does not read -the
clause as J read it.. I take it to inean that
you still require fo iay your information; but
before you can 6end it to the province where
you are going to have it executed, you must
get the. consent of the attorney general, a
judge of the superior court, a counf.y court
judge, or a district court judge. That is additional procedure thait you have to take.- 1 do
flot think this, section covers anything more
than that. It is an additional safeguard to
prevent magistrates sending out warranta
in a way in which some people claim they
should not be sent out. After many years
of experience 1 have neyer yet iound any
hardiship arisi.ng from the issuance of a
warrant in one province andl the sending

order to bring a inan to trial. Suppose this
clause is passed, and if is necessary fo
arrest a man who bas committed an offence
in the cif y of Ottawa. You are required Vo
issue a warrant because he has gone acrosa
the river, absconded from Ottawa, and ia
getting away as fast as he can. Besides
laying the information and getting the
warrant, you have to hunt up the Attorney
General in Toronto, or geV the country court
judge-and he might be away-and in the
meantime the criminal escapes. That is
the great objection that I see to this section.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: IV is a pretty senoua one.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
withdraw the clause.
Section Il was -truck out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: At t.he
instance of the Departinent of Justice I
desire to insert another clause. It bas. Vo
do with procedure iinder the Secret Commissions Act. Under that Act prosecutions
have been taken against employees of railways, particularly conductors, who have
been charged with collecting fares and misappropniating the proceeds. tAit the iture that.
Act was, passied it was neyer intended by
the Governinent or by the Departinent of
Justice that a prosecufion should take place
under that Act, because it gives. no right
of election to the accused to be tried other
than summarily. Hence the amendment
is for the purposes of permitting trial Vo
take place as practically under any charge
of an analogous character which might be
made. t wi.ll read as fo>llows:

SENATE

-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: While
very mucli might be said in respect to the
proposition advanced by my honourable
friend, yet it involves so mucli consideration, and has ýbeen the subject of so niuch
discussion and deliberation in judicial
circles, as well as in legislatioýn in England
and elsewhere, that at this late-hour of the
Session it would be futile to attempt to
deal with a subject so important and comprehensive. 'My honourable friend from
Winnipeg (Hon, Mr. McMeans) during the
present Session brought down a Bill looking
to the revision oi sentences, 'which was, in
its nature, somewhat of. an appeal, so that
a sentence mightý be revised by the Court
of Appeal with the consent o! the Attorney
General of the province. The question of
appeal was at that time discussed at considerable length in this House, and i think
the consensus of opinion was that it 'would
be unwise to depart !rom the principle of
the great body o! criminal law as 'we have
'it to-day on the statute book. The subject
is entirely too large to be deait wîth in a
summary manner, as iA would of -necessity
have to be at this particular time. In the
United States the facility of appeal is said
to he largely responsible for the failure te
administer successfully the criminal law in
t'hat great country. It has been largely responsible for the delays, the failures, and
the many abortive trials 'which have taken
place in te most serious criminal offences;
and it would be very unwise if we should
introduce anything of that kind in Canada
without considering very fully the experience which other countries 'have had
in dealing with a subject so important. 1
arn very sorry to say to my honourable
friend that the Go-vernment at this late
date of the Session would fot give any
serious consideration to it. If a subject of
this kind -is to be properly deait with it
seems to me that it should be introduced
by te Department of Justice. The
ister of. Justice should be responsible Minfor
legisiation of so serious a character, particularly as it makes a departure from the
establisited principles of the crim'inal law.
Hon. Mr. IYANDURZAND:
I. fully agree
witit te conclusions of rny honourable
friend, but 1 rise te .remind him that his
memory fails him when ite says that the
Senate did flot approve o! thte Bill o! the
honourabie gentleman from Manitoha.
Hon. Sir JAMES ýLOUGHEED: We a4pproved of that Bill, but we did not approve
of an appeal. -as is, now suggested by my
honourable friend from Toronto.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

lon. 'Mr. DANDURAND:

The Bill does

Ilot go so far. It -bas reached te Commons,
and s we have not heard anything about

it, thougit it has been there six -weeks, I
arn quite sure that, titis proposed -amendment
would raise too large a question for t.he
Commons t-o discuss now.
The Hon. te CHAff-P.MAN:
Does the
honourable member frorn Toronto persist
in bis amendment?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: In view of what
te honourable leader o! the Goverrnent
has said, I -wiitdxaw the amendment, with
the consent of rny seconder.
Section 17, as amended, was .agreed te.
Hon. W. B. R-OSS:
I announced
that- I would move an amendment as
section 18.
It refera te sections 4,
5, and 9 of the Act. Rft ia a section
that was carried in this House two
years ago by *a very large majority. I
do not want Vo weary the House with it,
but I would say that section 301, dealing
with children, is left exactly as iL was; if
t.here is proof of the assault, that ends it.
There is enly one *party to that, namely,
te man, and. he is ;punimhed. Iu those
offences that corne under sections 4, 5, and
9, under certain conditions there may be
two parties to te crime, as there are two
parties te the act; and iL is quite possible
that in some cases iLrnay be the wom-an who
is to blame, although in the ma:jority of
cases it is te man. But there must be seme
way to guard against possible injustice.
Two years ago0 the House thought that a
very good vay te do that was Vo provide
tat t.he presiding judge should leave thte
matter to thte jury; and the section which
I submit to the House for its consideration
and adoption is titis:
18. On the trial of any offence against section 4. 5 or 9 of this Act the trial judge shail
instruct the jury that if in their view the evidence does not show that the accused is wholly
or chiefly to blamne for the commission of said
offence they may find a verdict of acquittai.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: I, do not -want te
oppose titis, but il do not think the wording
is quite correct. My itonou-rable frieind
mentions sections 4, 5, *and 9 of this Act.
As this Bill will be incorporated into chapter 146, would it not be better te refer to
sections 211, and so on?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No; that will ail be
worked out aft.erwards. This is definite as
it is now, and wvhen it is edited titose points
can be takin care of. This is identical

JUNE 24, 1920
verbally winhi what was voted by tihe Senate
t,,,o years ago.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not want
to object to what my honourable friend
frorn Middleton proposes, but it seems to
me the samne objection applies te this
amendment as to the amendment I proposed a few moments ago. If instructions
are to be given to a judge, they also should
bie deait -%vith by the Minister of Justice
and ehould bie 'brought down by him. I do
nlot like the wording of that clause, because it reads that the trial judge shall instruet the jury. I do nlot think we ehould
place on the statute books any words to
that effeot. Suppose that the trial judge
should not instruct the jury in that way,
then there voul bie a mis-trial, and the.
conviction, if there was a conviction, would
not be enforced. I think the section& as
passed are sufficiently safeguarded and
afford sufficient protection te the class of
people we are dealing with, And that it
would be a mistalte to bamper the trial
judge with a clause of that kind. I do
not suppose if, wouid amounit te anything
anyway. Nine times eut of ten a judge
in charging a jury would tell them practically what my honourable friend bas set
forth in that clause. Bo you are placing
on the statute book something which, 'instead of being use! ul, may do a very considerable amount of harm. I think it would
be very much better to let the legisiation
go as we have ainended it, 'without adding
to it a rider of this nature.
The word
Hon. Mr. DJdNDURk.ND:
"1shall," at all events, seexns te bie one that
might well be changed to the word "may."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I have no objection
to changin- it to "may." That will be the
only word in which the section differs from
that which we earried at a previous session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I amn a lit-tle
doubtful o! this rider, because it provides
that if the uuilt is shared te a certain .degree
by the other party, the offender is freed
from the responsibility of bis act. That
is what this in effect declares, and it would
Io a considerable extent, I fear, nulliiy the
effect of the three clauses.
The arnendment cf Hon, W. B. Ross was
negatived: yeas, 10; nays, 12.
Hon. Mr. McLFINNAN: Honourable gen-.
tlemnen, I inove that the following be added
te this Bill as section 18:

Section 216 of chapter 146, as amended by
section 9 of chapter 13 of' 1913, is arnended
by striking out. in Une 2 of the said section,
the word "five" and substituting therefor the
word 'ten".

This amendment met 'with the aoceptance o! the House when the matter was hast
under consideration. The reason for that
acceptance 'was that the penalty applied
te lesser offences was. five years, the same
as for the offences enumerated in clause
216. It seems te me that the lieuse last
year accepted the view that there was a
very great difference ini the nature o! those
offences, both as te the motive cf tbe individual and the effect on, society. Glaneing ait the headings of clause 216, you
will see that the effences punishable by five
years' imprisoniment are: procuring a girl
for defleinent; enticing a girl te a bouse cf
ili-fame; procuring a girl for prostitution;
procuring a girl te leave Canada for tbat
purpose; te come into Canada for that purpose, te leave bier abode for that purpose; camnai connection .by threats, by fal&e
pretenses, by tbe adminîstering o! drugs
for the purpose. These offences, are al
vastly more serieus tban the offences referred te in the clauses we bave no-w dealt
witb and passed. I therefore propose tbat
the difference in the anti-social nature cf
the offence be, recognized- in the penalty,
and that the penalty 'be net the saine as
now, namnely, fiv 'e years alike for the lesser
effences and for those far more odieus
crimes, but tbat for tbe latter class the
penalty bie made .ten years.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: For what crimes
is the penalty te be ten years?
Hon. Sir JAiMES LOU-GHEE: For white
slavery.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAIN: The effeet cf the

It seemas to me that we should be very
careful -in thtis, iatter. Times are very
strange. and we do not want te put any
obstacles in the way of the manufacturers
of this country. I am informed that if this
provision is carried it iwill cost the Tuekett
factory frein $60,000 te $75,000 extra per
year, and will -practically put them out of
business. I think a good deal of this kind
of legislation could be avoidied. if the Minieters understood what they were legislating
about. There are plenty ways of getting
information as te w'hat la proper legislation,
but it seems that somne people prefer to take
the responsibility on their own shoulders.
As hionourable gentlemen know very well,
the manufacturera are very liardl presaed et
the present time, and we should net put
any obstacles in their way if it is possible
to avoid doing se. Soe year£ ago legi&lation was pro.posed in regard te botties
whieh would have inade it practically impossible for the brewers to carry on business. Their difflculty was that they could
not get bottles from the glass manufacturers, and -they had te pick up botties as
beat they could. That legisiation was put
over for three years.
Since this year's Budget was introduced
many amrendments have been mnade, and
mueh. dissatisfaction has been .aroused. We
aIl know t1hat thé great war must be tpaid
for. Rfn that connection I would remark te
honourable gentlemen that the mercantile
community pay a large proportion cf thé
taxes of this country. I duo not mind paying
my income tax and business tax, provided
that the othér fellow dees thé saine thing.
I .know for a fact that a great many people
among the farming comimunity whe should
psy income tax do not pay it. *The manuf.acturers -have te pay their share cf the tax,
but it is unfair that they should have to do>
se unless others do likewise.
I hope the Government will see its way
clear te do something in this case, because
if thîs legislation goes throug.li it is going
seriously te affect the toibacco industry from
which thé Govérninent gets millions cf.
dollars in revenue. Thé other House passed.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, since this Bill was, discussed in the House of Gomnmons répresentations have been made to the Governiment

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I notice that we are
raisin- -the minimum penalty from $100 to
$200. Is that because in cases of convictions the offenclers bave not been ifined
heavily enougb?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: It is
pointed out that this le such a profitable
business that by the manufacture of a few
barrels of alcohol at tbe very start of the
business, a man will make enough to pay
bis fine. Consequently we have te keep pace
with bim by fixing a fine in due proportion
te the price realized on the alcobol, and
making it a very substantial one. There is
very large margin of iprofit in this business.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.: The question arises
wbetber it would not be better to make the
fine greater tban tbe section mentions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It mnigbt
not be wise to discourage it entirely, because we are enjoying a source of revenue
wbich is not to be overlooked.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Those who have
been adminlstering- tbe law bhave it in tbeir
power te impose a fine up to $500 for the
sale of illicit liquojr and it migbt be advisable te make the minimum still bigber.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We bave
te leave it to the discretion of tbe magistrate.
Hon. MLr. M'oG&LL: From ,t.he evidenice
just given by the bonourable leader it is
quite clear that fines do not prevent people
from distilling, wbich is going on and
rapidly increasing. A fine of $100, or even
$200, is, notbing, for a man working at an
ilicit still can make in a few days mucb
more than bis fine. I suggtet that there
ought te be the penalty of imprisonment
for any person carrying on a stili, for sucli
a person not only d-efrauds tbe revenue but
helps to debaucb the men whô drink the
stuff he produces. I believe that in every
tewn and in every community there are
stilîs now in operation. I understand tbat
a still can be madle for a few dollars and
attached to some kitchen utensil, and tbat
spirits produced in that way are being
bottled up and sold te people, te their
injury in every way. If it is in order I
would move that imprisonunent be added
te tbe fine.

Section 10 was agreed ta.
On section 1l-label on containers of
methyl alcohol in medicinal preparatione:
Hon. Sir JiAMES LOUGHEED:
The
words introduced here are "Methyl Hydrate
-Poison," because several cases of poisoning have been caused by persans drinking
mehtyl alcohol under the impression that,
as the article wae labelled as an "alcohol,"
they were consuming an intoxicant. It is
therefore believed that the use of the words
'IMehyl [Hydrate," the chemical eynonym
for Methyl Âlcohad, will, to a very large
Pxtent at least, overcome the difficulty.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG4HEED: Yes, Lt is

,Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND:
What does it
caver? I observe that subsection 1 says
that every persan -who desires to pack or
cure C.anadian leaf tobacco muet apply for
a license; but the raisers of tobacco, the
farmeTs throughout the country, are doing
a certain amount af curing. Are they all
obliged ta sedure a license?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it
only extends ta the packer. The abject af
havirig a packer licensed is ta enable the
Departnîent ta follaw the sale of the leaf.
A cultivator otherwise cauld- seil ta a leaf

could sell ta any manufacturer or retaîl
merchant and evade the five cents duty

place the samne upon the market. If the
Department licenses the cultivator and the
packer, they are in a position ta knaw what
becomes of all leaf grawn; that is, whether
it was sold ta a ret-ail merchant or ta a
licensed manufacturer, and whether the
duty was paid thereon.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is it nat a fact
that a numiber ai packers are alsa cultivators?
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If they

Hon. Mr. DAfNDUIRAND: There is an
interpretation in subsection 5 which, states

Trade Act.
He said: The object of this Bill is to enlarge the present Boards of Trade Act, with
a view to aflording greater facilities for
the organization in towns and cities of s0
desirable an institution as the Board of
Trade. It is srepresented .to me by the Department of the Secretary o! State that
since the close of the war a great number
of applications have corne into the Department, indicating that the facilities or opportunities for organization are not wide
enough under the present Act, and it is
very desirable to recast it. I arn not goixlg
to ask for the isecond reading until to-morrow. We hope by that time to have the Bill
printed.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL. Could not Boards of
Trade be established without coming under
some Act of Parliament?

there is the Franchise Bill, which I expected to he here to-day, and which in ahi probabihity will reach us to-morrow. In addition to that, there is other legislation which

ORIMJINAL GODE AMENDMENT BILL.
THIRD READING POSTPONED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
third qTeading of Bil1 137, an Act te amend
the Criminai Code, as amended.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I ivas not here yesterday, and I
have only noix got this Bil1 in my hands.
I want -to draw the attention o! my honourabie friend to the provision in regard te
racing. I refer to the provision which fi.xes
the date when this Act would, become effective.
,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: lIt is not
on the printed Bill; it will be found in the
Minutes.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I want to suggest to my honourable friend that, instead
of making the date the lst of September,
it ought to be made the 15th of October. If
you make it the Ist of September, certain
clubs will enjoy the advantages of the
present iaw, which, entitles them to take up
to 10 per cent, while others wîll not, sud,
if I may say so, those clubs whîch, according
to Dr. HRutherford's report, are inost deserving are the ones which. wiii suif er most,
while the clubs -te which objection has been
raised-I rnay say that they -are those on
the border, whvlere gentlemen from the other
sida of the hune operate-woulid get the
benefit. I therefore suggest that, instead o!
the lst of September, the date should be the
l5th o! Octeober.
Hon. Sir JA MES LOUGHEED: I may say
to rny honourable friend, froni Ottawa that
ît has been a somnewhat controversial question as te when the Bill should corne into
operation, and 1 have not had an opportunity of seeing the Miui-4er in w-hose departinent this particular clause will be ad-

727

ministered. R should be very happy to pos4pone the reading of the Bill until 1 have an
opportunlity of discussing the matter with
him, and I will direct bis attention to the
remarks of my honourable .friend.
Hon. Mr. BELOOlURT: May I 'add that
the first of the f ail racing meets will be tho.t
of the Conniaught Jockey Club, at Ottawa,
and will begin on the 31st of Augusit and terminate on the 7t-h o! September. We would
have the first day under the old law and
the six remaining days under the new iaw.
Hon, W. B. ROSS Honourable gentlemen.,
when this Bill was in CommiVtee we had- a
rather srnall House, and R would suggest
adding a clause -to the Bill which 1 think
is in the interest of justice. As the Bill
stande, you prove the age of the girlI and you
prove a siexual offence; and the cr ie, is
complete; it doeEp not matter whether the
girl or the man. is to bla.me. I have always
admitted,'and I think most men will -admit,
that in the majority o! these cases you rnay
assume that the man is the aggressor; but
it is im*poss'ible to assume 4that in ail cases.
One o! the best judges in Nova Scotia told
me of a case whIch. he tried. On a Sunday
afternoon a negro girl 'looking out ot a
window saw a young negro coming up the
street. .She beckone, film, called hlm -across
the street, and asked, him to come into the
house. «A few minutes afterwards he came
out and 'went up the street, and, alinost immediately she came out and followed him up
te a grove of bushes. An old negro saw
them going up 'there, :and he followed,. Later
a charge was made against this young negro
under the section. The judge told mie that
ithe incident was ail one-sided, and went
to prove that the girl had iprovoked the
whole thing; and. that boy, if e verdict o!
guilty had been found .against him, wou.id
have had to go -to the penitentîary for I do
flot, know how many years. The judge said
that if the jury had done that, he would
not have known what te do. But there was
a littie bit of doubt in the evidence about
the girl's age, and, the jury took advantage
of that and found, a verdict o! not guitdty.
Under the law as. it now stands you may
have cases o! young boys-not black boys
or yellow boys, but white boys-who do flot
instigate the offence et ail.
Now, I think there ought to be something
te guard agaînst what would be a very unjust punishment. That can be doue by this
clause without invalidating the law at ail in
,the case of a man who is guilty. The section
that. 1 propo~se is this:

SENATE

728

18. On the trial of any offence against seciio 4. 5 or 9 of this Act thtû triiwl judlge- rnay
instruct the Jury that if in their view the evidence does flot show that the accused is wholly
or chiefly to blame for the commission of said
offence they may find a verdict of acquittai.

I need net again discuss sections 4, 5, and
9: they are familiar te you aIl now. This
is a demnocratic age. The jury hear ail the
evidence and they see ail the parties, and
if the law is te he administered fairly and
in the interest of the country we ought to
leave discretion to the jury to bring in a
verdict of acquitta if the girl was chielly
or wholhy te blame.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:- Does the woman's
evidence stand against the man's? Is the
womnan's evidence paramount?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, her evidence has
te be corroborated.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: . think, honourable
gentlemen, that the objection raised by the
honourable member for Middleton deserves
consideration. I have been told several
times that in Montr-al, for severai years,
there have been more boys seduoed by
young girls than girls seduced by boys.
That is the experience in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. OLORAN: There is ne doubt
about it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I move that amendment.
Hon. Mr. BE.AUBIEN: I will second that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourable
leader of the Government said he was going
toefa.low this Bill to stand over until tornorrow.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEDJ: We had
better deal with this amendment new, and
if it is carried we will then let the Bill
stand until te-morrow for the third read-

press the motion. The third reading is on
the Order Paper. and 1 move the third
reading now if 1 did flot do so befere. Then
I shall ask that it stand.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: And I move my
amendinent, that the clause which I have
proposed be added te the Bill.
The emendment of Hon. Mr. Ross was
agreed to.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the'debate was adjourned.
NATURALIZATION BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMESq LOUGHEE]) moved the
second reading of Bill 184, an Act to revive
and amend. the Naturalization Act, 1914.
.- e said: Honourabie gentlemen, in 1914
H
the Parliament o! Canada passed a Naturalization Act as the res&ilt of an agreemient
between the Imperial authorities and the
Government of Canada. It wa.s the outcorne of an agreement among the different
parts of the Empire with a view to making
naturalization uniform and common. throughout the whole Empire. At the same time
we repealed the Naturalization Act which
we had upon omir statute book. In 1919,
after the armistice was arrived at, and after
public opinion had been excited over what
should constitute the naturalization of alien
enermes, we repealed the Act of 1914 and
passed a new Act. Probably the mrost prommnent feature of the later measure was a
prohibition as to the naturahization of certain alien enemnies until they had put in a
residence of ten years in the Dominion. It
was afterwards djscovered that there had
been a misunderstandingê between our ewn
Government and the Imperial authorities.
The opinion was that Great Britain had
acted similarly. It bas been feund that

JUNE 25, 192-0
derstand, is 10 enable the Government ta
deal with a question that arase under the
Franchise Act in anather place. When thiE
Bill becames law the Government will be
able ta give naturalization ta aliens wha
lived in this country priar ta the coming
into eff ect of the Act af 1914, but who had
flot taken out naturahization papers.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
whose loyahty wih be proven ta the satisfaction ai the authorities.
ýHon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 think I am right
in stating that there is another improvement
in this Naturalization Act, inasmuch as
certain powers which before -were left entirely in the hiands of the Secretary af 9tate
are now ta be exercired by the Governar
in Council on the advice o! the Secretary
ai State. This brings the inatter to the
attention of the whole Government and ini
a way is, 1 thhnk, an additional advantage
to the whole country.
There is a paint regarding the nianner
in which this Bill is drafted which. 1 intend
ta brin- ta the attention ai the honourable
leaderàa the Government when we go into
Committee. I may mention it now. If the
hanourable gentleman has Bill 184 before
him, he will see that it is flot stateil where
section 7 is ta be inserted. When we camne
ta discuss this in Committee, that should,
be changed sa as ta state"definitehy where
section 7 ai the Bill shahl be inserted i the
Act itsehi. It can be discussed better in Coinmittee than at the present time.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Daes this B3ill

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second tirne.
,CONSIDERED IN C0oMMI'rTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion af Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the
Bill Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-(new section 7)-revocatian
of certificate oi naturalization by Governor
in Council on report of Secretary of State.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
section provides for the substitution of two
sections in place of section 7 of the Act of
1914. That is to say, we are amending the
Act of 1914 by the substitution of the two
*sections ta which I arn about to allude.
These two sections were intended to be
introduced into the Act of 1919, to establieh
uniformity with the British Act of 1914, as
amended by the British Act o! 1918. There
were, however,. omissions, and some verbal
differences, between the clauses of our Act;
of 1914 and the British amendment, and
these differences and omnissions are corrected- in the present session. The most substantial difference between the proposed
section 7 and section 7 of the Act of 1919
is that paragraph b of subsection 2 was
omitted in the 1919 Act, whether by oversight or for any special reason is not
apparent. Th is clause was in the British
Act of 1914, as amended in 1918, and was
one of the clauses which. formed the subject
of previous 'consultation with the Dominion
and which had been assented ta. It is therefore one that should be included in the
Dominion Aet in orcher to maintain uniformity. In ather words. we are simply insertirg the s-ame sections as are in the
British Act.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Does this repeal
in any respect the power that the Government had under the amendîment of 1919 ta
revoke the naturahizatian of an alien? 1
miss somnething from. this, but I do. not
know just what it is.

SENATE
and there will be ample opportunity to make
a comparison between the proposed ainendments and the Aot of 1919.
Hon. Mr. BRADBUiRY: I de-sire to point
out that during the cduscusrion, on the Deportation Bill.and the amenidment proposed
in this House it became quite evident that
anaer the existing law -the naturalization
which h.ad been granted to, an alien could
be revoked for certain Teasons; and when
his natuiialization was revoked hae would of
course become an undes-irable citizen; in
fact, he would be deported. I have not the
statute before me at the present moment,
but I rather t:hink that if you pass the
amendient as proposed, whie natura-lization may be revoked for certain causes, some
of the causes of revocation, mentioned in
the 1919 ainendmentis are not included. That
is what I féar.
*Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will the
honourable gentleman look at paragrapyh d
of the section we are no-w considering?

Hon. Mr. DANDURANfl:

the adoption of subsection 1.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is flot the difference
between subsection 1 of the present Bill and
the similar provision in the Act of 1919,
first of aïl, that the matter is left in the
hands of the Governor in Council on the
advice of the Secretary of State, instead of
being deait with by the Secretary of St.ate
without reference to the Governor in Council; and, secondly, that if any of the conditions ment.ioned in the clause exist, thien
the Governor in Council bas no discretion
in the matter, but shall revoke the naturalization papers? In the Act of 1919 there
was a permissive "may" instead of "shall."
Hon. iSir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, that
is one of the -am-endment6. I wiil corne te
that 'presently.
Hon. Mr. BOISTOOK: That is the position as I see it. There is practioally ne
alternative.
Hon. ýSir JAMES LOUGHEED: The one
is mandatory; the other was permissive.

.Hon.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. DANDU1IAND: I would drawv
attention to the fact that paragraphas a,
b, c, and d are hardly necessary if in paragrapli e we -ive the iGovernor in Council the
right to recai a certificate in any case
when hie deems t-hat the certificate is net
conducive te the public goed. That la an
extraordinary po-wer - to, give ito the Governor in Council; yet it anay be somewhat
tempered by the preceding paragraphs
which are precise and determinate. I
realize that paragraph e was in the Act of
1919, but it was net in the .Act of 1914. As
the leader of the Opposition bae said, it
is net on]>' the Secretary cf State who can
exercise this judgment, but it must be
endorsed b>' the Governor in Counicil. I
wonder if the person who is thus deait
with wil! have an opportunity of knowing
the
the precise rgason which actuate
Governor in Cnuncil? If the Governor in
Counicil arts under paragraphs a, b, c, or
d, the reason will be obvieus; but if he
undertakzes te act ur.der paragraph e, then
it ma>' be that ne reason will be gwven.
It wouhd seem te be a ver>' arbitrary action te, withdraw the certificate wîthout
the person knowîng the reaeon.
Hon. JSir JAMES, LOUGHEFID: The
paragraphs referred te la>' down certain
principles by which. thi; -act cf revocation
should be acted upen, and in my judgment they weuld be a feature in the
event cf any action 1Žeing taken. When
a country is in a state af war, conditions
îniay anise which it is net possible te feresee, and it seems to mie that this is net
an unreasrnable tdiscret.ion, because the
rpvocation cf the certificate la net a very
s.ýrious matter se far as the person holding
it is concerned. It deprives him cf certain
privilegeis, buit under such conditions it
is net a very serieus matter.
Hon. '-%r. POWER: There is just one
point te which 1 should like te direct the
attention te the leader cf the House. It
étrikes me that in subelause 2 ef section
2 the word -"shal" should be - m;ay," because the Governor in Council might see
some reason for net revoking the certificate, even ln a case lu which, under the
wording of this clause, hie ceuhd do se.
I think, the better wav would be to leave
the discretion with the Governor in Council, either te revoke the certificate or net
te de se.

Hon. Mr. DANUIRAND

iloperstive'

MINE 25, 10P20
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
section as we are nov considering- it is, 1
understand, verbatirn with the British Act.
It is with the object o! obtaining uniformity that the amendlments are being
made. It seems to me that it would be
very undesirable for us to depart in the
slightest deirree from the British Act. - 0f
course, we may réiake a clause of this kind
mandatory so far as the Governor in Counc41 is concerned, but nevertheless the
Governor in Counicil anay' exercise discretion.. That is to say, I know o! no
power except the defeat o! the -Government
that can compel the Governor in Council
to commit an Act.
Subsections 2, 3, and 4 were agreed to.
On subsection 5--revocation of certificate

,On new section 7a-effe-ct of revocation

Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsection a corresponds to subsections 1, 2, and
3 of section 8 o! the Act of 1919, so that we
have already passed those. I will therefore move the adoption of new section 7.
New section 7 was agareed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsections 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were contained in the
Act of 1919, and therefore are flot new.
-ëubsections; 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of section 3
were ag-reed to.
-On subsection 4 o! section 3--imperial naturalization:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsection 4 provides for the arnendment o! section
8 of the Act of 114, sirnply to correlate that
section with the amendments herein made.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: This subsection
reads:
In section 8 the words "Governor in Councfl"
shall be inserted immediately atter the words
"Secretary of State of Canada" in the lOth
lune, and the words "and of the high court or
superior czourt of the province in which the case
arises."

731

Is that for the purpose of giving a right of
appeal to the superjor court?
Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In sorne
of tie overseas Dominions the court is
termed the high Court and in others it is
called the superior court. For instance, in
Canada in some of the provinces the court
is known as the high court and in others
as the superior court. This simply indicates
to what court dap.plication is to be made.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK.: 8o applicationý for
naturalîzation is -made to the superior court
of the province?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yez, whatever is deait witih in section S. An application regarding that subject wiIl be' made
eîther to the high court or to the euperior
court, by whichever name it is known in
the province.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The change às that
the application will be made to a 8uperior
court. 1 think that previously it .could. be
made to a country court in certain cases.
Hon. Sir JAMES .LOIJGHEED: No, apparently iL was to a superior court.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That appeal to
tihe superior court would be in the option
of the Governor in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHHIED: Whatever
the provision is under section 8. This ia
simply declaratory of the court.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: There is just
one thing that bothers me a litûe at the
present time, owing to discussions that have
taken place in regard to the power the Government of the country exerci-ses in the way
of revocation of citizenship. L arn wondering if the present amendmaents are intended to make it impossible for the Governnient to exercise control. Section 7 o! the
Act of 1919 reads as follows:
Where the Secretary of State of Canada ta
satisfied that a certificate of naturalization
granted by httm under this Act, or granted under any Naturalization Act heretofore in force
in Canada, has been obtalned by false representation of fraud, or by concealment
of
materlal circumatances, or that the person to
whoni the certificate ls granted has shown hlmself by act or speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His Majesty, the Secretary of State of
Canada may recomniend that the certificate be
revoked, and the Governor in Counil may by
order revoke the marne-

I was just wondering if that would be
nullified by this clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It only
chang-es iL in thi8 way. Paragraph d of
ne v section 7 reads:

I do flot think it is correctly expresaed.
Perhaps it should read: "A person who, at

was agreed to, and subsection 1 o! new section 7 was agreed to.

On subsection 2 of new section 7-no
certificate to enemny subjeet for ten years
after the war:
Hon. Mr. POWER: I think that that is
a subclause which requires some consideration. That just means that any man who
was a aubject of Austria or Gerrnany or
Turkey, etc.,-any country that the Empire
was at war with-cannot get a certificate of
naturalization before the year 1928. It
seems to me that this is an unreasonably
long probation. I think we had better leave
it at !five years, as it is in some other portions of the Act. In the first place. after
the expiration of five years the feelings that
the war has created, feelings o! hostility
between different peoples, will have pasaed
away. And then there is this other feature
about it, îthat, 'while Germany, or Austria,
or whatever the country rnay be, was at
war with the -British Empire, the individual
eubjects o! that country may not have any
hostile feeling towards the Empire at ail;
and 1 thînk we should also bear in mind
that this long term o! ten years may prevent Canada frorn getting immigrants who
would be very desirable. It is one o! our
great objecta now to get people to corne to
Canada who will help to carry the burden
that the country will have to carry for sevara] years. 1 move that the word "ten" in
line 17 tbe atricken out and that the word
"five" be aubstituted therefor.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 rnay say
that in 1919 we passed this same legisiation.
In the Bill now before us we have alightly
modilied it by paragraph d sio that it w.ill
not apply to anyone who was not residing
in Canada ten years previous to the 7th of
July, 1919. On the previous occasion the
ten-years clause was very fully dis-cuased,
and I think it is not unreasonable, because
if the persons Wo whom it applies could
coinply with a, b, c, and d, the refusai Wo
issue them a certificate would not be made.
But I think it is entirely necessary to
retain the ten-years provision as to an alien
from an enerny country.
Hon. Mr. BOYEIR: Make it twenty-five.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I fail to see it.
Tho Ranendment o! Hon. Mr. Power was
neg-atived.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I want to draw the
attention of the leader o! the Government
to that clause. I do not quite see where it
is going Wo

7 o! the Bill, but it should really corne in as

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is provided.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
thse practice. The Secretary of State will
take notice of any information which is
brought to him f ram the police, from
citizens, or from any other source. He is
the depositary of ail information in regard
to the administration of the Act.

it bias been a pure matter o! forni.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn tld
that that is a very serious reflection upon

investigation is made into every application
for naturalization.

RETURNED SOLDIERS INSITRANGE
BILL.
SECOND READING.
Hon.'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second readîng o! Bill 195, an Act ta provide
for the insurance o! returned soldiersa by the
Dominýion of Canada.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is the outcome of recommendations- made by
the Parliamentary Cornmittee wh'ich bas
been sitting since. almost the beginning of
the session, making a very extended inq.uîry
into the re-establishment Of Teturned soldiers. The sub'ject o! insurance for returned
soldiersi very naturally is one in which a
very great intereat bas been. evinced, particularly since the retumn o! the disabled
mnen irom the recent war.
The principle underlying the Bili is this.
The returned soldier has served bis country
patriotically and loyally, and by reason o!
that service has more Or iess suffered physicai impaîrment or disability, and, does not
-possess the physical qualifications to pass
the necessary medical examination thiat very
properiy is enforced by insurance compan-ies
doing a commercial -business. The question
arisies, is iA not highly proper that the state
should make provision to meet the difficulties which the returned soldier has encountered? The Government therefore proposes te establiÉh an insurance -scheme, 'by
which the returned soldier who makes appylication may take out a policy just as lie
wotild do in any legitimate or standard
company.

JUNE 25, 1920
The only difierence wjll lie that the
medical examination will be disýensed with.
Ho6n. Mr. THO'MPSON:
important difference.

That is a veoey

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Undou.btedly. But naturally 'we could not expect
t-hos-e who have served their country under
the very trying conditions which faced those
men to corne back with -al 4their physical
energies and qualibies unimpaired. If s&ich
wetre the case they wouId not, require the
assistance which the Bill proposes to give
them. Probably it -would be undesirable to
go into dthe provisions of the Bill in detail
now, inasmucli as they can be elaborated
upon in Committee.
Hon. Mr. LPOWER: I think that the suggestion made by the honourable gentlieman
from Fredericton (Hon. [Mr. Thompson)
deserves rather more consideration thsan it,
is apparen-tly going to, get. As I understand it, the principie upon which this Bill
is -based is that the man who has gone overseas and who lias been permanently disabled
siiall be entitled te, receive state insurance.
The point is just this: how is t.he Governmient going to, tell whether -a man is entitleci
to insurance or not unless theire is a medical
examination? I think it i.s absolutely necessary -that you shouldi have a medical
certifloate s.tating that the man lias suffered
permanent 'physical injuries. There seems
t.o me to be a disposition Io leave our
ordinary common sense beliind when
we corne to deal witih men -who went to
the front. If the money 'which the country
is eupposed to pay these men were to, be
picked up on the streets, it would be well
enough; then we need not exercise any precautions ini dealing with the matter. But
that is not the case. The money that is
to go to pay these benefits is money that
will be taken out of the people of Canada,
and I think the people are entitled to, be
satisfied that that money goes to, persons
who are really qualified by law to receive
it, and I laul to see how you can deal with
a man as having been disabled unless there
is a medical examination.
Hon. .Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think the hionourable gentleman from Halifax has not
very well considered the question. This
Bill lias for its object the insurance of
soldiers who cannot pass a medical examination. They are badly injured, and will
not lie accepted as risks by ordînary companies.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I quite agree.

lion. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the applicant have to show that lie has flot been
able to obtain insurance in a standard
company?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Now I corne to
the second point. Those men are bad risks
and they are taken care of by the Government. But suppose those who could pass
an examination were to apply for this insurance, surely my honourable friend couild
flot object, because they are good risks, and
the more good risks there are the easier it
will b. for the Government to carry on the
insurance.,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Provided that
the rates are the standard rates charged by
the other insurance c9mpanies.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGiHEED: These are
standard rates, 1 underetand.
They are
based on 4 per cent.
Hon. Mr. IÊOWER: 1 owe an apology to,
the House. 1 spoken under the misapprehension that this insurance was confined to
soldiers who had suffered under disability,
but I eind it is a general enactment.
Hon. Bir JAMES LOUGHEED.: I may
gay that this does flot difier eo widely fromi
the class of business that is becoming, 1
uxiderstand, somewhat popular with standard compgnies-that is, group insurance. I
know the matter has been d.iscussed on previous occasions, and my impression is that
we have already legislated along this line in
giving certain companies authority to, do
group insurance, and under 'which authorit they take insurance upon an existing
group, entirely irrespective of individual
physical standards.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

the honourable gentleman at the moment
what the military standing of the V. A. LR
would be, because it is in a sense a voluntary organization. I understand it is not

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You would make it
perfectly certain if you fixed a date anterior
to the first of July. Quite a number of
people have had notice of this Bull, and if
they were înclined to perpetrate a fraud
they would have an opportunity to do so.
Why not say the fiast of January, 1920?
IHon. Bir JAMES LOUGHEED:
They
would not have had any intimation of a
particular clause of this kind.
They
might have a general intimation of a
Bill providing for insurance for returned
soldiers, but I think this would come as
news to any of us; none of us would -have
anticipated this particularity in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: This is a special
table of rates different from the orctinary
ratesP
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They are
based 'upon standard rates.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:- If they are based
en standard rates, could no't the widow and
ýorphan do just as well in any private coin-pany?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
,could flot get t.he insurance in a private
company.
Hon. Mr. ]YOMVILLE. Why not?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Il they
insurable they could, but this is to
cover a class of persons who have suffered
fîom their waî service and, could flot readily
get insurance in standard, companies.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it confined to
theni?

~were

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH'EED: No, it is
open to all who have served.
Hon. Mi. ROBERTSON: But those are the
necessitous cases.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Probably
that class will be, the more numerous.
Hon. Mi. I3ELCOURT: What is the difference, roughly speaking, in the rates?

JUNE 25, 1920
Hon. Sir JAM1ES LOUGHEED: They are
practically the same; just a small fraction
lower than the standard rates.,
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why are they
-ma-de lower?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. Theser are
based upon the 4 per cent table, whereas
the insurance table, as rny honourable
friend will doubtless remnember, was placed
eo'me years ago on the 3 'per cent basis. The
4 per cent -table iwill permit of rates being
slightly less than the standard rates under
the 3 per cent interest calculatoion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: il suppose the rate
has been made as low as is consistent with
the cost of administration?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUOtHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: The rates seem all
aTight. This is a kind of clearing-house, is
it notP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELSOURT: What is a clearin-gbouse?
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Do you not know
that?
Hon. Mr. BEIÀ30URT: No, I do not. I
cannot tell from the definition that we have
just had.
Hon. Mr. DOM VILLE : I d.id not hear
the definition. In the United States they
have what they eall a clearing-house for
inisurance coxnpanies. I want te asip the
honourable leader a question: how do any
of these people obtain insurance?
Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Those who
corne within the classes provided for in the
Bill wil1 make application to a representative of the Government for a policy rap to a
maximum of $5,000, paying the premium
prescribed in the Act.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: And proving that
they are entitled Io insurance by having
been in the service?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, the
mecessary evidence wilI have te be forthcoming.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Ras. any estimate
been made as te the number of persons te
-whom this Act will apply?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
apply to the whole Expeditionary Force. It
is difficuit to say how naýny will avail themselves of it.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is the insured

payable only in this way, one-fifth in cash

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG-IEED: A-1l insurance is more or boss complicated. It

of the Department of Finance. They will

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEET>: Yes. The
fund wifl be quite distinct and the resilîts
cani be ascertained.
Hon. MT. BEWOOURT: With regard tbo the
words,
-"if such disability is not deemned to be attributable to his service so as to bring hlm under
the provisions of the Pension .&ct--"

Suppose that after paying four, five, or six
premiums, the insured is declared to be
unable to carry on a gainful occupation.
He ia gra.nted a board and is found eligible
for a pension. What becomes of the four,
five, or six premiums that he has already
paid?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose my honourable friend has in view a
case in which the insured drops tho premiums?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. I have in

is ontitlod to a certain pension by reaison

the insurance and the pension must not

I suppose hie would bceontitled to a paid-up
policy.
Hfon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no provision here for surrender, as in certain standard companies, but it can be
made the subjeet of a regulation. When the
Act is put into operation it may be found
desirable to make an arrangement of that
kind.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: It seoms to me
it would bo only fair that if the insured has
paid for a numbor of years and ids unable
to continue the payments, hie should get
the bonefit of either a paid-up policy or a
cash surrendeT value.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Let me put the
whoIe case. A soldier Las been xnarried;
hie wile is dead; .by that wife Le had a

gave birth to a grandchild; so that. this
unmarried or widowed soldier anay have no

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUrGHEED: We

Hon. Mr. BELCOIYBT: What does it
-meanP
Hon. Sir JAMES .LOUGHFiElD: A deduction bas to be mnade; that is assuming
the benefits to be for $5,000, if the two
funds combined exceed the amount of
$5,000 a deduction will be made so as to
reduce the amount to that, s0 that the
beneficiary will not receive, by pension
and insurance combined, more than the
maximum amount o! the insurance. That
is the meanîng. That is to say, they cannot have two benefits at tihe same time,
one through the policy, and another
through the pension, exceeding $5,000, and
if on the death cf tihe insured that condition does exist, then a deduction will
be made, redu7cing it to the amount of the
maximum.
~Hon. Mr. MUIRPHFY: We need not go
up to $5,000. Suppose we take the amount
for which. the soldier is insured at $1,000.
His heirs are receiving pensions for their
lifetime, and those are computed on an
actuarial basis, and if tihey go up to $1,000
lhe premiums paid in -by the deceased will
be returned to his heirs proportionately,
mith 4 per cent, interest.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They may
be entitled to a very sub6bantial return inl

the deduction may be. That being -ascentained, the deduction is made.

MITLITIA PEN1SION MRLL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading o! Bill 197, an Act Vo, amend
the Militia Pension Act.
He raid: Honcourable gentlemen, it wil
doubtless be remembered that hast session
or the session hefore we passed a provision
in the Militia Act precluding a member of
the Mihitia lrom drawing pensions from
both the Militia and a second source. That
is to say, hie would. draw only one pension.
That provision worked in this way. Certain
Imperial officers were in receipt of a pension, and ai the samne time they were entitled te a pension under the Militia Act.
By our action we precluded such persons,
while they were drawing a Militia pension,
from availing themselves of the advantage
o! a pension from -another source. IV was
done, 1 think, without our having a full
knowledge of what we were doing. The Bill
was sent down f rom the Gommons and we
acted accordingly. The purpose of th-:; Bill
is to repeal subsection 2 of section 25 of
the Militia Pension Act.
Hon..Mr.

MU£TRPHY.

Would the
liton. 'Mr. DANDURAXNýD:
1',)ino'rable gentleman read the claus~e
wvhich we are repealing?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would sugg.eszt ta
my honourable !riend that it mi&ht be better to go into Committee and deal with it
then.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
when we go into Committee r will do that.
The objeci o! the Bill is- simply Vo repeal
that section.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion o! Hon. Sir James Lougheed
the Senate went into Co)mmittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.
On section 1-subsection forbîddingS duplication o! pensions repealed:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
what we enacted in the session of 1919:
25. (1) The pension of a widow shail, if her
hueband was at the tinie of his death on fuit
pay, be an amount equal to one-haif of the
pension to which he wouid have been entitled
if he had been retired coxnpulsorily lmmediately before his death, or, If at the tume of his
death he had been pensioned, an amount equal
to one-half of such pension.
(2) If a widow or child le entitled to a pension, gratuity or allowance under this Act and
ls also entitled to a pension. gratuity or allowance under any other Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, or under any law of the UTnited
Kingdon of Great nritain and Ireland, or under the law of any other portion of His
Majeety'e Dominions, such widow, or, In the
case of a child, the parent or guardian, dr tutor
of such child. shali eleet which pension, grgtuity or allowance she or he desires to accept,
but no widow or child shall receive two pensions, gratuities or allowances.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That looks to
be fair enough.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does the benefloiary have the option o! taking the larger
pension? That is the case in England.

When there are two pensions the pensioners have the option of taking whichever
one they like. Naturally they take the
larger one.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Now they can
get only one pension.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But we do not
want them to get both.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. By
the regulation o! hast year we precluded the
widow or the child from participating- in
bath pensions.

They had ta take one or

JUNE 25, 1920
the other. But if they have corne rightly
by both, it seerns to me it is not equitable
to prevent them fromn getting the two. Let
me read this ag-ain:
TÉhe pension of a widow shall, If her husband
was at the tinie of his death on full pay. be an
amount equal to one-haif of the pension-

That deals with what the pension of a
widow shall be. Then we went on:
'If a widow or child is entitled to a pension,
gratluty, or allowance under this Act.
That is, under the Militia Pension Act-and Io also entitled to a pension, gratuity. or
allowance under any other Act passed by thie
Parliament of Canada.

She might have been entitled to a
sion arising from an allowance which penher
huaband should have dirawn say from one
of the railways or from some commercial
institution, and that 'would have been under
an Act passed 'by the Parliament of Canada-or under any iaw of the United Klngdom of
Great Britain and ireland, or under the law

she or he desires to- accept, but no widow or

Hon. Mr. POWER: That is subsection 2
of section 25, is it? That is what we are
ptriking out?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
what we propose to strike out.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What happens in
a case of this kind? Suppose the widow is
entitled to a pension in her own right, because of having served, -for instance, as a
nurse during the war?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: She
could not draw both; she would have to
forego one pension or the other, under the
leg-islation of last year.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, that is what
I mean. But %veare making it permissible
for her to draw at the same time the pension to which she is entitled in her own
right and the pension she ehould get because o! her husband's death?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Act will have
the effect of enabling her to draw Ihose
two pensions?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. That
was the law before last session.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

I do not see why

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But hast
session Parliament unwittîngly, wi.thout
considering the effect or the injustice, passed
this clause.
H-on. Mr. iCAiSGRAff N: Does -the honourable gentleman think it is an injustice? The
system that prevails in. other countries does
not slow of two pensions being poeid. Take
England. for instance. A màn in the army
retires and gets, a pension. If he takes any
kînd of service, either in- England or in the
colonies, -and if the remuneration is greater
than his pension, he foregoes the pension.
He is not entitled to receive bis pension in
addition. The pensions are oupposed to be
reasonable. Wby give two pensiions to one
individual? The Government must have
become very ricb. It does not appear ito
me unjust to provide Vbat only one pension
shahl be paid.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Suppose
that an officer in the militia, througb. bis
service in the Im-perial army, was enfitled
to a pension; then he camne to Canada and
served fui time. and became entitled to a
pension un'der the Militia Act. Shouhd his
widow be deprived o! the pension he earned
in England before coming ito Canada?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: She would be if
she were living in Engh.and.
Hon.'Sir JAýMESLOUGHEF*D: I am not
prepared to accept that construction.
Hon. lMr. CASGRATN: She would not get
the pension fromn the Im-periai Government.
The Biritisb Aot says that if they get eanythinb, !rom any o! the oversea-s &bminions,
then that amount is deducted from -the pension in England.
Section 1 was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed
to.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND:
Most o! the
honourable Senators present are I -suppose,
unable to foresee the effect of the repeal of
this clause. lIs repeal may resuit in abuses
creeping in and oausiug commotion in the
country. At the moment I am not in a
-position to say what effect it will have. I
know that people generally are somewhat
chary about the -liberal granting of pensions,
anid if they bear that two pensions are paid
to one person it may open their -eyes and
they may wonder %what are coming to.

no case in mind mylf.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND :-which I cite
in order that we may see how far public
opinion will endorse our action. In 1906,
I thirik, the Parliament o-f Canada decided
that a Minister of the Crown 'who had
rendered five years' service, disassociating
hirnself frorn his private business and giving
ail his time te the state, ehould ipso facto
receive a certain pension, which was flot
a large one. I think it was $2,5W0 or $3,500
a year.
Hon. Mr. POWRR: It was haif his regular saiary.
Hon. Mr. DKNDURA.ND: I think it was
about $3,500 a year. The ex-Ministers who
were thus benefited received that pension
for a certain numaber of years. But it happened that sorne of those ex-Ministers were
re-elected to the House. One or two were
sitting in this Chamber. There was suclî
an infernal noise throughout the couintry
because those men who had served the
state for five years were receiving both the
pension and an inderanity as mernbers of
Parliarnent. that the Government that had
obtained the legisiation carne before Parliarnent and asked for the withdrawal of
the pension. I think that that pension was
a very proper one. I remnember that when
I represented te the Prime Minister that
the action had been hasty, and perhaps
the pension might have been suspended,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

or there nîight iave been a deduction
frorn it of the arnount of the indemnity
received by the ex-Minister as a member
of either House--I was speaking, of course,
of the impression prevailing throughout the
country and the argument that was being
used against the payrnent of both the indemnity and the pension-the Prime Minister said that he thought it was a mean

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable

of men drawing the double pension.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.

we are not only giving them immediately
the double pension, but we are increasing
the pensions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. The
injustice of last year was that rights which
pensioners enjoyed up to t.he legisiation of
hast year, and which they 'had enjoyed for
years, were at once disturbed and interfered
with, possàbly wiped out. There were vested
interests of a very substantiai character
interfered with; that is to say, pensions that
had been drawn possibiy for many years were
suddenly discontinued by the Act of last
year, but we apparently gave no consideration to the fact. However, I will make
further inquiry before we give this Bill the
third reading.

MAGDALEN ISLANDS STEAMSHIP
SERVICE.
REPORT 0iF SpE)CIÂL CO!MMTTEE.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON presented the report of the Special Committee appointed to
in>quire into the aubject of the steamship
service to the Magdalen isiands.
He said: I desire to make a few remarks
in respect to this report. Until after the
committee had mnet, I was not personally
acquainted with the subject-matter to be
considered. I found then that it had to do
with matters that were of concern to 6,800
residents of Canada living on the Magdalen
islands, which are, as I understand, part of
the county of Gasp& The Magdaien islands
are situated at a considerable distance from
the mainland, and the people living there
depend entirely for their supplies of various
kinds, .such as flour and clothing, upon
steamship connection with the mainland.
The Magdalen îslands are located neareat
to the county of Kings, in Prince Edward
Island, and the Government has subsidized
a steamship service Vo run from there to
the islands. For six inonths of the year,
the Committ-ee ascertained, they are practically in the Arctic zone, for they are surrounded by ice and the people have no
chance of reachingy the mainland. We f ound
it to be important that a serv-ice should be
made available to the people of the islands
as early as possible after the opening of
navig-ation in the spring, and as late as pos,sibhe in the fail, in order that the supplies
for the six months during which they are
frozen in may be obtained. The people o!
the islands are engaged in fishing, and the
products of their industry, such as fish and
lc>bsters, are said to -be worth upwards of
$I,000,000. Their industry is a genuine
weaith-producing industry, and these people
belong to the Dominion o! Canada and their
interests should be conserved in the best
possible way, even as we would, be disposed
to conserve the interests of a larger popu-

BOARDS 0F TRADE BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill M5, an Act to amend
the Boards of Trade Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the object of this Bill is to aniend the Boards of
Trade Act so as to afford further facilities
and encouragement for the incorporation
of boards o! trade. It is flot a very radical
departure trom the present Act, but a
@lance over the eight sections of the Bill wil
impress honourable gentlemen that it is in
the public interest that we should facilitate
iii every possible way organizations of this
character.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill has corne down to us at
a rather late hour of the Session, and, ahthough my honourable friend says it is not
a very radical departure, I want'to draw
his attention to oxie or two matters in the
Bill which I think indicate rather extraordinary forms of legishation. In the first
instance, section 3 deals with the incorporation of boards of trade. When I first
-tock up this Bill to read it, 1 thought we
were repealing the old Act, which deals
with the incorporation of boards o! trade;
but, on comparing it with that Act, I find
that if the present Bihl goes into effect in
the form in which it is presented to the
House there will be two rnethods of organizing boards of trade. It seemns to me that
this is an extraordinary kind o! legisîstion to introduce. The honourable leader
of the Governinent, when hie introduced this
Bill te the House, said that lie desired to
extend the facilities for forming boards of
trade. If that is the intention I wouhd suggest that a better way of deahing -with it
would be to ainend the sections cf the old
Act, and not have different sections in the
twc Acts dealing with the saine subject.
Then, further onx in this Bill we find othç.r

sections providin- -for the powers te be exercised by hoards o! trade formed under this
Act; but it is not very chear whether they
have ahi the powers possessed by boards of
trade formed under the Act as it stands today. Possibly my honourable iriend may
have some amendments to make in coinmittee 'whicni wiii put that matter right.

Act and the other je known as the Boards
,of Trade Amendment Act, 1920.
Hon. air JAMES LOUGHEED: & far as
legislatdon is concerned.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If anybody tries
to look this inatter up in order to flnd out
under which Act lie is going to incorporate
a Board of Trade lie would require that information.
Hon. air JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
this Act the organizations would not be
known as Chambers o! Commerce, whereas
under the present Act, »Chapter 124, that

naine may be adopted. I think that in the
province of Quebec the terni chiefly used
is "Ghamber of Commerce."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That does not get
away from the dilffculty of having two Acts
governing boards of trade.
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUQHEED: Except
that the one makes provision for a much
simpler organisation than the other, and iL
cannot use the termi "Chanîber o! Commerce."
Section 1 was *agreed to.
On section 2-definition:
Hon. Sir J AiMES LOUGHIEED: This is
rnerely an extension of the description of
the governing bodies o! boards of trade,
and provides that they may be designated
as directors, trustees , or otherwise. I[ might
say that it is proposed that some rather
numerous amendments ahould ne made to
this Bill, and I will proceed now, or if
honourable gentlemen prefer we will let
the Bill stand, Lili to-morrow.
Hon. %Mr.BOSTOCK: I think it will hi
betLer to let it stand.
Hon. Sir JAS1MES LOUGHEED: What I
had better do is to go on now, and thus
get the ainendments on the Minutes, and
then the OCmmittee will rise and report
progreas. We propose striking out section
2, but leaving in subsection c, and it will
then read as follows:
2. Section two of the principal Act la hereby
amended by addlng at the end thereof the. following paragraph-

"(c)

'council' Includes *board of directors'

and trustees of the governing body, howsoever

designated."

(2) In this Act the expression "the principal
Act" ineans the Boards of Trade Act chapter
one hundred and twenty-four of The Revised
Statues of Canada, 1906, together with the
amendments of that chapter made by chapter
nine of the statutes of 1908 and by chapter
twelve of the statutes of 1917.

So that my honourable friend will se
that we draw a distinction. That will be
section 2. .
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If there axe to
be rnany amndments, would it not bie as
well that the Bill be reprinted with the proper amendments and distributed between
now and MondayP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I wil
just put the amendments in now, and if
we eau get the Bill printed by that Lime we
will do, eo. At the end of section 3 we will

Then,.referring to section 6, we add, after
the word *"Canada":

Canada has deait rnost generously with
them, we would hardly expect to be called
upon.to spend another $8,000,000 a year for
the purpose of stili further improving the
condition of these men and their relatives.
As I venture to say in connection with
another matter, if these $8,000,000 were to
be found lying about on the surface of the
earth, and not extracted from the pockets of
our people, there might be very littie objection to such a messure as this; we maight
be as liberal as we pleased. But under
existing circumnetances honourable gentlemen must bear in mind that we are undertaking now to deal etili more liberally with
a class as to whomn we have the authority of the leader of the Government for eaying that they are deait with more liberally
than the same class in any other country in
the world. I do not think, honourable gentlemen, that Canada is in a position to
scatter millions about in that manner. If
it were shown thàt anyone was suffering any
eevere hiardship, 1 could understand it; but
under the circumstances it does séem to
me that we are not justified in. undertaking
to add to our liabilities in this way. It is
not as though we were adding the $8,000,000
just for one year. The honourable gentleman <Hon. Sir James Lougheed) spoke as
though, whenever we pleased, we could drop
the provisions of this measure. But every
honourable gentlemian knows that that is
not the case. We arrange for payîng s0
much, and no qGovernment would have the
courage, and no Opposition would have the
courage, to corne out with a declaration that
they were going to cnt off some of the
pecuniary benefits that are conferred upon
the beneficiaries by this measure. If Canada were an exceedingly wealthy country
I do not think that even then we should
be justified in spending money in this way;
but Canada is not a very wealthy country,
and our population, or -the bulk of themn at
any rate, have to earn týheir bread bv the
sweat of their brows. I do not thînk'they
shou]d be condemned to see their 'earnings
taken for the purpose of paying unnecessary
sums. That is the way this thing strikes
me.
Honourable gentlemen here can afford to
be independent in a way that the members

PENSION BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEI) moved the
second reading of Bull 198, an Act to amend
the Pension Act.
Be eaid: Hononrable gentlemen, this is
a Bill that lias been prepared for the purpose of carrying out the recommendations
made by the Pension Committee of the
Bouse of Commons. It proposes increasing the pensions, in round figures, by about
50 per cent.
Hon. MT. BOSTOCK: What is the total
amount of thal 50 per cent?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
it will represent in te aggregate about
$8,000,000 of extra payments; but I might
point ont that those are bonuses; tihey can
be reduced at any time. The pensions are
not de'finitely fixed at that amount, but
upon the return of normal conditions it
'will be optional with the Government of the
day to reduce them by whatever amount
may appear to themn reasonable.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Assuming that the
pensions this year are $25,000,000, it would
mean a total of about $33,000,000?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: They are taken
care o! pretty well.
Hon. L. G. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, I looked over this Bill with a certain
amounit o! care, and I have to con! ess that
after readîng it I really did not see where
the increases came in. But I did see that
the Act which this Bill proposes to amend
was exceedingly liberal towards the beneficiaries under it. It was stated in another
place by the leader of the Government that
Canada was dealing more generously with
her soldiers than any other country
in the world, and I think there is not much
doubt about tihat. It has been pointed out
thet we already proposed to spend $25,000,000 for the purpose of imnproving" the mat,Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

supposed to contrai, a very considerable
vote, and naturally, as the members of the
popular House have to go back to look for
votes, they do things that they would flot
do as a matter of business. Looking at
this question in the interest of the country
and considering our own reputation, the
6enate shou1d do 'what you can hardly expeet the members of thé other Chamber to
do, and this Bill, I think should be thrown
out.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourabie gentlemen, 1 'for one wouid be very sorýry to see
Canada recede from. the proud position.
which. we occupy to-day, in being the country which has done most -for ber returned
men. I believe that, Canada's soidiers were
the greatest soldiers in the war. I do flot
think that there -were any sioldiers 'who
equalled them ini bravery and in devotion
to duty, and Canada owes them so great a
debt for the lustre which they have shed
upon 'her narne that we ought to deal most
generously with. the returned men. 1 have
always taken the ground that the man who
has corne home f.rom the war as isound
physicaily as when he went is flot entitled
to any great considérations on our part. In
bis day and generation it was necessary for
him to make -that sacrifice. Wars in the
past have been fought by the young men of
other generations, and in the future he 'will
be relieved from that duty, 'which -will be
cast upon others in their time. But for the
man who has been wounded, the man who
has been physically disabled. and unfitted
for the work necessary to enable hlm to
maintain his fam4ily and himseif, we canflot do too much. For the widows and orphans of those who have given up their
lives or have sacrificed their health we canflot do too much. Generosity in this case
is, I think, a generosity 'which will meet
with the approval of the masses of the
people of this country.
I do not think it is fair to say that this
Bill was supported -by members of the
House of Gommons because, forsooth, they
might have to cali upon the electors to give
themn votes on some future occasion. I do
not think that proposition is fair to the
members of the House of CommonsHon. Mr. POWER: It is true, though.
1Hon. Mr. GIRROIR :-hecause I believe
-and 1 cannot understand how anybody
could believe otherwise-that the members
of the House of Gommons as weIl as the
members o! this House gener-ally are firmly of the opinion that the men -%who have
received assistance under the Pension Act

751

and the widows and the orphans of those
whoc have last their lives -in the service of
tlie cauntry are flot getting too much. I
for one feel that it is aur duty ta strain our
finances ta the utmost in order that those
who -have suifered and sacrificed in the
Great War should flot go unpaid.
One can hardly realize what it means to
a famiiy ta lose its head. One can hardly
realize w-hat it means to the 'widow and orphans ito be deprived of the hushand and
father. Men have gone from Canada in. the
fiower o! their youth, full of etrength and
vigour, and have fought in the war and
have corne back decrepit and unable -for the
rest of their lives to earn a livelihood. For
the rest o! their lives they are going to su!fer mentally or physically. 1 do flot think,
honourable gentlemen, that any money
that we can pay can ever make up for that
great bass.
Those of us who, on account of age or
other impediment, were unablé ta ta-ke part
in the -war and fight for that great cause,
the liberty of this country, in order that the
great institutions under 'which. we live rnight
be saved .for ourselves, and for future generations, surely should flot hesitate to make
every sacrifice that can be made in order
that those Tanf who have done that great
work for us, who have made that great sacrifice for us, shouid be recompensed as f ar
as possible. In the case of a young =an
with. good prospects ini life, who went overseas and has corne back an invalid -and is
going to suifer for the rest of his days. does
any one mnean to say that a mere pension
will compensate him for that losP I say
that rnoney cannot compensate him, but we
certainly should go ta the very limit in
assisting him. As to the man, who bas- corne
back safe and sound in mind and body, ail
I have ta say is that he is mighty lucky;
but for the man who bas suifered, and for
the dependents of the nian who has suffered,
I think we can hardly do too much, and I
%vasa littie surprised ta hear the honourable
member for Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power) make
the statement that he did. 1 arn sure that
if be looks inVo this niatter more carefuily
and weighs ail the considerations that
should count in a question of this kind he
wiil came ta the conclusion' later on, if he
does not irnmediateiy do so, that we should
ail hoid up aur hands in order that the returned inan and the dependents of the returned man should be given every possible
eornfort and financiai assistance. I for one
arn proud ta be a Canadian citizen and ta
be able ta say that Canada bas done more

SENATE
than any other coun~try in the Nvorld for the
returned men.
Hon. R1. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I feel in this mnatter exactly as does
the honourable gentleman who lias juat
taken his seat. I thînk that no one can
express sufficient admiration for the mnen
who have returned fromi the war or sufficient
sympathy for the widows who have suffered
the boss o! their liusbands. 1 amn unable,
however, to pass judgmnent upon the work
o! the Commons Committee. It would have
been necessary to follow the work o! that
Committee fromn day to day. attending its
meetings and listening to the advice -which
wvas given, in order to be able to state that
f roin A to Z*its work has -been absoluteby
Committee, if I am
satis!actory. As that unanimous. report, 1
not niistaken, made a
assume that this is an indication that they
have judged sanely and conservatively. I
quite understand that my honourable friend
[rom Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power) is a littie
fearful o! the efforts that may -le made fromi
increase tliose pensions in
year to year V-o
one way or another, in view o! the experience !ollowing the Civil -War in the United
States. During the last- fi! ty years there
have been influences, both in Congress and
out of Congress, whicli perhaps unduly iiiflated the list of pensions in the United
States. But as to the report 'which is nov
betore us, I will not quarrel witli it: first,
because I am not quali-fied to express a judgment; secondly, because I amn disposed
to give a full measure o! sympathy to the
clasa o! men and women wlio are being
!avoured by this Act.
There is only one query whicli I 'woubd
like to mnake: that is concerning section 27,
which amends the Pension Act by adding
new sections 47A and 47B. I observe that
the Comnmittee reported-it must have so reported, as I find the provision in the Bilin favour o! increasing the pensions o! the
South African \Var veterans and the veterans of the Fenian Raid and the Northwest
Rebellion to the level o! the present pensions. I amn wondering whether the people
who have got those pensions will be entitled
to an increase de piano, witliout their cases
being- examined indïvidually for the purpose o! determining wlietlier or not they are
entitled to pensions according to the scale
to be fouind in schedules A and B, or wliether
they will have to pasa anme kind o! examination to ent-itle them to take advantage o!
In other -words, were the

or of the South African War treated
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR.

more leniently, or more generously, thari
they would have been Uder this Act,
and are tliey really ail on an equal footing
as to the rating of their disablement with
the men who have returned from the-Great
War? That may require a considerable
amount o! money, and maybe there should
be a distinction, whicli does not sieem to be
made in virtue o! this Act. 1 should like
to have some information [rom the leader
o! the Government as to that. I see that
ail those who were pensioned in 1867 and
1868 and who are stili pensioners will have
to stand an examination in order to receive
the benefit o! this.
Honi. Mr. BRADBURY- Are there many
of those pensions?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANU: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It is pretty hard
for me to concur -in the finding o! the Committee on the question o! the provision
made for Fenian Raid pensioners and South
African War pensioners. 1 do not believe
there is any analogy between themn and the
men whom ve are now pensioning. I think
the pensions provided for the Fenian Raid
and South African War veterans were
ample. Conditions were then very different
from what they are to-day: A dollar then
was equal to three dollars to-day. While
I have not followed the report o! the Committee, I arn heartily in syrnpathy with
most of the suggestions contained in it, because, ever sînce the pension systern was
inaugurated in Canada, I have felt that the
scale of pensions was absolutely inadequate. There were many -in my own 'battalion, who when they went overseas were
splendid, strong young men, but who,
wlien they came back, by reason o!
having lost an arm, or having contracted lung trouble or something o! that kind,
were absolutely incapacitated. I say that
no inatter how much inoney we give to
those men we cannot compensate thern for
the great sacrifices they made. The widows
of men who made the supreme sacrifice
are equally deserving o! consideration; and
the children o! fathers who are iying in
France are public wards and must lie taken
care of and educated; nothing the Government can do can wholly make up for the
great loas 'which. they have sustained.
There is one other phase o! this quesIn
tion to which I should like to refer.
rnany cases the medical boards have failed
to make a proper diag-nosis, and as a resuit
men receiving a pension in accordance
with thle disability found by the Board have
not received their due. There are to-day

JUNE 26, 1920
rnany men on the pension list wvhose cases
should be reconsidered; men who ought to
have been g-iven a higher disabiiity than
that given to them by the Board. I hope
and trust that the Board wili see that al
isuch cases are thoroughly investigated;
and, il there je any doubt, that the benefit
of the doubt will ho given to the man. I
can mention the case of a young man in my
own battalion. He was a lumber merchant
from Northern -Manitoba. He had a wife
and two small children. When he -went
away he was in the pink of condition; but
when he returned two years ago he was a
hroken-down man. The Medical Board gave
him a pension of, I thrnk, $12 a month.
This man, although he had flot been wounded, had contracted sorne kind of stomach
trouble during hie service, and the Board
seemed to have dîfficulty in arriving at the
extent of his disability. Hie is a reliable
man, a reai man; flot a faker-andi we have
enoug-h fakers, God knows-and the pension awarded him was entirely inadequate.
This je only one case, and I arn sure there
are many simîlar ones.
I wish to say just a few worda in reference
to the men who have corne baek fit, without
a wound or a scar. In hun>dreds of cases
they came back b-etter men than they were
when they went away. I think that the
Governirnent of Canada bas been more than
generour, to that class o! men. The gratuity provided by the Government, in addition to the pay which they received, ough.t
to have satisfied any reasonable person that
the Governmnent had gomme to the limit in
trying to recompense themn for any sacrifice
they nmade; but, in view of the agitation
that has been raised .by 8,one o! these mon,
I want to say that if a canvase were made
of the dissatisfied element who are causingr
the unrest amonga our returned monn,. I believe we would find that 95 per cent of themn
are not Canadians. The oeeal ianadian who
wvent over did not do so for the money that
wvas in it. He did not expect any compensation; ho went over to do his duty and
he did it well, and he has corne back and
as a rule je eatisfied.
* I. amn giad that the Comniittee has seen
fit to bxing in thie report recommending protection andà compensation for the real sufferere-the widows and the orphans and
the men who have been maimed for life.
1 do not think, we need, have any lear of

Tihis
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
question was thrashed £ut samewhat laat
night in connection with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Bill and the MilitiL
Pension Bill. Upan inquiry since then,
1 arn informed that these pensioner.s pay
for their pension. You might cali it superannuation. They subscribe ta a f'ind, as
I understand it-about 5 per cent-and
S--481

755

while me eau it pension it is really for
length of service; it is not for disability,
and flot for death. The pension scheme
now before us goes on an entirely different
principle. The officers of the 'Militia and
Royal Canadian Mounted Police contribute
during long periods of years ta a pension
iund, and upon the expiration ai that periad
they are entitled ta. their pension. Likewise the men eniet at a low rate of compensation or pay in consideration ai the
benefits which 'wili flow f rom long service;
so that an retirement they get perliaps a
superannuation allowance, just as the Civil
servants in whomn my honourabie friend.
since I have been in ethis Chamber, has
been deeply interested in -regard ta superannuatian. I see no distinction between
the twa. You might call it a pension or
you might eall it. superannuatian. Buch &
persan might have .bought en annuity for
the anme amount as the subscription which
hie made, and might thus have acquired the
rîght of superarmatian. Why shouid that
be interfered with if in giving his services
ta his country hie became disabied' He
might have made provision through one of
aur insurance campanies for precisely the
expected
slame advantage, and it was neyer caution
that the thrift, prudence, and
which hie znight thus have exercised in malting provision for his aid age ehauld be, disturbed in case he rendered service ta hie
country in the event af war.
Han. Mr. POWER: Aflter the explanatian my honourable friend bas given 1
assume -that it la just; -and there is no objection ta that clause, because the Militia
and the Mounted Police have ail contri'buted
at the rate af 5 per cent ai their salaries
ta the Pension Fund, and of course it would
be most unfair ta interfere with that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHFED: Yes, it
is simply for long service. I muet say that
yesterday I did not realize this; and I think
that, in dealing with the matter iast Session,
we had not before us that information,
either in the 'House ai Cammons or in the
Senate. We passed that legisiation without
information, and unwittingly, and I think
it is aniy right that we should restare the
pension.
Hon. Mr. BRADBUTRY: That relates te,
the permanent meen?
Yes,
-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHHE.
aniy ta the men in the permanent force.
Hon. Mr. BRADYBURY.- The only objection 1 would find in that regard would

SENATE
be that many of those men were increased
in rank very rapidly; but 1 think they are
entitled to a pension.
~Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: LI quite
agree with that.
Section 19 was agreed to.
Sections 10 and il were agreed to.
On section 12-diecretion of Commission
to pay pension to certain classes of children:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would mny honourable friend explain what is meant by that?
This
.Hon. Sir JAMES iLOUGHEED:
change authorizeis the Commission to pay an
amount "noV exceeding" orphans' rates
instead df orphans' rates. IV is only in
case o! need that this is.paid. It gives a
wider discretion Vo the Commission than
heretofore.
Section 12 was agreed to.
On section .13-no dteduction in certain
cases of disability; no payment in certain
other cases:
This
HaIn. Sir JAIMES [,OUGHEED:
amendment is nmade in accordance 'with the
practice edopted, a.nd is self-explanatory.
The worde "congenital. defect- are new. I
might say that for a long period 'dlaims
were made by 'Lhoee applying for pensions
that 'they having been accepted by the
medical 'board, even if there had been no
latent injury or disease, the Government
was stopped from. saying, "' You were not
physically qualified at the ime you were
enrolled." This will not permit a position
be
of that kind Voa taken. For instance, if
a man had an artificial leg at the time he
went overceais he could not be heard to say
that he had noV.
Hon. <Mr. BRADRURY: 1 had two or
three cases in my own battalion o! mnen
who went overseas after having been examined by mny own medical officer, paraded
4,hree timées before they le! t Canada. paraded at Wit.ley Camp before they went over
ta France, were passed Iby the medical
boards, accepted as fit mnen, and then eent
over ta fight. One of those men returned
with considerable disability; he contracted
rheumatism, and was told by the medical
board tha-t he mugt have had some of this
trouble bel ore he joined up with my battalion. I do not think that is fair Vo men who
were accepted by board after board, who
wvent over and performed their duties, and
after they carne back developed disabilities.
Hon. M.Nr.BRADBURY.

I say the country ought to be responsible
for those men; it accepted themn and took
thern over there; the men performed their
duties; and the doctors 6hould nlot be -able
to isay, "You have fil ty per cent or seventyfive per cent disabili-ty, but you must have
had some of those troubles before you joined
Up wjth -the force at ail."
Why did they
,Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:
take them?
Hon. Mr. BRADhBURY: That is what I
want to know.
Hon. Mr. FARRELL: Because they were
.looking for quantity, not quality.
They passed
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY.
the doctor, and R, is hardly fair to say to
those men now, "You have done your bit,
.you corne back broken down, but you cmust
have had some of this diseaise before you
went to the trenches."
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: They do not say
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.- If they
went to France and accepted all chanSe of
war it is ail right; but if they did not go
to France i l not.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That is satisfactory.
Section 13 was agreed to.
Section 14 wae agreed tc.
On section 15--minimumn and maximum
of increased pension ini certain cases:
Hon. Mr. POWER: A littile explanation
of that section would noV be out of place.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand this is the onily inerease that is given
to commissioned officers.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Is th-at for
inedical attendance?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Section 15 was, agreed to.
Section 16 was agreed to.
On section 17-time for which payment of
pensions for disability shall commence:
Hon. Mr. FARRELL: What does that
meanP
This
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
amendment is necessitated- by the defirultion
of the words "appearance of the injury or
disease." This deals with the word "disability."
Section 17 was agreed to.

JUNE 26, 1920
On section 18-difference between pay and
allowances and pension to be apphied for
bospital maintenance:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The purpose o! this is to make uni!orm the amount
payable to ail patients in hospital.
Section 18 was agreed to.
On section 19-snnual allowance not exceeding $180 each foi maintenance of
parents:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
new.
Hon. Mi. POWER: The existing law provides:,
When the mnember of the force bas no wife,
or the addItional pension on account of bis
wife bas been îefused, an amount equivalent
to the additional pension for a mnarrIed member of the forces may be paid to him If be ia
maintalnlng, or In the opinion of the Commission is substantially assisting In maIntaIning.
one or both of bis parents.

I do not see just what the change is or
what is the object of the change. The wife
is dropped out altogether in the Bill as it
ie Weore us.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: The exThe
planation as gîven to me is this.
aniendmnent of this section provides foi the
payinent o! an additional pension to a disability pensioner for the parent or parents,
even though he is receiving an additîonal
pension on account of hi& wife or childien.
He may have been maintaining- a parent
as well as bis wife. But the amounit shall
not exceed $180.
Hon. Mr. POWER: There is a provision
bere that $180 may be paid for each o! bis
parents. Take the case o! a young man
w'hose parents are realiy very well.to-do.
Perhaps he is the son o! a millionaire.
Should there not be some inquiry made?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, there
is. Hie bas to prove that hie bas been suppoiting his parents. The case is deteTmined
by the evidence submitted to the commissioners.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.: The parents would
flot be inillionaires if hie bad, to. support
them.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: No. The
matter of support bas to be made very clear
to the commissioners before payment is
m ade.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Ail right.
Section 19 -%as ag"reed to.

On section 20P-sickness and burial expense flot to exceed $100:
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: That is a smal
price for lumber.
Section 20 was agreed to.
Sections '21 and 22 were agreed to.
On section 23 <new section 34, subsection
7)-pension to 'widowed mother not reduced
on account -of earnings. free lodgings or
other amall income:
Hon. Mr. BOeTOCK: What is the alteration in subsection 7?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is au~
amendnient to the first proviso of the pievious subsection 4 of section 34. It is to -be
noted that outside Canada the pension of a
widowed mother would not, be redruced. on
account of lier earnings or on account of
ber having free lodging, and that ixiside
Canada it will also not, be reduced if she
hae an income which does not exceed $240
a year, or $20 a month. If hier income does
not, exceed those amounts the pension shail
not be reduced; otherwise it may be, at the
discretion of the Commission.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Anýything over that
asnount is taken int-o accounit.
Section 23 was agreed to.
On section 24--death pensions payable
from day after death:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the effect
of paragîaph a?
Hlon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED:- Apparently to give the commissioners discretion as to,
when the dependency pension shall start.
IL will not necessarily start upon the death
of the pensioner. It is for the commissioners
to inquire as to when the dependency arises.
Section 24 was agreed to.
On eection 25--supplementary pensions
to members of allied forces:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Why is, that limited
to ail who are of or above the rank of
warrant officer?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Below
that rank they are paid by the Imperial
Government.
Section 25 was agareed to.
On section 26-additional pension to
dependents while residing in Canada o!
members o! A]lied forces domicîled and
resident in Canada at beginning of war to
bring up total aniounit from other pensions
to that o! mnembers of Canadian Foi-ces:

SENATE
lion. Mr. POWER: We should have a
lucid explaiiation of that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This iiz
the outcomne of an arrangement between thc
Imperial Government and -Canada by which,
in the case of persons of the rank of warrant
officer, or of a higher rank, we make up the
difference between the Imperial Government pension and our own, and the
Imperial Government make it good. As is
seif-evident, the purpose is to provide the
pensioners with enough money to enable
themn to live in this country.
Hon. Mr. POWER: If a mian entered the
British army or navy instead of entering
ours, this is to give bis dependents the
same pension that they would obtain from
the Goverument of Canada?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yea, we
make it equal to'our pension rate, and the
Imperial Government repays to Canada the
difference-that is, if they were resident in
Canada before the war.
Section 26 was agreed. to.
On section 27 (new sections 47A and 47B)
Airican War pensions, while
-South
recipients reside in Canada, to be brought
up to amount payable under this Act;
Fenian Raid and Northwest Rebellion
pensions to be increased:
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honestiy I do not
think that is desirable legisiation. The
Fenian Raid took place 53 years ago.
H on. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There are
about ten cases.
Hon. Mr. POWER: But I wish to cal
attention to the fact that although the
American Civil war ended in the spring of
1865 the United States were paying three
or four vears agýo as much as they had paid
at any time previousiy. The widows and
children and other dependents managed
things so that the pensions kept on. We
may find that there are a large number of
Fenian veterans who would corne in and
make a dlaim under this provision. I was
out during the Fenian Raid myself.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: So was I.
Hon. Mr. POWER: But, I may say, I
have flot put in any dlaim up to date.
Then take the Northwest Rebellion. That
rebellion took pince 33 years ago, and the
men who took part in it did not expeet to
receive liberal pensions. It was a very
short rebellion; it lasted only a few weeksand I do not see wby we should go back
years for the purpose of trving to find @orneHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

one who would feel like putting in a claimn
on that account. This is vicious legislation, in my humble opinion. These people
have been satisfied up to a very recent date,
and I do not see why the rest of the country should suiffer now in order to give themn
something that they neyer expected.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
say to my honourabie friend that no abuse
can arise from new applications coming in,
because the provisions are confined to those
who are to-day on the pension list and are
receiving pensions. I understand that the
Fenian Raid veterans and the Northwest
Rebellion veterans will receive, in ail,
about $8,000 a year. As to the South African
veterans, we make up the difference between
the pensions 'which are now being paid to
themn and the amount payable under this
Act.
Hon. Mr. POWER: "It la such a little
one."
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 0f course, these
pensions for veterans of the Fenian Raid
and the Northwest Rebellion are flot granted
for any disability or injury o! any kind?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yee;
they have to undergo a medical examination before they become entîtled to the payment under this Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I notice there is a
difference in wording between 47A and 47B.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: These tire
ail disability pensions, mentioned in 47A
and 47B.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I thought there was
a distinction there.
*Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 0f course,
there are paid to those who suifered the
di6ability or to their dependents.
Section 27 was agreed t,.
Sections 28) and 29 were agreed. to.
On section 30-commencement of Act:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: la there any particular reason for fixing that date?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. It
will require considerabie preparation to
obtain the necessary information to meet
the new rates.
-Section 30 was agreed to.
Schedules A and B, the preamble, and
the titie were agareed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.

THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT.
PROPOSZID AMENDMENT-JOINT .&DDRESS
TO THE KING.

The Senate proceeded ta cansider a Mî~essage from the bouse a! Gommons with a
proposed Âddress ta His Majesty the King,
praying that he may gracioualy ho pleased
ta give bis consent ta submitting a measure
ta the Parliament of the United Xingdom
ta amend certain provisions of the British
North A.merica Act, 1867, in the mauner set
forth in the said Address.
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED movçd
that the Senate do unite with the House
of Gommons in the said Address by filng
up the blank therein with the words "Benate and."
He said: The abject of this is ta sec ure
Imperial legisiation amend.ing the British
North America Act, whereby it will ha
placed beyand ail cantraversy that the
Dominion Gavernment bas authority ta
legislate extra-territorially. 'This legisiatien is desirable chiefly because af the new
conditions which have arisen through the
development af aerial transportation. Nat
only ie the Goverument of Canada estabiishing an air service, but aerial transportation is being organized and established
by commercial campanies. This will iuvalve of course a new branch of law, and
it is desirable that there shou]d b. na
question as ta the authority of Canada ta
legislate for thie punishment 'within its own
territory of violations of the law which
o!
rnay take place over the territory
another nation. It is doubtful whether we
have that authority to-day. 01 course,
every sovereign power bas that authority;
but. owing ta the British North America
Act being silent upon a question o! that
kind, or not dealing with it in express
]ang-uagae, it is very desîrable that we should
secure the necessary legisiation ta permit
o! aur regulations being enforeed. We are
entering into arrangements, for instance,
with the United States, te enforce regulations that xuay be agreed upon between the
two ej)untries respecting aerial navigation.
The Ulnited States, being a sovereign
power, could exorcise jurisdiction extraterritorially to enforce regulations, and persons who violated those regaulations out-

759

side the United States could be punished
rpon their return to United States territýory. It would be uniortunate if we in
Canada were precluded fromn enforcing our
regulations likewise. We do nlot say we
have nlot inherently that righût, by reason
of the constitutional powers which we
already possess, but it is desirable, in
view of aur relations with other countries,
that this should be placed beyond ail peradventure. Our abject is, therefore, ta
F-eek legislation amending the British North
America Act so as ta give us expressly
that authority.
Honm HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen. I have listened ta the very full
explanation my honaurable friend bas
given an this matter. I regret ta say that
I have nat bedn able ta look inta it persanally as much as I would like ta do, but I cauflot ose why this legislation àe necessary.
It does seemn to me that any citizen of
Canada who goos outside the Dominion
aud infringes the law of the country can
be punished when he cornes back if the
Government thinks it desirable ta punish
him.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not if
the affence bas been cammitted outside of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That ie just the
point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, that
is the paint.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The affender can
be punished when he comes back. We eaunot of course punish him if he is outaide
aur jurisdiction.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. It is nlo'
absol'utely clear that we have the right.
for the constitutional reasons I have
pointed out.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: 0f course, if it is
nlot absolutely clear, I do nlot aee any harm
in rnakinga it clear; but I Bhould have
thought that we had that right already.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I think that after the
aviator passes the three-.mile limit he ceasea
ta ho within the juriediction af this Parliament. and it is questionable whether anything he did then would be an offence
ogainst the Iaws of Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
the point.

REPORT 0F SPIDCIAL

in the report of the Comniittee on Banking
and Commerce with reference to the petition
of the Allied Indian Tribes of British
Columrb ia.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlenien. as I under-stand it, if this report is
flow (,oflcuirr-2d in, the position -%ith regard
i,

r J AYTES LOIJGHEED.

to this, Bill will be a rather peculiaxr one. 1
wish to say that I do not altogether concur
in the finding contained in this report. 1
do flot t.hink it goes far enough. The report
s.ays:
The committee beg to suggest. howevel,
that before exercising the authority granted

by clause 3 of the Bill, an endeavour should
firet be made to secure a surrender, under the
provisions of the Ind4an Act of the proposed
reductions or cut-offs.

I appreciate very highly the recommendation of the Committee that the Indians
should be considered. before anything is
done, but I feel that it would be very much
better if clause 3 of the Bill were amended
so that no action could be taken until after
the Department had tried to corne to an
arrangement with the Indians to obtain
their consent to what is to be done under
the Commission; and, if in any particular
case they cannot get the consent of the
Indians and find that they are prevented
£rom dealing with the matter, that they
should corne back to Parliament and ask
for power to deal with the matter without
obtaining the consent of the Indians. I do
not know whether it is wise. to go into a
discussion on that point now, but I propose
to move that amendment when we reach
the order on the Order Paper dealing with
this Bill.
I think it is, a serious matter for the
Government to announce to the country
and to the Indians that they desire to have
this power on the stiatute book before
having shown that there is any necessity
for it. They are altering- the position of the
Indians; and, in view of the situation which
exists in Canada to-day, and, I may say,
almost throughout the world, I do not think
it is advisable for the Government to take
s-uch an action, which may be misinterpreted by the Indians. The Indlans may
feel that the Government is flot giving
them due consideration, but is rather trying to proceed with a olub in itr. hands
in order to, make the Indians do things
which they do flot want to do.
I do not want to -take up the timne of
the Ho*use in discussing this niatter now.
I 'tihink honourâble gentlemen realize the
situation. and I hope they will see 'their
way clear to adopting the course which I
have outlined. if do not w.ant in any way
to hamper the Government in their action.
If tihe Government can show tihat 'there is
any oase in w.hich they cannot get the consent of the Indiane, and that it is in the interest of the whole country tihat a particular
reserve ýshoffld be dea-it wiîth, I would be
perfectx- re-ady to assist thiem in )u-tting

through legie.lation that would give them
that power; but, until it is know.n that they
have tried te obtajn surrendere, and have

Contingent Accounts, be rescinded in so far as
It relates to the retirement of Mr. Joseph Bouchard. Translator on the Senate, Debates staff.
referred to therein.

He said: The rea son thaét 1 make this
motion is this. The action of the Senate was
to retire Mr. Bouchard on the lat of Juiy
next et a certain salary, which, I think, was
heuf the salary he had been receiving. As a
resuit of the~ Superannuation Act now going
through Parliament, which places the retirement of these officiais, in the hands of the
Civil Service Commission, there bas been
nething put in tihe Eýstitmates. te provide for
tihat salary. 0f course, the Civil Service
Commission, under the Act, if it is passed,
as I suppose it wilI1 be, will then be able to
deal 'witih the retirement of Mr. Bouchard
according to the ternis of the Act, and unles
we take this action, as there is no provision
to pay Mr. Bouchard anything, froni the
lst of July he will not be in receipt of anything. For this reason it is conaidered necessary te rescind our former action, and
'ta leave Mr. Bouchard as he ie until the
Civil Service Commission are able to act

cf the province of British Columbhia. The
second clausie cf tihat a.greement, paragraph
a, readse s fohlows:
At such places as the Commissioners are
satiafied that more land le included in any
particular Reserve as now defined than ls
reasonably requlred for the use of the Indians
of that tribe or locallty. the Reserve shall, with
the consent of the Indians. as required by the
Indian Act. le reduced te such acreage as the
Commissioners, think reasonably sufficient for
the purposes of such Indians.

That was the agreemnt mnade between. the
two Gevernments, and it specifically recognized, that notliing should be done
,without the consent of the Indiens. The Provincial Government was quite setisfied with

SENATE
that arrangement at that time, as was the
Dominion Government. The Provincial Government since then have obtained. the passage of an Act dealing with this Inatter,
which is somnewhat similar to the Bill we
have now befere us; but in the Act passed
by the Provincial Legisiature werds were
inserted to the effect that the British
Columbhia Governinent was, quite ready to
negotiate with the Indians. Honourable
gentlemen Nvill understand tfihat, -the Provincial Governinent bas Teally no power to
negotiate with the Indians; that the Dominion is the authority responsible for the
care and welfare of the Indians, and that
anything to be done between. the province
of British Columbia and the Indians must
be dione through the Dominion Governmeut.
But I rnaint.ain that the Act passed by the
Legislature of British Columbia indicated
that the Government of that ipro>vince
desired to show to the Indians every consideration possible in this aspect, and
did not wish to give the Indians the idea
that the Governrnent were using their
power and authority to override the intereats
of the Indians and treat them in a highhanded, arbitrary maniner, but were prepared te do anyth'ing they could te coule
to a reasonahie and equitable settiement
with the Indians.
We ail know that a great portion of the
area-Q held as Indian reserves is good and
valuable land, and that as the population
of the province inereases it is but natural
for people Vo s!ay *thût it should be
extent.
Some
used
to
the fuhlest
pogsbly
people in British Columbia
think that the land la not being nsed as
much as it might be if it were in the hands
of white men; but thait is a consideration
which I do not think should be alloered to
affect our attitude in this matter. The
Indians had these lands set aside for them
years ago, when rthe Indian population in
British Columbia was greater than at the
present day, and when it was very important for the white people that the
Indians should ftreat theni properly and
s.hould live peaceably alongaside the newcomers. Therefore I think that the Governnient of British Columbia were perfectly
right in s1howing that they did not want
Vo act in an arbitrary manner, now tiat the
white population had become so ýmuch
greater than the Indian population and
were in a position practically Vo dictate the
ternis.
I desire Vo draw the attention cf the
House Vo another point in regard to this
agreement. Clause 4 sayô:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOC'K.

The lands which the Commissioners, shall
determine are flot neceasary for the use of the
Indians shall be suhdjvIded. and sold by the
Provinoe ait public auction.

And clause 5 says:
The net proceeda of ail such sales shall be
divided equally between the Province and the
Dominion, and ail moneya received by the
Dominion under this Clause shall be held or
used by the Dominion for the benefit of the
Indiana of British Columbia.

Under thisB arrange-ment the province cf
British Columbia, as I understand, is to
get one-balf of the money for whicoh those
reserves are sold. Under the agreement a
certain acreage will be taken away from
the reserve and a cert.ain acreage will be
added froni the land& of the province of
British Columrbia. But I do not see why
the two Goverruments should have agreed
that the province of British Columnbia should
receive one-ibalf of the 'proceeds of the sale
of t1heae lands.
The report of the Commission deals with
the situation lu British Columbia as they
fouud it at the time cf their investigation.
On page 17 of the report the Cornrnissionrers
state:

The Government of Briti-sh Golumbia, for

Now, the provinice of Britiish Columnbia had
no power to malte an enactmnent of that

They were abrogating a solemn
agreement wvhich h-ad been muade between
tihe province of! British Columnbia and the
Dom-inion., and whjch tihey had neyer properly carried out as they were bound to do.
Then the report, on page 18, quotes the

-the Dominion Governmient entered into this

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Honour-

able gentlemen, I sha-1l net oecupy tihe tiane
great length Lin replying
f riend. What he has
me, demonstrates very
making a charge against
govern.mental administration lin a matter
which apparently is noV fully undersitood.
îCriticiBsm of this kind, which constitutes
a bill of complaint, iqf not a waîl of'complaint, as to the attitude of the Governmîent touching the solution of the Indian
question, is not appreciated by me, at
of thle House at any
to my honourable
stated, it seems to
f ully the inutility of

SENATE
]east from the honourabie gentleman, who
cornes from the province of Blritish Ooiumbia, where he bas been in toýuch with the
administration of the Geverninent ever
eince he has been ini that province. So far
a& I 'have corne In contact with either
triendély or unfriendly critics, no one hais
been able te attack the policy of the Doýminion Government in deairg with the
I*ndianis from Confederation down to the
piresent time. If there ics one feature of our
'Government th-at bas been divested abseiutely of ail political and ail party felfi.ng it
has been the admini.stration of our Indian
affairs; and if one feature has been emphasized more than another in that administration it has been the almost parental
soldeitude shown by the Canadian Governnment in dealing with the Indian tribes of
this coçuntry.
My hocour-able friend bas moved to strike
ont certain words in section 3, and he is
gracious enough te leave the balance of the
section, whioch would be entirely unnecessary, because the Indian Act as it is to-day
bas eil the powers, which this Bill gives,
with t.he exception o4 the part which niy
honouýrable friend strikes eut. Hence I fail
toe ee why he hais left the balance.
Permit. me te say t.hat this legisiation
which niy honeurable friend i6 attacking
has been asked paa'ticuiarly by the Government of British Columbia. When the province of Britieh C.olumbia in 1912 entered
into the agreemnent te w'hich my henourable friend bas referred it made provision
that agreernent for the cut-offe should be
docided by the Indians; but that decisien
bail ne sooner been reaehed than the British
Columbia Gevernnient realized that if eutoffs were made in the event of the Gurrender
net being rs-curedý, then a legisiative branafer
cf the cutoff must be made. If, was therefore necessary that, if the Indianis rofused
to surrender -the cuteffs. the Governments
involved would he in a position te give
legislative effect thereto. That wee casked.
fer by the Governrnent cf British Columbia,
net by this Governinent.
Now let me point eut te heneurable gentlemen the effect cf the mischievous element which my honourable friend insist6
upon callhng in-to existence, namely, tlbat
the Indians sheuld be first approacbed te,
give a surrender, and, in the event of a
Tef u&ai. that this Governianent sheuld cerne
te Parliament and asi, for leg-isiation. Dees
my honourable frienil serieusly think tliat.
if thbe Government approawched the Indians
for a-surrender cf these cutoff s, they would
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

then be justified in corning te Parliament
and saying: "We have deliber«teWý negotiated with the Indian for this cuteif and that
'cutoff; they would net give it te us, and
new we must have legialatien te take it,
absolutely against their will." Why, if anything wouîd lead te trouble, it woull be
that. It ié t.he purpoee cd the Governrnent,
honourable gentlemen,-and I s.ay this upon
a statement made te me by the offieSm
adminieteringu this Act-to protect every
scintilla of intereet of the Indians iii those
cut-oiffS.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: In what way?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In this
way. They intenil te review the whole
action of the Royal Commission in regard
to these cutoifs; they intend te -negotiate
ansd discu-se the whole eubjet again with
the Indians. They do not intend te accept
the arbitrary findi-ngs of the Royal Commission; but, with elhi the advantage of
negetiating ab initie concerning this point,
they propose entering iipon such negot-iatiens; then if the Indians do net surrender
it will be for the Governkment te exercise
itis discretion in giving legielative effect te
the agreement between the province cf
British Co>Iumbia and this Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would that be
by means of expropriationP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
be by meane of legisiation. I arn net prepared te say wbether that legisistion would
net require the action ef bo>th Governments,
in-asmuch as the fee simple is in the province cf British Columbia. I arn not prepared te say that the Dominion Gevernment
could make a transfer cf those eut-effs; but
it could be a party consenting te carrying
eut the Indian Act. Because this weuld be
an arnendrnent te the Indian Act te the
extent cf censenting- te any legisiation involving the transfer cf thee cut-effiq.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Would the Department be .prepared te vary the finding cf
the Cemmissien if it sbould be considered
necessary?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
This is purely a matter of adjustnient of
differenices between the tWo Governments,
and I cannot see how any honourable gentleman with a reisonable inind-and I arn
sure we are ail possessed cf that useful
cemmodity, if we wouid only give it free
play, though cf course we sornetimes cast
impediments in the way-can arrive at any
ether conclusion as te bow- those differen ces

JUNE 28, 192-0
can be adjusted. Surely it wii not be contended that a committee of the Senate could
adjust the differences, or that we could
sit around a table in coenmittee, or in this
Ohamber, and settle ail those difficulties
referring back several centuries, and lnvolving alnost &Il -the constitutionai difficulties; because, as 9eriously pointed oul
by the representative of the Indians, such
constitution-al difficulties .would, place the
people of Brit4sh Columnbia in a position of
jeopardy, and practically lead to a denial
of -t-heir havi!ng any interest lu those lands.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What disposition
has the province cf British Colunmbia shown
so far, as to compensation of the Indians
for whatever bas been taken. away?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
corne to that in a moment. My honoura&ble
friend referred ko the legislation of 1875,
and construed the agreement witb BiAish
Columbia as conveying to the Dominion
Goverrnent a certain ti-tle over the Indians
in their reserves.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: It was following
up Section 13.
Hon. Sir JAM'\ES 'LOUGHEED: It may
have been, but rny honourable friend enxtirely overlooks this point-that ail those
agreenments have reference only to a qualified interest in the la.nd. In the colonial
days, when the two Crown colonies were
adnîinietering Indian affairs-and I hesitate to again refer to thie. hecause 1 have
done it on two or three occasiorns-the agreenient was that the Crown colony of British
Columîbia and the Crown colony of Vancouver Island wvould transfer certain lands
to the Indians for their use and occupation. There never was any agreement that
the fee simple would be transferred to the
Government. but only a qualified interest
in the lands, making the reversion of land
in the province of Brîitish Columbia upon
the extinction of the Indians; and -that
qualification has alwayibeen observed not
only f rom Crown colony .day.s, but from
Confederation downi to the present time.
Section 13 of the Act of Union makes use
of the words, "use and occupation," and
any lawyer appreciating legal termis will
know that a qualified interest in land can
be transferred, givi-ng the use and occupation of the land. and leaving the remainder
or reversion upon use and occupation ceasing. That was the case here. Consequently
the British Columbia Government always
claimed the reversion of ail the Indian lands
which they transferred to the Indians in

765

the province of British Columbia, which
aggregated practically three-quarters of a
million acres, and negotiations had always
to be entered into with the province of
British Columbia as to their transferring
that reversionary interest even after the
surrender was made by the Indians of the
lands which they occupied. This was
always an aggravation, flot only to this
Government, but to the Indians; yet the
right of Britigh Columbia to that reversionary interest was always conceded. Theagreement of 1912 was due verv largelv to the
very fact that it was desirable ko adjust this
difficulty -between the two Governments and
the Indians, and as a resuit the province of
British Columbia a-reed that if those eutoifs were made, and the land s-Id, and the
other differences adtjusted, they would
forego their reversionary interest, taking 50
per cent of the sale of ail lands, while 50
Der cent would go to the Indians. That
refers to the reserves where the Indians
had disappeared or where they had becorne
extinct.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUET: Would that percentage be paid to Indians living in the
province, or to Indians generally?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Indians living in the province; and it is in
order to gîve effect te this agreement that
the two Goveruments have corne together
and arranged for the adjustment o! their
differences. The legisiation we are proposimng to-day is to gîve effect to that agreement.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Had any of those
eut-off s been taken previously?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; they
have ail been deiimited, under the agreement of 1912, by the Royal Commission.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
And they ail
come under this legisiation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. The
eut-off s constitute 47,000 acrer. of the totality o! the reservee in British Columbia,
and in lieu of those 47,000 acres the Indians
got 87.000 acres of land, which wili be transferred by the British Columbia Government to the different tribes in that province. There are good reasons why sonie of
those cnt-off s ehould be made, and why the
Indians should be compelled toe urrender
them, because we know that many of those
reserves are contiguous to civiiized -communities, they impinge upon .many urban
municipalities, and in the -moral interest of

SENATE
the Indians it is not desirable that thev
should livp on reserves imniediately adjoining cities.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is a cut-off
only; that is. only a portion o! the reserve
la to be taken?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Only a
portion. My honourable friend will see Lb it
it is only a fraction, because the Indians
bave in round numbers, three-quarters o! ai
million acres o! land in British Columbia,
and those cut-of!s will total only 47,000
acres.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How many reserves are there?
About
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
res-erves, I believe, in British Colum1,200
bia. Some represent only a !ew acres; some
represent perbaps a few hundred acres. But
coming down to a common-sense basis, bonourable gentlemen, 1 feel that we ebould try
to see if there is any way in whieh the two
governments and the Indians could get together and settie this business. Let us drop
ahl discussion about the eonstitution-al interpretation that should be pie ced upon
the .Act of Union, or the different agreements entered into between the Indians and
the Governnient of British Columbia, or
between tbis Government and that of Britisb Columbia. There is only one way o! doing this: iL i6 for ail parties to get together;
and the intention of this Government is to
get together with the Indiana to settle those
differences just as wisely and particularly
as if no previous negotiations bad taken
place. I therefore oppose my bonourable
frîend's aniend ment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have given some
attention to this Bill, and have perused the
proceedings of the Royal Commission, and
1 must say that I am in sympathy witb
the main part of this Bill. I think, as was
very properly said by the honourable leader
o! the Governhlent, that this question
,should be approached by both sides of this
House without any polit ical bias. The Indian tribes ail over this Dominion have
been treated generously by ail Governments, whetber Liberal or Conservative,
and 1 arn sure that t.hey expect to be treated bv the present Government as they were
My only
dealt with by previous ones.
trouble about tbis Bill is as regards giving
power to this Government to go beyond the
agreement o! 1912, which was limited to
dealing witb Indian reserves; it in no way
covered fishîng or hunting grounds. The
matter bas been deait with by the GovernHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

ment through a Royal Commission, whieh
bas made a report on the Indian reserves,
and I do not think it would be proper for
this Parlianient to go beyond that agreenment and adopt legislation to cover or interfere with or override the fishing or bunting rights of the Indians. For my part 1
arn willing to approve of the present Bill
to the extent mentioned in the agreement
of 1912, because 1 think that it is such a
vexed question as must of necessity be
deait with by the Government and not by
Parliament; for the Government has to
take the advice of its officers and assume
responsibility for its own action. But I
think t'hat, section 2 -of the Bill should be
amended, and as eoon as this House bas
disposed of the present motion I propose
to move that section 2 be amended by adding, after the word " differences"- in line
18, the words, - falling, within the ecope o!

have the power
Governrnent should
to deal with the Indian reserves or with
the cut-offe, but not to interfere wjth Indian fishing or hunting rights. 1 do not
think that, alter the Royal Commission bas
been limited to the Indian reserves and the
cut-offs, it would be proper for this Parliament, in enacting legislati-on to give
effect to the report of the Royal Commission, to go beyond the scope o! the agreement of 1912.
Hon. Mr. POWEll: Honourable gentlemen, I think it is desirable that I should
say a word or two upon this subject. It is
perfectly true, as the leader o! the Governnment bas stated, that in Canada we have
deait very fairly and liberally with the Indians; but the point I cannot quite understand is why bas it been impracticable, in
dealing with Indian lands in British Columbhia, to follow the sanie course that bas
been pursued in the other provinces. I understand that agreements have been made
with the Indians in aIl the other provinces.
Every little whi'le the Government have
made a treaty with such and such Indians
for such and such land. Why bas not that
been done in the case of the Indian lands
in British Columbia? I may 'be muddled
intellectually, but I do not see wby it bas
been inipracticable to do the sanie thing
there that bas been done in other provinces,
and it seenis to me that if that had been
doue no difficulty could arise.
The leader o! the Government told us
that aiter this Bill becomes law the Goverument -will consuit with the Indians. It
seenis to nie, honourable gentlenien, that

JUNE 28, 1920
t.hat is a case of putting the cart before the
horse. I think the consultation with the
Indians should be had before the land is
taken away. I say this in aIl humility: I
do nat profess to understand the question
very thoroughly.
There is one other point that has flot been
made very clear by the leader of the Gavernihent. It is proposed that these lands,
which it is diearly desirable should cease to
be Indian lands, shall be soid, and half of
the proceeds handed over to the provincial
Governmentrs. I really do flot see why
that- shauld be. In deaiing with Indians
in other parts of the country the Government do flot pay over haif of the price for
which Indian lands are sold to the Provincial Governnient; and I have flot yet heard
any good reason why that action should be
taken in British Columbia. These, honourable gentlemen, are the reasons which induce me ta vote for the amendment of my
hanourable leader.
The ainendment of Hon. Mfr. Bostock was
tiegatived, on division.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
For the reasons
whieh I stated a monment ago I now begc to
move:
That this Bill be flot DOW read a third timé.
but that it be recommitted to the Committee of
the Whale Ilouse. and that it be amended by
adding after the word "differences" In clauss
2, Une 18, and In clause 3, Une 30, the following words: "falling within the scope of the
sald agreement."
As I said before, I think it is not proper
for this House to go beyond the agreement.
The great objetion of the Indisins ta this
Bill, and, as I take it, their main objectien, is that it xnay be interpreted as making
away with their fishing and hunting rights.
I think they shouid be reassured in that respect, and that the Government sbouid be
content with the power necemry to deal
with the reserves and the cut-ofis.
Hon. Mr. BELOOU'RT: My honourable
friend who has just nioved has, to my mind,
given no indication whatever of the extent,
if any, to 'which the rights of the Indians
in regard -to picking and choosing are going
to be affected. Unless there is eome danger
of that I cannot quite see why the aniendment shouid be carried. Again, should we
not consider this elenient, that it is quite
possible that when the two Governments
and the Indians get tagether there inay be
a disposition on the part o! the Indians to
curtaîl their -hunting and flshing rights for
a cnnsideratio•'. It is conceivable that the
who¶e agreemnent May turn on that ques-

767

tion. because 1 imagine that there is nothing o! more interest to. the Indian than
his right to fish and shoot. Therefore I do
not see why at this stage we should circumscribe the negotiations to be cftrrited out,
.and if we aocept the a-mendment we may
be taking soxnething out of the agreement
which 'would be the very thin.4 upon wliic-Ii
an agreement wouii be made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
defeat the legisiation.
The amendment of -Hon. Mr. Béique was
negatived, on division.

of the Committee yesterday in presenting
this report,, it is hardly neoessary for me ta
say a-nything. I wish only te give my
reasons for asking for the appointment of
-the Committee. To my mind the Magdtalen
islands have xiever been justly treated in
regard ta their steamn'hip service. I know
soinet'hing of the experience of the province
of Prince Edward Island in trying to obtain
-a eatisfactory eervice. Happily its difficulties have been overcome by the steamer
which has been put on that route.
T-he -Magdalen islands are peculiariy situ,ated. There are three harbours at which
'the steamer ta -the Mfagdalen i8iand-s are
supposed ta cal.i-Amherst, Rindstone, and
<Grand Entry. On the bar ini the harbour
'o! Grand Entry there is only 12 feet of
'vater at high tide; consequentiy the
steamer has ta be specially built so that
she 'vili net draw too much 'water, and at
the same time, in order te, carr-y the freight
ýoffering there, she must be capable of carrying 4,000 barrels ibulk. 8a far, a satisfactory
,steamer bas not been put on te, do the work.
Whiie the compaxly rendering the service
'at the present tirne have done the best they
couid with the steamers uat their disposal,
the reervice has flot been aatisfactory, because the steamers, awing ta their lack of
-speed, are not able te make twa trips a

SENATE
week. In t.he fali of the year freight has
had to be left over from time te time; and,
as the people of the Magdalens are almost
entirely a fishing community, in the fali of
the year they have te get sufficient supplies
to carry them over t.he winter, and their
iisihing supplies for the next season. Honoura;ble gentlemen who know anything of
the fishing industry know that until the
~fishermen have sold their tfish in the fail
they are unable te buy foeur and other neces%ibies, and as the islands are isolated for
~practically six inonths of the year it is
very necessary that they should be certain
-of getting their winter supplies.
Last year the Government did everything
possible to place a steamer on the route to
-carry on the service satisfactorily; but she
failed. The Montcalm was the-n sent down,
-but she failed to arrive until the mniddle
of the 'winter. This epring the service has
~been very un-satisfactory, and there was no
service when navigation opened on the lst
of April. Il the Departrnt had placed the
,matter in the hands of Captain Taylor, the
agent at Charlottetown, I have no doirbt
that a steamer would have been provided
which 'would have arrived at the islands
not later than the 15th of April. The lobster
season opens on the 25th of April and ends
on the 25th of June, and, because of the
failure the previcus faîl and on account of
the steamer flot sailing until the let of
May, the supplies were not received by the
peuple -in time to be of use, but were leit
lying in the steamer at Souris. The 1)epartýment failed in nlot placing thc matter in
the hand8 of a mnan on the spot; and, when
the captain of tlîe ship was sent down from
Quebec, hie found that the steamer had not
eufficient coal on board to xnake the trip,
whicli caused further delay.
As I said in opening, my reason in asking for a committee was to bring before
the Government the necessity of an Minproved service and to place the matter before the Governiment in such a wvay as to
show what would be in the best interest-s
of the people of the isiands. Some years
ago William Leslie and Company and some
others built a steamer -for this service. She
was called the Lady Sibyl. She was capable of 13 or 14 knots an hour, and carried about 3,000 barrels in bulk. She made
two trips every week. This steamer was
so punctual in her trips that passengers on
board of hier could depend on catching
trains, either at Souris or at Pict.ou.
Your Committee have recommended that
as the Government are building steamers
at the present time they should build a
Hon. Mr. MclEAN.

steamer of 4,000 barrels capacity, capable
of e speedi of 12 or 14 knots an hour, and
strengthened at the water line so that iii
the fali she would be capable of going
through the sheet ice, and in the spring
would be able te make lier trips through
the loose floating ice. The people of -the
Magdalen isianda are at the present tîme
paying three Urnes the freight rate that thiey
have had to pay in 1914, and 1 think they
are entitled te a satisfactory service, the
best service the Government can give
them. When one takes into consideration
the fact that a subsidy ot $20,000 a year
is now being paid, if a proper ship were
built and put on the service, the cost of the
operation of such a service as the people
of the Magdalen islands are entitled to
would be very Iittle more than the present
expenditure.

AIDOPTION 0F REPORT 0F JOINT COMMITTEE.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN (for Hon. Mr.
Watson) moved concurrence in the first report of the Joint Cominittee on the RestMurant.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Before this report is
concurred in, because 1 arn a French Canadian and do not understand English, 1
should like te ask what clause 2 of the report means. It says:
The restaurant shall be for the use of Senators and memnbers of the House of Commons
and their families, who shali have the right
of in'viting guefits.

Does that mean that senators and members of the Huse of Gommons shall have
the right to invite guests, or that their families shahl have that right? Could that be
put in English in such a way that a man
from the province of Quebec couid understand it?
BHon. Mr. TANNER: Before this motion
is carried, I also would like .some explanation. I understood at the beginning that
steps were to be taken tewards improving
the restaurant, and rny recollection is that
a special Committee was appointed to look
inte the question. I presuque it was expected that that Commîttee would report
to the House before the end of the Session.
Personally I amn net familiar with the
management of the restaurant, and it is
for that reason that 1 amn on my feet. I
observe that this is descrihed as the tirst

for the Commiiittee to give the House any

House %vas not satisfied, inasnirch as eorlier
in the Session we ag-reed upon the appointnient of a special Coiminiittee for thie purpose of bringing about what was described
as «' mucli needed itaprovenient." 1 shouild
like to know wliat. steps have been taken
in that direction, and I sliould also like to
kn'uv a little more than this report discloses in regard to the administration of
the restaurant. Perliaps it is ever-inquisitiveness on niw part, but I subinit thia
question to li'onourable members of the
Coimiiittee and shall be glad to have any
inf--ilatirn th1t thev cani give mie.
WVit.li reg-ardl to the re.gulatsions which -have
been ma-de. I would venture to inake the
suggestion tiiat these re2ulations should be
suhmnitte tn the Bouse before they are put
int,o operation. I understand that there wvas
senie lit-tie friction in regard tai them. I
do flot know whether this Conuuiiittee has
carte blanche to inake re.gulationz without
the concurrence of the bouse; but 1 shouid
think that, at any rate, it would be expedient an< 1 v.'uld be in line wit-h proper business niiethoi-'s for any Conimittee of this
Ho-use, especiallv sucli a Co'ninittee as
this. when it proposed to makze regu]ations
of this nature, to as], for the concurrence
of the Bous-e before putt.ing thein into operat.i<n.

judgnieiit of the Commnittee has been used
with respect to the management-. In the
early part of the session there was r9uggested the appoint-nient of a Committee to
deal with thle new restaurant. We were to
have an Esmpire club. The 'proposition was
ene that the Cûîninittee of which I arn a
member was not big enough teo deal with.
'1hle members of the Joint Committee considered that the rules adoïpted were quite
proper; but it is certainly open te any member ef the -Senate te 'make any criticism he
wishes. In other years it was neyer considered necessary for the Codmmittee tW report on these, matters te this Bouse or te
the 'Couinions. What has been done may be
right or it nray be wrong. That is a question which la lef t te the judg-ment of honourable gentlemen; but, as I say, the rules
muade by the 'Cenmittee have neyer been
su.bmitted te the House before adoption, nor
lias the Comîniittee reported on its transactirins. In regard te the restaurant, I msay
say that I -have had meals regularly there
since the opening of' Parliament, and,
alt.hough I have heard semne criticismn in
respect to wliat we have to eat, personally it lias been entirely sati-sfactory.'
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I had the, pleasure
et eating some deoayed fis'h, 'whieh poisoned

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: R do nqt think
that the honourable gaentle-man came te the
Comniiiittee and reporteid that. If lie had
done se. I n.s a iernber of the Çommittee
would have taken sentie action and' endeavourel to ascertain how that had oocurred.
I did net -have any et that fish, and did net
know anything abou.t it. If I had, I wo-uld
probably 'have -made some trouble. Hewever,
wit.hi regard te the rules and regulations,
any honourable miemnber can read what they
are and interpret their meaning. Witli Bis
Honour the 'Speaker I have attended tthe
meetings ef the Joint Conrnittee, and I know
that the Comimittee have endeave-ured te
d.i.Qclarge their duties in the best intereats
of the restaurant and of the menibers of
both flouses.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am net questioning
the desire of the Cornmittee at ail. Do I
uniderstand that this Committee that is n-ow
reporting will have ne powver to continue

it te -proceed?

carnot understand why the Committee, in

should decide that while a member of the

It
seems to me that the Coanmitte-e has not
given this matter proper consideration, and,
not ha:ving- given it proper consideration,
they should be asked to do so. Before the
old Parliament Buildings were destroyed 1
had the pleasure of going, to the restaurant
frequently, and I know t-hat it was splendidly cond-ucted. It was very mucli better
oonducted than the present restaurant is.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED inoved the
sceoIIl reading of Bill 14, an Act to aniend
the Indian Act.
He said: This is another Bill to ainend
tle Indian Act. The Bill proposes legislation on two points. The first feature, and
the most important one, is to give authority to the Governuiient to undertakze the
education of chijîdren of Indian parents.
The Governmenl. now inaintains certain
e'lucational institutions for this purpose,
P'nd under the Act powers are vested in
the Governmtent to permit of that laudabie
purpose being- carried out. This Bill, however. contains additional powers. so that
we wiay give the fullesi effect to the stcps
that have already been tak-en and «to the
p1an.4 which have worked out most satisiactorilv on the different Indian reserves
in the Dominion. I think I need flot elaborate on that subjeet, because I appeai
to every honourable Lzentleinen whether
Aiq not desirable that the Government
should assume this responsibility, and take
every reasonable nicasure for giving practical effect thereto. In the past the plan
has worked out most &atisfactorily; schools
have been established upon the different
reserves; they have been manned by competent teachers; Indian children have
been takzen froni their parents and furnished with educitional advantages and
desirahie influencs, and many of- them
have becîne seif-supporting and are today cood citizens. It is necessary that this
work be carried on to a greater extent than
has been done in the past. What I mig-ht
sav is the coroh1arý- of that is the next
feature o! the Bill, narnely. that %ve should
enfranchise the Indians îas quickly as
possible. The fundampntal principle that
underlieq a11 thc work, that is beîng doue
by the Governinent with reference to the
Indians is that thev should be qualified

citizen. taie Governrnent meay take the necessary steps te declare him a citizen, and

To say that we should nùt adopt a welldefined sclicine wherebv, upon the clos.est

Mr.

MttG

of a board includingl representatives iromi
the Departrnent of Indian Affoirs and a

meinber of the Indian band selected by the
band theinselves, te make inquiry int-o the
flt.ness of each mian. As an ad-ditional saleg-uard it is provided that, the Governor in
Counicil "m-ay by order direct t.hat s-uch Indian shall he and becoine enfranchised at
the extpiration of two years from the date

of such order or earlier if requested by such
Indian." So there is a probationary period
of two years during .'which the Indian rnay
avail himself of the responsibilities about
to be assumed. He lhe'n has trans4erred te
hirn the land which he has occupied upon
the lindian reserve, and whatever in'tereist he
inay have in the funds of his band, and in
that way he goes forth as fully equipped for
the exercise of citizenship as any ot-her meniber of the community. Unless we adopt sonte
we1l-deflned policy of this kind, by which
in the proces-s of tinte we nîay bring about
the enfranchisement of the Indians, it must
be obvious that for a-Il tiîne we shall have to
look after the Indians as wards of the
nation, and that is undesirable.
lion. Mr. BELÇOURT: I must confess 1
arn not convinced that a mian can be fit
for citizenship who does not want to becorne a citizen. 1 should think that the
first es-sential qualification for citizenship
is the desire to be a citizen, and if a mati

niatter îvhat other qualifications he may

Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: I do not
want to interrnpt mv honourable friend,
but I wati!d ask, hitui te consider the principle which wiii be invoked in the case of
the inquiry:
It shall be the duty of the Board to take
iiito coinsiclration and report upon the attitude
of any such Indian towards his enfranchise.
irent. whîch attitude shall be a factor in deterînining the question of fitness...

So it is quite apparent that if the Indian
did not, choose to qualify he should not
lie broii.ht ivithin the clauLse.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 do flot know.
I arn afraid that this is aIl wrong--to makc

The agent of each reserve is charged wvitIî
the duty of exercising more or less supervision over any educational work that is

there are Indian children between the ages
of seven and fifteen years," and te substitute the following: "but ne child shall be

idea of forcing these children te go te those
boarding kchois, taking them away f rom
their homýes, is very unfair to the Indians.
and is exercising tee strong power on the

shmuld kunow ail the particulars cf the yards
before mmaking thiese guarantees.

M1ost cf these shipyards, I think, have
bilt up as a result of the policy pursue4f durin.g the 'war, first .by the Imperial
BuniicsIoard afterwards by the
and
Dominion Government, of finding money
for the building cf sqhips. *According te the

liad, been built
or were being *built for

JUNE 28, 1920
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, I might recali to the House that
a couple of years ag-o, or perhaps earlier,
1 made some remarks in reference to shipping, which tended, to .show thýat it was inadvisable for Canada, as Canada was then
circumstanced, to attempt to encourage
shipbuilding iby the ordinary processes of
a bounty on yards or a bounty on tonnage
produced. The scheme presented in this
Bill eeems to me to involve none of the disadvantages which are connected with the
ordinary schemes for the promotion of shipbuilding.
I djd not uziderstand the honourable leader of the ýHouse to say exactly what was attributed to him by the honourable leader
of the Opposition, namely, that this measure was introduced in order to keep some
25,000 men employed and certain yards
busy. At a time when there is need for
thousands and tens of thousands of men in
Canada, it would be ioolish to spend any of
the country'e money, or even te embark
the credit of Canada in trying to find work
for them in that particular way. The situation, it seems to me, is this. Canada in
shipbuilding, as in the manufacture of manitions, displayed an extraordinary and unlooked-for ability, both as to the volume
and the cost of production. My honourable
friend on the other side who shakes his
head has had some experience in this connection and knows thgt a great proportion
of the munitions produced, the hast part of
them, was produced in competition %vith
ail
the manufacturers of this continent; namely, that part supplied by Canadian firms
to the American Government. But be that as
it may, we have shown that we could build
ships, at ahl events, vastly nearer the cost
at which the Enghsh yards, the best in the
world, were producing ships. The cost in
Canada wsas astonishingily near that of the
Enghlish yards.
What Canada is doing to-day is giving an
opport.unity to anybody, partieulsrly any
foreigner, who wants to build a ship and
w-ho wvill find 50 per cent of the cost of it.
The Government w-ill finance the other 50
per cent of the cost, for say about three
years from the time of the completion of
the vessel. The Bill says 57 months. W'ell,
the vessel would take one year anyway to
build. That would mean, at the most,
somet.hing under four years that the Government would be carrying that particular
burden. It seems te me that the provision
of that 50 per cent would be substantial
assistance, and that the shipbuilding yards
in Canada would produce ships at a much

S___50
REVISED

better cost, as comparedl with English costs,
than any firm that now has an opportunity
o! taking part in the work and getting business. If there are any French people, or
any people in some other European country, who want to build ships and can find
50 p>er cent of the xnoney, we will -finance
the other 50 per cent.
I cannot agree with my honourabie
friend the leader of the Opposition as to
there being a parallel between the guazanteeîng of railways and the guaranteeing
o! ships. The railway is buiît under a
guarantee, and if there is flot sufficient
tra-fie between the two terminal points
on that railway to make it pay, the. guarantor wvill be called on-the country will
lose. If this Bill is enforced you will get
the ship for 50 per cent o! the cost, and
that 50 per cent will be reduced every few
months that the ship is available for trade
in any part o! the world.
Shipbuilding has been extraordinarily
successful during the war; but it must
also be remembered that for six or eight
years before the war the shipping trade
o! the world was enormously profitable.
It must be profitable in decreasing deiree
if i-e are to get onto a sound basis, but
it seems to me that withîn the time for
which this guaranteeirig is'done-if, as the
honourable leader o! the Blouse says, these
contracta are carefully entered into-there
is a reasonably good prospect of building
up and strengthening the shipbuilding
industry in this country with the minimum
o! risk f0 its people.
Hon. J. G. TURIIIFF: Honourable
ventlemen, I wish on this occasion to put
myseif on record as being absolutely opposed te any proposition of this kind. You
w
%ould think, when we are asked to guarantee inoney for building ships for France
and ot-her European countries and for
people who want ships at home, that
Canada was in a beautiful position, ready
to lend money te an.ybody if the security.
wa at ahi god
It looks to me as if
the Government were embarking u-pon a
policy simply to help out or to keep up
the big interests that were started during
the war, when conditions were not normal.
This is exactly along the lina o! giving
$25,000,00
to Greece andý .$25,000,000 to
iloumania. It is ail very well giving out
the money, but sometimes it is a very
different matter to gat the money back.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. McLennan) w-ho has just taken bis secat

thinks that 50 per cent is quite safe te
advance on ships; and se does my honourable friend the leader of the House. Wel],
if may be, and it may nlot be. In the
lending of nioney on real estate, the most
that. any one will ilend is 50 per cent. of hie
own valuation of the property, to be safe;
and very. often hie is net sale. Here you
are building ships to-day at double the
cost or more than double the cost, at which
ships could be bujît a few years ago, and
at a higher cost than ships will be buiît
in other parts of the world with which
our 8hips will have te coimpete. At the
end of four years fromn the time these ships
are icomnpleted conditions may have dhanged
-ery îmuch, with. every 6ehipbuildingo
rountry on earth straining every nerve to
àuild ships. In England they are building
as neyer before. 1 amrnflt aware of NYlhat
France is doing; but, knowing what the
French nation are and what they can do,
1 amn satisfied that they are building to
the utmost limit. Four years from now the
situation may be very different: shipping
may be a drug on the market; there, may
be more ships than you can find freight
for; and in that case, I1 venture to say,
those ships will be put on the market and
sold, and you may not get anything like
50 per cent of their value.
-Hon. Mr. McNfLENNAN:- May I cail the
honourable g-entlernan's attention to the
lact that under this Bill the ship would
practically be paid for in four years.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I have known rnany cases in which
money, loaned on more secure property
than a ship, was te be paid off in five
years, perhaps in five equal payments, and
was not paid. Suppose the payment is not
miade--the second payment, or the first
payrnent-what are you geing te do? An
individual or a company is' in a much
better position in that case than a goverfiment. We aIl know perfectly well that a
governiment cannet take the extreme measures that the individual will take, and
if this Government lend money on a ship
and two or three years from new 25 per
cent o! the loan cornes due and is not
paid, what are the Government going to
do? Simply wait, and let the matter stand.
They will net seli the ship immediately.
.So I foresee the risk of a great boss in
connection -with thîs matter.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. fBlosock) was quite
right in drawing a parallel between the
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

raidroads and the shipping. We guarantee
the bonds. My honeurable friend (Hon.
Mr. McLennan) sayis there is ne comparison. ,The twe cases may net Ibe identical;
1 do not say they are. But we have learned
our lesson.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY:
W'hat. guarantee
did you have lor the construction of the
Transcontinental?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: You have the road,
whatever'you guaranteed it for.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY:
Whatever yeu
squandered on it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: You have the ship
also, but you take the ship at a time when
it ir very likely te be worth less than 50
per cent of what it costs te build the ship
to-day. To xny mind this is juist a continuation of the policy of maintaining the institutions that were 6tarted during the war.
WýVe
have $ 1,500l,000,000 on deposit in the
banles. If the ship-building industry were
legitimate and on a businiees basie, would
the financial interest-s -of Canada, the
banks, net look after it? Would they net
undertake te help eut a deserving proposition? But they will net do it, b-ecause it
would net be good business for them. Se I
cay that the G'overnment would do well te
be very ceareful when they step in and
undertake something that the comnion
sense, level-headed, hard-headed. business
men do net eee their way clear te undertake. Why should we, in the present financial condition of the country, corne te the
rescue of other people?
MIy honourable
friend,(Hon. Mr. McLennan) says it is net
fer the purpose o! providing work for the
men, because there is plenty of work for
everybody who wants te werk; therefore it
mrust be te keep going an industry that was
started under mushroom conditions during,
the war, when the AlIlied ceuntries, Great
oeritain, and Canada wanted vessele in the
.werst way, and, net knowing that the war
ivould end when it did, underto-ok a large
programme.
It is stated by the honourable leader
that the business bas proven te be mucli
better and much more profitable than it
was ever expected it would ibe. We do net
know anything sbout that, honeurable
gentlemen.

are we going to do in connection
with the shipbuilding- ind-ustry? We are
going to do -rnuch more. We have good sedurity. There is no possibility-I say this
advisedly as a man -who kTlows so'metihing
about shippin-of the country losing on
the proposition that is 110w being put 'before this House. When the building of a
phip is to be contracted for, the contracter
,must in the first place lie acceptable to the
,Minister of 'Marine and Fisheries, and the
Minister of Finance. He must corne before
thern as a business mani, representing a
business concern that has, some standin.
Re must depoeit 10 per cent of the cost of
the ship -bef-ore the contract is made; and
after lie signs the conti-act lie must deposit
10 per cent more; and lie must continue
making deposïts until he has deposited 50
per cent of the price of t.he vessel. What is
The next thing,? A mortgage is taken i
order that the shipbuilding concern may
proceed to make contracts for the carrying
en of their business and the financing of it.
They cannot expect to get more for that ship
until she is about ready to launcli. Then
the purchaser may be able Vo arrange to ohtain the money. somiewhere else and le
bring that rnoney in and complete the payment. Il lie does not bring in the money,
the Government hold the mortgage on the
ghip and she is flot transferred from the
ÇCanadian register te any other reg-ister until
every dollar of the mortgage is paid. The
vessel is insured for such amount and in
such companies as the Minister of Finance
may determine, and the insurance policy is
held hy the 'builder of the ship or by the
,Government. Therefore there is flot the
slightest possible chan-ce of loss. As I bave
already said, 50 per cent of the total price
is paid by the man who makes the contract; and the contract for the construction
of a ship is not a contract involving $100,MO0,
$200,000 or $30000»0. For instance, a
3,000-ton ship could. not to-day lie constructed for less than $125,000 to $ 150,00ý-and I arn making a very low estimate.
There are ships that would cost something
like $500,000 or $600,000 to-day. 6o 'the contractor makes a deposit of 50 per cent of
the ship, and we take the mortgage on it.
We have also the insurance. 'Moreover, the

lie removed from the Canadian register until
she is paid for. There is not a moment f romn

ship goes to sea that we have to take the
slig-htest risk.
My honourable friend from Ass4nibois
(Hon. Mr. Turrifi) talks about notes and
-says they are very dangerous things. So
they are. But how do the banks make ail
their money if not by notes? How does any
.business man make nxoney but by lending
it or inveeting it in business? True, my
honourable friend- ray have endorsed notes
for somig persons who did not pay, but on
the other hand he may have endorsed, notes
on which he lias made a good deal of nioney.
In this case the Government do not put
up a single dollar of cash; the Minister of
Finance simply endorses the notes when
the contractor is seen to have everything
in perfect order. In the flrst place, the purchaser muet be relLable; econdly, the
people who are go0ing to, construct the ship
.must be reliable; and then the Minister of
Finance and the Minister of Marine and
Fisheries jointly mruet decide that Vhey are
reliable before any credit at all ie given.
1 do not care what Governnîent may corne
into power-and I doo not think there is
any poesibulity of any other Government
ooming into power than the one tiiat is
in now, because they say there are flot
going Vo be any more elections. Therefore
we can be perfectly sure, if we have the
same men that we have now, that very
gc'od progress will be made.
It wae said before that this ivas done for
tise purpose of giving ernployment and
carrying on the shîpyards. I do not say
it is so; but supposing that to be the case.
would my honourable friend say it was flot
well to keep 25,000 men at work in Canada
here? But we could not have that condition
without this legislation. Would the honourable gentleman asay that it was a wise policy
for this or any other Government to allow
an industry to' go down, and those
*thousands of workîngmen to go without
employment, rather than have fIe Government endorse the notes of reputable people,

Hon. Mr. TURIR'FF: I would say it is

want Vo lend it to him, te let hirn have it;
but if you have not the money, don't sign a

that if this Government did flot take this

amn sure every mnan in this House will agree.
If every dollar of interest, every dollar of
subsidy, every dollar of endoreation made
by the Government during the paut years
had been made on the same Uines as this
Bill calls for, we would neyer have lost any

Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: The matter of
security is net the question that is involved
in this Bill. During the war xnany extraoidinary things -%ere done in Canada that
would not have been dore but for the war,
and no one is geing to say that those things
were net justified then. But the war is over,
and if the Government desires te do that
which is wise and judicieus ît will allow
business te take its natural course, and
flot interfere wvith it in any manner or
form. This Government rneddling in business matters is a serious error, and the
sooner the Government discontinues that
practice the better. For instance, who ever
heard anything se ridiculous as the su-Ail

1 can assure the Government that. *without
any question of doubt, suggestions of this
kind do net recornrend themselves te the
wise business cornrunity of the Dominion
of Canada; and if the Government of Canada were composed to-day of business men
as good and sound as rny henourable friend
the leader of the Gevernment, no such
projeots would be undertaken. I arn confident that my honourable friend disbelieves in such an undertaking as this to the
earne extent that I do, and I disbelieve in
it absolutely.
Hon. IRVING R. TODD: The leader of
the Opposition, speaking on this Bill a few
minutes ago, said he theught it was a very
doubtful piece of polîcy. I cannet agree
with hirn, because I think it is the worst
piece of business policy that 1 have heard
proposed since I have been a member cf the
Senate. I would like to ask the leader of
the Government what he would think of a
corporation that would say: "We have a
large debt, our expenses are heavy, we must
reduce our expenses, put in the knife te
the limait we can hardly keep Up." and the
next minute turn around and vole S20,000.It 1is
000 or 325,000,000 worth of notes'
ridiculous on the face of it.
1 cannet agree with the honourable member for Halifax (Hon. Mr. Crosby) in regard
te this class of security. I know ships that
were built 'when shipping was net as prosperou-s as it is new; they neyer paid a dividend from the firist trip, and wit hin five
years they were seld fer ferty per cent cf
what tbey had cost. I think, there is no
question that the Government may rnake

they can in England.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Oh. yes, we can.
Hon. Mr. TODD: And there is a big
shipping policy being carried on in England, and alzo in the United States, and
you will find that the building of ships
will be overdone in the next four or frve
yeare. Why do flot the large financial inistitutions of Canada advance this moneythis fifty per cent? I would like to ask iny
honourable friend the leader of the Government that question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
know. That is their own judgment. I
would say to my honourable friend that I
have not the 8lightest doubt that the large
shipyards of Canada are being very largely
helped by the banks of Canada and the
other financial institutions.
Hon. Mr. TODD: Then why do flot
the banks keep on helping them?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose the banke have a limitation.
Hon. Mr. TODD. I only wish the Governiment had a limitation. The only institution in this country that has no limitation is the Government. I 'tell you it is a
business transaction, and you will flnd inside three or four years that many gentlemen on the other aide will agýree with me
in that.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: You will find you

some knowledgae of the industrial conditions
of Canada to-day, and 1 know of no industry

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,

On section 1-conditions, under which

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: When this Bill was
before the Bouse yesterday, the argument
that Rf understood the honourable leader
of the Government te -present to the House
as the reason why the Bill should be accepted.was that, as is stated in the preamble,
"large numbers of mien are ernployed. in the
shipbuilding industry in Canada," and there
is danger that they mnay be laid off.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I did
flot say th-at. I said that the industry had
assumred' very large proportions, snd I mentioned the tonnage that was.constructed and
-the numiber of men who were employed; but
I did not make that the central fact.

791

industry in this country and, to keep thetse
firms eîuployed, I do not think we s'hould
allow this asslistance to *be given to other
firmis that are not now 'building Ghips' for
the Government or -are not in existence.
I 'would ask my honourable friend if he can
girve us sorne information on this matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the
proposai doee not necessarily relate exclusively te yards constructing Government
ships, nor bas il, relation only to those yards
which are now engaged in shipbuilding. The
purpose is to assist shipbuýilding genevally.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- I would, draw
tAie -attention of my honourable friend to the
preamble.
Whereas large numbers of nmen are employed

in the shlpbuildtng Industry in Canada; and
whereas at the present time there le fnot sufficlent demnand for the construction of ships by
-Canadian purchasers and the Governmnent of
Canada has ceased placing further orders.

Theïse employees the present shipbuilding
yards are about to lay off because Vhey have
ne ordiers. If that be so, is it nlot logica1 for
niy honourable friend (Hon. '-%r. Bostock)
to ask if this meanis what it says-that these
subsidies or these encouragements are for
the prurpose of keepiung those shipyairds

he able to expLain, and probably Nvill explain, that St. John is te be counted iii. But
it is my duty te bring this matter before the
Governmnent for serious consideration. We
in New Bruntswick are net in a very happy
poition: we have net intelligence enough
to be represented in the Governrnent. M-\any
of our represent.atives have shîown their
popularity, or their jocularity, but the Gevernment do net seerm te recognize their
value sufficiently to take theni in. This
will be viewed by our people down there
in a mere serions way than we may at the
moment suppose. There is. as I have said,
-an imimense dock at St. John. and thiere is
ne Teaýsen why ships slîould niot be built
there. In, Beliast, where great ships have
been con.st.ructed, the people had neither
coal nor iron; the pl:ates and the girders
eolhadx& to be conveyed there and erected.
The saïne t.hing ca.n be dome at St. John;

you on this question, as I have sel little

We have only a few members. and they
have gone homîe happy. The welfare cf the
individua'l, I suppose, is of greater iirnportanice tihan the wel-fare ef the nîation or of
the province. Perhaps I nîay be out cf
touch with the situation; but I desire te
bring this question, in a friendhy, sensible
way, te the attention cf the Governnîent.
Did net New Brunswick at one tine have
the third largest fleet cf ships in t.he world?
Did it net build the Maro Polo, wliich in
her day was the fastest vesgsel sail.in a the
ecean on thi-. side of the Atlantic, or perhaps, anywhereý The saine talent is there
to-day and thie saine desire te devehop along

looking te the Governiinent as a kind of
salvater mundi.
I understand that in another place the
Premier stated that hie had been misinforrned about fuel. Winter ivili not bie long
in corning, and we shaîl find ourselves
confronted wit.h the fuel problem. I dare
say the Prime Minister ha-s been misinforrned. I think that if hie had been properly
informed hie would have taken a different
view. Now, I would point out-perhaps it
is the last time I shaîl ever bring up the
question-that there is an abundant supply
of fuel in New Brunswick. There is oi
enough in that province te run almost the
whole country, yet there bias flot been a
friendlv reference to it except what was
st.ated by my honourable friend the leader
of the House a couple of eessions age: hae
said hie would do îvhat hie could. We shial
soon have the winter with us, and every
nionth is vital. Let us get started and
produce. If there were anv doubt as to
whether coal or oul should be produced, or
any doubt as to the quantity or the available markets, or the requirements, I would
certainlv feel that the Governnient were
justified in giving New Brunswick the go-by
in regard to fuel or shipbuilding. We have
nobodv in New Brunswick of sufficient
intelligence in the eyes of the Governrnent
to ha in the Cabinet te protect our interests.
If there were anybody lie would not remain
there long; hie .%ould be hurled out of the
province. I roake these rernarks, as I
said before, for the purpose of asking
the Goveinnient if St. John i-, to got
it z share in thie shi.pbuilding industry.
1 think the answer given by the leader of
tue Governnîent put this Bill in even a
worse liglit than I thought At was in yesterday. I can quite underStand that there
rnight be sonie justification foT the (iovernnient conîing down wjth a Bill of this kind,
and asking the country te endorse notes
for the purpose of keeping bnsy sliipyards,
that are already establislied; but I think
it is a very bad policy te pass, legishation
encourazing other sbipyards 4eo start up
when those that we ahready have apparent.ly not sufficient business.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Do I
-understand my honourable friend to ad'-ecat-e the exclusion cf ail yards that hiereafter cerne into existence?

Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: No. The point I
amn trying to make is this. The shipbuihding
industry is like any other itidustry in the
country: it should ha runi on l)nSiriess lines. If there is no -business for

JUNE 29, 19--0
the present yards, other yards certainly will
not corne into existence. But if a group of
gentlemen get together and think they can
form a company and esta'blish a yard, and
get the Geveinment to back their notes,
tbeymnay be encouraged to start aniother yard
hich at the
in competition. with yards -w
present time require assistance.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
not that be a good thing for the countryanother successful yard?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not thinh- iL
would be a good thing Lo encourage competiLion with yards which are already in existence and which have flot enougli to do.
Hon. Mr. PROU DFOOT: I should like
to ask the honourable gentleman a question.
Has the honourable gentleman considered
the use of the words in the preamible:
And whereas Itl s advisable to assist In
financing the construction of ships in existlng
Canadian shipyards.

Do the provisions of the Bill extend any
farther than that?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The leader of the
Government has said that thev do. When I
read the Bill. yesterday I thought the assistance which wvas Lo be given was conifined
to yards already in existence; but the leader
of the Governmnent to-day has given an
answer somewhat different from that. That
la the very point I arn trying to bring home
to honourable gentlemen in this House
-that the legaisiation goes further than we
thought it did. In view of what has. been
saîd to-day, I think the Bill is evei -more
objectionable than I thonght it was yesterday. I think iL is very questioniable whethei
this legiglation should be adopted at the
present time. The leader of t.he Governrnent
has not shown to rny satisfaction that the
already-existing yards require assistance.
WVhen the question is rai-ed as te t.he
providing of money for the purpose of enabling foreign companies te Lget shipa built
in Canada, we find the provision in the Bill
that the Government will not. take rnortgages
on those ships, but wvill take other approved
securitv. IL does flot seem Vomie that there
is muchi likelihood of this money being ue-ed
for that paTticular purpose; it is more likely
that the rnoney would be used for the purpose of assisting people in New York, or
some such point, where the notes wiii probably be financed, to corne here and build
ships very much te their own advantage.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would not that incidentally be of advantage to Canada'

793

Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: Certainly.
Hon. '-%r. FOWLER: Would Lhey not
spend the money here for labour and materials?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK. Certainly, if there
was enougli business for the Canadian yards.
I want to draw attention to a sta.tement
made the other day in another place when
an item on the Estimates dealing with
steamships subsidies was being discuseed.
IL was pointed out, 1 understand, by the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, that
some of these subsidies could flot be
continued by the Governrnent
eause
there were not sufficient sbips te put on the
lines te do the busriness. Surely if the
shipyards required work te keep their men
going the proper thing te do would be te
build ships te supply the people of our own
country with facilitiesQ for carrying on trade.
If, as is apparently the .caze, we have not
enough ships for our own needaz, surely we
would, rather be building them than helping
other people te corne in front outside tO
take up these yards with our credit.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I should lîke te ask
the leader of the Opposition a question. Doee
lie hiniself, or the honourable gentleman
fromn Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power), or the
honourable gentleman frornt Fredericton
(Hon. Mr. Thompson), or the bonourable
gentleman to bis rigbht (Hon. Mr. Dandu,and),' think that thev, or I invself, should
he precluded from forming a company and
building ships and taking part in world
trade?
Since the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman bas put the question
to me as well as to others, I draw attention
to the fact just nientioned a mîomnt ago.
that this Bill is te provide assistance to
existing Canadian shipyards. That does not
preclude tbe opening up of other shipyards.
But, if it is true that there are 2-5,000 men
threat-ened with being laid off, I would
suppose that tbis menley was for the purpose of keeping tbem employed. That heinthe ca-se, I think it would be very injurious
te the country~ for the Government to subeidize new companies or te, sig-n notes te
assist in tbe opening up of new yards.
Hon. Mr. M.NURPHY: Why could not yon
and I open a yard and employ some of those
men?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That could be
done. But if shipbuilding in Canada is te
succeed iL must adjust itself te existing
conditions, and I do not think iL would be

794

SENATE

conducive to the health of the industry to
expend money in euch a way as to bring
utter failure to existing shipyards. I suppose
we have at present as many shipyards as
we need, and if we can keep them going 1
think we may cong-ratulate ourselves.
I arn rising, not particularly te answer
my honourable friend <Hon. Mr. Murphy),
but to ask the leader of the Government if
he can lay on the Table the correspendence
which bas brougaht this. Act into being. The
Minister of Marine and Fisheries has
stated that foreign countries wanted to
build ships in Canada, and that, while they
were neot ready to pay the cost of building
them here, they would under this arrangement pay up te 50 per cent of the cost, the
Government guaranteeing the other 50 per
cent. There is ne such statement as that
to be found in the preamble of the Bill.
Apparently this Bill is the resnît of negotiatiens with foreign countries or foreign
firms for the building of ships in Canadian
yards. 1 do not know whether the information I aak for has been lurnished in the
other Chamber; at ahl avents, I have neot
seen it, and I would ask the leader of the
Government if he can hay before us the
correspondence leadiing up to the present
legislstion.
Hon. Mr. GORDON,' Honourable gentlemen, this measure appeals to me .as being
a step in the right direction, and one of the
best business propositions which se far bas
been put forward by the Government. It is
designed to have ships built in Canada
which otherwise would not be buiît here. 1
understand that certain corporations in
Europe are willing and anxious te have
millions of dollars worth of ships built in
Canada provided t.hey receive help in the
fin ancing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the honourable gentleman seen that correspondence?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No, but I was informed of that.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He bas more faith
than you.
Hon. Mr. DOM\VILLE: We live by faith.
Hor. 'Mr. GORDON: As I say, this Bihl
is designed se thiat ships, may be built in
Canada which otherwise vould not be built
here. I think any honourable gentleman
will read'ily adnmit that if-th-at end can be
accomplished without. the -country having te
put up any money it will fbe -a geod thing
for the country at large. There is nothing
which tht country requires te-day -more than
meney. The building of these s-hips is going
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND-

to be the means of givring the ceuntry hundreds of thousandts cd -dollars not only
through taxation on the material use&i ini
the construction of the ships, but also
through the taxation which will ha paid
by the hands employed in constructing the
vessels. One honourable gentleman said
yesterday that he knaw of vesseIs which had
been built years ago, and which liad bean
held for four or five years, and then, upon
sale, had realized not more than 50 per
cent of their value. Assuming that that
might happen li this case, Rtdo not believe
that there would be -any k>ss, because the
taxes would make up the hoss. I de not
believe there isa a chance of such a thing
happening in any event, because the money
will net lbe advanced te the ahips' purchasers. In addition, -the Government will
have las &acurityflot only the mortgage, but
aise the company, and I amn sure that thay
will *be very reputaible firms. If any
reasonable care is taken in selecting the
firnis and in guaranteeing only for good,
reput-able business people, the lests which
my henourable friend, seeme. te fear so mnuch
will never take place. 11f, instead of guaranteeing 50 per cent te these companWes, the
Governrnent were adivanicing the money, I
would. be the first ont Io stand up in thîs
Bouse and oppose such a policy.
One honourabbe gentleman ssked yesterday 'why these èpeo.ple dd net cerne te our
banks fer the *meney. He said that the
banks of Canada had on deposit to-day over
$1,600,00,000. I,presume tihat. the honeurable gentlem.an's statament as te the amount
on depesit in the banks is correct; but I
weuld point eut te hi-m that the fundË- of
tht banks in Canada are pretty -wehl employed te-day, and. I would ask him. why
we alheuld' prevent these people from bringing in what we se much desire, and thus
enasbling us to -acquire new capital?
'Hon. iMr. i'%ITCHELL: Whiere 'will the
Govertiment get tht inoney if net from the

Hon. Mr. G~ORDON: TheGovernment is

Hon. Mr. GORDlON: Supposing any shipbuilding llrrn were to build a ship costing

aven under existing conditions, with the
high cost. of construction and so on, would

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; but
1 would say to rny honourable frîend that
if t4ie orders do net corne the Government
will flot have te incur the obligation.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlenmen, 1 do not presumne te know enough
about the matter which is now before the
House to undertake te deel with the details
of the Bill; I leave that to honourable gentlemen who are better infornied; but the
preaanble of tihe B:11 paaces the inatter in a
light in which I think it should bie considered. The experience of Canada, as well
as of other countries, is that it is net desirable that Governrnents should go into limes
of business which oan be transacted by
private enterprise. We *have taken hold of
railroads, and w-e have now a fair idea of
what the practical resuit of Canada's underta.king te run nearly &il the railoeoa.di of
the country is likely te be. And now, flot
satisfied with dealing with the rairoads,
it is propesed that the Governrnient should
interfere in the matter of shipbuilding:. I
know that seme littie time ago the Goverument djd interfere, and there was perhaps
some justification for the Government's
undertaking to build ships at a time when
the tonnagae available for traffie was not
at ail equal, to the traffic which offered;
and, ini order to relieve the traffic distress
which ares-e in ilhat condition inf things, the
Governrnent undertook to build ships. While
I thought that that w-as an excusable thing,
I believe it was a mistake. If there was
se great a dernand for toknniage. private enterprise, if given trne, would hai e met the
deniand.
Hion. Mr. GORDON: Doez my honourable friend think that the risi, cf endorsing
notes for ships is as hazardotis as the risk
of endorsing for the railroad&-Hon. Mr. POWER: I t.hink the hionourable gentleman lias had sufficient experience
to make him a littie cautious about endorsing even the ,best-looking paper; and, if
these foreign gpvernmnents are anxious te
have ships built in Canada, why do they
not have thern built by the shipbiuilders
who are eng-aged in the busince-s? That is
what I cannot see. I do not see why t.he

there is a private company at work building ýships. That cornpany employs three
thousand men, and it does net seeins te me
te be the right thing fer this Government
te interpose itself between that company
and the foreign gevernrnent, if there is such,
that desires te have a ship built. That is
the way it strikes me-that if the tonnage
is needed and the customers are there w'ho
are prepared Vo pay for it, the Government
lias ne business Vo interfere; and, if there
is ne one able Vo pay fer tbe building of
ships, then the sbips had better net lie

Hon. 'Mr. FOWLER: Wben I first glanccd
over this Bill it struck rne that it was a
very good Bill indeed, a step in the righit
direction; that it tended te encourage shipbuilding in this country, providing a market
for ship labour and for varieus materials
that go te make Up the ships. But when 1
heard the speech of one honourable meniber
ef this Huse, and ebserved the ominous
silence cf another benourable member, w-ho
very iseldem misses an opportunity te enter
into a debate, 1 began te think that thiere
miglit be semnething behind ail this thoat
vas not quite rigbt. The hioneurable meniher
for Rothesay intimated that the merger w-as
behind ail this legisiation. The honourable
member for De Lanaudière (Hon. -'Mr.
Casgrain) has been conspicueus in this
debate by bis silence; therefere it woffld
almost look as if there w-ere sorne connection
l)etween the merger and this assistance to
shipbuilding. if thiat. be the case, I shal
sean with suspicion the various sections of
this Bill; but., if net. 1 Nvill revert to ni '
original opinion, thaf this measure is really_
in the interest of the country and szhould

right, or to continue the shipbuilding programme at the expense of the country; but
it did seem deairable, if feasible, to continue
having ships built in Canada, Vhereby
preventîng the closîng down of that industry
both on the Pacific and the Atlantic coast,
and the Vhrowing out of employment of
approximately 25,000 men now engaged in
shipbuilding, and an almnost equal number
engaged in subsidiary industries which
construet the materials which must go into
the building of shipa; engines, etc. There
is a demand for chips that is not satisfied.
There ia capital avaîlable in foreign countries, one in particular, that would like to
obtaîn ships; but Vhey cannot furnish the
cash to -purchase those ships in this country
at this time because of the tremendous lo.ss
they wouid sustain by reason o! exchange.
Therefore it did seem feasible to provide
some means whereby the country, at no
expense Vo itself, and with ample security,
would be in a position Vo assist in continuing
the shipbuilding industry until the now
disorganized exchange situation becomes
more normal, after which time it is hoped
that the industry will be contînued indefinitelv and permanently in the ordinary
run oi business. It is well known that shipa
can be produced in this. country as cheaply
as they can be even in English and Scotch
yards. The shiphuilders there cannot supply
the demand, because they cannot get sufficient materials at the moment, and are
refusing orders, and the purchasers o! the
world are an.xious Vo come to Canada because
of the financial situation which I briefly
referred Vo, as they find themselves unable
to .- t the cash at the moment.
e
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On what does
the honourable gentleman make his statement thbat other countries are anxious to
place orders here?
Hon. Mr. ýROBERTISOjN: On information
t-hat bhas come to the Government, and
inquiries made by those wanting te purchase shi.ps in this country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA'ND: What cibjeiction
ire there to ]aving that information on the
table?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have flot the
information Vo lay on the table. If thic
measure passes, in ail probability it wili
not cost tlie Government or the people ai
Canada one cing-le dollar. Each ship is Vo
stand on ils own bottom, not as belonging Vo
any one corporation, or combination and is
Vo be ils own security for the Government of
Canada, -which would by this means- be
amply eecured for about 50 per cent o! the

797

co6t. Il it happened that the owners, who
must put up 25 pet cent of the cost of
eaieh ship in cash, failed to meet their
liability, together 'with the additional 25 per
cent 'which the shiphuilder himself murst
be prepared, to ris< before the Government
is in any way implicatedi, they -must lose
their învestment and the Government bas
the first security upon the aship. So it must
be
adm*itted
the
ships
themselves
constitute an ample security for the guarantee which *the Governiment makes, and it
will retain, for Canada this imtportant industry, and guarantee emp.loyment to anywhere from 40,000 to 50,000 men at a period
of time which we are now approaching,
when the -prospect of unenmployment during
the coming winter and the next year is one
for very grave concern. From the standpoint not on-ly of maintaining the industry
itself, but of lenoding such aid as we can to
provide einployment for the large number
of skilled workmen who *might otherwiee
emigrate from the country, and, without any
risk or cost to the country, this is a decsirable
measure, and I hope it wi1l pasc.
Hon. Mir. DOMVILLE: My honourable
friand. does. not reach the bottom of this
question. He has said, it takes iron to build
thoce ships.
Undoubtedly, unless you
make them of something else. But where is
the ion to corne from unless this country
produces it? From the merger, absolutely.
The current &tory iG that they are giving
20 per cent, or promieing it,. for taking up
their ctock. The-, have had aLI this m'oney
tiiere, and theY coudd easily negotiate an
exchange -for the shipbuil1ding through New

many people who say there îs no rooney;
but il you go down our way you will. find irom
50 Vo 200 littie Chinese ehopa collecting
interest, but they do not w.ant Vo lend it.
That money la being produced for the

kenzie and Mann in their heyday sent three
or four trains to the West,. I got three telegrams to accompany the party, but I
replied: "No, you can't catch me with a
drink and a free passage." But all those
gentlemen went there and they whooped it
up for the Canadian Northern; their hands
were tied, and the Government finally had
to take it over. What could they say? They
had been entertained; they had eaten salt
with theiýr bread. That would be foreign
to my ideas, and is se to-day. I think this
shipbuilding question is a very large one;
it is like throwing your bread on the water,
as the Scriptu.re says, and it may return
égain, -but it might return without the crust.
I have esked the honourable leader of the
Government to give us some assurance that
St. John i6 not to be ruled out in the
Subsidy Act, but that we axe going to be
encouraged,. so that I can say when I go
home: "Look at what the Governrment bas
done; it is going to give us a chance to
build ships." They will eay: "Where axe
our members? what did they say?" Wel, I
don't know what to answer; they did not
say afnything. If they ask me, "How do
you know the Government are going to do
that?" I will answer: "I don't know at aIl,
but I believe it, I hope it, because I hope
the Gover.rnent of the day is intelligent."
All I ask is that there should be in this
Bill something to show that St. John is
a shipbui.dng port. The minister does not
want to give us the assurance for which I
ask, but we shall not be ruled out of court.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I think if there
was anything to convince this country that
the Bii should not be passed it was the
speech of the honourable Minister of Labour
in which he said that if some assistance
were not given, the shipyards in Canada
would be shut up and many thousands of
men would be thrown out of employment.
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable friend would quote me correctdy he
would not say that, because that is not
what I said.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It is very difficult

to hear my honourable friend. He talks so

low that anyone sitting behind him does

not hear him distinctly; but I know he
referred te the closing up of the shipyards
and the puttiing of a lot of men out of
employrment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is my honourable friend's own misfortune if he is sitting behind the minister, for he need not.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I chose my own
seat, and, while I do not agree with this
measure of the Government, there is a
great deal that my honourable friend on
that side says that I do not agree withnot for one second. Generally speaking,
I am favourable to the low-tariff policy that
we used to advocate on that side of the
House, but I am not so sure that a good
many of my honourable friends now advocate that policy.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: You will again,
when you come-back to us.
Hon. Mr. TURRlFF: My sympathies are
altogether with the Farmers' party, I am
much more in favour of the Farmers' party
and the policy they advocate, because 1
believe firmly that if they had the opportunity they would go a good deal further
along the lines that I believe in than.

whom I formerly acted.

neither here nor there.
If I have misinterpreted my honourable
friend I apologize for not hearing him correctly; but I understood the trend of his
argument to be that if this assistance were
not given shipbuilding would cease and
men would be thrown out of employment.
Now, for whom is this legislation passed?
It is not for the labour men, because there
is not one labour man in Canada who, if
the shipbuilding were shut down tomorrow, could not get work, plenty of it.
at good, high wages, because there are
hundreds of industries to-day suffering for
lack of men: they cannot get them for love
or money.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman a question.
Does he believe that a technical rivetter
could get as much pay working on a farm
in the Northwest as he could earn in a
shipyard? It is nonsense to talk about getting enough to keep body and soul together.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I am not speaking
of work on the farm, but I see there is a
call for 50,000 men for the farms in the
And let me tell my honourable

friend, if he does not know it already-but

JTINE 29, IP1 think he does-that the men on the farms

are getting jxust as fQx ahe.ad. so far as
money is concerned, as the men working
in factories, when board and lodging and
other factors are considered. There is no
use in rny honourable friend bringing up
that argument. It does net affect the question for one moment.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why should a
skilled mechanic be obliged te go and work
on a farmn at something he knows nothing
about?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I arn not referrin1g
to a skilled mechanic working in a legitimate trade. If shipbuilders can afford
-te
hire such a man and pay his wages and
build ships, well and good; but if they
cannot do that what are we going to do?
Are we going te ta;r the people of Canada
for all time to help up the"e infant industries.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There is no taxation necessary.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Who are going ta
benefit by this? It is not the labour man
particularly.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Will the honourable
gentleman excuse me again?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Well, I would
rather that my honourable friendHon. Mr. FOWLER: I amn not te be excused?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Oh, yes, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would my honourable friend point out under what section of

shipbuilders %'«ho
of the rnoney will have to go to the banks to

1 have no quarrel with the statement
made by the Minister of Labour, but I restate my question. There lias been correspondence on which this legisiation is
hased, either ernanating- directly fromi the
parties wlîo want ships or coming through
their representatives in tis country. What
good reason lias the Governnient to offer to
this Chamnber whv this correspondence,

'Dividends"

shaîl

divid-

There was some doubt as to 'whether
stock dividends were included in the former
Act.
Hon. Mr. .PROUD)FOOT: Do the '«ords
"stock dividends" mean this? Supposing
a company la not ini a position to pay a
cash diividend, and it pays a dividend in
stock. fis if. intenided that that stock shonuld
be t.axed as part of t.he income? It may not
meani ca.sh at ail.

JUINE -29, 1920
lion. Sir .TAIES LOUGHEED: 1if a
represents profits nmade since the Act camne
into force, then it is taxable.
Hion. 3Mr. BOSTOGK: This Bill seems
rather peculiar in one res.pect. It is made
retroactive and there are dihfferent dates
at whicb various clauses shall corne into
effect. I would aek the honourable leader
of the Governument te indicate regarding
eacb clause when it is proposed t.o nake it
effective. I think I arn rigbt -in saying t.hat
this first clause withl regard to stock dividends goes back te 1917?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It is rather difficult
to understand exactly what is the date on
which each clause is to fake effect.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Sinice t.he
Act camne into force the Departmient has
given effect to the interpretation which is
here st.ated more clearly. This is simply
declaratory of the interpretation that the
Department has always given to the Act. It
is net introducinga a niew element for taxation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It really niakes
ne change at ail in the administration?
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it is
sirnply declaratory.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I desire to'ask.a
question as te the effeot of this. These et ock
dividend-s, il assumne, can be taken only from
a surplus. If that surplus is left it is entitled to be treated as capital.
lion. Mr. MURPHY: No.
Hion. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hion. MNr. SMITH: Not necessarily.
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
question does not apply te the Incoine War
Tax at ail; it applies only te the Business
Profits Tax.
Hon. '-%r. MURPHY: Some honourable
miinbers may not be conversant with this
inatter. In mvy ret.urn I inserted isoinet.hing
whichi affectsz everybody in this Chamber
and in the other House as well. 1 put in
as an exemption $1,000 for the extra cost
of living at Ottawa and for the performance
of n duties du ring the Session, and. my
good friend te the right (Mr. Breadner)
writes and sys lie ixnight allow nie $10. I
think lie is probabiy a little parsiimonious
in bis judgment. It is just as reasonable
that 1 should, -et tliat exem~ption as that an
allowalice should, be made for the wear and
t.ear oi mîmy
house. This is an expense inS-M5
~nvIsî:n

soi

curred iii tbe performance of rny d'uty, and
there should be an exeiplti
for everything- that pertains thereto.
Section 1 was agreed- te.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Clause 2 of the
Act of 1919 states:
Deficits or losses sustained in transactions
entered into for profit but not connected with
the chief business, trade. profession, or occupation of the taxpayer shall not be deducted
from Income derived f rom the chief business,
trade, profession or occupation of the taxpayer
in determining his taxable inceme.
And the addition here is:
-and the minister shall have power to determine what deficits or loases sustained Ia
transactions entered Into for profit are connectPd with the chief business. trade. profession or
occupation of the taxpayer. and his decision
shall be final and conclusive.

1 should like te know if thë -conîverse
would he true. Would basses sustainedý in
transactions entered into for -profit, but net
connected witb the chief business, ioe ded'ucted froru the incomne?
Hon. Sir JAiMES LOUGHEED:- It would
depcnd upon the niature of the transaction.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 arn speaking
of an exactiy similar transaction. I buy a
stock on mnargin, or pay in full for it. It
goes down in value and I sustain a bass,
and in virtue of this Act I cannot dediucl the
loas from my income. Then take the other
case. 1 buy a stock and it brings -me a
profit. Does that go te increase my inceme
on which II pay a tax?
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
bonourable friend were a stock broker it
would, but as lie is net a different rule
would apply. That, as 1 understand it, is
the principle upon which the income is
determined.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I mentioned a
stock transaction as an illustration; I could
mîention inany others. for instance, a real
estate transaction. If a man is not a real
estate agent or a broker, and goes into a
real estate transaction, and sustains a bass,
lie cannot deduct that losa from his income.
If that transaction brings a gain, does it
affect the tax?
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
bonourable friend wvil1, I think, appreciate
the fact that if be were perniitted te go into
nmany side businesses and speculations he
înigah-t destroy the whole of his income and
render it unrealizable upen for taxation;
consequently it is necessary teo prehibit anything of thiat kind. That. is te say, if my

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let us
draw a disinction b.etNeen the incomne and
the tax itself. If a taxpayer makes a wronfui return ais te income, then he is pen-aIized, but not as te the Vax itself; he rnay
misapprehend what the rate is. Th-e penalty e2etends only to bis rna.king a wvil'fully

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He rnay make
such wrong ret.urn on the inerne because,
with his lirnited knewledge, he oannot, set6f.act.orily interpret the Aot itself. W~e were

be deduoted, if upon stocks, -we have heretofore left it te the Government to dedtict

A few rnon-ths later we have received from
the deparitirnent -a sta-tement wlhich they
prepared, wrîtaining ail the dedndetions and
the additions thatt the depa.rtrent wvere
pleased to na.ke. I arn quit-e sure thstt

-was useless to look to the depawUtnenit, for

of geing 'to the represqent.a-tive of the department in his cent-re, ebo'wving hlm his et-alement, and verifying hi6 conclusions. If
that is net done, I knowv thbe depsu'tment, will

co&nclusioins as tie thie amount wvhich tiîey
owe. undless they w-ent te a lawyer or a

Hon. Sir JAM,\ES LOUGHEED: The Department bas inspectors in alînost every
centre. and the publie are not only invited
but welconcd by the inspector for the purpose of bis communicating to them ail tl'e
information th2y need. In addition to that,
literature is distributed te ail taxpayers
with tbe view of giving thern ail the information possible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I make these
rernrrks because I feel that the public wil
[e very rnuch demoralized.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; we
will look after the public.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tbey have te
face thie tbreat of those numnerous penalties.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: There.is ne penalty.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOrC: I see a further
objection to subsection 7 of section 10, reqiiiring- the taxpayer te pay 25 per cent
v-ith bis inceme return, and the balance
in tbree equal bi-rnontbly instalments therealter. The next tax wiIl be payatk.e in
April, but he %vill net receýve notiýce until
Octoher. On the 30th of .~rlor thereabouts he will be required te make his return. and as the tex for 1920 cornes due
at that tirne be bas te pay the 25 per cent
on it, and if he does net then psy that 25
per cent he must psy 6 per cent on the
balance ef the instalnents. It looks te me
as though this would work a hardship by
requiring people te pay twe taxes at the
same tirne. 1 think further turne should be
given for rnaking the payrnent called for in
this subsection. I understand the Department checks over the returns sent in, and
after tbey' bave done se the taxpayer gets
ii statement showing wbether he is right
or wreng, an'i he will be aske-l te make goed
a shortage if there be one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Provided 1 arn
not penalized.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: You will -net be
penalized.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOI7: I think subsection il wili interfere very nîuch with the
investiluent of înoney in thisz .ountry. It.
points out that anybody in control ef funds
frein non-residents is beund te wake a return
of the income and a tax on that nioney is
te be previded fer. If we are going to tax
rnoney invested in tiîis country in that way
we willi find that peeple will net send
money bere for investrnent, and we will
be very rnucb harnpered in secuiring money
frein outside as we have done in the past.

SENATE

My principal objection, however, is to subsection 7, and 1 thinkz we should have more
time to send in the return so as flot t0
have two taxes coming in at the saine
time.
Hon. Mr. EDWARIYS: It secnms to nie
the most serious part of this Bill is subsection 7,which practically enforces the payment of two years' taxation in one. 1
think, it w~'i1 flot only be difficuit, but many
people wil find if impossible.
Hon. Sir JAMIES LOUGHEED. I do flot
know how mv honourable friend makes out
that if wiil require two years' taxes to be
p -idi in one. The assessment will be made
in November, 1919, for 1920.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We paid this

1919 aiso.

The Governmrrent has been atfacked in
every possible direction. Complaint was
made that they had been remisa in placing
in motion the proper maichinerv for the
collection of this tax, but they n sooner do
that than fhey fail under the criticismn and
censure of honourabie gentlemnen.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS. I do not want to
inipede this measure in any -wav but if the
past practice prevails her-eaftei-fhle 1918
taxation, for instance, was not payable tilI
1919-1 azsert that wlhen von makie the retnrn for 1920 you will pay yoiir taxation for

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
be ail righft after that.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: If there is anything
in tlîis Bill for whielh I conîmiiend the Goverrnment it is this parficular section. They
have lost millions of dollars during the existence of this Act because they have nof
collected the money proniptly. As to the
argument of the honourable gentleman
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Edwards>. if seems
to mie that the taxpayer ouncht to be very

weli satisfied that lie bas had the Governnient fo carry hi- taxes for hlmii for a year

for nofbînz. He ich-t be well content to
pay two taxes at one time. He only has to
pay 25 per cent down. but in any case hie
lias hiad the use of the tax mcmey for a
year. which lie ouglit not fo have hiad. Moreover, there is a very strong suspicion
tbrougbout the country thaf there are thonsanda of people likie the person my hionourable friend froin Montreal (Hon. Mr.
Boyer) spoke of a few moments ago, who
hiad flot paid their taxes and hiad not made
any return. The Goverrument. have lost the
use of that money, fhough they wvill no
doubt collect it some day. This man who
bas escaped paying bis taxes will suddenly
find he bas to pay them; but in the meantime the Government bas been done ouf of
the use of that money. It seems f0 mie
this section is an admirable one, as if will
compel the prompt payment of taxes, and
secure for the Goverrument the use of the
money.
Hon. Mr. McCALL: I hiave an observation f0 make on this Bill, and I do it with
the more pleasure because the able administrator of fhis Branch is present. Reference bas been made f0 the difficulfy of
making up returns. I have a case in mind
of a medicai man who derivea income
from bis practice, against which hie can
set off his expenses; lie is alsn interested
in a drug store, froni which he gets aonme
profit; he owns a farm, from where he derives some profit; he la interested in a liffle
fruit ranch with a poultry attachment; and
hie bas some money af interest. I doubt if
that man la able to get asristance in bis

will say further,
the iiethod of iniI believe
thaf
spection and collection can be improved.
If if ia Ieft f0 the honesty of the individual,
lie mav not alwavs make bis refurn. Tbere
are in this country people who are isolated.
I have in nîy mind now the case of a loue
widow wbo bas a lot of money. She says
she neyer heard thiere was an income fax.
She knew thaf the assessors of the townsbip
had asked ber if she liad any income. She
may know of the income fax by this time,
but aime did nof kno'v quite recently. There
are cases of that kind. Then tbere are peopie in 6nme doubf whefher they ought to
pay income fax or not. I wvould suggest
that if the inspection district were made
snîaller-were made to include the limita

807

of an ordinary county, and if an official of
that countv were to admninjster the Act, hie
could frorn hi- owni knowledLce, and frorn a
searoh at the irejitry office anid an exarnination of the azz-;sjîient roils and myot.bfr
inquiry, a-zCertini the naine of every person in that district wvho wvas liable, or
nearl 'v liable, for the inconie tax. Then hie
woulIl issue a notice to ail sucfl persons to
corne to his office on certain days, bringing
ail their information, and there with his
assiztance thev would make up a statement
of the tax they should pay. When the
amount payable was ascertained the indiv'idual shouldJ be called upon to hand in
bis cheque within ten days, the retumn beinle subject to correction at the Finance
Department. If he had overpaid, the
arnount of the excess would be returned to
him; if hie bad underpaid bie would be
called upon again. That inspection and assessrnent couid be made in the early part
of the year wbile the taxpayer's niemory
was fresh as to the operations of the vear
past, and the money would be paid promptly h)v the first of Julv on the azse-ssment of
the previous year. 1I(do flot know whether
there is any menit in this suggestion or not.
Of this much I arn sure, that a very large
arnounit of money is being lost to the treasury; that the owners of 'whoie areas (i!

I know that in the

the school collector, he knows approxirnat.ely the inconie of every -man iu his

amnount to utilize bis services, and Fou
would find that in that way a very large

larzely tbe arnount of money that would be

publication o! such a list %vith reference

Hon. Sir JAM-%ES LOUGHEED: With
neivspaper advertising se expensive as it
is?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The newspapers
wvould be very glad. to publish iV. They give
the naines o! firms and persons, and the
liat is published at the newspaper's own
expense.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: It strikes me that the
case mentioned by my hon.ourable friend
fromi De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) i8
aIready covered. We have the famous
registration cards, that cost the country
haif a million o! money to Àcollect. You had
to appear before an officiai and 4sign a card
stating who you wvere, what you were, where
you lived, etc. You could not even buy a
raiiroad ticket without producing that card.
The cards must be somewhere. Why does
nlot the Department use them? They have
cost enough money t-o the country. It seems
to me that we were toid at the time that
they %vould give such valuabie information
to the country that nobody could escape.
Surelv they have been stored away somewhere.
Hon. Mr. BEAUI3IEN: The purpose o!
the honourable gentleman from De Loriniier is evidently to have the people make
retuirn6. There wouid be of course no
g-uarantee that the returns sent in were
exact; but what the hon"ourable gentleman
is urginL, is that all should be required to
miake a report from wvhich calculations mig'ht,
he made by the Department, and it couid
be asccrtained whether the report was exact
or not. Now, if there is an objection to
puhlishing the aniount o! the tax paîd by
each person-and I think there is a very
serions objection-what objection wouid
there he t-o puhlishing simply the npmes of
those wvho mode returns, without stating the
aniommts «?It seems to me t.hat that would
mieet the case re!erred to.
Hn. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Information wili be g-iven out hereafter.
Hon. Mr. BE.AUBIEN: Will the names
o! those inaking returns be published?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Informiation showing the number o! taxpayers
in each district.
Hon. 'Mr. BEAUBIEN: That inforniation
'volld not at ail serve the sanie purpose.
If the Departmient sees no objection to pubiishing the nanies o! those who have sent
in their returos. that ought to meet the

difficulty, it seenis to me; because any person alancinff around couid ascertain those
who should have made returns and had nlot
donc so. That is the information that we
are çeekin.u. Publication of -the names
would serve a very good purpose, because
it is absoluteIy unfair that persons who are
conscientious and honourable enough to
hear thçir full share of the country's deb,
should see others pass by smiling and
paying nothing at ail.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I stili fail to see
any reason why you should not pubiish th-3
amounts as well as the names, because we
do not knoNv whether the persons who have
made returns are, as the honourable gentlemen said, bearing their full share o! the
country's hurdens. They may be taking a
very small part o! their share.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND. The objection
which I formuiated is one. I know there
rnay be many others. I just put the question: %vas there any country in the worid
that publishes the name o! the taxpayer
and the amount hie pays, and the answer
was no.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 answered yes, s0
far as the cities of New Brunswick are
concerned.
Hon. Mr. McM-%EANS: Anybody can go
into a municipal office and find out how
much taxes a certain person pays.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wouid point
out to niy honourabie friend this difficulty.
The publication woiild enable everybody to
sep the financial standing o! a firm. Âny
firmi inay pass fromn years o! pienty to lean
vears. and as the commerce o! a country is
iarg-eiy based on credit and confidence the
whole fabric might be affected by the publication o! thiose returos.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I fail to see why
we should not have the opportunity o! going
into tho office here in Ottawa and findingout at any rate what certain individuals
Supposare paying in the way o! taxes.
in-, for instance, 1 know of a inan who has
a certain incoine and I feel that he is not
paying the proper ainounit of taxes, why
should I not have a rig-ht to go to the Departinent and ascertain exactiy what that
mnan is paying?
As the law is at present the officiais cannot
give me that information withiout rendering
thenîsei1ves ia-ble to cert.ain penalties. 1
do not t.hink the law should be left in that
way. If you couid find out what a man
was paying, that would have the effect of

SENATE
conipeliing individuals to put in proper returns. I see no objection w hatever to, the
returns bein- made as publie as possible.
Evcryone sl)ould psy his taxes, and if one
knew hio% others wNere situated in thiat regard one would be able to point out to, the
Departnient, that those other persons were
flot paying- a proper amount, and they could
be compelled to do so.
Hon. '-,r. GORDON: It appears to me
that such procedure, while it m.ight satisfy
the curiosity of a great many people, would
flot do much good. A gentleman goes to the
Department and finds out thiat So-and-so
hias paid a tax of $1,000. He goes away,
but perbaps his curiosity is not alt-ogether
satisfied. It inay be that that gentleman
will believe that So-and-so bias flot paid as
inuch tax as lie sbould pay. I cannot m-ake
myseif believe that there are miany people
who have flot paid t.beir taxes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: There are thousan ds.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In the face of the
penalties providcd, 1 cannot believe it. R
inust. sav tfiat gentlemen from other localities must be in a different situation from
myseif to see things in that way. In the
localitv from which I corne I cannot tell
you wibo hias paid and who hias not. I do
not see m-hat means any person bias for
saying at the present time that there are
t.housands or hundreds who, have flot paid
their taxes. One honourable gentleman said
t.hat the Government was losing millions
of dollars t1irougah uncollected taxes. If I
knew that te be the case, I ivould think it
mv duty te go to the Department and ineorin thein as to who was evading the t.ax.
lion. Mr. SMITH: I said there was a
strong suspicion that such was the case.
Hon. M.\r. GORDON: Suspicion means
nothing.
lion. M-r. SMITH: Oh, yes, it does.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Unless a person
kuows he should flot say t.hings like that.

tixat such a position w'ould be rather to

Hon. 'Mr. MeMc)EANS:

taxes as one would gather there are in
other districts. I have no doubt that there
are in tHe city of Montreal hundreds and
perhaps thousands of people who ha-ve flot
îiaid their taxes, but I think the publisbing
of tbe details would do a g-reat deal of
hiarin. Thiere are mierchan-ts and others in
the city who are iii a weak position financially, -who are s't.ruggling te get on, and if
a-Il the inside dJetails of their business were

On section 16-retroactive effect, etc.:
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen. I should like to say a i;7ord before
this Bill is passed. There is no doubt that
the Inconie Tax law, as it stands now, is
a vert puzzling combination. The Act was
pasel I thiink in 1918; it was verv ]arzeiy
amended in 1919; and now in 1920 we are
largel yI aniending it arain. WVith respect
to understanding the meaninz of. statute
law. 1 thinkz 1 amn about equal to the
averaze non-instructed person. and I find
it ver '%diflicult indeed to tell just what
should 1)0 cont-ained in the return with
respect f0 the tax. It seemus te me, hionourale g-entlemien, -that it is onlv the consideration which is due te the people who
are expecte1 to pay these taxes that they

should have the law -before themn as it is,
se that a taxpayer should not be o&liged to
g-o and look un the law of 1918 or the law
of 1919 or the law of 19-20. The Departmient should see that the law as it stands
now, with ail its ainendnients, is placed
where the ordinary taxpayer can concult
it. That is a mnere mnechanical thiing, but
I think it is very important.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is the
intention of the Departnient to do that

Hon. Mr. PIIOUDFOOT: What is the
effect of inakzing clauses 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13,
and 15 retroactive? Personally, I amn alwvays onposed te retroactive legisiation. The
principle is wrong, and whien I find that
vou are going to tax people or make changes
in the taxation years afterwards, then I
think you are doing son)etbing that should
not be done.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The intention is simply to give effect Io the interpreta-tiens which have been placed upon the
preceding Acts by the Departinent. This
-dLes net caîl into operation any new law;
it is simp)lv declaratory of the Department's
interpretation of the statute.
Hon. .Mr. PROUDFOOT: The section does
not se state. Of course, that may be the
intention (A it, but I do no.t so read the
c1ause.
Hon. Sir JAIES LOUGHEED: I think
you will find that ail the sections mentioned
nave been in operation since the passing o!
the Act.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT : If that con6truction bas been. placed uponl thein, why
the amiendment' The consetruction apparently is satisfactory.
Hon. 'Mr. D-ANDUR.IN'D: This is an artistic. way of making anl initerpretation clause.
On the preainble:
Hc.n. Mr. MceMEAN,ýS: Beicre the Bill is
rcported. I would ask for some information
about section 6. That deals with persons
hiable to incorne tax. It makies no exemptions whatsoever. As 1 understand, there
are certasin people in Canada who are
exempt. There are the judges o! certain
courts. 1 know that certain judges -c! the
superior court 'in Manitoba are paying
taxes on the increased salary which they
got, whihe the judges o!f the court of appeal
do not pay any tax at ail. This question
!iPs been the cause of considerable coin-

ment by these gentlemen, and I feel strongIN,that there should be 6ome well-reg"ulated
principle in regard to it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Mv boitourable f riend will recail the legisiation
which we passed, I think last session,
wherein we increased the salaries of superior court judges, -and wherein provision
was made that the increase should be liable
to taxation. Th at is in-the Judgeis Act.
Honi. Mr. MeMEANS: There is no exemption under this clause. You say here that.
every one in Canada shall pay.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Y<iu have
to read it in connectin with the other law
on the suhject.
Hon. '.%r., McMEANS: The Judges Act
was passed some years ago. But even -so, I
do not like the disorepancy between oxie
jadge and another. The judges of the court
of appeal whose salaries were neot increased
psy no tax whatever; the cither judges got
an increase of $1,000, and pay an income
tax on the $1,000 only.
Hon. Mr. FOWLF2R: I understood that it
was to be on the whole salary.
Hon. Mr. MdcMEANS: No. The judges of
the superior court say, "-Vhy should ive
pay an income tax on any po_,rtion of our
salary when the judges of the court of
appeal pay nothing 'at ail?"
Hon. Sir JAM.%ES LOUGHEED: I do not

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But mortgages are invariably taken as coliateral. and

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shall section
7 be adopted?
Hon. -Mr. FOWLER: I submit that the
Bill before us is a matter of soîne importance. and it does not speak well for this
hegisiature to be rushing it througah in this
manner. Some of us will not understand
it. and I ain asking that the Bill ho read.
I want you, Mr. Chairman, to read the Bill.
The CHAIRMAN: Is it the desire of the
House that I shouid read this Bill?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, it is. I think
point
that is the rule of the House. M_ýy
is this, that this is very important heg-isiatien, sud it is being rushied throufflh, and
nobody iz understanding- it. I arn sure I
do nlot understand it, and I would be very
gýIad to do so.
The Hon. The CHAIRMAN: The motion
is that the section shall be read in full.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not thiuk that
a motion is necessary. Wlien an honourable meuember asks to have a section read 1
thîink lie is entitled to have it read; I do
not think it is a subject for a motion at

The Hon. The CHAIRMAN: Ail rig-ht.

JUNE 29, 190
On new section 1, subsection 3--stamp
tax on hb.lls payable on deniand, et-c.:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Heretofore it was only two cents on a document
no mat ter what the amount wvas, but hereafter it wvill be two cents on each $100 or
-fraction thereof.
H on. Mr. PROUDFOOT: On $1,000 it
would be 20 cents?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
On paragraph d of section 1-stamp tax
on documents or writings containing
promise to pay, or pledge of securities, to
aticure pay itent of advances:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN. What is the explanation of that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no changae in that. If it is more than a
three-days draft the two cents shall be applicable for every $100 or fraction of 8100.
On .paragraph c--stamp tax on promissory notes given for advances:
Mon. Mr. FOWLER: Is that new?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
that requires a quarterly statement to be
macle by the Bank.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does that rnean
that 1or every $100 advanced. to a person
by the bank, he bas to put a two-cent
s tamp P
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, on
the note, and the bank hereafter shall
make a return to the department of ail
advanccs, and the persons te whom the
advances have been made.
Hon. Mr. I3EAUBIEN: Is this applicable te the loans. already contractec?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, but
if there is a renewal it is.
Hon.
M r. PROUDFOOT:
Will the
department su-pply a special st-amp, or may
'People use postage stam<ps, as heretofore?
I think the idea wvould be very niuch better to have a special] stamp.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
there wi]'1 be a speolal stamp. They are
printed now
On subsection 4-transfer delivery of 'bill
or note wit-heut stamp; penalty:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would like to
a.sk about that penalty of $50. Sometimes
banks have~ notes for $2,000, $3,000, $5,000.

and I think the penalty~ would be less than
the stamp duty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think it is quite
large enouagh.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
would -be liable teo the stamp tax as vwell
as te the penalty.
Hon. MIT. BOSTOCK: Under subsection
10 I understand tshe banks will now have
te issue aIl their cheques with stamps
afflxed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Net

stamp in lieu thereof.
On subsection 13-stamp tax on sale or
transfers of stock:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This la
a new provision-that the stamp tax shall
he applicable to shares of stock of the
face value o! $100 or fraction thereof.
Hon. :'Mr. FOWLER: Is that for every
company?
Non. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Ho' inuoh is the
tax on shares of the value of one dollar?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is intendec to appily t-o shares of a par value
of $100. It is not anticipated that it vil]
he made applica)ble te shares of a dollar,
such as mining shares. This provision is
taken froni the Ontario Act, I understand,
and it is flot intended te apply to cases of
that kind.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The tax is

Hon. 8-ir JAMES LOUGHEED:

No.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
We already
have in Ontario a tax on aI-l transfers of
stocks in Ontarie companies, and this will
me-an a double tax on the transfer of everv
share of stock. First the Ontario Governnment tax must he Vaid, anmi then aise the
Dominion Government. tax, under this
section. I think the paynnent o! one tax
ought te be sufficient.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: To-day,
unfortinately~ for the tax-paver, a municipality may levy an incenle tax, a province may do the same. and the Dominion
Government rmay aise do so. That applies
to the land tax as well. For instance. in
Alberta and inunicipalitv levies -a land tax

JUNE 29, 1920
have no authority te deal witài a taxation
Bill in this way.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why does it corne
before us if we have not the power?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We can
reject the entire Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do net admit
my honourab1é friend'a statement, because
if that principles were adopted, then the
Bill woiild be read at the table and could
be rejected on the second or the third
reading or in committee pro forma. 1 dlaim
that in reading the Bill clause by clause
we are sixmply acting in accordance with the
resolution passed unanimously by this
Chamber whereby we declared that we had
the right to amend a money Bill; and My
honourable friend joined in that resolution.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
arn net propared te say that I went as far
as my honeurable friend charges that I did.
However, it is undesirable that at this late
hour in the Session we should enter upon
a discussion as to what the powers of the
Senate are in connection with financial
measures. As te considering thir, Bill clause
by clause, it is properly within our power
to do that, because there might be a clause
which would- warrant the Senate in re-jecting the whole Bill, and hence it is necessary
to deal with it clause by clause. lt seems
to me it is more desirable to impose a tax
upon sporting goodsê than upon clothing.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Yes, much more.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would ask the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot) why he objecta te the psyments of a tax on bîlliards and pool tables?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wh.at, objection
has my honourable friend te that itemi?
Hon. Mr. PROTJDFOOT: I say we should
not impose a tax at all on sporting goods,
such a-- are described in the item which I
read. That is the ground that I t.ake.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But why?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is in the
interest of the health of the young people
of the country net te impose a tax on
sporting articles that they are using constantly, day by day.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What particular

particular advantage to the youth of this
country?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I arn quite
willing te drop the part of the item relating
te billiard tables. 1 had not observed that
billiard tables were referred te particularly
in this portion. My motion would be te
strike out the several lines at the foot of
page 6 and the five linees at the top of
page 7.
'Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I vould draw
the attention of my honourable friencl te
the f act that there are sporting goods that

shoes, and that a tax c! 10 per cent on the
total price should -be paid in the case of bats

sud shoes are just as important as other
articles of clothing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
a very much greater range of prices in boots
mnd shoes which permits of this princîple
being applied to them. You can buy boots
at any price up to $5 if you are rich enough
andI: extravagant enough.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOR: Are these taxes

Hon. Sir JAMES ILOUGHEED: By the

%Hon.Mr. F0 WLER: Does this ýsection
with regard te the tax on motor boats a-pply
te new boats.? -Suppose a man bas a boat
which. he has had for five or six years and
hie seils it. is there a tax on thaf. sale?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
be applied. only under two conditions: in
the manufacture or in the import. As the
boat is an okLd one changing bands it wouJ.d
not be subject to the tax. 0f course, if it
were bought out of the country and were
imported it would, be subject te the tax.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There is a tax on
automoýbiles. Why do you not tax gasolineP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
subject te, the Sales Tax.
Hon. Mr. FOWLt£R: 1 would suggest that
there should be a s.Decial tax on gaeoline,
with a rebate te people who require to use it,
because there is an enormous amount of
rnoney wasted by joy riders.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The difficulty is to follow it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is not this a very
simple matr
There would ho a tax on
every gallon of gasoline sold. Then men
like doctors and merchantsHon. Mr. McLEAN: And fisherrnen.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:-and fishermenwhoerver require in their busineè6 to use
motors of any kind-would get a rebate. In
that -way you woulcl get after the joy riders,
and -would stop the excessive use of gasoline.
If it didf not do that it would fill the coffers
of the country if they continued their wild
extravagance. I would suggest that something should be done along that line.
ýHon. Sir JAMIES LOUGHEED: It is
worth considering. Of course, we now get
2 per cent on the sale.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You ought to get
20 cents a gallon from the joy rider.

DEMOBILIZATION BORROWINGS BILL.
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE.

On mot-io'n of Hion. Sir Jsames Lougheed the
Senate went into committee on Bill 211, an
Act Vo confirmn certain borrowings under Vhe
Demobi4izatioýn Appropriation Act, 1919.
Hon. Mr. Gordon in -the Chair.
On section l--excess borrowings confirrned:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This Bil
is simply Io a.uthorize tihe Governiment to
accept the subse4-riptions which were made
in -connection with the last loan. It ils
desirable that this should be done, as 1
unde.rstan-d from, the Minister of Finance
that vwhen. that loan was placed on the
market the subsocriptions exeeeded the
amount cont.emplated by some $340,000,000.
This .money is required, and will avoid the
necsSsity Of sTaing another joan of that
amount. Consequently we desi-re Vo include
these in the borrowing powers of the Government.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I presume that the
Government has. recei-ved this money, and
has probably already made use of it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That may
be.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Some of it.
honourable
Hon. "11. DANDURAND: M-%y
friend is mnaking this proposition without
a blush. That $340,000,000 wasl filched out of
the pockets of the public and transferred
into the treasury. He is noV sure that it
has been spent, yet he wilI have Vo render
an accunt of it before many days.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I rise to a point of
order. Perhaps I misunderstood the honourable member for DeLorimier (Hon. Mr.
De.ndurand), but it seems Vo me he used
the word "filched"-that the Govemniment
ha-d filched out of the pockets of the people
that amount. Now, I do noV think the bonourable gentleman «houild use 'la.nguage like
that in a digniied Chamber like thisaccuse a body of men who are presumably
respectable of having committed an offence
of that kind.
H.on. M'r. DANDURLAND: Well, the expression muet be, very bad on which my
hon<>urable frie.nd haS raised a question of
order. I may confess that I need a little
more leeway than my friende of the AngloSaxon race, because I sometirnes use an
expression that cornes to rny lips for the
first tirne, and I am n ot very -sure that I

SENATE

S20

could use a synon.ym. 0f course, when I
said filched I rneant took, by le-erdemain.
I suppoise there is a French expression that
is used in E.nglish, "from the po.ckets of the
people," that is too say, from -the public, for
the purposes of the Government. The Government was authorized to borrow, I think,
$500,.000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; we
were authorize>d to borrow in -ail SI,750,000,000; that xvas the entire borrowing power.
The subseriptionis exceeded that amounit by
practically the ainount in. the Bill, and we
therefore ask authority of Parliament for
that a.dditional borrowing- power wvhich, ini
any event, would have to be secured. for the
purpose of an additional boan if we did. not
take advantage o! this over-subseription.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Iiow it was done; the people over-subscribed the hlast loan; but I feel ail the
saine that the Governmient wvas enabled
through. that surplus subscription to boast
lately that it would not appeal to the public this year fSr anotiher loan. The question is as to the accouniting, and I suppose
that the close o! this Session inay be the
end o! this Parliament, -and we may have
a full accounting for the total sum.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 amn surprised,
now that the honourable gentleman understands just how this money came, that
hie should not withdraw the word or apologize for its use as applied to the Government, because the people ýiad so much
confidence in this Government that 'when
it asked them for $400,000,000, or whatever
it was, thev gave them $350,000,000 in excess. So that it was not necessary, you
see, to filch even if they had been so
rninded; but the people, havinga that confidence in this -Government that thev would
expend the money properly, and' having
that patriotic feeling that they must put
up the money because it wvas needed for
public purposes, over-suhscribed. Now,
this legisiation is simply to take advantage
of thati over-suboscripticn and use thai
ruoney. not for the 'Governmrent's purposes,
but for public purposes. So that the
honourable gentleman'rs language is astray
on two counts: one, that hie bas aocused
the 'Government of filching the money
from the people, and the other, that he
dlaims the money is being used for Government purposes instead o! -for public purposes.
I thinkz the
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
honourable gentleman is very rnuch misHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

taken if he takes for granted that the
surplus anjount subscribed by the people
means confidence in the Governrnent.. It
means confidence in thernselves, in the
people of Canada, because the several byelections we, have had in the last feuyears do flot seem to imply over-confidence
in the present Governrnent.
Hon. Mr. FOW.LER: Those can ail be
accounted for.
Section 1 was agreed. to.
The preamible and the titie were agreed

While the
Hon. Mr. DANDURANU:
Chiairînan of the Committee is performing
bis duty of signing th-is Aot, and as the
honourable gentleman from New Brunswiek is withiýn the reach odf my voice, I
would like to read for his benefit a statemient made by President Wilson, which
could be altered in one word, in explanation of the fact that, in spite of his
protest a year or two ago that rny voiee
irritated hlm, I arn stili on my feet. President Wilson wvas asked to say a few
words at a charity musicale, and as h
wvas surrounded by ladies hie said:
For beauty 1 amrn ot a star;
There are others more handsome by far.
My face 1 don't mlnd it,
Becaus-e 1 amn iehind it:
It's the people In front that I jar.

I can alter this by saying:
My voice, I don't mind it,
Because I arn behind it;
It'sthe people in front that I jar.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: That latter part is
correct.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The people feel se

section '2 of this Bill providles:
The Hon. the CHAIRNIAN.

JUNE 29, 1920
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There has
been a very substantial surplus; in fact,
the surplus from the handling of this business is so substantial that it amazes one.
The farmers and the public get the benefit
o! it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Up to the present
time there has been no loss?
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It

is claimed that
of the Governis over 40 cents
to issue cheques
the l5th of this
farmer.

Hon. W. B. ROSS. But that is not the
loss w-hich this subsection deals wvith. It
is quite correct, as the -honourable gentleman from Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe) has
said, that the Wheat Board has 40 cents a
bushel which it holds. Those who held on
will -et 40 cents; but the grain dealer whi
went out and ibouit avheat tat say $3,
before the Government came in and fixed
a price of $2.î5, made a loss; and there
was a loss last year. There has been a
partial settlernent of that loss, but I think
there is still a dlaim of some $20,000 in that
regard. I think that is what is referred to
i n this section. If you 'have an open market for a time and mt-n buy wheat at certain prices the board is then appointed and
fixes a price, it is possible that the price
whidh they fixed miay cau6e a loss te the imen
who have been buying ini the open market.
That is ivhat this section provides for, and
it is poszible that there might ha a big loss.
I think, however, that that is not a thing
to worry over, because at the time they
constituted the board the Government naturally would know whether there had beeri
much buying, and would take care not to
-faîl into a hold of that kind.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Last year the Government, were very undecided. whether to
go ahead and control the wheat or not, and
for a timie they allowed the Grain Exchang--e to huy and sell wheat. This year
they Nvill have thieir minds made up before
they allov the Grain Exchiange to open ut
all; and if they allow it to open, they will
allow it to hanidie the whiole crop.
Section 5 was agreed. to.
On section 6--powers of Board:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think this is an opportune time to mention a certain matter
wvhich 1 have in mind. I take it that the

827

existing Wheat Board wvas constituted under the War Measures Act, or duriîîg war
time; and, of course, 1 can quite well understand where the Board got its powers.
But in the light of the British North Amnerica Act, I arn puzzled to know where the
Parliament of Canada gets power to pass
this legisiation now that the war -is over.
So far as we have gone, well and good. I
quite understand that the Board should bc
able to make inquiries and reports in the
public interest; but if you read section 6
you ivili find that some very drastie powerý,
are being placed in the hands of this
Board. Take, for instance, paragraph g,
u.nder which they shall have power:
.To fix maximum prices or margins of profit
at which foeur and other products made frorn
wheat delivered to millers may lie sold, and to
fix standards of quality of such foeur.
Then paragraph k, which says:
For the purpose of performing its duties under this Act, to allocate Canadian lake, tonnage and to distribute cars for rails shipments.
The Board will have power to take the
wvhole of the lake shipping in hand. I
understand very well that the Government
dlaims to have got the power last year; but
since then there has been a declaration of
peace.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No declaration of
peace?1
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no declaration of peace wit.hi Turkey yet.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I have in my poissession, and I could get it in a very short time,
a proclamation of King George issued on
the 7t.h day o! July this year, stating that
war hetween Great Britain and Germany
and hier Allies had corne to a close.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Withi
Germany, yes.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: With Gerinany tand

Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: Are we stili in a state
o! warv
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Under a statute passed
last vear, England is; but Canada, under
international law, under the War Measures
Act, and under the proclamation of His
Majesty the King issued Iast Julv, is at
peace wit-h Germany and Nvith ail thie Allies

The Hon. the -CHAIR MAN: They are

Hon, W. B. ROSS: Great Britain is. but
we are at peace with Turkey. Great Britain
is working under the statute passed lait
year.
Vien, paragraph q of this section says:
To require that any wheat sold or purchased
in Canada shall be dellvered to the Board or to
its order in accordance with such regulations as
the Board niay froni time to timne malte.

That is to say,. they could order wheat
to be delivered to them or to someone else.
I Nvould like to know where the Parliament
of Canada gets the aut.hority to give them
the power to do that. Then you will find that
under section T they have the following
power:
To order any person holding wheat stored
in any elevator or warehouse. or on rallway
cars or Canadian boats to sell and dispose of
the sarne to any purchaser namned by the Board,
on such ternis as the Board may direct. and
any such order of the Board shall paes to the
purchaser the titie in the wheat mentioned In
any such order.

This is a most sweeping clause, and I
should like to know where we get the power
to pass isuch leg-isiation.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can the leader of
the Government give us any information
about that? I think the point raised is a
very important one, and one upon which
we should have some information.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
exercising the same authority that we have
always exercised. There may be something
in what my honourable friend has- said, but
the Government is quite willing to accept
the responisibility and to exercise this power
of legislation. If anyone considers it uItra
vires of the Canadian Parliament ha has
his remedy in the courts. But there is a
good deal of force in the good old rule. the
simple plan, that they shail take who have
the power and they shall hold îvho can.
,Hon. Mr. BOSTOCE: That ivas the German idea.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEfl: That may
ha, but the public have their remedy in the
courts if they think that this is ultra vires
of this Pailiament.
Hon. Mr. McMMEuNS: The same question ivas raised about the Indian Acts the
other day, but we passed those Acts.
Hon. Mr. BOuSTOCK: The whole question
was ra.ised about the Commerce Act.
The Hon. the CHÀIRMAN.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Ail legislation is susceptible of being investigated
as to its validity.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But I do flot think
it is a good thing for this House to ha passing legfislation of this kind.
Hon. 6ir JAMES LOUGHEED: It bas
worked very satisfactorily in the past. The
power that ha& been exercised in putting
legislation on the statute book in former
sessions is good enough to place it on at
present.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But the conditions of the country when this Act was in
force before are different from wha-t they
are now.
Hon. Sir JAMES IuOUGHEED: No; I
would say that the conditions to-day are
even more startling than they were when
this legislatàon was placed on the statute
book. They are ail conditions arising out
of the war.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: One of the
first questions would, be Nvlether the Board
could operate successfully without the
powers granted in section 6. The powers
are very extensive, and any one familiar
with the handling of grain, if ha studies that
section, will conclude that those powers are
absolutely necessary if the Government is
to take control and handle the grain of
Canada under certain circumstances, which
isthe objectof the BilI. 'Many cf thepoweTrs
mentioned here were exercised before the
War Measures Act was passed,; that is, the
Grain Commission had poNver of control in
handling the cars. Tbey allocated the cars.
and ordered the different railways to send
cars to certain points. and to observe the
order of shipment. I do not know whv
we caù do it with grain cars under the
Railway Act and not with other cars; one is
as much ultra vires as the other. There
is something in the point raised by the
bonourable member for M-Niddleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross) that would give any lawyer
ground for argumrent anyway. If we are
going to "ive the Governmiient this power
and put this Act into operation I do not
think section 6 contains po-wer that is not
absolutely necessary to %vork the Act prýoperly.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That may be perfectly true, but the position is this. We
rnay say that it is necessary to give the
Government those powers. but we are not
in a position to give themn. If any man
came to my honourable friend as a law-

JUNE 29, 1920ô

would probably say, "Go and sue the Government at once, and have the matter

FIRST ÂXD) SECOND REkDINGS.

Bill 217, an Act to amend the Railway Act,
1919.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On settion 1-powers of Board of Railway
Commissioners with respect to coal and
other fuel supplies:
Hon. R. S. WHITE:
Are the powers
given to the Railway Board exercised over
the Department of Marine, the (Department
of Labour, and the Department of Trade
and Commerce, or what powers do they
have?
-Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
The powers
that the Railway Board may exercise under
this Bill wil1 ibe practically the same as
those lhat were conferred upon the Fuel
Controller during the wvar under the War
Measures Act.
It i6 intended that the
Board shall have general jurisdiction over
and assist in the obtaining of coal necessary to meet our requirements, and the
transportation and distribution of it.
Hon. R. -S. WHITE:. If they find, for
instance, that the production of coal is îlot
sufficient, can they cali on the Labour Department to increase that output, or not?
Have they any power over týhe Labour Depart-ment, or sny instructions about it?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do flot assume
that the Board of Railway Conunissioners
woulic l ftave env more power in tha:t direction than the Fuel Controller hiad.
They

829

would simply makze the necessary representation am to what, in their opinion, ought
to be done, and the rDepartments would have
some pow6r to exercise in that direction.
At the present tinte the fuel situation is indeed serlous in the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec. During the first part of this
year the importations exceeded those for the
first five menthes of @last, year; 'but, owing
to transportation diffioulties in fie United
Statas, and the scarcity of coal, that is, the
de.mand not beîng met even in their own
country, drastic eteps have been taken over
there to control the situation; and the Interstate C~ommerce Commission has been
placed in control of the coal situation under
mnuch the same powers as Mr. Garfield
exercised as Fuel Controller during the war.
Embargoes have been placed on the exportation of coal oversea6. It is dbvîous
that some control must be maintained over
coal in Canada, and as it has ibeen thought
wvise by the United States to euggest that
coal should not -be exported to Europe, we
would expect that country to supply coal
here. Therefore some body must have power
in Canada to exercise such control. as was
exercised *by the coal director under the
WVar Measures Act; and inasmuch as the
Railway Board are in direct touch 'with and
control transportation movements, it is feit
that they are. the logical body in whom to
vest this power.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Would they have any
power over the ships owned by the Cariadian
Government if they wvanted tonnage?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would assumne that they would represent to the Minister of Marine what was, required in the
wav o! ships. I would not assume that they
had any commandeering power under this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 6uppose the production of coal in Nova Scotia had fallen off,
wvould they have power to take drastic
nicasures to increase that -production?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They have power
to take control of a mine and operate it,
if neecssary.
Hon. Mfr. iBOSTOCK: Titis Board of Rail%NayCotnrissioners would have that power?
Hon. Mr. RiOBERTSON. The Bill aays:
The Board shall have power to do and authorize such acts and things and te mnake fromn

Bloard, by reason of reai or apprehended scarcity of coal or other fuel suppies in Canada,
may deemn necessary or advjsable for the provision of such supplies and for the distribution.
control and disposition thereof.

SENATE
The regulations which. the Board are arnpowered to make wvould, I assumne, be along
the lines of those that governed the operations by the Fuel Controller, and under
those reculations he was empowered, in the
event of industrial difficulties whicha interfered with or interrupted the production of
coal, to take sucli steps as in bis opinion
were necessary to guarantee and continue
the coal production, even to the extent of
operating the prcierty.
H-on. Mr. POWVLER: Il would bc assumed
that coal operators, that is, *the owners of
the coal mines, would be anxious to produce
as much coal as possible.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But th-ey are otten
prevented irom doing that by reason of the
action of the minera. What extra powers
would. the 'Railway Board have to take hold
of the 6ituation and make them produce?
Hon. Mr. ROBERISON: Ail that they
could do, (1 assume, if they lound -it neces8ary to take control of and operate the
mine, would be to take euch steps as were
necessary in the way of production.
Hon. 'Mr. FOWLER: What steps could
they take? Suppose the labourers refused
to work?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Get labour that
would work.
Hon. Mr. BEIQU'E: This Bill is cipen to
the same objection as was raised by the
honourable member from Middleton (lion.
W. B. Ross) in connectiion with the Bill
which bas just been passed by thie honourable House. There is no question that the
Railway Board, under tbis Act, rnay prevent
the exportation of cal; that would be within the power of this Parliament; but, as
was stated by tbe honourable memiber from
Middleton, they would not be e.ntitled 10
interfere with contracts, xior to control the
puice at. which coal was sold at the mines,
nor would they be enlitled to take possession of the coal. as that would be interfering- wit.h the provisions of th. British
North America Act. 0f course, if we were
in a state of war that would be another
thing, but we understand that we are neot.
Iif we are flot, then ail contracte are within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the province.
Section 1 wa8 agreed to.
-Hon. Mi. ROBERTSON: It is, deemed désirable that there should ha an amendment
aidded. î1t is proposed to insert the followin- as subsection 3 of &ection 1, and the

Hon. MT. BOSTOCK: It seems to me that
this measure, like the other one dealîng
with the W7heat Board, will be open to, dispute; that in Ibis case the Board of Railway Commissioners will try to enforce the
law and sorne -company or person will engage a lawyer and dispute the whole thing,
and it will ha 'lied up. Il does seemn to mie
that it is foolish for Parliament to pass
leg-islation of this kind. Il may ha ail right
for -the iawyers, but I do not see that it is
wise iegislation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We would

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON I would point
out to my honourable friand and te the
House that these are amendmants t, the
Raiiway Act. Section 52 of the Ra-ilway Act,
if I remember correctly, provides for an appeal at any lime from the decision of thc

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I have
no apology but an explanation to give this
House why this motion is presented so late.
ht is a case of necessity. The policy of the
Governiment in this respect wa-s not announced unt-il the 26t.h of June instant. was unable until vesterdav to obttin from
the different departments the informnation
required; therefore it was, prior to this moment, impossible to put this matter before
the House in an intelligent nianner.
In these last fieeting hours Of the session
I would certainly not infliet on this House
a subject of a rather dry nature, composed
practicallv of quotations and figures, if 1
did not consider it of paramount importance
to the country; but I do. I wivsh 1 had the
natural ability that many members of this
House possess, of putting a business proposition in concise, crisp and clear language.
Let nie preface what 1 -have to say by
stating that this motion has been approved
by very important bodies of men in this
country. I wiIl quote a resolution recently
adopted by the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association at their last annual meeting:

A similar resolution was adopted by
France-Amerique, a very important organization composed Of men endeavouringa to,
6trengthen the trade and intellectual relations existing.between Canada and France.
This association comprises many of the
heads of our -big rajiroads, Of Our banks, of
our industries-mnen who hold very higli
positions in every -walk of life. The resolution adopted iby this association is as follows:
Extract tram the minutes ot a meeting of
F'rance-Amerique, held In the CitY of Montreal on the 17th day of May, 1920.
Whereas the repeal of the commercial trsaty
between Canada and France will operate from
the 19th day ot June next (1920). and whereaii
the negotiatien of a new treaty will no doubt
entail protracted discussions, extendnzg over a
long period;
Whereas It Is of vital Importance that Canadian exportations to France, so highly developed during the war and to a substantial extarit nTaintained since should flot be ieopardized
by such revoration, but should be protected and,
as fax- as possible, belped by a tempox-ary agreement between the two nations;
Wherefore It je unanimously resolved;
That the Govex-nment of Canada be earnsstl3
requested forthwith to take such stepa as may
lead to the negotiations of such a tempora-y
agreement prior to the 19th day of June, 1920.

Resolutions to the sanie effeet have ali.
been adopted by the -Montreal Board of
Trade and by the two Chambers of Conimex-ce of Montreal.
These resolutions, honourable gentlemen.
fortify the proposition 1 wish to lay before
You. What is the position of Canada now'
We were very unfortunate in the war in
that we lost the flower Of our'manhood and
burdened our country with a very heav,
debt. But we have been fortunate-du this,
that our trade lias been extremnely prosperous, and that the unfavourable balance
of trade, whîch had increased so alarmingly
from 1914) to 1914 to the extent of $1,000,000,

SENATE
000 was offset by a favourable balance in
the four following years, from 1914 to 1919,
that is, to an amount of no less than $1,300,000,000. This -%as very satisfactory ifldeed
for Canada, bein.- face to face with theý
enormous debt which she had to assume as
her fair and glorious share of this world
war, the war of liberty and of civilization.
But what I need draw your attention tu
is not so mucli the past but the present.
While I arn speaking we are consuming this
fiavou.rable balance -of triade at the rate of
about a million and a haîf a day. Let me
quote somie fig-ures. The favourable trade
balance, in 1918, was $576,000,000; in 1919.
$296,000,00; in 1920, $174,000,000. Let me
now put Meore vou, as business men, a
comparative statement for the three last
months of this year, as compared with the
sanie peripd of last year. Taking March of
1919 and March of 1920, how do they compare? In 1919 we had a favourable balance
of $28,000,00. What -have we. this year? We
have an unfavourable balance of $49,000,000
-a reversaI of $77,000,000 against Canada in
one iontli. In April of last year we had a
favourable balance, already declining, of
$10,000,000l. What have we this year? In
April, 19'20, we have an unfavourable balance
of $44,000.000. Last year in the menth of M.ay
we had a favourable balance of $20,000,000.
What have we this year? An uni avourablze
balance of over $36,105,321. In the last
three months, honourable gentlemen, we
have already conisumed no less than $1,432,
000 of our favourable balance. If we continue at this rate, in less than twelve
months we shail have reduced it by no less
than $522.000,0W0, which means that practically, -in two years, all that we have accumulated during the war -%vill be -one. Arn
I therefore right in contending that every
effort must be nmade t( increase our exportations and, if possible, to diminish out
importations?
I have endeavoured to treaat' this as a
business proposition and to find out îvhere
we have zained and where we have lost.
A country bas clients just the sanie as a
corporation. a conîpany or a business'man.
I have carefully exainineil the list of our
customers; and have, first of alI, eliminated
all small countries with whorn we do less
than $1,00S,000 of business, a year,
secondly, I have ranged off on one side
those countries with a-homi we are doing
what I would cail a profitable business-a
business %vhichat the end of the year will
leave us something to the good. I have put
on the other side those countries to -whomn
we are losing money. How do we stand"
Hon. '.%r. BEAUBIEN.

The countries witli which -we bave a favourable balance are lifteen in number. The
first one, of course, is the British Empire.
In trading witli the *British Empire we
make no less than $387,000,000. 1 know
that the Government will do everything
that is required in the near future to ensure
that this favourable balance will be. maintained and if possible increased. I have no
doubt either as to their intention or their
ability for so doing.
Hon. MTr. P-OWER: May I interrupt the
honourabl-e gentleman for a moment? 0f
what year is hle speaking?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 0f the twelve
months ending on the 3Lst of Mardi last.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND: A.nd the first
three monthcs of this year?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 think I made
that quite clear. The British Empire is our
best custorner. Who do you think is our
next best client? France, and with lier vie
are no less tlîan $52,642 to the good. Let us
continue. Tien we come to Greece with
$28,888,000; then to Belgiumn and her colonies, with $27,526,000; 'then tu Italy, with
$15,962,000. Then we ccome to Roumania,
with $ 12,953,000. You kno-w what money
we have loaned to Roumania. We f ail off
very much indeed at this point as we come
te China, with 55,458,000; to Norway, 'with
54,000,000; Sweden, with $3,000,000; Denmark, with $2,832,000; Albania, with $2,741,
000; the Netlierlands, with practically
$1,500,000; Russia, with $1,477,000; Turkey,
wîth $1,103,000; and finally we come to
Brazil, wýitlî $729,000.
What about the unfavou-rable balances'
First of ail comes our good neiglibour to
the ýsoubli, witlî an unfavourable balance of
no -less than $336,000,000; then comes Switzerland, witli $6,273,000; then Japan,. with
$5,903,000; then Peru, with $4,798,000; then
Mexiýco, with $2,238,000; then Cuba, witlî
$1.256,000, and, finally, Spain, with 8444,000.
Now let us ascertain how fur these figure-s
have been influenced by our conmmiercial
treaties. As already stated -we deal ivitx
two groups of nations, one which pays us
and the other which does xîot. We have
liad a favourable treaty 'with France. IfVhat
lias it given us? It brougiht us, just as soon
-as opport.unity offered, no less tian the
arnount which 1 have stated--over $52,000,
000-in the year just elapsed. You will
say: ««But wliy lias this treaty been revoked?' It has been revoked for Vhis reason: France, as you know, in 1871, shed ber
lie.art's blood, tien she was bled of hier gold,

JUNE 30, 1920
and then wvas shackled for ahl time to corne
in her business relations. Germany. indeed, said to her: "'Our troops will not
quit your soil until such time as you bind
yourself not to grant commercial favours
to any nation in the world unless they are
automatically extended to us." So France
bas gone on for over forty years carrying
these chains and making good the business
o! Germany. As soon as war was declared
France thought o! breakîng ber shackles,
and in the month of September, 1918, sbe
did so. But, honourable gentlemen, these
sbackles dragged other chaîns; and to f ree
berself entirely denounced. ail ber existing
treaties.
But here, honourable gentlemen, a new
necessity arose, and in tbis regard I do not
blame the Government for what they did.
We bad to get more money, and it was only
reasonable to impose heavier taxes upon
objects of luxury. France exports to this
country mainly objecta of luxury. But that
is not ail. Wbatever commercial treaty advantage is granted to, France is now automaatically extended 'by the most favoured
nation clause to twelve other nations. We
therefore had to denounce the French
treaty. Notice -was given, and the French
Treaty -%as cancelled on the 19th of this
month.
Now, bonourable gentlemen, bow is it
that we are not free to trade separately -with
every nation? How is it that when we give
an advantage, to France rwe have to give it
to twelve other natione? How is it that
when -we grant a concession to a country
that benefits us to the extent of $52,000,000,
we bave at the same time to extend it to a
country that eosts us several millions a
year? It seema to me that if vou, as good
business men, were dealing with a company, you -would be extremelv curious to
find out the reason for such a state of
aff airs. Let me tell von how it is.
'%Veere ail proud indeed. . during the
negotiations of the Treaty of Peace, to see
Canada so well represented by aur Prime
Minister and other niembers of the Cabinet.
Let me say here, looking tawards my honourable friends opposite-and I feel that
in a large ineasure they %vill share my
opinion-that Canada bas left in France a
very deep and loving impression. This impression is due not only to the valour o! our
soldiers, which was unsurpassed, not only
ta their conduet as good, kind-hearted,
generous men, who a! ter fighting without
food for a -whole day ta capture Mons, forgot the panga o! hunger and turned their
kits over to the famished population-this

83â

impression is due also to the stand Canada
has taken as a nation and to the manner in
which she was represented by her statesmen. I can tell you without exaggeration
that no country in the world stands dloser
to the heart of France than our dear country of Canada.
One thing has struck the French people,
as it bas struck you, nonourable gentlemen,
it waa the sudden realization that Canada
had gotten out of her swaddling clothes.
We have been men of full virility in the
trenches; we have been men of full maturity
in the negotiations for the Treaty o! Peace.
Very o! ten, indeed, the opinion of our
Prime LMini6ter has been accepted and is
niow reflected in the wr' ting-s o! the Treaty of
Peace. Our Prime Minister and, the other
members of the ,Cabinet have insieted. upon
one thing-that Canada should stand by
itself. England *had m-agnîficent men to
represent ber; she had men of talent and
men of experience-nien 'who. came from a
long lineage o! dipiomats; inen 'who have
been brought up.generation after generation
to be -statesmen. Still Canada insisted that
she should be represented. by ber own sons,
the sons o! the land. Therefore, gentlemen.
we were bound by the signatures o! aur owu
peera.
Norw, honourable gentlemen, if we were
not willing to be beld by the signature o!
Lloyd George or that o! Balfour, what du
you say to being bound by that of Lord
Aberdeen? Or by that of Lord Beaconsfield? Or that of Lord Liverpool? Are you
willing to be pledged by the signature of
Charles the Second? Nay, are you willing
to be bound hy the signature of Queen
Anne? What is your answer? Canada, at
this bour, is oblig-ated to extend the most
favoured nation clause to twelve countries,
as follows: Argentine, under a treaty made
wvith Great Britain on the 2nd February,
1825; Colombia, under a treaty made witfi

in my province, 1,200 post offices, many of
which, as you know, have been established
for the convenience of people scattered in
the country districts, and at places where
there are groups of enly three, four or ten
houses. In. France ne less than 560 city

You may say: -Yes, but how many o! those

than 480,000 houseé to build, Jeaving aside
altogether the city halls, the schools and

years o! strenuous efforts. But you will further ask: -"How is oui agricultural community interested?" Let me deal wiith that
question. France has lest no less than
1,300,000 head of cattie. How rnany do you
think have since been replaced? Two
hundred thousand. There are stili 1,100,000
head of cattie to be obtained by Franca
sornewhere. Why should we flot furnish
them? There -are hundreds e! miles e! railivay to be built, of canal-s to be repaired;
there are no leas than 504 bridges to be reconstructed.
With reference to the third point, the
abrogat ion o! the Treaty o! Frankfort presents a great openîng for us. What wvere
the imports of France from Germiany prior
to the wvar? One billion sixty-eigbt million
franc-. And fromi Austria the imports
amounted to 103,500,000 francs. Those inmports include many articles which we are
now prepared te aupply.
What is the remedy prepoaed by the Governinent' It consiste o! an effer to France
of eur intermiediate tariff, in exchange. oi
special concessions on certain lires o!

France bas. Do you Vhink vie are go.ing ta
get much? Do yeu think wve are entitled Vo
get much? Should we net shake off our fetVers o! old, free ourselves from the servitude
of the most favoured nation clause and
then say to France. -"Weare free; we wili
bargain with you; what wilJ yeu give us foi

We sel

tariff se Jo-w that -we shall have an exclusive

lower than for any other nation." WTe could
apply this method te a great 'many Jines et
merchandise. That is by far the best way
te negotiate.
But Jet me go further. Should the Gev
ernment succeed in obtaining frem France
special concessions in exchange fer eut
intermediate tariff, how will it work eut foi
France? Let me eall your attention te a
very serieus state o! affairs. How -was ou.
tariff applied te France by the Department
of Customs? 1 theught, the method o! ita
application se extraerdinary, I received
Tepresentationa from France so cf ten. that
I made an earneslt effort te ascertain the
facts. The duty on French geods is imposed on a fictitiens value of the franc.
How dees this fictitieus value affect the
goods imperted from. France? Let me tak#3
a very smaîl sum as an example, se that I
nîay be better understeod. 6uppose yeu
are a merchant and you have eone dollar t j
spend. You send un order te France for
goods wverth one dollar. That means that
you buy gooda to the value o! 10 francs 3aý
centimes, at the present value o! Frenchi
currency. which is 'worth 10 francs 30 centimes te the Canadian dollar. Very 'well.
you go ta the Customs Department and yoli
Aay: " I have paid a good Canadian dolla!
fer this article. The duty is 35 per cent on
thia; now impose yeur duty; you bave .9
right te 35 cents." "Oh, ne," says the
Customs officer, '«you have bought goods to
the value o! 10 franc,- 30 centimes in
France, but an Ordex in Council bas fixed
the value of the franc at 5 francs 15 centimes te the dollar. Therefore the dutv
must be imposed on 10 francs 30 centimes;
that is te say, on two dollars instead o!
one." Therefere -the geeds are charged, net
with 35 cents, but with 70 cents. That
seems very unjust.
But that is net aIl. As you are aware, it
is impossible te ebtain short deliveries for
any gooda erdered in France. If your order
is placed to-day you may net receive the

SENATE
mercharidise for six months. The ocean is
net as easy te cross as the border. You cati
go te the United States and order your
goods and get thein within 30 days, but
you cannot expect te receive goods se
quickly from France. _Well, -what happensO
The custoins regulation provides that in regard te geods upon which ne actual value
is placed at the turne cf shipment-and this
is practically always the case for importations frein France-there is a super-tax inposed cf 20 per cent when three months
elapse between the erder and the shipinent;
12J per cent when two months elapse
between the erder and the shipinent;
and 5 per cent wvhen the delay is reduced tce
How does that work out? It
30 days.
mearis that the importer has te pay a doubla
duty and the super-tax. When the goods
reach Canada, he has te pay $1 for the'
goods, plus 70 cents for dut.y, plus '40 cents
super-tax, or a total cf $2.10.
Hon. 'Mr. CROSBY: 0f duty?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Now if the duty
n'as imposed on -the real value of the franc,
which is 10 francs, 35 centimes te the dollar,
and even with thie application cf the supertax, which I think is unjust, the arnount
payable would be enly $ 1.55.
Now let us -see hon' this compares witli
France's g-reatest competitor, the United
States. You have one dollar te spend. You
buy your geods iri the United States and
bring them in. What duty de yeu pay'
Thirt-y-five cents, nothing more. Therefore
you pay crie dollar for yeur goods and 35
cents fer duty. You get the geods inostly
within 30 days; therefore the super-tax is
only 5 cents, and the total cost te you is
only $1.40. 0f course, yeu have te. add to
that an amount sufficient te make up the
depreciatien on cur own rnoney, 15 per cent,
which bririga the amount te about $1.55 or
$1.60. Is it reasonable te expect that
French geods cari compete with Americari
geods under such circuistances? Increase
that one dollar te $ 100,000 and in the case
of France you will -have te spen.d $210,000,
whereas if you bought simiilar goods in the
Ujnited States, the cost weuld be $160,000.
It is altogether out cf the question for
France te compete under the present conditions.
Evidently you must say: -'This diff erenc2
ini treatinent in these twe cases is se «reat
that there muýst bie a reason fer it." That
was my first thought. Very well, let us see
whether there is *a reasen for it or net.
Section 59 cf the Act respecting Customs i-very plain. My honourable friends cai
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

easily refer te it, it is chapter 48 of the
Revised Statutes, section 59; it provides, in
part, that unless there is a value fixed on
foreign currency by Order in Geuncil it
shall be the duty of those importing goods
frein a country in which the currency sî
depreciated to obtain froin any Consul
residing in such country a certificate of thc
value of that depreciated currency at the
date at which the goods are shipped. In
such case the duty is imposed on the value
of the currency se established. Why is ýthat
section not applied? Simnply because there
is an Order in Council which %satesthat
the franc is -worth 5 francs, 15 centimes te
the dollar.
You will further say: "Surely there is u
reason why the value of the franc is s;.
fixed and cannot bie altered. It is only to,
apparent that it is te the detriment u,
France, and it is cf no, benefit to us, because the goeds which otherwise corne from
France, corne frein other countries; therefore we gain nothing at all; we get the saie
amount cf duty; other countries profit and
France loses the trade.Well, gentlemen, 1 find that this Order
in Council is dated on the lst February.
1918. The franc there is queted at 19.30
cents, which is 5.15 francs te the dollar.
This Order in Council was amended on the
5th cf November, 1919, ini respect to the cu,renc'ies cf Guatemala, Honduras, San SalIn
vador, China, Paraguay, -and Persia.
addition it dees net establish the value oi
the American dollar. Why could it net be
amended te eliminate frein it the fixed
value cf the franc. Is there any practical
or technical difficulty in the Nvay? -Honourable gentlemen, in the IRepublic te the
south of us, with a very much larger and
more complicated business than our own,
wvhenever French goods are imported the
Arnerican Consul certifies on the date et
shipment of the goods the value cf the
French currency, and it is on the value se
certified that ,the duty is paid.
Bomne turne ini 1919, 1 think it 'vas on the
6th Oct-ober last, as shown in Hansard,
page 842, Hcn. Mr. Maclean gave tw)
reasens why our duty sheuld be applied as
it presently is. These reasons at first sight
seemed plausible. The first one was that it
was very difficult te modify the existine,
systein. I think I have disposed cf that
objection by reference te the practice followed in the United States. But the Q>ther
one was very much more serious in its cousequences. .He said: "If you faveur France
because the currency has depreciated, yen
are geing- te faveur -Germany very mnuch

JUNE 30, 1920
more." Hanourable gentlemen, are you
aware that some of our good neigbbours ta
the south take their raw niaterials across to
Germany, get thern the-re turned inta
finished goods, ibring them back a.nd pay
duty, and iay tbem down on their own market cheaper than tbey eould get themn
manufactured at home; and I would not be
at ail surprised to learn that they also often
ship them across the frontier ta us. Germany cannot get raw material as with bier
depreciated currency she has ta pay 8W0
per cent advance on anything she import%
whilst France pays slightly over 200 per
cent. France wants ail sorts cf goods for reconstruction purposes. Why should we not
furnis-h thein? We have the sympatby of the
people of France; they open their arms ta
us, -tbey only ask -that 'we make it possible
for them ta deal with us.
I amn sorry ta -see that the minîsterial
chairs are ernpty at the present time, and
that the advantage we possess of speaking
directly Vo the CGoverniment through its
representatives, in this House, is denied to
me et this tirne. I earnestly hope, however, that pending the neg-otiations now
going on with France, two thingas will b.ý
done: first, that we will get rid of the
shackles-and, mind you, our freedom is
'within our reach and for our aski-ng. England will not -stand in the way; if we only
express the wish, she will grant it. Let us
bie, first of ail, free, let us offer ta France
special privileges in exchange for special
privileg-es. Let us further have the customs
duties imposed as they sbouid be on the
real value of French currency, and flot on as
fictitious v;alue, whicb practically chokes
every possibility of trading -with a country
to which we are drawn by every possible
advantage and every possible sysnpathy.
Let me close by saying that it is googi
business for us ta trade w-it.b France, as she
in na way competes with our home industries. There is another reason wbich rises
considerations:
above purely niateriai
France bas bled more than any other country, she bas assunied a heavier debt than
any ather country. Ail of France bas been
bleedinýg arid paying for ail of hiuranity,
and non, that ;lie is bravely striving 'ta
climb the steep and narrow path that leads
bier ta the far but radiant sumniit of pro3perity and happiness, surely she deserves
the help and synmpathy of people so deephrnoved by bier bieroic deeds and 50 greatly
benefited by bier appailing- sacrifices.

fore the office of the
not been dealt with as a distinct. office; it
bas always been. dealt 'with as that of a
member of the Council holding the office
of Prime Minister, and has necessitated, his
having a portfolio. Under the present Bihl
it is not. necessary that the Prime Minister
should be designated as hol.ding a specific
portfolio. The ealary la voted to the office
of Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does it not amount
Vo a change in the Constitution-in this
way, that under our Canadian Constitution
and also under the traditions of the British
Constitution the Prime Minister has been
looked, upon simphy as a member of the
Cabinet whom the other inembeTs' have
agreed Vo work with, and who, of course,
has been called upon by the King to form
a Cabinet? No recognition was given Vo
him as Prime Minister. He accepted, a portfolio either as Firs-t -Lord o! the Treasury
in England, or in Canada as Presiden t of
the Council. Now we are going to adopt
an altogether different programme, as it
were: the Prime Minister is Prime Minister
without any other portfolio.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We recognized him as holding that office. I think
it is a distinct improvement in our 'Constitution.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:- But it is, a change.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, to
that extent it is a departure.
POWER: He has to run an

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- He need
noV necessarihy do that. He might. be a
niemher of this Chamber.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Sect.ion 3 was agreed to.
On. section 4-provisions applicable to
prisent sesQsion:
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOOK: il thînk we might
have a ittie explanation of this. The first
Vwo uines o! this section provide that the
other regulations in this Bihl shaîl not apphy
to the indeinnity for this particular session.
That is to say, Vhe rules and regulations that
have applied Vo the paying of t.he indýemnity
heretofore will apply te this session except
in so far as the amount o! the indemnit.y
and the amount that is to ha de§ducted for
absence are concerned.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
effect o! it will be that notwithstaziding

839

the increase of the indemnity the Act as
at present upon the 6tatute book, with
regard to payments and absences of members, and so on, shall be in operation as
it the Act had flot been amended, except
to the. extent of the greater compensation.
The difference between $2,500 and $4,000
shall apply to this session.
Hon. Mr. BFIQUE: And $25 instead
of $15s for absence?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGRHEED: Yes.
The deductions. will be made as they will
be made hereafter; but the Bill permits
members who were absent to take advantage of the increased indemnity less the
increased deductions to the same extent
as if no increase had been made.
Hon. Mr. POWIER: Does not the leader
o! the -Government see that there is to
a certain extent a contradiction between
this provision and the provision in clause
6D The clause we are considering provides
that the members -shall attend threequarters of the sitting days-, and new section 35 says:
A deduction at the rate of twenty-flve dollars
per day shall be made from such sessional
allowance for every day beyond fifteen on which
he is a member, if the House sits on such days.

I do not undertake to say that under
that provision a member could get away
with the grose indemnity without attending
three-quarters of the days. We will say
that the session hasts ý50 days. Tbreequarters of 50 are in round numbers 36.
Now, a member attends 22 days, and then
ha bas these 15 days for xvhich he is not
penalized under section 35. ls there not
some risk that we may get back to the
old abuse? I think that. when we are
getting so generous an indemnity as is
being given by this measure, this provision
allowing 15 days to a member on which
he doee not need to sit should. be omitt'ed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 think
not. The Parliamentary Counsel tells me
that that bas received every consideration,
and that there is every safeguard surrounding it. The introduction into the
Bill of a compulsory attendance o! threequarters of the days upon which the H1ouse
sits will amply protect against that; and
likewvise there is an additional provision
in the hast proviso in subsection 1 of new
section 35, under which a mernber must
be, in his place* during the last two weeks
of the session.

Hon. Mr. FOW'LER: I was not here
when section 3 w-as discussed, and I should
like te aek a question. 1 see that a very
generous allowance is made te the Speaker
of the lieuse of Gommons and te the
Speaker ot the Senate. Dees that mean
that he gets in addition some $3,000 a year,
1 think it is for his bouse?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not
under the Act. A provision has been made
'bv Order in Council, I tbink, and alfterwards carried inte the Estirnates, by
which. under the exceptional circumstances growing eut et the fire, the ailowance was made te both Speakers as te

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I arn net objecting
te the $3,000 ailowance, but I arn objeting te the additional alUowance provided
for bere, because I say that $13,00 is
more th.an the position is wortb, a.nd I
think that would be the general feeling in
the country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Now
fhat the increased allowance appears upon

Parliament can x'evise what it bas done in
the past. It doe net follo-w that the carne
aflhwance will be made for bouse and

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I may tell the
honourable gentleman from Kings (Hon.
Mr. Fowler) that, as iar as the $3,000 grant
it concerned, conditions are far froan being
as good as they were in the old House.
In tihe old lieuse the Speaker was providei with fuel and with help-be generally
had six employees at bis command for the
wbole year-wbereas ne'w, for instance, I
have b<yug<ht a bouse on which the interest
on the amount invested is $1.500, and I
pay $500 for taxes. I have to, hire ahl .my
servants, and I have te pay for niy fuel,
my ligbt, and everything else. Sc it will
be seen that former Speakers were much
better paid tban we are no-w. If I understood the honourable gentlemnan aright,
he said that the Speakers were paid tee
much for tibeir work.
I tbink se.
Hon. Mr. FOWLEII
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I suppose that
when the bonourable gentleman is appointed Speaker of this lieuse he will decide
vhether he will refuse the $3,000 or not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLE1l: I de net tbink that
i-g the right way to put it. I think I bave
a right as a member e! this lieuse te criticize, and II should pe.rhaps criticize a little
-more closely now, since His Honeour the
Speaker takes Viha-t attitude. It is ne argument te say what I or any other person
,would do if appointed- Speaker: it is a
question es~te what the people who bave te

gives te the Speaker $13,000 a year. Ministers of the Crown, whe bave te, devote

who is obliged to give lis time only when
Parliament is in session and! perhaps a
week or two before and a week or Vwo
efterwards, ta fulfil the duties of his
dffice, ia to receive 53,500 more than. a
Minister af the Orow-n received. unckr the
ohi Act. This applies flot only ta the
Speaker of this lieuse but ta -the Speaker
of the other House as well. I Bay that the
increase is toc greait. That is my opinion,
and, I arn not afraid- ta express it.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-sessional indemnity:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This extends the
minimum session for which un indemnity
is payable -from 30 days ta 50 days?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: And the new section 33 requires that a member must be in
attendance for at lesst three-quarters of the
eitting duys &f the House to be entitled to
the indemnity of $4,000. Is not that the
case?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK:- How does the 15
days allowance came in? 19 it when the
rnember lias attended for at least threequarters of the sitting days?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And the
last, two weeks of the session.
Hon. Mr. I3OSTOCK: In the new section
35 1 find these words:
Provided also that the deduction shall be
made for every day on which a member does
flot attend a sittlng of the House of whlch he
Is a member during the last two weeks of any
session of Parliament

So I take it that as the sessions generally
run, the 15 deays allowance wil not be of
any advant.ge to honourable members of
this Hlouse.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It will
not be of the same advantagae as it formerly
Wv.a
S.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: If a mewmber is present
for three-quarters of the time lie gets bis
full indemnit-.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If he fails short of
that the allowance is $25 for eacli day's
-attendance.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:- That ia the point
I want to hav7e cleared up.

841

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As 1 understand it, a member of Parliament will not
be entit1ed to his full indemnity if lie does
not attend three-qu.arters of the sittings of
the House of which he is a member.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
But when he
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
lias a'ttaine-d that 75 per cent attendance lie
is entitled to the $4,000 indemnity; but
from that $4,000 will be deducted $25 for
eaeh day thait he is absent beyond the 15
d.ayr t.hat are aflowed hixn.
Hon. Mr. FOW~ILER: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BO'TOCK: I do flot think the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed.) has quite caught my point, because this provision regarding the last two
weeks of the session duaes flot apply there
at ail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the
15 days at the close of the eession do flot
apply there. The 15 days must be taken
before the last two weeks of the session.
Hon. Mr. FARRELL: You must be here
for the last two weeks.
Hon. Mr. POWER.- There is one point
regarding section 32:
For every session of Parliament whlch extends beyond 60 days there shall be payable ta
each member of the Senate and House of Commons attending at such session a sesgional
allowance of four thousand dollars and no
more.
1 think that neither the honourable leader
of the House nor any other lionourable member will venture to say that it is likely we
shall hav'e any session of less than 50 days.
I think this is equivalent to saying that
there shall be no session less than 50 days..
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
-Hon. Mr. POWER: 1 think -ie may trust
the energy and perspicacity of the members
of both 'Hous-es to feel assured that no session hereafter will be less than 50 daye.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but those
50 days wiil not be 50 sitting days.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
It means 50
Hon. Mfr. DÂNDURAND:
calendar days from the opening- of Parliament. For instance, froin the first of one
month to the twentieth. of the following
month.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: I do not think the
fifteen days allowance is going ta be of mucli
value in the Senate. Rf asked the question
bevause 1 want to have 'this point muade
clear.

Hion. Mr. BOSTOGK: There have been
52 sitting days this 6ession. Three-quarters
o! that number would be 40.

Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It simply

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: As a rule, this

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEED:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. -DA'NDURAND:
But my
honourable friend, I think, must qualify
that answer. He told us that subsection
2 of section 35 would prevent a rnerber
of Parlament from taking advantage of
those days of adjourment if be had not
previously put in an appearance.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is al
right. The intention of this is to prevent
an abuse whicb has been complained ofthe practice of members absenting themselves for a certain tîme during the session, and then appearing before the
close and claiming ail the days over
which the Senate adjourned
in previous rnontbs. I would draw the attention o! my honourable friend to
a pbraseology which works out unjustly.
In order ta obtain the advantagie of the
adjournîment say over the week-.end, from
Saturday to Mond-ay. a member will need
to be present on the day pre.ceding the adjournrnent. So that it will 'work in this
way: for dnstance, a memiber of this
Chamber meav be absent on the Tuesday,
the Wednesday, and the 'flhursday, and
those days wilýl be deducted f-rom bis fifty
days if the session is long enough. But if
he attends on the Friday he will be 'entitled ta count in his ýfavour thbe Saturday
and the Monday, 'whereas if absent on the
Frida.v he will not be entitled to dlaim tihe
Saturday and Monday as attendance days
for the making of the 75 per cent. I do not
quite underst-and wihy that word "immecdiat;ely" is there, because if a Tnan be
absent on Friday, although he bas been
bei-e ail week, he would lose the advantage of that attendance, wb.iie another
member may *be absent tbe wbole o! thie
wxeek, but be here on thbe Friday and gain
those days.

th-e day preceding the adjournment, a
meinher living in British Columnbia, for
instance, if he wished to go home, wvoul.d
have ta spend the whoie time on the train.
That is a serious handicap ta members
living at a distance, and I point it out in
order tlhat it may be remedied.

THIRD REA.DING.

On section 8--Judicial Committee of the
rrivy Council:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to ask my
honourable friend just what bas been the
situation in this regard during- the lest two
or three years. It is traditional for the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court te attend the
sittinga of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, and for many years past
prpvision bas been made to cover 'his travelling expenses. Last year and this year
the Chief Justice dîd not attend, but one of
the other judges of the Supreme Court who
is a member of the Privy Council attended
the sitting, the amount neces.sary for bis
travelling expenses being voted in the
Estimates. Apart from this Bill altogether,
I want to ask why the Chief Justice was not
chosen.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Bill was read the third time and passed.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the House wvent into Committee on the
Bill. Hon. !Mr. Fisher in the Chair.
On section 1-definition of "Judge" made
to include a president of a court:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
simply a change in the ànterpretation. It
is made te include the judge of the Exchequer Court, which is a new term we
adopted this session.
Section 1 ivas agreed to.
On section 2--Supreme Court of Canada:
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: The
salary of the Chief Justice of Canada under
the present law is $ 10,000. The proposed
salary is $ 15,000.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The $15,000 is for
other duties as well?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
It includes the duties he wvill perform as
Deputy Governor. So it will do away with
any question hereafter as to any additional duties he may be called upon to
perform.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3, 4, 5 were agreed to.
On section 6 (new section 10)-New
Brunswick:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:- I want to say, with
regard to judges, that I think their salaies

Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is provided
for; that is one of the great, things in
this Act.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then that is al
right; I have nothing more to say.
New sections 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 14-1
were agreed to.
Section 7 was agSreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I reall
could not tell my honourable friend. I fancy
that if the Chief Justice wanted te go there
would be no objection to bis geing.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: He was net strong
enough.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUET: Did my bonourable
friend examine him miedically?
Hon. W. B. ROSS8: I do net need to. That
is a notorious fact.

on questions of Iaw, but 1 do net know
whether I sheuld take it on medical matters.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Take your medicine.
Hon. W. B. ]ROSS: I t.hink perhaps it
wvould be safer te take it on medicine. No
affront bas been put on the Chief Justice.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I did not say there
hiad been; but I wanted te know why the
tradition had been departed from.
Hon. W. B. ROSS5: He did net want te ao.

SENATE

846

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does mny honourable friend know that?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Before this is carried,
I w'ant to say a word or two. There have
been some strictures passed upon a late
member of the Supreme Court of Canada,
'which 1 think were not well deserved. I was
inforined by -Chief Justice Strong t.hat anyone attending the meetings of the Judicial
Committee bas, to go well informed as te
the whole course of judicial procedure and
judicial decisions in Canada, and must be
prepared to give some information as to
what is going- on in the United States. In
addition to that, 1 found that he was
wvorking býard to get a general idea of what
was going- on in Australia, in India, and
in Egypt, because, a man cannot sit aniongthe niembers of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council unleas bie is qualified
no
along- the same Uines as they are. This isQ
smail inatter, and I would be sorry to, t.hink
that anyone should go away with the idea
that the $3,0O0 is, not a well-earned sruni, 'no
matter who the judge may be who takes the
pos-ition.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I ehould like to ask
if thîs $3,OOO is sufficient te meet the
expensýes that the representative would be
put top
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh. 1
think they wvill see to, that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: WVould it not
be better that the Government should, revert
to the old system of designating the Chief
Justice, and, if be did flot wish to go, of
allowing him to designate corne one to
take bis place? WVe have been trying to
maintain the independeiice of the judges
and to keep them free from political influence. I diclike tbe idea of the Government
selecting one of the judges of the Suprerne
Court of its own free wviÎl. It seern to meI want to be as gentie as possible in myv
expression-that there may be a tendencv
on the part of the public to dicuss the
reason wby Mr. So-and-s-o hbas been selected
in preference te somnebody else? This is
flot the resuit of a flight of imagination on
my part, but is because of corne questions
put te me as te why the Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court vwas net selected and
someonie elee vas. Then the question of
the relations bet-ween the judges of the
Suprenie Court and, the Department of
Justice or the GovernTn>nt of the day cornes
inte the discussion. I say that adtvisedly,
because we must rise above persons and
[Hon. Mr. ROSS.]

personalities. Me are leg-islating witbout
having in view individuals. We are trying
te establisb ruies to guide the Government
of the day-and the Government of the day
is the G'overnment of this day and the
Government of to-morrow. As I have said,
I dislike the principle of allowing any
departmnent of the Governrnent. the discretion
of selecting a judge. I tltink, we sbould say
that it sbould Jbe the Chief Justice, or eomeone whom hie may decignate. lIn this way
we would eut the connection between the
Government and the judiciary with ail that
that may imply.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This does
net say that the Government shall make the
selection. It only makes provisions for
travelling and, living expenses.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but that
does flot dietraet from thbe argument I have
miade, because tbe Government in later
years, instead of applving te tbe Ohiel
Justice, bas appointed one of the puisne
judges, naming bim, and has given him the
stipend.
Hon. Mr. IBELCOURT: Wby is tbe
arnount put in this Bill instead of being
placed as usual in the Estimates?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is unnecessary te put it in the Estimates from
titne te time. The judge may not attend tbe
sittings, of the Privy Council every year.
Hon. Mr. ]3ELCOURT: The camie thing
bappens witb thousands of items. Expenses
are voted te he expended enly if the required
event takes place. In the past this. it-em bas
always been voted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LO'UGHEED: It was
net v-ery pleasant for the Chief Justice te
bave it discussed on t.he floor of Parliamient. It is net desirable that it should
be so. This is a mat-ter of uncontrollable
expenditure, and it is verv mnuch ibetter that
it should be piovided fer in the statute, ju6t
as are the judges ealaries.
Hon. Mr. BELOT: That may be se;
'but if there is anyt.hing in the argument of
my borieurable friend from De 'Lerimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), tbe public and the
representatives of the people in the House
Of ýCommcns, who bave the rigbt te discuss
the question would be interested in knowing
why one juidge vas chosen in preference te
another.
Hon. Mûr. BEIQUE: I think there is another reason for it. This Aet determines

JUNE 30, 1920
what amou-nt shaU be paid to the judge-s,
and closes the Kloor Vo them .reoeiving any
other rernuneration in case Vhey are called
upon Vo renider other services than sitting
on their regular courts. That bei-ng s0, ît
becaxne necessary Vo make an exception ot
this $3,000 paid for attending the sittings of
judicial committee of the Privy Council.
Section 8 via agreed Vo.
Sections 9, 10, and Il viere agreed Vo.
On section 12--j.udges net Vo be paid any
remuneration for acting on commissions,
etc.:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I arn more than pleased Vo find thie section in the BiE, because it
has removed vihat I think was one cause of
rapid deterioration in our judicial systeim.
The proviso at the end of subsection 2 is
objectionabie, but 1 hope the time ie flot
far distant when vie may get f ree of that.
There are judges in Ontario viho are paid
aliloviances by the provincial Government.
As I bave said before--and I arn satisfied
now that the Department of Justice agrees
with me-those payments to judges appointed by the Dominion, and vihose salaries are
fixed. by the Dominion, are nitra vires. 1
think it is, highiy objectionable that any
Dominion judge ishould have any sum paid
Vo hirn by any province or a.ny Rnunicipality.
Now that the judges' salaries are being
increased, I hope the provinces wiii see
their viay olear Vo aboliehing provincial
statutes authorizing that pracýtice,. and that
they wiii1 keep their hands off the Dominion judges in the future, whatever excuse
Vhey mnay have had in the past. However,
ha.lf a loat is better than ne bread, and this
s-ection is viell worth the vihole of the cost
that is going Vo be throvin upon the country by the increase ïn judges' salaries. The
proper course Vo folilow is Vo appoint a
judge and Vo fix hi& salary; the couqntry is
then entîtled Vo hie whoile time. This will
put an end Vo ca.nvassing, or attempted
canvassing, for appointrnents on arbitrations.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Like my honourable friend, I toe arn gratefui for hait a loat;
but Vo me it is oni-y hait a boa! ; and se long,
as I. have a s-eat in this Hcuse I propose
every time that opportunity offers Vo get
the other hait o! the boal if it is Vo be got.
I think that this Parliament ought Vo endeavour at the earliest possible moment Vo
prevent any jud.ge from doiing anything
beyond sitting .in court performing judicial
wvork. We have judgee in thiG province,

every tirne there is an arbitration in eight,
and, I have ne hesitation in mentioning the
Chietf Justice of Ontario.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: He is cut out under
this.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, he is noV eut
out. He could set as an arbitrator, but
he could only geV his travelling expenees.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Your point ie that he

duties P
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Absolutely.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: And slop serving on
commissions.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Even without pay.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I think my. honourable friend andi I are agreed on that
point. Judges are appointed, Vo act as
judges in court; it vas neyer contemplatesi
that any judge vas te act as an arbitrator,
either with or without pay.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They will not act
very long without pay.
Hon. Mr.. BELCOURT: I think that Parliament ought Vo prohibit them acting in
that capacity in any vay. They are net
appointed for that purpose. A judge may
think that it is a diversion Vo leave hie court
and Vo sit as chairman of an arbitration,
even without pay; but durîng the time he
is sitting on that arbitration hie judiciai
duties are being neglected, and he je net
performing, the funiction for which he vas
appointed.
I amn net complete]y satisfied with this
Bill. I have been helping my honoura-ble
friend in hie Ineve te prevent the judges
acting as arbitratore, and I propose te help
him in the future; I hope we may stick Vogether in that fight; but if he dees not
choose to keep on I will keep on by myself.
I arn net satisfied. Judges have no right te
act as arbit.rators, executors, or anything
but judges.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: I -have net changed
my mind in the slightest degree since I
stated in thie House, net only last
year but on several other occasions
that the ideal condition je Vo have a jusige
attend te his judicial duties and Vo them
alone. If vie allovi judges Vo leave the
Bench Vo go eut and sit on disputes that
are net purely judicial, we are in danger of
destroying their utility and the confidence
which the people have in them. In England, where they have had several hundred

SENATE

years more experience than we have had, I
find that the trend of opinion is ahl the
samne way. While the judges there were
serving outside of their regular judicial
positions during the war, now that the war
is over the leading papers say they should
get back to the old rule. The Law Times
gave some instances of mnen who were as
fine judges as ever sat on the Bench, but
who, because they left tee Bench and served
on one or two commissions, lost their influence and the confidence of the public as
a whole.
The administration of justice is the first
thing in every civilized country. That la
the difference between a civilîzed and an
uncivilized country; and the only rthing
that will save us fromn Bolshevism and al
the wild teings which are fioating around
to-day will be to keep these men in such
a position that everyone will 'have confidence that the poorest mnan as well as the

There was a

time in Canada when the judges fromn one
end of the country to tee other enjoyed
the universal respect and admiration, of1
the people. But teat time bas passed. I

-- why? Largely because of this ab-use teat
has been resorted to by tee Governments
in tee Dominion anid tee provinces. I
make no distinction between one party
and another. It has beeri practised by
both. It is largely because these gentlemen thave been appointed te hold the
balance between the public and the Geverninent ini such important matters, for
instance, as the Canadian Northiern railway deal and the Grand Trunk railway
transaction. I dare say that 50 per cent of
tihe peopkl of Canada are not going to be
sat.isified vlth the judgment that ýwill be
rendered in either of teose cases. No
miatter how jiist or how fair it snay be,
there will ha a strong suspicion that will

question for a long time, and I arn glad te

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have just a

Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I have no feeling
of that sort.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do flot know
how that may ibe, but his statement is not
in keeping- with the universal experience
in that portion of the province f rom wvhich
I corne. There la a good deal to be said,
ho'wever, in f-avour of the contention th-at
judges shou.ld not act as arbitrators. We
'have at present in Ontario an illustration
of how public business fails to be attended
te owing te tee judge's accepting arbitrations. At the present time we have two
judg-es sitting as arbitrators for the Ontario mGovernment. They have been engaed ini that arbitration now fer fome.
tihing like three weeks, and I do not know
how much longer it is going to be continued. The result is thst. oteher judges
are obliged to do their work. Unfortunately there is a vacancy on tee Bench, and
ano4iher judge is ill. Conseq.uently te
ord.inary duties of four judges are net
being attended te, and business is congested. The Court of Appeal failed to eit
from tee 15th of June to 'the end of te
monte. At tee close of the sitting- there
,iere some sixty cases flot disposed of, and
these must stand over until Septemfber.
One can readily see that if it requires a
certain nunber of judges to do a givenl
amount of work, and if t-wo of tem are
tran-Àferred te arbitrations and t.wo are ili,
or oteerwise in.capacitated, tee -work is not
going to be carried on.
Now, j.ust a -word as te the payment of
$1,000 a year te the judges of Ontario. The
judges of the Supreme Court, of the province of Ontario each receive the Ontario
Government $1,000, wlhich is paid te them
for services teey are supposed. to p.erform.

oficers, clerks, and emnployees.af the Senate or
the flouse of Commons, the expression "Governor In Council" means the Senate or the
flouse of Cannions, as the case may be.
If hanourable gentlemen will look at the
section they will see what this means.
The Civil Service Commission reports ta
the Governar in Council as ta departmental officiais, but in the applicatÀon ai
this section ta the officers, clerks and employees ai the Library ai IParliament, or
ta such ather clerke or employees as are
under the joint contrai af bath Houses ai
Parliament, the repart is not made ta the
Governor in Council bul ta the Senate and
the House ai gonimons.
This amendment w~ill keep the contrai
in the hands ai the Senate. We gave way
a few days aga ta the House ai Commans
on another Bill tauchiing this point, not
insisting on aur amendment which. was
very necessary in the public intereet. I
gave way unwiflingly, as I think other
members did. I move that amendment.

as to the object of this Bill. Ronourable
gentlemen talk about the interests of the
Senate being interfered with by the Civil
Service Commission, and our rights being
legislated away, and sa on. This Bill is
only a temporary measure, to, be enforced
for a year. It expires next year, as honourable gentlemen wi]l see by section 8:
8. No persan shall be retlred under the provisions of this Act after the firet day of JulY,
one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one.
Now, there is a special reason, a reason
c hich has been strongly urged upon the
Goverument, for the passage of this legislatian. The action that has been taken
by the Government within the last year,
iooking ta the reconstruction af the public
service, has impressed upon the Goverliment that there is a large class of employees in the different branches of the
service Who have reached an age that will
nat only warrant but require the Government ta take steps for their superannuation in arder that the xnost efficient service may be rendered. 1 arn not for a
moment saying that men of that age can.
not render efficient service; but provision
is mnade in the -Bill sa that na injustice
will be done in cases ai that kind. Then
there ie another class provided for in the
Bill-men who have reached a.certain age,
and who, however inefficient, must be provided for. Honourable gentlemen who do
not camne in contact with those Meatures
of the public service 'do not appreciate
the very great number of men who aire
in the public service throughout, the whale
of Canada-a service which. numbers somet.hing like 60,000 employees-who are absolutely inefficient who are drawing publie
nîoney but giving no value for it. We
know perfectly well that in the past, when
an appaintment has been msde ta the
public service, the tendency has been ta
cmit ta provid-e any way ai removing the
appaintee from the service. But is it not
a highly laudable abject, unpleasant
though it be ta the Government, ta have
a tharough investigation inta the whole
public service, in order ta ascertain what
men are unable ta perform their duties,
through age, through inefficiency, through
iliness? I may say there are thousande
of such men. If you -force upon the

It seems to me that this Act is as clear
as it is possible to make it, and I think that
the sooner it is put on the statute book the
better. No one will be 'burt and the service
will ha improved. The leader of the Government is not speaking without some
authority or without some experience; he
is net speaking without some real knowledge of tbe situation and of tbe facts in
connection with the departments. Therefore I have no hesitation in saying that I
shall vote for the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, speakîng in reference to the amendment offered by thbe honourable gentleman
Rfrom Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross), I migbt
point out that it is to be observed that the
Bill is to remain in force for one year.
That being the case, it would not seemn to
me so important to give consideration to
the amendment proposed *by the honourable gentleman as if would be if this were
permanent legîsiation. It is further to be
observed that in ail probability some form
of permanent superannuation will eventually have to be arranged to fit tihe whole
Oivil Service. A few montbs ago, a aurvey
o! the Servi ce was taken and it was found.
that there were approx:imately 1,300 people
in the Service over the age of 65 years,
many o! whom were no longer able to give
value for the compensation received. It le
equally true tbat it is not possible £or them
to retire from active work and to discontinue receivingc compensation; if they did,
they would not be able to carry on and support theniselves.
The Government bas no desire, and I arn
sure Parliament bas no desire, to treat tlhese
old and faithMul employees -in anything but
a fair and proper manner. It is therefore
deerned necessary, flot only in justice to
tbese people, but for the purpose of improving the efficiency o! the public service, to
make temporary provision wbereby auch
employees as bave reached the ages named
and who are not able to give full time service should be retired upon tlhe terms set
out in the Bill, subjeet, of course, I assume, to tbe preparation and adoption at
a future session of a permanent system of
superannuation.
Tbis measure also concerns economy as
well as efficiency. A large number o! tbese
civil servants 'wto have been in tbe servicn
cof the country for a number of years bave
reacbed the zenith o! their ratings or gradings. They draw the top salaries, and
doubtless -have merited eonsideration in tbe
past by reason o! long service; but tbe
situation at present is tbat juniors who

of
these

employees. To
continue in the Service
employees
ivho
do not and who in mnany cases are flot
able to appear at their offices too render
service is somewhat discouraging to these
juniors. My experience covers perhaps the
sniallest department; but I have there
one very pitiable case, soi far as one's
sympathy îs conceerned. It is the case of
a man whom in my opinion it would be a
very serious matter tu retire without givinghim sufficient compensation to enable hini
tu take care of hinmelf and bis aged wife
so long as he lives.
This Bill simply provides a modest but
at the same time a very help.ful retiring
allowance. If the amendment df my honourable friend from Middleton (H-on. W. B.
Ross) is seriously put forward and should
prevail in this !House, with the prospect
of prorogation to-night-and I think we have
already had notice fromn the Governor
General-it is quite possible that this 'Bill
would not get back to tbe Houise of Conimons and be returned bere again.
The
resuit 'would be that it would dlu, wbicb
I think would be regrettable. Inasmuch
as the whole m.atiter will likely corne under
consideration at a future session, I1express
the hope that my bonourable friend will
not press bis amendment.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: One niatter has been
cleared up. il understand that there are
men who, under the existing law, would
be entitled tu retire on thirty-five-fiftieths
or seven-tenths of their salaries.
Some
of them are afraid that under this Act they
might be retired on fifteen-sixtietbs; but
their fears sbould be dispelled by the assurance of the le.ader of the House that
that is not se. and that anyone who bas a
vested rigbt to retirt on seven-t-enths of his
salary is protected, and that even if there
is sornething -wrong in the construction of
,the Act it will be made good. As I understand the Bill will autornatically cease on
July 1, 1921, it rnay be -as mwel] to let it go.
So, witb the explanation I have made, il will
be satisfied to let the Bill pass as it i,-.

attended the meetings of the Cornmittee as
regularly this year as 1 did in the prior
seven years. I he-ard only about 34 divorce
cases, and there were over 100. But the
Committee has sometim-es sat frorn halfpast 10 in the morning until half-past 1,
and from 2 o'clock until half-past 6, and
then from 8 to 10 at nigh't, in order to clear
these cases. It is becoming a very great
labour.
These Divorce Bills Vo which the hionouTable gentleman refers were.passed through
this House by very large majorities. They
are very conservative measures. They do
not enl1arge the groitnds upon which divoroe
16s granted. On the contrary, they narrow
them; because there are no limits to the
grounds on which Parlia.ment may grant
divorces. But the divorce courts wou.ld, be
confined Vo the divorce laws existing in
England in 1870, a.nd ln those 1aws the
grou.nds for the granting of divorce are
well-defined, and, 1 woul say, fairly conservative.
I arn very rnuchi disappointed that the

to mnove un the matter-hie wa-s perhapG a
littie off his guard-the, time fo-r private
menhbers introducing Bis had expired -and
he would have to get a day fromi the Governient. As 1 understand, the opponients
of divorce in the -lower Huse say: -Why

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Explain.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
we go into Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTE5E AND
REPORTED.

On -motion o! Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Committee on the
Bill. Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, this is a Bill making provision for the inspection and regulation of
the packing of pickled fish. This has been
introduced very largely upon the representations of the Canadian Fisheries Association, and it practically places fish upon the
saine plane o! fruit and other products
which are inepected and regulated by the
Government. Up to the present time the
inspection o! fish bas not been carried on
to the same extent as the inspection of
other products-in tact, il bas not been
done.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, the ext.raordinary t.hing that 1.
8ee about this Bill is that, if it is a desirable measure, as my honourable friend bas
endeavoured to point out to the House, it
bas not been deait with before. Had prorogation taken effect, -as we expected, at 10
o'clock hast night, this Bill would apparently not have been passed. It is now brought
down to us-I was going to say, in the
dying hours of the session, but il is hater
thaîi thatHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Say the
eheventh hour.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: -when the rnembers have gone home and we are not in a
position to study the Bill.
As to the Bill itseif, I had a copy placed
in my banda only a few minutes ago, and
it is hard to tell exactly what it means.
However, I would draw the honoursîble gentleman's attention to the hast clause, which
Baya:
'rhié Act shall corne into force, with respct
to fish caught on thc Pacifie coast on the first
day of November, one thousand nine hundrcdamd twenty, and, with respect ta fIsh caught on
the Atlantic coast on the first day of April. one
thousand nine hundrcd and twenty-one.

I therefore fail to sce why there is a necessity to rush this legisîstion througli at the

SENATE

860

present tîme. If the fishing business has
been carried on successfully, as it has been
carried on, in this country for a number of
years past without this legaisiation, and if
this is to apply on the Pacifie coast only
after November, and flot to apply on the
Atlantic coa.st until after the Ist of April,
1921, surely this legisiation could have been
held over nuntil next session, when we
could study it carefully and know what we
wvere doing.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: This measure should
have been passed ten or fifteen years ago.
Hon. Mr. BOS'TOCK: Perhaps iny honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed>
would explain 'the rneaning of the provision
at the end of new section 9:
Provlded, however. that there shall be no appesa In any case where the aVppellant 19 unable to satisfy the Minister that the identity or
the container or fish with respect to which an
appeai la desired has been carefully preserved.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
must be evidence on which the appeal is
based. That is a principle of law that applier, to ail evidence.
Hon. -Mr. BOSTOCK: But would there
flot have to be evidence in the first case if
the inspector took a man up for flot having
his fish in conformity with the regulations
under the Act?
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The evidence might flot have been preserved atterwards. When the appeal cornes before the
Minister there mnust be evidence of the
subjeet-matter of the appeal. That is ail it
means.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If the appeal 'took
a long tirne, the evidence rnîght possibly
get into such a condition that it would not
be recognized in any court, or anywhere
else.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
would not advocate an appeal if 'there be
no evidence.

APIPROPRIATION BILL No. 4.

of Commons with Bill 221, an Act for

money for the public service o! the financial years ending tihe 3lst March, 1920,
and the 31st March, 1921.
The Bill was. read thé first Urne.
SECOND R2E.ADING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second ýreading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Supply Bill1 now before us is obviously a
large one, and a perusal of it will
conclusion
the
to
lead
inevitably
thereini are
that the votes contained
entirely necessary for the publie service-.
No good purpose. would be served by
making even limited rernarks, let alone extended rernarks, upon a Supply Bill1 eo
large and so important as the one noui before us. When 1 say that no good purpose
would be served, of course I have in view
t~he fact that the constitution-al functions
of the 8enate would stand in the way of
our giving to iA that analytical attention
which so large a measure is entitled to receive, if it is considered at ail. No other
Bill1 that cornes before Parhiament receives
the ýamne degree of attention as the Supply
Bill1. It reflects not only a scrutiny and
searching investigation by Parliament itself, but also, to an even greater degree, a
scrutiny by the Government, more partieularly the Finance Minister and 'his associates.
It is a mistake to think for a moment that
every item which la presented to the Governiment by different Ministere as the eubject-matter of a parliamentary vote is included in the Supply Bill. I. say wit-h
every confidence, and unhesitatingly, that
the searching exarnination which is made
by the menibers of the Government concerning a Supply Bill1 before it is presented
to Parliament, is very rnuch greater and
more seârching than that of Parliament
Coneequently honourable gentleitself.
men can accept the Supply Bill withi the
greatest mesure of confidence, knowing
that it bas undergone the investigation and
examination to which I have referred.

Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: flefore
the honourable gentleman resumea hie
speech, may I ask if this Supply Bill has
been siwbmitted ta the Committee on Finance ai thia House that was appointed for
the purpoee ai regulating the financial
affaire ai the country.
No, it
*Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGXEED:
bas not, and may I zay in that connection
that I -scarcely think the Finance Committee deaires ta assume a task, so great as
that ai revieing the Supply Bill. I rather
think the abject ai the Finance Committee
waa ta revise other financial Bille rather
than the Estimates. Of course, the scope
o~f the Committee was sufficîently 'wide ta
permit af any Bill being referred ta it; but
I have nôt yet lheard of any motion ta refer
the Supply Bill ta the Coanmittee.
Hon. 7.4. FOWLER: I may aay rh passing that the appaintment of that Committee
was opposed by mnyseli; but I think that
the main argument in support o! it was that
it could go !nt<> the Supply Bill. A Committee canaisting of business men of high
repute was appointed for the purpose o!
bringing ta bear upon the Supply Bill the

861

power of their strong financial minds, so
that they could understand it and could explain it ta the rest of us w'ho do flot possess that great business acumen which
leads to great financial success. I regret to
find that my forecast at -the time has proved
to be correct, and that the work of that
Committee will be conspicuous *by its absence.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, when I listened to the leader of
the Government introducing this Bill, I
thought Ifrom his apening remarks that he
realized the position in which he is placed
at the present time and .the enormity of the
sins the Government have committed. I
regret to find that as he proceeded with his
speech 'he apparently was quite satisfied
with -the work that has heen done and with
the tremendous amount asked <for in the
Supply Bill. 3630,000,000 odd is a very large
sum indeed to have to find for the work of
a country with a population flot exceeding
9,000,000.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: 8,000,000.
Han. Mr. BOSTOCK: 1 wanted ta give
the Government the benefit af -the larger
figure. Suppasing that the population ia
9,000,000 this ia an enarmous amaunt ta require for canducting the affairs of the country this year. Particularly does -this aeem
so when we remember t-hat the Finance
Miniater in hie statement to the House estimated hie revenue at 3388,000,000ý odd. It
indicates the large sum of money that has
ta be raised by extra taxation through the
measures which we put through the House
the other day.
At the time the Bill dealing with -the
luxury tax waa before t.he House my banourable friend made the statement that 'he
hoped that the -revenue iram that tax would
*be between $75,000,000 and $80,000,000. Even
if hie hope is realized we will have to find
an enormaus amount in some way to meet
the demanda as outlined by my hanourable
ifriend ta-day.
If we are ta prorogue at hahf-past twa
this af.ternoon, tîme is toa short ta attempt
ta deal with this situation; but I want ta
refer ta one or two things that appear in
this Supply Bili-things which we in this
Hanse have before xnaintained shauld not
be placed in a Suppiy Bill. We provide
$140,000,000 ta pay the intereat an the public debt. The Finance Minister, when dealing with the public debt in anather place,
taok an exceedingly courageous and bald
stand when he admitted that certain items
that had been cariied in the accounta of the

862

SENATE

country for a number of years as assets
were flot longer Vobe considered as assets,
and hie put the net debt at $2,273,305,436.
That ia an enormous net debt for this country to be carrying. When you corne to
figure the interest on that debt at 6 per
cent 'lt only amounts Vo $136,398,826. So,
taking this as the net debt, either we are
paying on other items over and above the
amount included. in the net debt, or the rate
of interest is higher than 6 per cent.
Iu the Supply Bill as brought down wp.
have two items dealing with loans to railways. One is an item of $48,000,000 for the
Canadian Northern railway, and the other
is $25.000.000 for the Grand Txrunk railway.
In both case the Goverument provides that
the loans shall bear interest at the rate of
6 Per cent: but, as I have tried to show thp
flouse, it looks as though the rate of interest should be more than 6 per cent. It
would appear as though, when the Govern-ment,makes a: lan to these railways and
only charges 6 per cent, the Government is
not getting enough interest to caver the
rate charged.
We have also In these Estimates other
figures deaIinsr with the railway situation.
I want to read to the House a couple of
items which an-pear and Vo which I think
attention should be. drawn. In the Supply
Bill and in the Main Estimates we have an
item which readsThe Canad-lan Government rallways, towardsq
deticit of working expenditure for nine months
ending Deoemnber 31st, 1920. the management

the railways being hereby authorized ta
apply the recelpts and revenues toward >a.nment of the working expenditure, $5,000,0«.
Tien, in the Supplementary Estimates
there is another itemî of $1,000,000, rnaking
a total of $9,000,000. Apparently iV i5 proposed to adopt a systemi of accounting on the
Govcrnment railways different fronti what
we have had up to the present. Up to thle
presenit time the alioneys received have been
paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund,
and expenditures have beer paid out of
that Fund. and the accounts hqve gone
through the Department of the Auditor Generai. But this item is quietly put in and
nothing la said about, it. 1 do noV suppose
that any honourable gentleman in this
flouse realized îvhat the item was until it
was brought to bis attention. Apparently
it la a change wvhich. the Government is
going to make without acquai*nting the
country with whaý they are doing. 1 do
not, know whether the country is prepared
to have the accounts of the Intercolonial
railway and the National Transcontine-ntal
of

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

dealt with in that w'ay. 1 quite understand that some honourable gentlemen înay
say iii reply, "0f course the accounits will be
audited in the same way as other railway
accounts.' But I do not th:nkil, ini view of
the way te railways have been run in te
past, that the Governmlent is quite justified
in calmly doing titis without givixtg Parlianient an opportuxtity of saying anything
abouý it. At this late hour of the session
it is impossible for any honourable gentleman properly to criticise an action of that
kind.
Then we have in the Supply Bill other
items of railway expenditure which I do
noV think should he treated in that way.
In fact, I think ahi items of railway expenditure whidh are large items, and which
deal not with the question of carrying on
the business of the country, but wîth the
devehopment of these railways, or the supphying of greater eqjuipment or somethixg
of that kind, should noV be put into the
Supply Bill proper. They should-be brought
in in a different forni, and honourable
gentlemen shouhd ho given an opportunity
of discussing Vhem.
The honourable gentleman from Kings
and Albert (Ilon. Mr. Fowler) raised the
question of hringing the Supply Bill before the Finance Committee of this flouse.
1 arn sorr that the Finance Committee
has flot been able to do the work which 1
had hoped at the time iV was established
that it wouhd do. 1 hope that next session
the Sonate wihl tako this matter up, and
considor lb. and I trust that they wili ho
able to bring it to the attention of the Government in such a way that the Government wîlh realize that, %vhen the Senate
adopted the rosolution of the honourable
gentleman f rom Middloton <flou, W. B.
Ross), they wero serious and did noV pass
the motion simpiy for the pheasure they got
out of it.
Thore are one or two othor items Vo
whieh 1 think reference should ho niado.
The Governmont have placed in the Bill
the amount of $1,700,000 for the purpose
of doaling with the navy; but thoy have
not stated Vo tte flouse any definite policy
with regard Vo that question. I think the
wholo question is a very important one,
and one whioh in the interests of thecountry should be very carefully considorod
and discussed. I do not think the Govornment iB justifiod at the present time and
under present conditions in committing thé,
country Vo an expenditure of this kind
until they have thoroughly gone into the
mnatter and decide upon a policy.

JULY 1, 1920)
The sane argument appiies î'ery largely
to the amount set aside for the Militia.
For many years we have been spending
maney on the militia, and it is probably
necessary that we should have an organization of that kind. But 1 want ta draw
attention to the fact that, althojugh we have
been spendingc rooney on the oxilitia ever
silice Confederation, when the war broke
out the inilitia organization was flot used
in raising battalions, but the work that
had been done in previous years by the
Militia Counci] and by the officers and men
of the militia and the permanent force was
practically thirown ta one side by the bon.
Minister of Militia.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY :Yau are wrong.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD. Absolutely wrang.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY- The militia regiments were flot used because ofai ome bad
legisiation of a Minister that you followed,
the late Sir Fred Borden. There was a
mnisunderstanding because your people did
flot know anything about it, and we had
flot trne ta look it over. rhe foundation
was laid, and it was cf great assistance in
sending 33,000 men overseas in the first aix
weeks after the war broke out.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The honourable
gentleman may profess ta know more aibout
tihis than I do; but if he will inquire into
the matter 1 .flhjn< he will find that there
was an organization in the Dep>artment
which. iould have enabled the necess-ary
battalions ta be raised at a minimum af
expenditure and trouble. I think that is
a question that should have received carefui consideration befare we went an with
an expenditure of a further sumn ai money
an the anilitia.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Will my honourable
friend permit me? Did the honourable
gentleman flot take the view ai bis leader
that Germany was aur friesid nt that time,
and that 'we did flot require any militia?
Han. Mr. BOSTOGK: I do nat quite understand what my honourable friend is aaking.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Do you want me
ta ask again? My question is this: did yau
not at the time follow the opinion ai your
leader, who took the view that Germany
was our griend and we did flot require the
money?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The tact remained
4ihat we had the militia; that in 1910, 1

think it was, the then representative of the
Government, the head of the Militia Department, went over ta England and took
part in deliberations there for the purpose
af organiz-ing the w-hole forces of Canada
so that they would ha in a position ta hae
utilized when any emergency arase, sucb
as the war wîth Germany.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: They were utilized.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: And they formed
an arganization and adopted a plan and a
policy that were ta have been used if any
trouble such as the war with Germany did
break out. But I think that, as I said hafore, that organizatian was not used in the
way that it should have been. We ought ta
have a thorough discussion and explanation of -the whole situation before we go on
spending mare rooney an thse militia.
I Ileel very strongly that thse Government
are to-day spending mare rooney than they
are entitled ta spend in the carryîng* an of!
the affaira of this coun.try. We are brought
ta a position in whîoh 'we can no longer
borrow rooney autaide ai Canada. We are
not acting in the interest ai the country,
we are not beiefiting thse country, if we
borrow mare rooney fromn thse people of
Canada for the purpose ai carrying on the
country's -business. The Gavernment should
have done mare pruning on their Estimates,
s0 that they might be mare in keeping with
the present condition ai the country.
I do not want ta take up any more ai tbe
tîme ai the Chamber. There may bie other
gentlemen who desire ta say something ou
this roatter; and I do not suppose that any
further pratest that one could make would
have any effect on tbe Government.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, the amaunt oif the Supply Bill that
has naw been brought dow.n shauld show
the country that the Government are unduly extravagant and have not exercised
the care and economy -that aught ta hae exercised under present conditions.
When
Canada, with a population of irom 8,500,000
ta 9,000,000, hbas a 6upply Bill amounting ta
somne $630,000,000, and when the estimated
revenue is only about $450,000,000 at the
outaide, then the situation ia very seriaus
for this country. ýCanada is about the only
country in the warld among those which
are aupposed ta be up ta date that is flot
raducing its liabilities. The U*nited States,
a country that I do flot think ia any richar
per capita than we are, is reducing its war
debt very materially. I saw it stated that
during the monVh ai April it 'had reduced

SENATE
ils debt by $275,000,000. The British Governrnent are reducing their war debt et
sucb a rate that, although it may take a
considerable number of years, the t-inie je
quite within sight when it will be wiped
out. In Canada, more than a year and a
hall alter the war has closed, not only are
we noV reducing our war debt, but we are
not even paying our way; we are adding Vo
our debt. There je a mnaterial increase in
the debt this year. The Minister of
Finance Stated a short time ago that ive
were not going to borrow 'any more; but
when your expenditure is $630,000,O00 and
you have only $450,000,000 to pay it with,
if you do not have a public subacription
for a boan, you muet borrow the rnoney in
corne other way; you cannot overcome the
fact that -the money has to be paîd and the
debt o,! Canada je increased. I arn convinced that there je too rnuch extravagance;
that in many lines the Government could
have cut the expenditure away down had
they seen fit .to do s0; and I arn sure that,
if the people of the country once realize
that at our present rate of spending we are
not able Vo pay our way and that the situation will become worse and woree every
year, they will be very much opposed. Vo
the extravagant policy that îs apparently
being followed at the present time.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL- Honourable gentlemen, 1 did not intend to say anything at
this tirne; but I do object to the statements
made by the honourable gentlemen who
have just sat down'. I object to this extent.
If rnoiley should be spent on anything in
Canada, it should be apent on those forces
and those undertakings that are neceesary
for the peace, order and safety of this country. We heard in days gone by, before the
laVe wvar, similar sentiments expressed:
" Nothing for militia, no'thing for the
army. nothing for the navy !"-the very
thinge on which the safety, order, and succees of the country depend. What would
,have become of France if she had not been
prepared to meet the German army in 1914?
What would have become of this whole
country under such cîrcumetances? What
would have become of our Empire if the
advice of the peace-at-any-price people had
been followed and the navy had been allowed Vo go down into desuetude and decrepitude? The inevitable recuit would have
ieen that we would now be the slaves o!
Germnany. We would have had no country
of our own to live in, let alone to boast of .
1 cannot understand the views o! people
who want to spend money on everything
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

else-even on the Hudson Bay railwayrather than on the forces on which the
peace, order, and safety of our country depend. I certainly must protest against the
statement that the armed force of our country must be the first thing to be set aside
when economy je considered.
