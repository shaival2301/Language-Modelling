SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne.
His Excellency was pleased to command
the attendance of the House of Commons,
and that House being come, ýwith their
Speaker, His Excellency was pleased to
open the First Session of the Fourteenth
Parliament of the Dominion of Canada
with the following Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I desire on this occasion to assure you that it
is with great satisfaction that I meet the Parliament of the Dominion for the first time since
ny arrival in Canada, and avail myself of your
assistance and advice in carrying out the important duties that lis Majesty the King has enIt is
trusted to me as his iepresentative.
indeed, a great privilege to be called upon to
administer the affairs of the Dominion and to
associate inyself with you in the work you are
about to begin.
Our Dominion has not escaped the world-wide
economic disturbance and industrial depression
but bas suffered less from it than other countries. Keen observers of the business barometer
feel that the worst is about over and that at an
early date we may look for a substantial revival
of activity.

li many parts of the Dominion contiaued depression of business naturally produced, in a
much larger degree than usual, the misfortune
of unemployment.
Whilst of the opinion that
unemployment relief is fundamentally a municipal and provincial responsibility, my Government has felt that as conditions have arisen in
a measure out of the late war, they would be
justified in continuing for the period of the
wîinter months the expedient of supplementing
by grants from the Federal Treasury the relief
contributions of Provinces and MA nicipa lities
for the purpose of alleviating actual distress.
The decline of prices in farm products in 1921,
as compared with the prices of previous years,
bas seriously affected agriculture in many parts
of the Dominion. The ill-effects of this inevitable deflation have been empbasized by restricted markets and the absence of any corresponding reduction in the cost of production. While
improved methods of culture, grading and storage cf farn crops in some parts, and greater
diversification in others, would materially better
conditions, it is apparent that adequate markets
and marketing facilities and reduced transportation and production costs lie at the root of the
problem. Recognizing such to be the case, my
advisers have lost no time in seeking to gain
more favourable conditions of sale and marketing for the products of the farm. Communications have been opened with the authorities of
other countries looking to an extension of trade
and a widening of Canadian markets, and conferences have been arranged betweein the railway authorities with respect to the reduction
of rates upon basic commodities.
You will be invited to consider the expediency
of niaking some changes in the Custoins Tariff.
While there are delails of revision, the consideration of which will require time and care that
are not at present available, there are features
of the tariff which it is felt may properly l)e
dealt witi during the present session.
In order that Government ownership and
operation of our national railways now extending through every province of the Dominion
may be given a fair trial under the most favourable conditions, it is intended at an early date
to co-ordinate the Government-owned systems
in the manner best calculated to increase efficiency, and to effect economics in administraThe whole
tion, maintenance and operation.
transportation situation is one which will require your best attention. It weighs heavily
upon our national finances. To assist in obtaining the information essential to an exact understanding and an adequate appreciation of the
problem in its many bearings, it is proposed to
supplement the wvork of co-ordination by a
thorough enQuiry.
The stream of immigration to the Dominion
was much interrupted and restricted during the
war. Now that the blessing of peace is with us,
a renexval of efforts to bring in new settlers must
be made. My Government are fully alive to the
importance of this question and vill use every
reasonable endeavour to attract to our country
people of the nost desirable class, withb particular regard to settlement on our undeveloped
lands.
The work in connection with the re-establishment, cmedical treatnent and vocational training of former menbers of the Canadian Forces
is being sympathtetically and energetically prosecuted. 'l'ie care of the disabled still demands
the best thougbt of those who are charged with
the duty of admcinistering the benefits provided.
It is intended, during the coming session, again

MARCH 9, 1922
to consult Parliament concerning some of the
problems stitl remaining.
The long standing question of granting the
control of the natural resources of three Western
Provinces to their respective Provincial Governments lias engaged the attention of my Ministers. Sympathizing with the desire of the authorities of these Provinces, which have now
advanced te maturity, to have the same control
and management of their resources as is possessed by 'the older Provinces, my Government
have made a proposai to the Governments of the
several Provinces concerned, which it is hoped
may lead to a satisfactory settiement of the
question at an early date.
With the objeci of promoting economy and
increasing efficiency, a Bill will be submitted to
you, providing for a Deipartment of Defence, in
which the various branches of the defence forces
of Canada will be co-ordinated under one ministerial head.
During the interval since the lasi Parliament
there lias been held in Washington on the invitation of the President of the United States an
Initerniationial Coîîference tu cu,îsider an agreed
limitation of armaments and in connection therewith to reach an understanding concerning the
political relations of the Powers interested in
the regions of the Pacifie and the Far East.
From this Conference treaties of far reaching
consequence have resulted.
It is the opinion
of my advisers that approval of Parliament
ought to precede their ratification on behaîf of
Canada. The treaties with appropriate explanations will accordingly be placed before you during the session.
As the result of recent discussions among the
Powers, it bas been decided to hold ai Genoa a
conference with the object of securing, tbrougli
frank and amicable consultation among the
nations who have been ai war, a concerted
effort to repair the grave dislocations in the
economie and financial field that have everywhere followed the war. The Governmnent of
Canada has been invited to participate and delegaies have been appointed for the purpose.
An Invitation bas been extended to the Government of Canada by the Government of the
United States to take part in a Postal Conference, ai which aIl phases of mail communication from one country to the other may be fully
discussed.
Reciprocating the spirit that bas
prompted the invitation, the Canadian Government will, in due course, appoint representatives
to meet the representatives of the United States
for the purpose meniioned.
Members of the House of Commons:
The Public Accounts for the lasi fiscal year
wull be laid before you. At an early date the
Estimates for the coming year will be submitted.
In their preparation imperative need for economy bas rendered necessary the non-inclusion
of many undertakings, appropriations for which
must await a more favourable financial situation.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In inviting your careful consideration of the
important matters which wlll engage your attention, I pray that Divine Providence may guide
and bless your deliberations.

His Excellency the Governor General
was pleased to retire, and the House of
Commons withdrew.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.

The Senate proceeded to the consideration of His Excellency the Governor Gen-

4

SENATE

eral's Speech at the opening of the Session.
Hon. ARCHIBALD B. McCOIG rose to
move that an Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General to offer
the humble thanks of this House to His
Excellency for the gracious Speech which
he has been pleased to make to both Houses
of Parliament. He said:
In rising to move that a vote of thanks
be sent to His Excellency the Governor
General in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, I want in the first place to express
my thanks and appreciation to the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), as well as the thanks of my
constituents, for honouring me by asking
,me to muove this motion.
I desire also to extend to the Prime
Minister of this country my hearty congratulations that, after expounding his
policy throughout the land, he has been
elected to the highest honour in the gift of
the Canadian people. lie is to be congratulated also upon having selected for
his advisers and colleagues such able and
outstanding statesien as surround him, to
assist in carr ying on the affairs of our
country.
I desire also to extend mSî congratulations to the honourable gentleman who bas
been se(ected t preside as Speaker over
this Chamber. We were all delighted when
we heard the announcement made.
Nor
must I fa il to express our gratitude as
members of this House in having with us
such outstanding parliamentarian as the
honourable gentleman who leads the Government forces and the honourable gentleman who leads the Opposition. We are
fortunate in having men of such out standing ability and reputation not only as
citizens, but also as statesmen, and we
hope that Providence will spare them for
many years to give their splendid services
to our country and the state.
In the Speech from the Throne reference
was made by His Excellency to a number
of questions. He referred in the first place
to the condition of unrest and to the assistance which would be given to solving the
great labour problemns. I believe that I am
voicing the sentiments of honourable members of this House when I say we are fortunate at this particular time in having as
Minister of Labour an outstanding man
who is in touch and is familiar with all
the great labour problems which will come
before Parliament.
It is also fortunate
and gratifying that we have in this ChamHon. _Mr. MUCOIG.

ber the ex-Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), who is also conversant with
the great labour questions, and, whose
advice and assistance will help us in grappling with such of those questions as will
come before this House.
The Speech from the Throne mentioned
that tariff changes were to be made at this
Session. May I personally express the
hope that whatever changes are made in
the tariff will be such as will be in the best
interests of the plain people of this country
and will tend to reduce the cost of living,
thus helping that class in which we are all
so much interested.
The natter of arranging for conferenceswith the railway heads for the purpose
of sccuring a reduction in freight rates
on the basic commodities is another
proposal which will, I know, meet with
general approval; and when it comes to
the question of the ceo-ordination at an
early date of the government-owned rail
way systems, I feel that we are fortunate
in huaving as Minister of Railways a man
who is recognized as one of the outstanding business men of this country. He has
a great problemn to grapple with, but we
as Canadians do not feel that it is his
problem alone. He must do his part, but
it is our task to assist in the endeavour
to put our Canadian railway systemi on
a paying basis in order that it may b of
the greatest possible assistance to the
Canadian people.
I believe,
honorable
gentieenoc,
if we as members
of this
Chamber and as citizens of Canada, give
to the Mlinister of Railways all the encouragement
possible ard
patronize
the
railway systern of Canada, we may look
forward to the tirne when the railway
systemi will not be in the condition in
which it unfortunately is at the present
time, but will be considered as an asset
to Canada instead of a liability.
In the Speech from the Throne reference
was made to a renewal of efforts to
attract settlers to the undeveloped lands,
and to the need for negotiations looking to
association with other countries, looking
to trade expansion; the co-ordination of
the country's defences, and to the requirements
of our returned
soldiers.
Honourable gentlemen, neither this Chamber nor the House of Commons bas as
many members who are conversant with
the
great
problemus
concerning
our
returned soldiers as I would like to sec,
but I know that those we have with us,
and other honourable gentlemen, will do
everything they can to assist in solving

MARCH 14, 1922
those problems to the best of their ability,
so far as the finances of the country will
permit.
The Speech from the Throne referred
also to the great question of agriculture.
Agriculture, as we all know, at this particular time is not as prosperous as it was
in the past. We know that the farming
community has been unfortunate owing to
the prices of their products being reduced
to a very large extent, while at the same
time the cost of the articles required in the
production of their products was not reduced accordingly. There has been a great
deal of dissatisfaction. We find from the
press reports that the export trade of some
of the main agricultural industries has
been falling away. It is regrettable to
see that the Canadian bacon trade alone,
in one year, from 1920 to 1921, fell off
to the extent of nearly 1,000,000 pounds.
And that trade which we have lost bas
been largely gained by Denmark. There
is certainly something wrong in this
regard, and something should be done by
the Government of this country to remedy
the situation. I am not saying this in any
unkind spirit; but I say, honourable gentlemen, that if other industries in which
the farmers are interested are falling off
in proportion to the hog industry, there is
some justification for the farmers saying
that they should have more representation
and more advocates in the Parliament of
Canada and in the legislatures of the provinces.
At this time I should also like to refer
to the unfortunate position that we occupy
at the present time in regard to our cattle
industry. In the country to the south of
us a tariff bas been put up against us
under which we cannot profitably export
our cattle to the United States. Then, too,
we read in the morning papers one day
that the embargo against our cattle in the
old land has been removed; the next day
this statement is contradicted. We might
as well make up our minds that the embargo is not going to be removed. Then,
honourable gentlemen, what have we got
to consider? Unless we wish to see our
cattle industry ruined, as our hog industry
bas been, we have got to consider giving
some encouragement to the producers of
cattle in this country in order to induce
them to remain in the business. Otherwise the time will come when, instead of
the cost of foodstuffs to the consuming
public being reduced, there will be a shortage of foodstuffs in Canada and a corresponding increase in the cost of living

5

to the consumers. What is the solution?
What should we do? What can we suggest?
We should not be destructionists; we must
be constructionists, and I would ask, honourable gentlemen, as we have our great
merchant marine, which we obtained at
great expense to the people of this country
-I am not at this time going to discuss
how it came into existence; we have it;
it belongs to the people of Canada-why
we should not take that great line of
steamships and equip it with cold storage
facilities, so that our Canadian cattle
could be finished on Canadian soil. Why
should they not be fed with Canadian
feed, tended by Canadian workmen,
slaughtered at Canadian seaports, and
sent to the Liverpool market as chilled
meat? In that way, the profits and the
benefits of employment to our Canadian
farmers and their sons and the workingmen generally would accrue to us in Canada. As bas been proved, we can ship four
head of dressed cattle to the Liverpool
market in the sane space occupied by one
live animal shipped on the hoof. Freight
rates would be greatly reduced. Then,
too, we can send chilled meat to Liverpool
in the neighbourhood of six days, whereas
our greatest competitor takes nearly four
weeks to send meat which is landed in a
much inferior condition.
Coming from a section which for a great
many years enjoyed prosperity in the
tobacco industry, I wish to address a few
remarks to that question. Thanks to encouragement by the Government, that industry was developed, and a great trade
worked up, in different sections of the
country. But, unfortunately, to-day we
find that that industry also bas been to
a large extent ruined because of the lack
of markets. The tobacco growers in my
section of the country can produce tobacco
equal to that produced in any other portion of the country. Should we not give
some thought to the reason why they are
not able to dispose of their products?
These are a few of the things which I
am happy to be able to bring to the attention of the House this afternoon. While
there are many other problems to be discussed in the interest of the people of
Canada during the present session, without
taking up any more of the time of the
House, may I have the privilege of moving
that an Address be presented to the Governor General to offer the humble thanks
of this House to His Excellency for the
gracious Speech which he bas been pleased
to make to both Houses of Parliament

6

SENATE
Hon. GUSTAVE BOYER (Translation):

Honourable gentlemen, I appeal to your
indulgence as members of this House, for
it will be readily understood that it is not
without considerable and justifiable emotion that I rise to second the motion so
eloquently made by my honourable colleague, the representative of the county of
Kent (Hon. Mr. McCoig). It was only a
short time before I crossed the threshold
of these precincts that I was informed that
I should have to fulfil this duty.
But before entering further into the discussion, you will, honourable colleagues, I
am sure, permit me to make a short digression, so as to discharge two very important duties.
The first is to thank the members of the
Government cordially and sincerely for
having promoted me to the Upper House of
this country. If the Government alleges
that the election of the new representative
of the county of Rigaud is due to his personal merit, it would be more fitting and
more believabie to say that it is rather
to honour, in my person, the agricultural
class of which I have been the champion
all my life, in more than one agrarian
moveinent.

Another motive which I must gratefully
acknowledge is the one which the Government had, of doing honour to the electoral
district of Vaudreuil-Soulanges, for it is
the first time that the senatorial seat of
the county of Rigaud has been occupied
by an inhabitant of that district. Before
the present time it was worthily represented by the Honourable Charles Wilson
from 1867 to 1877, the Honourable Joseph
Rosaire Thibeaudeau from 1878 to 1908,
and the Honourable Arthur Boyer from
1909 to 1921. This time, it was to the
county of Vaudreuil-Soulanges that this

honour came, and the inhabitants of that
district will understand how te appreciate
this fine compliment to their cleverness.
Another duty devolves upon me, alas, this

one is not of the same nature.

It is with

a full heart that I recall a recent sorrow;
I refer te the sudden death of the one
whose place I have the honour te fill. The
late Honourable Arthur Boyer embodied
within himself all the accomplishments of
a perfect gentleman. Endowed with great
scholarship and clear judgment, his advice
was advantageous to those who took it.
Generous, enthusiastic in efforts for any

object of general interest, we always found
him in the front rank, helping it on generously and effectively. Aristocratic by his
whole education and the surroundings in
Hon. Mr. McCOIG.

which he had grown up, he nevertheless
remained democratic in ideas and inclination.
The people of Vaudreuil, among
whom he had come to reside, had a special
admiration for the late Mr. Boyer, and
his death caused them deep and unanimous sorrow. Called to the Senate on the
28th of June, 1909, he represented the
county of Rigaud in this Chamber for thirteen years with a dignity and punctiliousness worthy of high praise. In his newlyclosed grave sleeps this virtuous man, this
excellent citizen who sincerely loved his
His memory will live on with
country.
When
those who knew and loved him.
I realize that it falls to me henceforward
to represent the county of Rigaud and, in
these precincts, te take the place of that
distinguished man, I greatly fear that I
shall net be equal to the task, and I wonder if I shall ever be able to accomplish
it with as much dignity and skill as did the
late lanented Mr. Boyer. However, honourable gentlemen, I will strive to walk
in the steps of my predecessor and te respond worthily to the great evidence of
confidence and of honour which the Government has just accorded me.
I will
strive to preserve, as I have always tried
te do, the fair name of the county of
Rigaud.
In the Speech from the Throne, among
all the great questions which the Government proposes for our consideration, I have
noted one especially, which treats of agriculture. I quote:
The decline of prices in farma products in 1921,
as compared with the prices of previous years,
has seriously affected agriculture in many parts
of the Dominion. The ill-effects of this inevitable
deflation have been emphasized by restricted
imarkets and the absence of any corresponding
reduction in the cost of production.

All the unrest of the day, whether in
commerce, in industry, or in agriculture,
finds its excuse in the war. It is the war,
the cause of all evils, that is given as the
final explanation of the grievances, the
commercial distress or the unemployment
which prevail in every part of the country.
I have read, somewhere, that war is a
necessary evil. Is that an axiom, or
simply an argument to make men forget
the horrors which it accumulates and the
painful reverberations which continue long
after its last hecatombs?
Whatever it is, it is very important that
there should be an end to this evil; for to
let things go on as they are would certainly lead to a national disaster. We are
reinspired with confidence by the faveurable attitude of the Gc vernment towards

MARCH 14, 1922
agriculture, for, if it is admitted that
agriculture is the sustainer of the nations,
it is important not to neglect it.
During the time of the war a pressing
appeal was made to the farmer. He was
asked to double his production and not to
be afraid of hard work, be the weather
fair or foul. All were asked to make an
effort. An appeal was made to the
patriotism of the people, and every one
responded gladly.
The head of the family, the mother, the
children left by the fireside after the departure of the older ones, whether for the
front or the factory, set to work. Large
tracts of land were ploughed and seeded;
they feared neither the burning sun nor
the rain; and, Heaven helping, the harvests were abundant. Carried over the
seas, they served to nourish those who, on
the field of honour, were valiantly sustaining the violent shock of a powerful enemy.
The farmers, you will answer, were well
rewarded by the prices which they received
in return for their produce. That I admit.
They admit it themselves. But what they
cannot understand is that the price of their
produce diminishes so considerably when
all around them the price of manufactures
changes so little. Farmers are forced to
sell at low prices, but at the same time
they are forced to pay a high price for the
manufactured articles which they buy. Why
is this reduction not uniform?
The manufacturers answer that that is
due to the high cost of manual labour and
the demands of the workmen. That may
be, in certain isolated cases, but in many
more is there not a reprehensible spirit of
luxury? Through selfishness, they refuse
to co-operate in the re-establishment of
commercial equilibrium by consenting to
the necessary sacrifices. If certain groups
of workmen are intractable, it is because
their employers have not always given
them a good example. Exaggeration leads
to exaggeration. The unreasonable desire
of the employers for large profits has led
·their workers to demand large salaries.
Honourable gentlemen, the equilibrium
must be re-established. The new Government promises to make an effort in this
direction. Let us see to it that our farmers obtain the maximum of protection to
which they legitimately aspire. We must
help the Government to solve their urgent
problem.
In the promised revision of the customs
tariff it is to be hoped that the share of
the farmers will be large and generous.
Our agricultural commerce suffers in our

7

own markets, especially in our dairy products, very serious competition, and I commend the Government for its policy of
opening new markets by agreements with
other countries.
In 1910 the Laurier Government signed
a reciprocal agreement with the United
States concerning farm produce. There
is no denying that this policy was very
much to the advantage of the farmers.
Well, what happened? Laurier appealed to
the electors of this country and the question was rejected. They regretted it. This
policy is now a fundamental part of the
Liberal programme.
What is going to happen? Our chances
of having the arrangement of 1911 with
the United States revived are more than
compromised by the Fordney Bill, which is
the opposite of what we are asking for,
and this time the opposition comes from the

depends to a large extent on the prosperity

The Government inforns us that it has
been decided to hold conferences with the
railway companies with the intention of
bringing about a reduction in the rates
of transport for Canadian products. That
is a measure which i- being taken, and the

cently, at Winnipeg, the National Dairy
Council of Canada, the members of which
were assembled in convention, adopted resolutions in this sense for the third or fourth
time.
One of the most powerful factors in agriculture is certainly the raising of animals
f rom the point of view of the production of
milk. The extraordinary number of businesses dependent upon this industry is conclusive proof of the interest which the
farmers atach to it.
Like ail other farm products, butter,
cheese and other derivatives of milk have
at present a deplorable market. Vigorous
competition on the part of other British

countries has

just opened, our eyes and

brought us face to face with a problem
fraught with serions consequences if we do
not set to work immediately.

SENATE
But this is a task which is incumbent, not
only upon the Government, but upon the
producers, who must be convinced that their
co-operation with the Government is an absolute necessity.
This co-operation will
become all the more easy when they see that
the Government is coming to their aid to
the best of its ability.
In my view there are three things necessary to the progress of the dairy industry
in this country:
1. Tools.
2. Dairy control.
3. Classification of dairy products.
Tools include, in the practical sense of
the word, good herds, good buildings, and
the best methods of production.
In these
matters the country has made enormious
strides and can compare favourably with
many other countries.
Progress towards
amelioration on that side will continue
then normally, if the farmers feel that they
are supported and encouraged.
Dairy control, of fairly recent date, receives a new impulse each year.
It is
the indispensable barometer for milk producers who wish to check up the productive
value of their cattle.
It is not sufficient
for certain farmers to declare that the
milk industry does not pay, if they have
not first found out the yielding capacity
of their cattle.
The Department of Agriculture has donc
splendid work up to the present. It is important that the present Government add
new methods of action in the endeavour to
popularize as quickly as possible the system of control.
The classification of dairy products
exists, properly speaking, only in embryo.
Last year Parliament enacted a law giving
to the Department of Agriculture the task
of framing rules for the application of
this law.
Not longer ago than the 7th, 8th and
9th of this month there was held at Ottawa,
under the presidency of the higher officers
of the Department of Agriculture, a reunion of the principal makers of butter
and cheese in this country. Each of the
provinces of the Confederation was represented at it. The classification was there
approved.
I consider that the classification of dairy products is extremely urgent
to enable us to resume the high place that
we had succeeded in attaining in foreign
markets, and especially in the English market. Besides, the classification is a matter
of justice for the producers. It will be a
practical lesson for those interested and
H

will render justice equally to each of the
provinces.
Canadian products, at least dairy products, must not be classified according to
the province from which they corne but according to their respective values independent of their source; that is te say, not
quantity in production, but uniformity in
quality.
This law will put an end to a rivalry
between our two largest provinces, which
has lasted too long; it will render justice
to each one of them, under a uniform stamp
determining the quality of each of their
products and their sale of these products,
on a footing of equality.
The Government is disposed to give effect
to this new law, which will be applied for
the benefit of the community in general.
This is another mark of its solicitude for
the agricultural class.
I am a convinced believer in the efflcacy
of co-operation; I commend the association
together of groups of farmers to expedite
unprovements in the raising of different
breeds of cattle, in the production of milk
and its by-products, and in the sale of their
produce. There only lies progress.
These associations, composed of active
and enterprising men, generally accomplish
what they undertake, to their own benefit,
and equally to the benefit of the great mass
of farmers.
In my opinion, the Government should
not hesitate to encourage, to subsidize, their
efforts. They facilitate the work of the
Department of Agriculture, and meet the
needs of the farmers better than the staff
of very competent officers of this important
department could do it alone.
Economy, the strictest economy, will be
the dominant note of the present Government. We have no reason to doubt their
sincerity if we recall the golden age of
the Laurier Government when, on entering
into office in 1896, the latter had to reestablish the equilibrium in our finances
and restore the confidence compromised by
the preceding régime. Once more, this is
the main task the Government will have
to accomplish, in face of the depletion of
our national treasury. Our financial situation is truly deplorable. The task of the
Government is enormous; but when we consider the patriotism and the worthiness of
the members of the Government and of the
present Parliament we have the firm hope
that it vill re-establish confidence and
bring back the affluence of former days.
What the Government bas to do is not
only to act, but to tea 'h others that the

MARCH 14, 1922
precarious situation of the country demands prudence and economy not only on
our part but on the part of everybody,
not only in the higher spheres but among
the masses. The country must extricate
itself fron the dilemma. The Government
will set a good example and it will surely
attain its object if the public will lend it
a strong hand.
The present Government is not a class
Government. It rests upon foundations of
the purest democracy. It is neither radical
nor reactionary. It is not divided into two
groups, one which toils and another which
reaps. No; on the contrary, it lives and
will pursue its destiny preaching equality
of classes and of the legitimate aspirations
of individuals. Its mission, shall we say,
is providential. In 1896 and the years
immediately succeeding, Sir Wilfrid Laurier saved the country from the dilemma in
which he had found it. The task is truly
very heavy; but, with the support of the
representatives of the people, and that of
the people themselves, the Government will
again perform the miracle of 1896.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I am not indifferent to
the fact that since we last had the pleasure of meeting in this Chamber we have
exchanged sides, and in the political
contest which took place on the 6th of
December last the Government of which
I was a member succeeded in taking third
place. The present Government bas not
been sufficiently long in office to declare a
distinctive policy which we can discuss
with advantage, nor bas it been long
enough in office to have a record which we
might criticise. My disposition, therefore,
would not be to criticise the policy of the
Government nor of the party which it
represents, because of an absence in that
direction. In fact, I am at a loss to see
any particular distinction between the
Speech from the Throne which fell from
the lips of His Excellency last week and
a speech which the late Government might
have submitted for the purpose of opening
Parliament. It seems to me that, so far
as the party which those who sit upon
this side of this House represent, we
might consider with some advantage the
reasons which led to the reversal which
took place in December last, and under
which wè have exchanged places with our
honourable friends on the opposite side
of the House. I am not disposed to cry
peccavi, to admi.t that in any sense we
have sinned, or that in the performance
of our duty we have fallen short of what

9

the country would naturally expect from
a Government which had held office for
the last ten years; nor am I prepared to
admit that the results of the late election
were expressive in any sense of a condemnation of the late Government, as to its
policy, or its acts. I venture to say with a
reasonable degree of confidence that the
Government which bas just entered upon
office will not depart to any radical extent
from the policy pursued by the late
Government. That is probably as high a
tribute as I can pay to the Administration
which bas retired from office. An individual or aggregation of individuals, in
their aggregate capacity, suffering a loss
or a defeat in the ordinary fields of
activity, would naturally take a retrospective view of such a situation and seek
to inquire into the cause which led to
reversal. It seems to me that possibly I
might be able to spend my time more
advantageously in the short period allotted
to me in dealing with this subject if I
were to look to the causes which led to
this reversal rather than to make any
criticism of the campaign carried on by
my honourable fri'ends during the late
election contest.
We cannot overlook the fact that the
Borden Government came into office at
the end of 1911, at a time when an era
of prosperity, when a boom which had
swept over this continent-probably the
greatest of any that we have experienced
in our time-had about ended. That
Government inherited, as we all know, the
many problems which had been assumed
by the Laurier Government, problems
which had not been fully developed. We
inherited at that time, for instance, the
railway problems, which were probably
the biggest problems that any Government since Confederation had to solve up
to that time. I do not propose to enter
upon any discussion of these problems at
the moment, except to say that, from the
time the Borden Government assumed
office until 1914, when the world's great
war confronted us, not only was the time
of the Government occupied in endeavouring to solve these problems, but the
financial abilities of this country were
strained to meet the obligations then
maturing.
It cannot be said that Parliament,
during the period from the beginning of
the war until its close, manifested any
disagreement with the Government as to
the policy which it pursued upon that
subject. I think our opponents will agree
with us that the Government of that day

lu

SENATE

steered Canada most successfully through
a time in which it was confronted with
more serious questions than any other
Government has had to face in our time.
The policy pursued by the Government
during that crucial period placed Canada
in the very front rank of nations. Canada,
looking back upon that period, has every
reason to be proud of the policy pursued
by that Government, and we have no
apology to advance by reason of any difference of opinion which may exist in the
country in regard to the obligations which
we assumed. I therefore say that in no
case was the defeat of the Government due
to scandal, extravagance, or policy.
It seems to me that if the late Government in any sense weakened itself, it was
in playing the role of reform-the role
which my honourable friends on the opposite side regard as their divine right.
When we came into office, we, perhaps unfortunately, were seized with the idea that
we had reached a period in the history of
Canada when we could carry out successfully certain reforms, such, for instance,
as we assumed and carried out, and I
think successfully.
At no period since
Confederation were so many reforms placed
upon the statute book as during that particular time. I need only refer to the
policy of the Government upon Civil
Service, upon prohibition, upon agricultural education, the policy pursued by the
Government as to returned soldiers, the
policy as to votes for women, a reform
which has been very strongly opposed in
Quebec by my honourable friends opposite.
But, unfortunately, although we assumed
the responsibility of carrying out all these
reforms and placing them on the statute
book and giving effect to them, the result
was that the Government rather lost support in the general election than gained
thereby.
I think I can say with some justification, that in the late election we sacrificed
the prestige and the influence which we
might have exercised, had we retained
political patronage. We sacrificed that in
the interest of placing upon the statute
book civil service reform, whereby the Government of the country handed over to an
independent Commission the appointment
and regulation of the Civil Service.
During the war prohibition became a
very interesting and very live subject. The
late Government did not hesitate to give
effect to what was then considered public
opinion upon the subiect. But I venture
to say that the prohibitionists of Canada
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

did not support the Government in the late
election.
I can say the same in regard to the
farmers of the Dominion. We did not
hesitate to place upon the statute book the
most advanced legislation as to agricultural education. We appropriated something like $20,000,000 for education in
agriculture. Notwithstanding this fact,
the farmers went back upon us.
And what shall I say of the manufacturers?
During the last campaign we
nailed to the mast the flag of adequate
protection for the manufacturer, no matter what the consequences might be. But
the manufacturers, observing that my
honourable friends opposite were wobbling
to such an extent upon the question of the
tariff, thought it necessary to give their
adherence to the Government now in office
with a view to making them solid upon
the tariff, and they went back on us.
We made the most generous provision
for the returned soldiers. None of the
Allied countries approached the generous
treatment which Canada accorded to them.
In fact, the treatment accorded by Canada
to the returned soldier has been a matter
of comment throughout the countries of
the Allies. But I venture to say that the
late Covernment did not receive the support of the returned soldiers, but that,
owing to the uncertainty of the attitude
of my honourable friends opposite, thcy
said, "We will go with the Liberal party,
inasmuch as they have promised us more."
Consequently my honourable friends got
the support, generally speaking, of the
returned soldiers.
Then, votes for women. Why, we were
in the very forefront of this particular
reform, and we placed a most liberal provision upon the statute book, whereby women exercise the same rights as men in
respect of the franchise.
But unfortunately we were not able, it seems to me, to
retain the support of the ladies, notwithstanding our policy on this question, for
I observe that my honourable friends are
here, notwithstanding

the very

militant

attitude which they took in the province
of Quebec against extending the franchise
to women.

It seems to me, therefore, that the Liberal-Conservative party will have to depend upon the publicans and sinners of
the community. We have never been able
to get any very great support from the
saintly section of the community, and
seemingly are driven back to rely upon
our old friends, the publicans and sinners;

MARCH 14, 1922
it is to be hoped that they will muster in
the next election and not leave us.
Now, it is a matter for some commentalthough, as I said a few moments ago,
we took third place in the contest at the
polls-that the Conservatives secured
within 13 per cent of the votes secured by
my honourable friends now in office, notwithstanding the solid vote which they got
in the province of Quebec, which we may
eliminate from the contest, as that province seems to be out of it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And Nova Scotia too.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The 114
or 115 representatives which my honourable friends have, represent a unit of
11,100, whereas those who sit on the Liberal-Conservative side represent a unit of
18,400. The Progressives represent a unit
of 11,800. It will thus be seen that the
Conservative members of the House of
Commons practically represent a unit of
nearly 75 per cent more than those supporting the Government.
Throughout
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the whole country?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
taking it as a whole. Furthermore, the
vote recorded for the Liberal-Conservatives
in all amounted to 971,502 as against 759,387 recorded in support of the Progressives. On the basis of the unit representation of the Liberal party, the Liberal-Conservative Opposition in Parliament would
represent approximately ninety seats; so
that, notwithstanding the support secured
by my honourable friends opposite from the
province of Quebec, in which a policy of
extirpation was put forth as to the Conservative party, we really came out of the
contest with almost as much credit as the
Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Everybody is
satisfied.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I simply point out these anomalies under our
election laws by which it becomes manifest
that our representative institutions are not
as representative as they should be.
As I said a moment ago, there were no
specially distinctive questions upon which
the late Government was attacked at the
late election, nor upon which the vote of
the electorate was cast. That is to say,
there was no distinctive issue except, perhaps, in the province of Quebec. I need
not inform this House, lecause we are all
familiar with the facts, .hat the transpor-

Il

tation interests, the banking interests, and
the power interests of the province of
Quebec went in full force against the late
Government, and instructions went forth
that under no consideration must a supporter of the late Government be elected in
that province.
It appears to my mind that, as the election very largely turned upon the action
of the province of Quebec, we might, ask
ourselves, why this combined attitude of
the transportation, banking and power
interests, of that province? Why were they
arrayed against the late Government? I
need not say that it was on account of the
policy of the late Government upon the
railway situation; and it might not be out
of place for me to review that question for
a few moments without going too extensively into the figures involved.
I need scarcely say that from Confederation down to the present time the Government of Canada, no matter which side of
politics it represented, bas been faced with
a railway question. It started at the time
of Confederation-before that period, I
might say. The Government of Canada
before Confederation had to assist very
substantially the Grand Trunk railway
with an enormous sum of money; at the
time of Confederation we had to assume the
building of the Intercolonial; and we had
to build a transcontinental line reaching
from the Atlantic to the Pacific for the
purpose of completing the union with
British Columbia. Hence one is not surprised that when the late Government came
into office, and it was found that the National Transcontinental railway and the
Grand Trunk Pacific railway had met
financial difficulties and could not be completed without the intervention of the Government, there was nothing else for the
late Government than to assume all responsibility incident to these operations'and the
taking over of the system.
Before the late Government came into
office, the Laurier Government had not only
committed itself to the building of the
National Transcontinental and the Grand
Trunk Pacific, but it had committed itself
to the development of the Canadian Northern into a Transcontinental system, and it
had placed the necessary legislation on the
statute book declaring that to be the policy
of the Government touching that road.
We were therefore faced, before we were
three years in office, with the necessity of
dealing with the railway situation, and
there was no alternative for the Government of the day, the Borden Government,

12

SENATE

but to take over those roads. What would
the transportation interests of
Quebec
have had us do? I venture to say that if
the Laurier Government had
been
in
office during the time we were in power,
they would have pursued exactly the same
course as the Borden
Government
did
upon this question. There was no alternative. The National Transcontinental,
the Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Canadian
Northern would necessarily have had to
go into liquidation, and at a time when
the war was upon us, when
it
was
impossible to finance those undertakings
either in the United States or in Europe.
We had to face not only the liabilities
which they had assumed and the possible
financial crises that would arise, but also
the guarantees which the Federal Government as well as the. government of the
different Provinces had given to those
roads. It must not be forgotten that there
has scarcely been a time in the history of
Canada when the railway companies of
this country have not met with success in
coming to Ottawa and extracting from
the Government what was needed for the
purpose of meeting their demands.
It
therefore became a question
with the
Borden Government whether we should
take over those roads or advance to theni
sufficient money to meet the obligations
which were then facing them and not
own the roads.
It requires very little
consideration
to come to the conclusion t'hat the only policy to pursue
was to assume the obligation and become
owners of the roads. The Government of
that day did not
embark
deliberately
upon the ownership of railways. It was a
situation that we had to confront entirely
irrespective of the views which we might
have held on the question of government
ownership.
Now, why, I ask honourable gentlemen,
should the late Government
have
the
strong opposition of those interests in
Quebec to which I have referred? What
Government was it
that initiated
a
reckless rivalry to the Canadian Pacific
railway? It was not the late Government,
The building of the National Transcontinental struck a serious blow
at the
prosperity of the Canadian Pacifie railway. Who was it that assumed responsibility for striking a blow at the prosperity of the Grand Trunk railway? It
was not the Borden Government. It was
the Laurier Government, in inducing thaè
Company to enter upon practically
an
orgy of expenditure
absolutely unwarranted, in building a second transcontinenHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

tal system. Thus we were called upon
during the late election to face responsibilities which in no wise belonged to the
Borden Government.
Furthermore, honourable gentlemen, it
cannot be gainsaid for a moment that public opinion was behind the Government
in assuming the ownership of those roads
during the period to which I have referred.
Both sides of Parliament supported it. The
Opposition in the House of Commons did
not oppose the policy of the Government
in taking over the National Transcontinental, the Canadian Northern, or even the
Grand Trunk. Hence it is difficult to understand why in the Province of Quebec
the policy should have been pursued of not
only attempting to eliminate the LiberalConservative party from Parliament, but
also to extirpate it to the extent carried
out.
May I quote ta the House just a few
figures with a view of establishing the
contention which I have advanced-that no
other sensible policy could have been
adopted than that which was pursued by
the Government. From Confederation down
to the present time the Government of
Canada bas paid subsidies amounting to
about half a billion dollars, including the
construction of the National Transcontinental. Excluding the National Transcontirenta!, we paid out subsidies amounting ap-

proximately to $250,000,000, and we like-

wise 'have assumed guarantees of bonds
approximating half a billion of dollars.
We have
made
land
grants
to companies exceeding thirty millions
of acres.
Notwithstanding those enormous obligations which we had undertaken up to the time of our assuming
ownership of those roads, Canada did not
own a mile of the railways we had so subsidised, in cash, in guarantees, and in land
grants. Between 1909 and 1918, in loans
and bond guarantees, we gave to the Grand
Trunk railway and the Grand Trunk
Pacifie no less than $70,000,000.
During
the short period between the creation of
the Canadian Northern as a transcontinental system and our taking it over we
gave bond guarantees to the extent of $45,000,000, and a loan of $15,000,000, and yet
we did not own those properties. I say
with the greatest degree of confidence that
if the Government of that day had at that
time not taken over those roads, but had
allowed them to go into liquidation, whoever acquired theni would have come back
to Ottawa just as soon as Parliament met,
and the annual pilgrimage for colossal sub-

MARCH 14, 1922
sidies would have been made to the Government of the country. No matter what
Government might have been in power, they
would have been forced to make further
advances of the character that I have
already mentioned.
My honourable friends opposite have
taken a very great deal of satisfactionand, I think, properly so-from the solidarity of the Quebec vote. If I belonged to
the party to which my honourable friends
belong, I should probably look upon that
as a tribute to the organizing forces of my
party. Nevertheless this maintenance of
the Quebec bloc and the Progressive bloc
-of which I shall speak in a momentseems to me to threaten the final disintegration of this Dominion if it is continued.
Why should the province of Quebec pursue
a policy of hostility, as it bas done during
the last two general elections, to the
Liberal-Conservative party? That pdrty,
during the fifty-five years of Federal Government, from Confederation down to the
present time, has administered the affairs
of this country for no less than thirty-four
years, and, I claim, thirty-four years with
credit to this Dominion and certainly to the
Province of Quebec. Yet we know that
during the last two elections the cry went
out-and this cannot be controverted-that
the Quebec bloc was to be maintained to the
exclusion and the extirpation of every representative of the Liberal-Conservative
party who sought a seat in this Parliament.
If representative institutions are to be
maintained in this country, it can only be
done by a well-balanced representation of
all political parties in the councils of the
nation.
It must appeal to the common
sense of my honourable friend that if by
some extraordinary cry a province will
absolutely refuse to give fair play, or
give representation to a substantial proportion of the people within that province,
simply because they belong to a certain
party, harmony cannot be maintained in
Canada, and our institutions must necessarily suffer from that degree of prejudice
and hostility. I am prepared to say further
that the trouble in the province of Quebec
in the last election was not based upon
party consideration, was not confined to
party lines. The struggle was maintained
upon a plane which is not for a moment
consistent with our representative institutions in Canada. It was maintained for
the purpose of giving to that province an
ascendency by which it would be supreme
in controlling the Government of this
country. We find the most responsible

13

individuals and organizations in that
province forsaking, as we well know, the
political sympathies which they had been
expression for years and years, severing
their adherence to the party to which they
had belonged and joining forces with the
opposite party for the purpose of forcing
and securing an ascendency in Parliament.
That condition is inimical and repulsive
to all our ideas of representative institutions and does violence to that sense of
freedom which should be expressed upon
the floor of Parliament.
I am the more surprised at this because
of the broad moderation which characterizes Quebec in legislation dealing with
moral, social, and secular subjects. I am
free to accord to the province of Quebec
greater sanity in legislation along secular
lines than is shown by some of the other
provinces of the Dominion. Quebec bas
shown less intolerance upon moral and
social legislation than other provinces.
The security of investment and property
is superior in the province of Quebec, in
my judgment, to that in any other
province in Canada. The people of Quebec
have resisted the wave of the present age
to the introduction of all kinds of political
nostrums and panaceas for the amelioration of imaginary difficulties, and they are
the only really conservative province, so
far as I know, in the Dominion of
Canada. If I were investing money tomorrow in the carrying out of any great
undertaking, or advising the investment
of capital, I would prefer its investment
in the province of Quebec to any other
part of the Dominion. In view of these
facts I cannot understand the hostility
manifested by the province of Quebec
against a proper or fair distribution of
representation in Parliament.
There are no critics in the Dominion so
severe upon the Progressives as the province of Quebec; yet the Progressives from
the West have simply followed the example of Quebec, and it is now a contest
between the two blocs as to whicb shall
be the stronger. The Progressives have
adopted the fundamental idea upon which
Quebec has built up its own peculiar bloc,
and they have built up a fundamentally
similar one in the provinces west of the
Lakes. It is the same spirit which actu'ates both each equally selfish in spirit.
One reason why I may perhaps be a little
caustic upon the subject is that the policy
pursued by the province of Quebec has
extended to the West, and we have the
mischievous spirit introduced into those
Western Provinces of one party controlling

14

SENATE

all the interests of that enormous country
extending from the head of the Lakes to
the Pacific.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: To British Columbia?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: While
British Columbia did not respond to the
appeal in the late election, yet I may say
to my honourable friend that there has
been considerable activity in British Columbia since, and I fear it may find expression in some future election.
We have, in the payment of income tax,
a very fair standard by which to judge the
responsibility of representation and the
measure which should find recognition on
the floor of Parliament in a general way.
We have 16,652 farmers paying income
tax, and out of a total of 194,257 income
tax payers. That is to say, the farmers
of this Dominion are represented by about
one twelfth of those who are paying income tax. They pay about three quarters
of one per cent of the income tax and the
business profits tax. If we eliminate the
business profits tax and consider only
the income tax, we find that they pay a
little over one and a half per cent of the
entire income taxes of this Dominion. Yet,
notwithstanding the large cities and towns
and urban municipalities in those three
provinces, and notwithstanding the fact,
that the farmers pay an infinitesimal proportion of the income tax and leave it to
other classes to pay the balance, the
ground is taken impliedly by the Progressives that they are the only people who
shall have representation in Parliament.
This spirit of a province or a group of
provinces, seeking to exclude all other
classes from representation on the floor of
Parliament is exactly the same spirit
which expressed itself in Germany during
the war, the spirit of insisting upon dominating everybody else, and which Mr.
Lloyd George very properly designated,
when he spoke of Germany, as the road
hog of Europe.
It seems to me that during the late two
general elections we have introduced a most
mischievous spirit of political rivalry into
the electorate, and it is unfortunate that it
has been carried out to the extent of which
I speak. The interests of all those provinces could be better represented on the
floor of Parliament with a fair representation of the different political groups, or
under the dual party system, than they are
at present with a solid representation of
one political party.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Before sitting down may I be permitted
to extend my congratulations to His
Honour the Speaker upon the recognition
paid to him by the Government. My honourable friend's assocation with this House
for so many years has impressed all of us
with the fact 'that there is no more painstaking, industrious or courteous member
in itSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And I
am satisfied that he will fill the high office
to which he has been appointed with credit
to himself and with satisfaction to the
House and to the country. I trust that
during the term of office of this Government, whether it is one Parliament or more,
my honourable friend may be spared to
occupy the Chair which he so well graces.
I have also to extend my congratulations
to my honourable friend opposite representing the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
I have been associated with him in this
House for a great number of years, and
that association has been an extremely
pleasant one. During that period, militant
as my honourable friend has been when
anything affecting his own Province has
come before him, I may say that he has
always given the greatest courtesy and
attention to any matter in which we have
been interested. And I must say that
during the term of office of the late Government, when I occupied the Chair which
he occupies to-day, I received from him all
the support I could possibly expect, and a
valued assistance which he never hesitated
to give in the promotion of measures which
were manifestly for the public good. I am
sure that the experience and knowledge
and ability of my honourable friend will be
spent not only in the service of the country,
but will be acceptable to this House during
the time he occupies the position of Government leader.
I have to congratulate the mover and the
seconder of the Address upon their appointment to the Senate and upon the
speeches which they have made this afternoon. Both these gentlemen come from
the House of Commons, and I am satisfied
that their experience in that House will be
of advantage to the deliberations of this
Chamber, and will facilitate the business
which from time to time comes before us.
I am sure that it will give this side of
the House the greatest pleasure to contribute in every possible way to the transaction of public business. I do not think that
while the present Government is in office

MARCH 14, 1922
they will be able to say that this side of the
House, notwithstanding our numerical
strength being greater than theirs, did not
show a desire to assist in promoting the
business of the country. I trust that the
coming Session may be one of harmony in
this Chamber and advantage to the public
interests.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, in rising to address this
House it should be my first duty-and a
very pleasant one indeed-to congratulate
ourselves upon the appointment of the

and friendly treatment at his hands
when he was on the floor of the House,
and I am sure we shall have constant
occasion to congratulate ourselves upon

At the same time, I should not forget
to welcome among us an old and leading
parliamentarian, the honourable gentleman from Lauzon

who did honour to himself in the Speaker's

shall enjoy the benefit of his experience.
He knows the whole of Canada well, and
the Province of Quebec perhaps still
better, and I will leave in his hands the
defence of the province of Quebec whenever it needs to be defended, for henceforth I shall be obliged to speak for
Canada as a whole.

their performance this afternoon. They
did justice to themselves. Their reputations were already established, and I am
quite sure that they, representing the
farming interests of the two large
provinces of Ontario and Quebec, will be
a valuable addition to this Chamber, and
will give us the benefit of their experience
in matters with which they have been
more especially concerned.
I am somewhat timid about mentioning
the action of my predecessor as leader
of the House, since he took the lead by
showering me with compliments. Before he
proceeded to wish me a hearty welcome,
I had intended expressing my regrets at
the loss of his leadership of this Chamber;

and I fervently hope that in the discharge
of my duties I shall have his friendly
co-operation.
Here, honourable gentlemen, I crave
permission to take up a matter which is
not contained in the Speech from the
Throne. It may seem a matter personal
to myself, but it bears on the conduct of
affairs of this Chamber. I refer to an
attitude of mind which has permeated the
Senate through tradition and for a long
period of years. At the root of the matter
is the whole question of the function of
the Senate and the exercise of its powers.
Should it be administered by party groups
-- by a Ministerial party and an Opposition? I confess that ever since I entered
this Chamber I have been reluctant to
submit to party rule. I thought that the
Senate should be, in appearance as well
as in reality, an independent body exerWhen
cising quasi-judicial functions.
reading the Debates on Confederation I
feit that the role which was assigned to
Upper Chamber was, indeed, an
this
ideal one. To cite but one of the fathers
the then Attorneyof Confederation,
General, since Sir John A. Macdonald, I
find that at page 35 of the Debates on
Confederation he stated that in his
opinion the Upper House should be the
controlling and regulating but not the
initiating branch; the House which would
have the sober, second thought in legislation. And at page 36 he added:
There would be no use of an Upper House, If
it did not exercise, when it thought proper, the
right of opposing or amendIng or postponing
the legislation of the Lower House. It would
be of no value whatever were it a mere Chamber for registering the decrees of the Lower

House.
having a free action of its own, for it is only
valuable as being a regulating body, calmly
considering the legislation initiated by the
popular branch, and preventing any hasty or ilconsidered legislation which may come to that
body, but it will never set itself in opposition
against the delliberate and understood wishes
of the people.

When examining the proceedings of the
first Sessions of this Chamber, from 1867
on, it struck me from the tone of the
debates that the action of the Senators
was that of independent judges. Perhaps
that attitude was due to the fact that it
started on its way under a coalition Government. There were but two parties at
the time, and the parties were represented
in the first Government of John A. Macdonald. But it was not very long, I admit,
before they had drifted into the old form
of party politics, which obtained in nearly
every parliamentary hall.

SENATE
For my part, from the moment I entered this Chamber, I felt reluctant to call
the leader who sat opposite the Government representative the "leader of the
Opposition".
That term was somewhat
repugnant to me because it implied a systematie official Opposition, and I did not
see the role of the Senate in that light.
It seemed, according to the dictum of the
founders of Confederation, that the function of the Up-per House was to tender
sympathetic advice to the Government,
and to postpone or oppose or modify the
measures of the Government according to
its own good judgment without any party
bias. Having these sentiments at heart,
I confess that, in assuming the direction of the legisiation in this Chamber, f
disliked the idea of crossing the floor, having
ben last Session at your left, Mr. Speaker,
and now coming to sit at your right. What
did that action purport? Its meaning was
that there were in this Chamber victors
and vanquished. It seemed to take into
account the fact that there had been elections in the country, elections which, to
my mind, should affect the popular House
but not this Chamber; and I had occasion
to tell my honourable friend from Calgary
(lon. Sir James Lougheed) that I wNas
perfectly agreeable to and even insistent
upon his remaining on this side of the
I thought also, in order to eliminate party politics, that this Chamber
should have no Ministers, either with or
without portfolio. I was toid that the
Government business should be handled in
this Chamber by official reprosentatives of
the Government. I felt that there was a
better way- that, instead of everything
being in the hands of one man, each Minister could very well select a Senator as
bis representative, and that, instead of
one man taking charge of public Bills, that
service could be assigned to ten, twelve,
or fifteen Senators. I felt, and I still feel,
that we should safeguard the independence
of this Chamber, and keep it uninfluenced
by any outside pressure. I felt, and still
feel, that this Chamber should owe its
fealty only to its King and country.
Party divisions in this Chamber have
created this state of mind.
We have
leaders. Well, let the leaders direct; let
them lead; let them carry the responsibility
and do the work. If the leader set up as
that of the Opposition criticises, there is a
wave which carries a certain number and
causes them to think and feel with him;
if-and this is more serious-the leader
ceases to criticise and says amen, a vast

number in this Chamber will be disposed
to repeat amen. I do not believe this is
the proper function of the Senate. The
Government did not see eye to eye with me
when I suggested to its leader and his
colleagues that Cabinet Ministers should
not sit in this Chamber. The Government
was agreeable as far as Ministers holding
portfolios were concerned, but thought
there should be one who would have a firsthand knowledge of the business of the Government in order to lay it before and impart it to this Chamber. I recognize that
the duty of the Government is to furnish
information, and that much I intend to do
to the best of my ability; but when I have
performed that task, it is my feeling that
the Senators are then supreme in the judgment which they exercise. For my part, I
refuse to lead a Ministerial party in this
Chamber; I claim no followers; I shun
party discipline and the party whip.
I
invite criticism of the measures of the Government, criticism from the right as well
as from the left; and I feel that it is the
responsibility of each Senator to try to
improve the legislation that comes before
us.
It will be obvious to honourable gentlemen that I do not seek uniformity
of thought in this Chamber.
In every
deliberative
assemcbly
the
trends
of
thought are many, and the ideals of government diverse.
All shades of opinion
are to be found within the walls of every
house of parliament, he it an upper or a
lweor bouse. These various opinions will be
given expression to more freely if they are
given full play in an atmosphere of perfect
independence.
The Speech which His Excellency was
pleased to deliver contained three matters
to which specially I would like to revert:
Finance, Railways and Immigration.
I believe it is the duty of the Government
to reduce the expenditure to the greatest
possible extent. Speaking for myself, an?
J trust for the Government as well, T
cordially invite the co-operation of this
House ir the task of restoring equilibriuni
in our finances. I want to draw the attention of new members of this Chamber to
the powers of the Senate with reference
to money Bills, as expressed in a resolution
adopted unanimously by this House some
years ago. I flnd in the Journals of the
Senate of 1918 that the Honourable Mr.
Béique moved:
That a special Committee be appointed to
ennsider the question of determining what are
the rights of the Senate in matters of financial
legislation, and whether, under the provisions of

MARCH 14, 1922

British

America

Act, 1867,

it

is

permissible-and to what extent-or forbidden,

for the Senate to amend a Bill embodying
financia, clauses, the said Committee to report
to the Senate as soon as possible.
The Committee was appointed, and
honourable gentlemen of the Senate will
find at pages 193 and following the report
of that Committee, whose Chairman was
the present Senator from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross), with a memorandum
attached, prepared by Hon. Mr. Ross himself. That report asserts the right of the
Senate to amend money Bills. It was
unanimously adopted by this Chamber. I
desire to say that I will not recede from
the position I then took. I may question
the wisdom, but will never question the
right, of this Chamber to intervene in
the discussion of the money Bills that are
presented to it. The situation is so grave
that I am sure the Government and the
people are entitled to the co-operation of
all the members of the two branches of
Parliament in the solution of our financial
difficulties.
The Speech from the Throne mentioned
the operation of our railway system. We
have now absorbed all the railways in
Canada except the C.P.R.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the Baie
des Chaleurs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question
is in everybody's mind: is there enough
traffic originating in Canada, or coming
from outside, for our present mileage? It
is agreed on all sides that our population
is too small to furnish the tonnage necessary to enable us to meet our railway
obligations. The most important and
pressing thing to do will be to cut down
expenditure and eliminate duplications.
At the same time, we shall have to see
if we cannot increase our population. That
is the easiest and surest way to increase
our tonnage. But immigration must be
selected. It must be directed to our farms.
WA cannot seek industrial workers in
industrial countries when the situation
is already so critical as regards unemployment in our cities. We must seek good
immigrants. We must place them on the
farms.
But what is the present situation in the
West? I am informed that very little
arable land is left in the possession of the
Government within fifteen or twenty
miles from any railway in the three
prairie provinces, and yet there are in the
West over 22,000,000 acres of unoccupied
and uncultivated land alienated from the
S-2

111

Crown within fifteen or twenty miles of
railway lines. This includes the Hudson
Bay and the C.P.R. land. What can be
done to get those- private interests to receive the settler and offer him at a fair
price the land which is thus held vacant?
That is one of the most interesting and
engrossing problems confronting the present Government. I believe we shall have
to turn to the Eastern Provinces as well
as those of the West, and ask them to
compete in offering the best possible terms

would solve the railway problem and at
the same time the financial problem, and
in the campaign which will be initiated
for the purpose of attracting settlers to
our lands I hope to see considerable emulation on the part of each province in offering them the best terms• possible.
My honourable friend (Hon. Sir James
has dealt at considerable
Lougheed)
length with the past, and with the causes
of the reverse of the Government which
went down to defeat on the 6th of December last. I did not intend to touch on any
of those questions, nor to turn backward.
I felt that henceforth we should apply
ourselves to solving the very important
problems that confront us. I will say but
one word in answer to the honourable gentleman's queries, why has Quebec elected
sixty-five opponents of the last Government, and why have the three central provinces of the West, including his own
province, gone likewise against the late
Government? I allude simply to the two
groups which my honourable friend has
mentioned. Now, I do not want to be lu
the least recriminative. Last year, in the
discussion of the Address, I gave two
reasons why those two groups would be
solidly opposed to the Government. Among
other reasons that actuated them, I felt
that the West had a grievance against the
East-that it had reason to complain of
what I might call the egotism of certain
classes in the East, of which my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
and the right honourable gentleman whom
we welcome among us to-day (Right Hon.
Sir George Foster) took advantage in

unrestricted and restricted reciprocity. We
ail remember Sir John's speech in Toronto

dissolve the House in 1891.
He said:

This is my personal view. I have been
fromn the outset in faveur of proportionai

know wvhether I have ever done se in this
Chamber or not-the example of Belgium.
Belgium is divided into two races, the

came

Socialists, who rninglied and fraternized

and from the Walloon district came a
fairiy goodi representation of Conservatives and Catholics, wvho fraternized
with the Catholic Flemish. This helped to
round the angles considorahly throughout
the yoars that followed; and it soems
te me that it o1lers a further roason for
establishing proportional
ropresontation
in Canada, because thon men cf the samne
opinions from ail parts cf Canada would

Yet, for ail that, I amn not fearful cf

PERSONAL

STATEMENT

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. WM. PROUDFOOT: By leave of
the House, 1 desire to say a few words of
a personal nature.
As sorne of you are aware, I was
appointed to this House by the Union Governnient, and sat on what is known as the
Government side of the House. At the late
election that Governient was defeated, and
following its defeat the present Government, pursuant to the ternis of The British
North America Act, appointed a Speaker
for this House. They also, according to
customi, went a step further and appointed
a leader of what is known as the Goverament side of this House. The niembers of
this body stîli following the customi, have
changed from one side of the Bouse to the
other.
The Senate is to niy mind an independent body, and the members should not be
tranielled with allegiance to any party
inside or outside of the Bouse. 1 trust the
finie is not far distant when the resuit of
an election will not mean the shifting of
seats £roni one side to the other by menibers of this Bouse. In the last election in which qI ran I did so as
an Independent, being opposed by a Liberal

Now I wish to speak for a few moments
on the question of reciprocity. I believe,
honourable gentlemen, that the Parliament
of Canada and the people of Canada are
just about to realize the mistake that was
made in 1911 in not accepting the offer
made by the United States. If that offer

had been accepted, does anybody here think
we would have had the Fordney Bill? We
would not. The conditions in both countries
would have so benefited by the operation
of the reciprocity agreement that was
then proposed that we would have had that
agreement in force up to now and for many
years to come; and, from our endeavors
to get something of the same kind again,
the people will begin to realize what we
missed. Who is going to suffer most? The
whole people generally will suffer, but if
there is any one class on earth that is to
blame, that was short-sighted, that was
foolish, that did not look to their own interests, it was the manufacturers of Canada.
The reciprocity agreement did not hit the
manufacturers; it particularly left them untouched. If my memory serves me aright,
honourable gentlemen, there were only three
items of manufactured goods that were
touched by the agreement: one was agricultural implements, on certain classes of
which 2. per cent was taken off, and on

other classes 5 per cent.

borne a duty of $1.50 a ton. I am not
sure, but I think, possibly, 5 per cent was
taken off the duty on automobiles. That
is the limit of the effect of reciprocity on
the manufacturers of Canada. They opposed it tooth and nail, and succeeded. What
are the manufacturers wanting now? They
are wanting markets. They need markets

to-day more than protection, because, while
for many years the tariff was the main
issue, it is no longer the most important

issue to the people of Canada, including the
people of the West. The question of freight
rates, which I will deal with presently,
comes ahead of that. But the manufact-

urers then had an opportunity of securing
the markets of the United States for the
agricultural products of the people of the
West, which would ,have enabled them to
get money to buy goods. But the manufacturers turned it down, and they will
regret that action from this time forward,
if they have not done so before now; because, in my judgment, never again during the life-time of anyone here, and longer,
will the Canadian people be able to get
from the United States such a good agreement as was arranged in 1911. I see that
the Government has made an effort to get
something of the kind. I will not give them
any credit for it just now, but if they
succeed they will have the support of the
Progressives throughout the country.

merely in natural products of the farm; as
a quid pro quo the United States Government will demand also reciprocity in certain lines of American manufactured goods.
That is the reciprocity deal that we shall

the manufacturers of Canada are the class
that will suffer the most in the future for
not having accepted the reciprocity proposal of 1911, that did not touch them or
hurt them at all.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Would the honourable member allow me to ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: I am interested in
the speech of the honourable member. In
case the United States refuse to give us
reciprocity, what shall we do then? Shall
we open our markets to them?

doing for the farmer and the workingman?
It would be putting the farmer in the
position of having to buy any goods used
on the farm at any price the home manufacturer chose to ask. Under the conditions which my honourable friend from
Mille Iles (Hon. Mr. David) mentioned, my
suggestion would be-and this is part of the
Progressive policy-that we should lower
the duties on all goods coming in from
Great Britain; we should increase the preference to Great Britain; or, if the Americans shut out everything from Canada, then
we might go so far as to say, "We will

go to Britain and to Europe. That would be
my suggestion as to the best way to meet
the condition, and it is quite possible that
the condition mentioned by my honourable
friend from Mille Iles may come about.
However, I have not very much fear of it
coming about.
One thing I notice has not been mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne. There is
no word about redistribution. I can understand that that does not effect a great
many people in Canada; but I would like
this House to remember that, until we have

parts of Canada, is represented in the

before the election, as we should have had,
there would probably have been nearly that
many more Progressives from the Western
Provinces. My opinion is, and I suggest
it to my honourable friend the leader of
the Government, that a redistribution Bill
should be brought down at this Session. We
do not know what may happen. The Government have not a majority, and they
have to depend on the Conservative party
or on the Progressives in the House of Commons. They need help from one or the

it would be good policy to pass a redistribution Bill at this Session. It would probably take only two or three days, for there
is now no party in Canada, whether Liberal,
Conservative or Progressive, that would
try to pass an unfair redistribution Bill.
That fact was made plain enough in the
returns at the last election. My honourable friend the leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) pointed
out yesterday that it took 18,000 Conservatives to elect a member of the House of
Commons, while it took only 11,000 Liberals
or 11,800 Progressives to elect a member.
So I suggest that a Bill be brought down.

committee would lick it into shape. Only
two or three days time would be required
for the House of Commons to pass it. Then
we should be ready for anything that might
happen. My honourable friend the leader

against them. I want to ask my honourable

It just proves the old adage that gratitude

the question of freight rates is settled. How
are we going to settle it?
One man will tell you that if you reduce
the freight rates you are going simply to
put the railways out of business; that with
the present condition of labour you cannot
reduce the freight rates. My answer to
that is this: Reduce the freight rates
first, then tackle the labour question. If
you have the freight rates reduced, the
railroads will be able to reduce the wages.
Unreasonable wages are being paid on the
railways. It is not so inuch the rate of pay
per day; it is the rate of pay for the amount
of work that is done. I do not blame the
Government for increasing the wages when

out we were engaged in the war, and if
they had not agreed to those rates there
would have been a general tie-up of the
railroads all over Canada. We could not
afford to have that during the war. The
McAdoo award was not so very bad itself,
but where some people got in their work
was in this, that in addition to the McAdoo
award there was inserted a little clause
saying, "and all amendments thereto.**
After that award there were seventeen
amendments to it, with the result that the
railroad men could do practically what
they liked. We travel on fast trains. But
take the freight traffic of the country. A
crew starts out from a divisional point.
At the present time they are getting high
wages. The run is one hundred miles for
a day's pay. They have eight hours
in which to do it. There are a hundred
different ways for that railroad crew, if
they wish, to delay and get in three or
four hours late. That means that for the
last three or four hours they can draw
as much wages as they did for the first
eight, either by receiving pay and a half
or by increased mileage. 'I have had
instances brought to my attention, honourable gentlemen. In one instance, I remember, a man who rwas working on a snowplough got his boy also appointed on the
plough. They start from a division and their
pay counts until they get to the next division.
They may be three days getting to the next
division. And what are the wages? For the
first eight hours they are paid their ordinary regular wages, and after that they
get pay and a half, day and night, Saturday and Sunday, working, sleeping, or eating. They get pay and a half for twentyfour hours a day. This particular man

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Each?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: $800 for the work
for the month.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: The two of
them?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes.
Another case brought to my attention
was that of a mechanic. Something goes
wrong with an engine.
The engineer
either cannot or does not want to fix it.
He wires down to the divisional point or to
one of the big shops, and a mechanic is
sent up. He has to have a helper. They
come up on the Pullman or in the parlour
car. That is aIl right. But from the time
they start out until they come back, they
receive pay and a half after the first eight
hours for twenty-four hours, day in and
day out. Any one knows that under those
circumstances if a man made a trip of
two or three hundred miles in the West,
the bill would be several hundred dollars.
That sort of thing cannot go on. Wages
have to corne down to a proper basis. And
remember, I am not in favour of reducing
wages to the limit. I like to see a man
make a good day's pay, but I want to see
a fair day's work done for that pay. At
present we are not getting a fair day's
work for a fair day's pay. And if freight
ratesare to come down-and they have to
come down if you want prosperity in Canada-then I say wages must come down
also.
Why should these men be in any different position from the farmers, for instance?
At the present time the farmer does not
get one-third of what he did for his products, and still he has to pay an increased
price for everything he purchases. At the
present time in the West there are many
products of the farm on which, if loaded
on a car of either the Government railways or the Canadian Pacifie railway, you
have got to pay the freight in cash when
the car is shipped-why? Because the railways are afraid that the carload of the
product, whatever it is, will not sell for
sufficient at Winnipeg or Fort William to
pay the freight. There have been numbers of cases in which a man has shipped
a carload of farm products, and has been
billed back for a certain amount to pay
the freight, the receipt from the sale of the
goods not being sufficient to do so.
I ask you, how in the name of Heaven
can a country prosper under such circumstances? I say it cannot prosper: there
can be no revival of trade till conditions are
remedied along the line of reducing freight

rates. This agreement giving the Board
of Railway Commissioners power to increase the rates on the Crowsnest railroad
over and above those fixed by Act of Parliament at the time of the granting of
the charter and the giving of the subsidy
to build the road should come to an end.
We paid millions of dollars to the Canadian Pacific Railway for the building of
the Crowsnest road, and we got as a quid
pro quo reduction on certain commodities,
both east and west-grain, cattle, coal, implements, etc. Now, there is a campaign
being carried on, not only in Canada but
in the United States, to continue that sort
of thing. The shareholders of the Canadian Pacific Railway have been drawing
10 per cent on their common stock for
years, and I want to ask why should
they any more than anybody else
be bonused year in' and year out? Is
there a man here having investments who
has not suffered losses or decreased dividends during the past few years?
Why
should the shareholders of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, a large majority of them
outside of Canada, be put on a pinnacle and
be permitted to say: "Oh, no, the Canadian
Pacific railroad is sacred; the shareholders
of that railroad, no matter whether they
live in Europe, Africa, or the United States,
must be paid 10 per cent on their common
stock."
Why cannot they eat thin soup as
well as the rest of us? Are we going to be
taxed day in and day out? The income tax
will have to be increased still further in
order that the shareholders of the Canadian
Pacifie Raillway, living in affluence in many
of the countries of the world may receive
10 per cent on their common stock irrespective of conditions here.
I want to point
out to my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that if the Governrment extends the time under which the Railway
Board can set aside the agreement that was
ma-de, or if they put up any private member
to introduce some little clause that wou-ld
hardly be noticed but which will have the
same effect, there wil4 be a strong reaction
through the country, and they iwill have
nighty good reason to regret their action.
I think it is time for us to let the Canadian
Pacifie Railway know that they have got
to live up to contracts they made years ago.
When that matter was brought up in the
House some three years ago, there was a
proposal made that without limit on the
time the Railway Board should have control irrespective of any Act of Parliament;

that is run. The same is true in the Lower

same thing is more or less true in Ontario
and in Quebec. Let a man of courage take

say: " We are running two trains a day;
one is sufficient. We are running three

do all the work." The service given, perhaps, will not be as satisfactory, but until
we get these railroads on a paying basis
something of that kind must be done or
the people of Canada will have to put their

reason that there will be other oportunities,

conclusion, I want to say that I have every
good wish for the Government; I have
every good will towards them so long as
they do what I consider to be fairly or
reasonably or nearly right; but, honourable
gentlemen, as a Progressive I fail to see
how a Government that has as many high
protectionists and as many men who are
dead against Canada operating her own

Minister, can bring in legislation that either
I in this House or the 65 Progressives in the
House of Commons will be able to support,
judging from the speeches made during the
last few days in the House of Commons. I
would ask any man in this House or in
this country to read the speech of Mr. King,
or the speech of Mr. Meighen, both able
debaters, both eloquent, and to read the
speech of Mr. Crerar, who is not as
great a debater as either of the
other two leaders, and then to say which
is the best speech from the Canadian point
of view, the moderate point of view. Talk
about Progressives being upsetters. Read
Mr. Crerar's speech and if you can carry
away f rom it that idea I shall be very much
surprised. I have read the three speeches
very carefully, and in my humble judgment
Mr. Crerar's speech is the best of the three.
Of course, I may be prejudiced.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, no.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I may be prejudiced, but, allowing something for that,
just as you would allow a little latitude to
my honourable friend from New Brunswick,
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

I think you will find that Mr. Crerar's is
a pretty fair, moderate speech. He tells the
Government:
"Carry out your policies,
and you will get a great deal of support,
but vary from them and we will be just
as ready to give support to measures proposed by Mr. Meighen if we think they are
in the interest of the country."
I was glad to see Hon. Mr. Meighen returned again. I think it would have been
a pity and a shame if a man of his ability
had been shut out of Parliament. I think
he will make an ideal leader of the Opposition. He has the ability, he bas the
courage, and if he does not keep the Government toeing the mark pretty well I am
very much mistaken. A good leader of
the Opposition is just as necessary as a
good leader of the Government. We have
in this House one of the old stand-bys of the
Conservative party, the honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Sir James Lougheed).
He was a fine leader of the Government.
I always found it a pleasure to listen to
him when he was in that position, and
he will make a fine leader of the Opposition. We all know of his fairness and
reasonableness, and, with such a leader
of the Government as my honourable friend
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
such a man as my honourable friend from
Calgary leading the Opposition, and I
leading the Progressive party, we should
meet with every success.
Hon. W. H. BENNETT: In rising to
continue the debate let me at the outset
congratulate you, Mr. S

been elected by the Government to the high
office which you are to fill. I judge from
your kindness, forbearance and deportment
in the House during the years you have
been here, as well as in the House of Commons, that you will be a popular Speaker
and will receive from the members on
either side every consideration possible.
• Referring now to the Speech, I want to
re-echo all that has been said with reference to the coming of the present Governor
General, Lord Byng. Perhaps no man who
figured in the Great War is nearer to the
hearts of the Canadian people, more particularly those who fought for Canada and
the Allied forces, than Lord Byng, and the
welcome that will be accorded to him and
his estimable wife during their sojourn in
this country will be one of the warmest and
kindest ever given to any Governor General.
Now, having offered my congratulations,
let me extend my sympathies. They are

Then the Liberals won North Bruce.
Well, that was one of the accidents of the
campaign. The Liberal-Conservative candidate there and the representative of the
Progressive party were both in accord as
to their former politics; consequently the
Conservative vote was split and a furniture manufacture slipped in there, representing the present Government. Will the

There are the seven ridings in Ontario
in which the great Liberal party was
able to elect representatives without appealing, as they did appeal, to every passion
and prejudice in order to obtain the German
and the French vote.

much as in the last campaign. I know
what it is to meet that cry, for in that riding, which I represented so many years, it
was always raised against me. I have seen
even a member of this Chamber go up there
to discuss the question of race and religion.
That is the cry that went throughout the
province of Ontario, and honourable gentlemen opposite may boast that they were
successful in fifteen ridings by reason of
the German and French vote. Well, that
appeal is recoiling on themselves to-day in
the province of Ontario. What happened
in the rest of the province? Progressives
and Conservatives were elected. It recoiled

recoil? By the election of two Conservatives there. That religious and racial cry
raised in those constituencies where there
is a big French vote is reacting on those
politicians to-day. In the municipal elections of the city of Hamilton, where there
had been peace, harmony, and goodwill
among the citizens before that insidious
campaign reached fever heat, and where
there had been Roman Catholic controllers,
councillors or aldermen, there was not one
elected. And so long as these gentlemen
want to talk about solid Quebec there will
be great portions of the province of Ontario
that will assert themselves against a solid

Quebec.
Right in this city of Ottawa what was
the result? The Conservative candidates
swept the English-speaking districts, but
when they crossed the bridge, as it is called,
into the section where the French vote predominated, that was the end of their majority. These honourable gentlemen are
perpetually crying out, "Peace, Union and
amity," and yet in the next breath, in
order to carry elections as they did, not
only in Ontario but throughout the whole
Northwest, wherever there is a foreign vote
they make appeals to passion and prejudice.
Let the honourable gentlemen remember
this, that in the province of Ontario there
are a large number of Roman Catholics
who do not thank them at all for such
appeals, because they react on themselves in
that province.
I commend to honourable gentlemen an
appeal that was made lately by a high
dignitary of the Catholic Church in the
province of Ontario. Let me tell honourable members who may not know the school

in possession, waiting to see what the Government is going to do. Has this Government announced at the earliest opportunity what it is going to do? It is true
that they say tariff changes will be brought
down; but is it stated in an authoritative
way what the tendency of the changes will
be, whether up or down? Comfort is given
to some gentlemen engaged in manufacturing in this country by the statement of
the actual leader of the Government, the
Minister of Justice, that the tariff will be
the tariff which existed under the Laurier
Government.. If it were decisively announced in the House that the tariff of the
Laurier Government was to be the tariff,
the manufacturers would go ahead. But
would it be believed, after that great conference of Liberals held in the city of
Ottawa at which they named the very
articles on which the tariff would be reduced? If it is going to be the Laurier
tariff, well and good; let it be known to
the people and then the manufacturers will
have some hope and will know where they
stand. However, the House will have to
wait a few weeks longer, and then we will
see what changes are proposed in the tariff.
But mark my words, there will be no
change in the tariff on automobiles, or in
the tariff on agricultural implements.
I do not intend to go further into the
tariff question, but I want to deal with the
railway question. The position of the
amalgamation of the Canadian Northern
and the Grand Trunk railways is simply
this. Under legislation enacted prior to
the outgoing of the last Government that
amalgamation would have been perfected
and the roads would have been under one
Board and one management, had the late
Government been sustained in power.
True, there has been an appeal against the
award of the arbitrators sitting on the
Grand Trunk arbitration; but that did not,
does not, and would not prevent the carrying out of the terms of amalgamation. But
what do we hear and see about this question? One might have read yesterday in
the press of this city what took place in
the House of Commons on that question.
It was stated by the Premier that it was
the intention of the Government to have
a Board of Directors who would manage
the entire system in a manner that would
effect economies and further efficiency very
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

much in regard to what was in view. Why,
honourable gentlemen, that is no assurance that there is going to be a consolidation of the whole system. There is to be a
board of directors to control the different
lines-that is, if they are taken over by
the Government; but there is no guarantee
as yet that this Government is not going
back on the arrangement to take in the
Grand Trunk railway.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I hope they do.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Do what?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Go back on it.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I hope the Grand
Trunk is taken in too; but what assurance
have we that it is to be taken in? We
certainly have not anything in the utterances of the present Premier or the Minister of Justice to lead us to believe that
this is going to be done. There was a
meeting held in the city of Montreal at
which the present Speaker of the House
of Commons was present, and if any
railway policy was discussed that night
it was not along the line of the amalgamation of the Grand Trunk railway and
the Canadian National railway, but was
of a different nature entirely, namely,
dual control or interlocking with the Canadian Pacific railway. Neither the Premier
nor the Minister of Justice announced that
he was opposed to that. There is no use
disguising the fact that from one end of
Canada to the other there is a campaign
of propaganda on foot to prevent any combination of the Grand Trunk railway system
with the Government railways. It is to
be found in the public press, irrespective
of politics; it is to be found in magazines;
it is to be found in publications of different
kinds and conditions. Let me quote some
of these. Here is a publication of the
Royal Securities Company under date of
May 6, 1921, prior to the election. This
article, even at that time, was strongly
against any combination of the Grand
Trunk railway with the Government railways. Saturday Night, a well known publication in the city of Toronto, comes out
along the same line. Search where you
will in the Montreal press and you will
find an unanimity of opinion that there
must not be any combination of the two
railway lines. It is true the word "coordination" is used; but what does that
word mean? As I said a moment ago,
when the Premier was asked for an explanation, he did not say that there was
to be a central control, but that there was

There can be no possible excuse for the

the board was apparently carried through with
the purpose of deceiving the Canadian Government and inducing them to act in a certain
way, but as a matter of fact, failed in their

Hon. Mr. McCOIG: How long has Mr.
Kelley retained that position?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Since he has been
general manager of the Grand Trunk. I
do not know when he started as general
manager, but my complaint is that he still
retains that position after that report was
made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When was the
report made?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I have told my
honourable friend that this is the official
report.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is the date
of Mr. Justice Cassels' judgment?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: This gentleman
says: "It was published in September and
it is only this month that I have succeeded
in obtaining a copy of the same."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it not true
that it was made at the beginning of last
year?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The late ýGovernment retained Mr. Howard Kelley after
the report was made.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: That is quite true,
but it must be remembered that if that
report was made in the month of September it was just after that that the general
election came on and that other matters
had to be considered. The late Government had not an opportunity, perhaps, of
looking into the matter and dealing with
it at that time. The fact of the matter is,
this Mr. Howard Kelley has been the friend
and confidant of honourable gentlemen opposite; that is the reason why he is retained
in his position to-day, and that is the
reason why the public to-day believe that
the Grand Trunk will be a separate system and that that system will be managed
by Mr. Howard Kelley. Mr. Kelley has
some gentlemen under obligation.
Now, let us go a step further in the
management of this railway. I cannot give
the exact date of the crisis in the affairs
of the old Grand Trunk railway, but it is
within the recollection of honourable gentlemen. It was when Parliament was sitting in the Museum building; and, if one
was ever struck with the pathetic pilgrimages of two gentlemen, it was when they
saw Mr. Smithers and Mr. Howard Kelley
daily promenading the corridors of Parliament. What happened? The Government
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

of Canada had to go to their rescue; the
Government of Canada advanced them

$10,000,000 to tide over their affairs. But

when that money was given there were
conditions attached to the giving. What
was the first condition? It was that the
Government should have the privilege of
forming a committee of five who should
have the control of that railway. The
Canadian Northern railway and the Grand
Trunk Pacifie railway, being owned by the
Government, were entrusted to a Board of
Management which had at its head Sir
Joseph Flavelle, a gentleman who has the
confidence of every one who knows him, and
of the bulk of the people of this country.
Nothing more complimentary could have
been said of Sir Joseph Flavelle than what
was said by the late Senator Edwards in
his place in this House last year-that be
was well satisfied that the Government of
Canada had placed the railroads under
the charge of Sir Joseph Flavelle, knowing
that that was a guarantee that they would
be well handled.
The Board went on with their duties.
They did as well as théy could. I have
heard many complaints as to the administration of the $10,000,000; but this much
is certain, that Sir Joseph Flavelle had to
entrust to Mr. Kelley and those under
him the administration
of the money.
What happened in the latter part of last
year? Sir Joseph Flavelle, who as Chairman of that Board was responsible to the
people of this country for what was going
on, had doubtless with business intuition
examined into the accounts of the Grand
Trunk Railway Company and the manner
in which its affairs were being conducted.
He not living in the city of Montreal, where
the meetings, I understand, were from
time to time called, there was necessity

for a considerable amount of correspondence.
Now, let the House be seized of the conditions and of the positions these gentle-

men occupied.

Sir Joseph Flavelle was

appointed chairman of that committee by
the Government of Canada. We agree on
that. Mr. Kelley was the second member.
I think Mr. Bell, of the Department of
Railways and Canals, was the third. A
gentleman named Dupuis, I think, was a
fourth member, and a merchant in Montreal whose name has slipped my memory

was the fifth member.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Mr. Mitchell.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Oh, yes, Mr. Mitchell, the accountant of the Grand Trunk.

MARCH 15, 1922
It wae not to be expected that Mr. Bell and
Mr. Mitchell couid supervise the distribution
of the expenditure. That must of necessity
be nmade under Mr. Kelley and the officials
of the Grand Trunk. Something may be
said later on as to how that money was
spent. However, one man was trusted by
the people of Canada as the head and front
of the aggregation, to control, it, and that
one man certainly had the undivided support of the people of Canada in accepting
the position: that was Sir Joseph Flavelle.
In pursuance of the duties which were entrusted to hlm he looked into the economies
between the two railway systems. There
was no doubt that there existed a great
gulf between the positions of the two gentlemen, Sir Joseph Flavelle and Mr. Keliey,
because Mr. Kelley Wias an employee of the
people of Canada on a salary of $60,000
a year, if my information is correct, whereas Sir Joseph Flavelle was assuming the
onerous duties entrusted to bum, not for any
monetary considerations, although his expenses were paid, but simply with a desire
to carry out those duties, as he had been
requested by the Government. His appointment had been endorsed by prominerat Liberals throughout the country. When Mr.
Howard Kelley was associated with a man
of the stamp of Sir Joseph Flavelle, it behooved him to be on his honour, if he knew
what honour meant. What do we find?
We find that towards the close of last year,
when it had been announced that the services of certain persons were to be dispensed
with Mr. Kelley had in his possession confidential letters from Sir Joseph Flavelle.
I do not use* the word "confidential"' in the
sense that the public must not see them,
for they were the people's documents; but
surely there might b. confidences exchanged
between two gentlemen occupying their positions. Sir Joseph Flavelle, in the discharge of his duties, had written to Mr.
Kelley a certain letter to which I will make
particular reference. He speaks about conferences they had had in respect to the
reduction of staff with a view to affectîng
econornies. I am charitable enough to
assume it was for that purpose. Sir Joseph
Flavelle, as chairman of the committee,
called Mr. Kelley's attention to what was
going on:
Sir Joseph Fiavelle, Chlarman of the Railway Board, wrote to Mr. Howard G. Kelley,
President of the Grand Trunk Rallway, under
date of October 6th last, a letter touching the
pensfion record of Mr. W. H. Blggar, VicePresident and General Ciounsel o! the Grand
Trunk Railway:
now
7I arn led to query if we should renew
the question o! the retiring of sorne of the

3

senior men, flot a year henoe, but at the end
of the year."

Again he says:
"If you are worklng up on your plans wiII
you kindly report progrees to the <next)
meeting of the Board."

Again, on the 3rd of December he asks
for an answer to the letters. This Mr.
Kelley, this $60,000 employee of the people
of Canada, deliberately takes that letter
out of the office where it was on the officiai
file and shows it-to whom? He must have
shown it to the proprietor of the Montreal
Star, Mr. Hugh Graham, Lord Atholstan. Honourable conduct or dishonourable conduct? This Government knows that
he did that, and yet this Government retained hlm. Why did he do it? To gain a
political advantage; for that reason and
no other. Did he prostitute the position
that he heid? Mr. Kelley knew just as well
as he knew that the sun would rise next
day that there were going to be changes
in the management of the Grand Trunk
railway. Mr. Kelley did not want to see
those changes made, and he was going to
take the chance that a political change
might enable him to hold under a new
Government the office he then occupied.
So this gentleman, Mr. Kelley, took the
letter down and handed it over to the proprietor of the Montreal Star and the
proprietor of the Montreal Star made
it public.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: In justice te Mr.
KeIlley may 1 say that he 'denied having
shown that letter to any.body.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: How*
did it get out?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Ail I can say is
it le rather a belated denial. It has neyer
appeared in the public press.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Hear, hear. Nobody
knows of it.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: What happened
next? Mr. Kelley, or some person, having
taken this ietter out, a certain notable personage in the province of Quebec must have
been a.pproached and aeked if he would
make public the contents of the letter. Who
was that gentleman? No less a personage
than the present Minister of Justice of
Canada. I believe that Sir Lomer Gouin
was too old a bird to b. caught with a
newspaper effusion, and before he made the
etatement he did make I believa Sir Lomer
saw the original. I do not assert positively
that he did see it, but 1 give hlm credit
for being astute enough not to go and

36

SENATE

make such statements without first having
seen the proof. Sir Lomer Gouin had very
good reason to be careful. He had been
in politics a long time and he has had associated with him in politics gentlemen
who came to grief by not taking great care.
I need not recall an incident. It is fresh
in the recollection of the honourable gentlemen opposite.
I can imagine a room in the city of
Montreal; Mr. Howard Kelley coming in;
Sir Lomer Gouin there too; the handing
over of the paper; and then a careful
search under the table to see that there
was no dictaphone. The dictaphone had
been a dea-dly device on a former occasion
and had caught some person.
Then, after Sir Lomer Gouin got that
letter, if he did get it, and was assured
that it was genuine, he went upon the
public platform. Now, mark you-and I
want to accentuate this fact; you may
read the correspondence right through. It
shows that there had been discussed the
question of the retirement of two gentlemen who were Vice-Presidents of the road.
What is the statement that was made by
Sir Lomer Gouin? Were there any other letters that were shown except this one to
him? I take it that this was the only letter
he saw. When Sir Lomer Gouin, having
seen this letter, if he did see it, or having
been assured that it was in existence, went
on the public platform, he received an
ovation. He warned the electors against
the stratagems of the Conservatives, who,
once elected, "will take away from us our
railway shop and management, thus depriving at least sixty thousand of our workmen of employment, who would be compelled to exile themselves." The Minister
of Justice, because he has been shown a
letter-if he bas been shown a letterstating that a couple of officials were going
to be retired, goes on the platform and
makes that statement which has no basis
in fact! That is the way elections are won
by the Minister of Justice of Canada!
I recall that when I was very young, in
politics at all events, there was a story
told of a celebrated Minister of Justice
being elected in Jacques Cartier county
with a ballot box that had a false bottom
in it. It is an old story, but it is true.
However, he may have been a doughty
Minister of Justice, and I would absolve
him from the suspicion of having ever
made the design of that mechanism. He
may have been quite guiltless of it. But
the present Minister of Justice, Sir Lomer
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

Gouin, is responsible for the statement he
made, and it is a shame and a disgrace
to have as Minister of Justice a man who
will make what he knows is a misstatement of fact on a public platform in order
to delude people and obtain their votes.
Worse than that, the statements coming
from him in his high position were repeated
by the innocent and the unwary. Those
innocents accepted the statement on the
authority of Sir Lomer Gouin. There was
a Mr. Archambault, a member of the
House of Commons of Canada, who had
seen "letters containing the dismissals of
railway men, including a number of senior
officials." I cannot believe that Mr. Kelley,
or whoever had possession of that letter,
was so indiscreet as to show it to Mr.
Archambault. But think of the innocent
gentlemen who were deluded by the fact
that Sir Lomer Gouin, an ex-Prime Minister of the province of Quebec, had made
the statement.
Let me give you another statement. "He
took up the removal of the shops to Toronto"
-went Sir Lomer Gouin one better, told
them even where the shops were going to
be located. "This was more than the
people would stand for." And who do
you think made that statement? The honourable Senator from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain). May I ask the honourable
gentleman if he has seen Mr. Kelley's
letter?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, I did not see
the letter. What is the honourable gentleman quoting from?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: The Montreal
Star.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I said that?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Let us see.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: It will be found
on page 11 of the Montreal Star of December the 5th.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said worse
than that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, probably.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Perhaps my honourable friend was as fortunate as Mr.
Archambault in being taken into the confidence of Mr. Kelley. Did he see Sir
Joseph's letter?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: No? He relied,
I have no doubt, on the assurance of the

MARCH 15, 1922
Minister of Justice that it was true. I
cannot ask the honourable gentleman the
source of bis information, biut he will

that there was an imposition, that the
letter bore no such construction as that
a removal of the shops was contemplated,
he will no doubt ask whoever conveyed the
information to hlm to apologise. An
apology is due the honourable gentleman,
and I hope he will receive it.
Canada is undoubtedly in a serious position as regards the railways. There is a
feeling throughout this country that the
Grand Trunk railway has been stolen outrigbt under certain management. A higb
court judge, on evidence before hirn, says
that there bas been dishonest bandling
of the books witb a view to defrauding tbe
Governrnent of Canada; and one of the
Mr.
directors is Mr. Howard G. Kelley.
Kelley, out of his own moutb, is practically convicted of having banded out this
confidential document, for he was the mnan
who had tbe letter; and, greatest disgrace
of ail, after seeing the correspondenceif Sir Lorner Gouin did see it-he exaggerated or mis-stated it witb one intention
alone, and that was to deceive the public. We
bave corne to a pretty pass in this country
wben tbe Minister of Justice of Canada
thinks it is fair and rigbt to take correspondence obtained under sucb circumstances and to read it, not fairly and
squarely, but in such a way that the
electors throughout the country will be
deceived, and that innocent gentlemen like
iny honourable friend will repeat bis stateinents on the assumption that, coming from
Sir Lorner Gouin, they must be true.
How bas tbe Grand Trunk been rnanaged?
I will give my bonourable friends one
instance wbich cornes within rny own
knowledge. I will flot make public the
naines of tbe parties, but I will tell thern
to my bonourable friend so that be niay
look into tbe books if be so desires. A
firmi became bankrupt that owed the Grand

Trunk Company $180,000 for freight.

Is

it any wonder that the long-suiffering
Englisb stockbolders are aggrieved at tbe
bandling of tbe Grand Trunk system? And
tbat bappened, I feel certain, while Mr.
Howard G. Kelley was: President of the road.

ýwbo lives in the province of Ontario knows
that for twenty years there has not been
the feeling that is spoken of, an esprit
de corps-why? The feeling bas been
manifested in the strikes that bave occurred

on that railway frorn time to tirne. Every
section of the road bas been perrneated
with that feeling. There is no loyalty on
the part of tbe bulk of the ernployees of
the Grand Trunk railway. I bave talked
to many of thtem, and they have hailed witb
delîgbt the idea tbat they migbt get out
from under the leadership of the mnen who
have been conducting that rond.
There is sometbing due fromn this Government, and that is an explanation as
to why Mr. Kelley 'bas bee'n retained in
office at a princely salary. And there is
sometbing so far as Mr. Biggar is concerned. I have known Mr. Biggar for
years, and I arn confident that bis retirenment was binted at on only one ground,
namely, that of econorny. He mnust be a
man of 60 or 65 years of age-I bave not
seen him lately, and trust that bis bealth
is good; but I arn confident frorn bis higb
standing that that must be the cause.
And since bis name bas been made prommnent, I tbink it is only fair that Sir
Josepb Flavelle sbould give the reasons
for bis retirernent. No other names are
rnentioned in the saine way, but there are
imputations made in reference to two other
gentlemen nientioned, namely, Mr. Dalrymple and Mr. Robb. It is higb time that

regrettable to see a bigh-priced official
like Mr. Kelley so demeaning and degrading
bis position, and on tbe other band to see
a Minister of Justice of Canada disseminating information containing not one iota
o! trutb to prove the statements he was
inaking; and if it is going to be a case of
ab uno dicte omnes, if we are to judge ail
bis statements fromn that one, then I say
this Government will be sbattered by having
the Minister of Justice associated with it.
To my mmnd, tbe Grand Trunk railway
should he taken over at the earliest possible
moment; tbe Governrnent railways should
be placed under the control of one man.
One man bas been found big enougb to control tbe Canadian Pacific railwayý and
surely another man big enough could be
found to control this system. But if there
is ýto be, as the Premier intirnates, an
interlocking of the whole systemi under
separate managements, I fear that not rnucb
is going to be acconiplished. But we do
not know even yet that tbe Grand Trunk
railway is going to be taken over, and 1
hope before this debate closes to hear an
affirmative staternent on this point. The

of its great potentialities in the Northwest,
as an adjunct to the Grand Trunk railway,
could be made a great asset.
I have to-day cut a statement frorn one
of the newspapers of the quantity of grain
taken to the port of Montreal. It says:
The greatest number of ships in port on any
one day; the greatest number of ocean arrivais
in any one year; the greatest tonnage of ships
in any year; the advent of the new
C'.P.R.
2,000 bushel cars for grain, which were in
operation throughout the year in connection
with the extensive grain movement between
Georgian Bay ports and Montreal; the greatest
grain movement through the port of Montreal,
doubling any former record In the history of
the port; the highest annual interest charges
to be paid by the Harbor Commissioners, and
which the commissioners are pleased to state
are being ful]y paid as they becorne due.

.What does that show? It shows that in
the port of Montreal this summer there
were handled the enormous quantity of
some 60,000,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 140,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I did not think it
ran quite so high.
I ask where the bulk
of that grain carne frorn.
It came from
the Canadian Pacific railway and from the
Grand Trunk railway.
Those two companies occupy a str,-.tegic position in respect
to the grain tradeý of the Northwest. The
Canadian Pacifie railway staked their future on the const-ruction of the line frorn
Port McNico]l to Peterborough and frorn
Peterborough to Montreal.
I think in the
past season they passed through Port
McNicoll, sorne for!y odd millions of bushels
of grain; 1 think at the Port of Mid-land
f ully forty million bushels were handled by
the Grand Trunk system; and fram Parry
Sound there were handled probably eight or
ten millions of bushels.
That was the bulk
of grain shipped into Montreal.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: How rnuch of that
was Arnerîcan g"ain?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I will corne to that
in a moment.
0f the grain which carne
through Midland and the other ports I have
no doirbt some was Arnerican grain.
A
few years ago the Canadian Northern railway carried about 36 per cent of ail the
grain corning from the Canadian Northwest. When it reached the head of the
lakes, owing to the fact that the Canadian
Northern had no port, the grain went to
Buffalo.
With the facilities of Grand
Trunk at Midland, and with another large
elevator at Parry Sound', it would be easy
for the two railroids acting in conjunction
te handle upwards of one million ibîshels of
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

In this connection I would like to
point out that last year upwards of one million bushels of our grain of ail kinds went
to Buffalo.
It is infinitely better that
that grain should go through our own channels, via the Grand Truuk up to the time
that navigation closes; or, on the other
hand, by way of the C.P.R. to Montreal.
The bulk of the freight coming doëwn to
Montreal this year came by rail, very little,
comparatively speaking, corning by the
canal systeni of steamers.
The honourable gentleman from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Roche) asked me a question as
to American grain. Let me say in reply
to that that is a most important factor in
the future of this Goverumeut railway, and
for this reason. You eau carry grain from
Chicago, Milwaukee, or Duluth over to the
ports of Midland and Port McNicoll and
theuce to Montreal. Once there it eau be
distributed in the Eastern States even as
far as Boston, and a large and profitable
trade is being done there at the preseut
time. So the Canadian Government systent
of railways would have the advantage of
attracting not only the trade of the Canadian Northwest, but also a considerable
part of the trade of the Western States.
On the other baud, if the grain goes to
Buffalo it has to be carried eastward an
even greater distance than from Montreal.
The question of deepening the St. Lawrence canal bas been mooted, and while I
do not anticipate that the Government is
going to take any action in that matter at
present, I trust that sorne day during the
present Session there will be a debate ou
that subject. I believe that the press of
Montreal and a considerable portion of
the American press are opposed to the
deepening of the St. Lawrence canal. I arn
in agreement with Montreal ou that question. I maintain that the future of the
St. Lawrence waterway schemne can ouly
be tested by the success of the elevator
system at Port Coîborne. The largest boat
on the upper lakes, carrying haîf a million
bushels, can be handled there. There the
grain is transferred to boats carrying probab]y 80,000 bushels. Grain can be routed
to Montreal either by Port MeNicoll or by
Midland as cheaply as it can be by Port
Coîborne: it is therefore fair to argue
that if larger vessels could be taken
through to Montreal, the grain might be
carried cheaper than it is at present. But
there are setoifs against this advantage,
one of the greatest being that any canalization of the river woul<l entail the operation of these vessels at a very low speed.
grain.

MARCH 15, 1922
No mani who has given the subject any
thought at ail would believe that these
large vessels fromn the upper lakes will go
across to Great Britain and there discharge
their cargo. Why? In the first place, they
would have to be built for ocean service,
thus entailing a much larger expenditure
than is now required; and, in the second
place, can any one imagine these haifmillion bushel boats coming back from
England wîthout a cargo? It is idie to talk
about it. To-day it is an abandoned theory
that these boats will ever ko to Montreal.
From there they would have the back haul,
and there would be no return cargo. A
man might have four or five cases of dry
goods placed on an ocean liner, which
carries ail kinds of packet freight; but
fancy boats 600 fret in iength turning in
to the different towns along lake Ontario
to dump off a few boxes here and there.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What is their speed?
Hon. Mr~. BENNE TT: Probably 14 miles
an hour. The St. Lawrence scheme is not
beyond the range of possibility, but I believe that when the people of Canada hear
the subjeet properly discussed they will
not be of the view that so many seem to
entertain at present, that the deepening
of the St. Lawrence should be undertaken,
at ail events now. Lt may be all right
as a power proposition-xainly for the
benefit of the United States-but beyond
that there can be nothing.
I contend that at the earliest possible
moment there shouid be a co-ordination of
the Grand Trunk and the Canadian National systems for the benefit of Port
McNicoll and Parry Sound, and that if
possible every bushel of grain that goes to
Buffalo to-day should be carried through
those ports. The tonnage on the upper
lakes is such that American vessels, having the right to ply from, Buffalo to the
head of the lakes, Port Arthur and Fort
William, will always take a certain quantity of it. No doubt that question some
day will be the subject of debate in this
House.
I am afraid, honourable gentlemen, that
my remarks have been'somewhat extended.
1 have spokien freely and fully on the subject of Canadian nationality. It is to be
regretted that Canada has been divided as
she has been in the last three or four
elections, but 1 look forward to the time
when every province in this Dominion,
although it may be divided on party lines,
or on trade policies or transportation ques-

U

tions, will be united in matters of race
and religion.
As to the good wishes of my honourable
friend the leader of the Huse, I can promise him that when the ýGovernment is in
the rîght it will have my support; but if
at any time legislation is introduced into
the other House which I think is not in
the best interests of Canada, he will find
me in opposition. The Senate of Canada
can render great service. A great niany of
the members of this House have been well
seasoned in the House of Cominons, and
they bring with them here a knowledge
and experience of the requirements of the

always believed in the policy of the party,
and as a loyal Conservative I may say that
I neyer had more faith than I have to-day
in the ultimate triumph of that party and
in the policy of that party becoming permanent. I only hope that honourable
gentlemen opposite will adopt the policy
of the Conservative party, as they
did in the time of Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
and also that they will follow the policy
of the late Goverriment on the question
of transportation and will not indulge in
wild expenditures. Let us all, therefore,
work together with one accord for the
good of this Chamber and for the good of
Canada.
Before sitting down I want to say publicly, on this first opportunity I have haï
of doing so, that I regard very highly the
ability and the integrity of, the right honourable gentleman who leads the Conservative party in this country. I believe
that his losa to Parliament would have been
an irreparable one, and I predict that Mr.
Meighen will see to it, so far as hie can,
that every piece of legisiation emanating
fromo the House of Gommons is perfect in
every respect.

100,000,000 or more than that quantity has
gone to the port of Montreal, did any of it
go by rail? I understood the honourable
gentleman to say that most of it went by
rail.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: By rail from the
lake ports to Montrent.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: The honourable

Fort William?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Yes, from Fort

Georgian Bay to Montreal.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I understand
by rail. The question I desire to ask is
whether that went by rail when navigation was open, or whether it was carried
both by water and by rail.

Honourable
gentlemen, as we return annually .to this
Chamber it is our good fortune to see new
faces appearing in our family circle, and
it is our duty and our pleasure to welcorne theni to our rnidst. We form here
a group more closely allied than that in
in the House of Commons, because we have
less occasion to divide and more to unite.

Death alone separates us. The Senate is
a body wherein friendly ties are more easily
formed and maintained.
When they are
severed we more acutely feel the pang, and
we raise our voice to express our sorrow.

An exceptional

have

number of our fellow

left

us

during

the

last

recess.
Our senior member, Honourable Mr.
Power, wvas called te the Senate in 1877,
and had been during 44 years an active,
industrious and painstaking member of this
House. He was the last survivor of the
Alexander Mackenzie appointees.
When
that Government resigned office there were
but a handful of Liberals in this flouse,
and the critical examination and super-

MARCH 16, 1922
vision of ministerial legislation fell mostly
to the lot of the late Senator Power, who
during eighteen years scrutinized all public
legislation which reached this Chamber.
The old colleagues of our departed friend
often expressed their admiration for his
minute and conscientious work during that
long period. He had so completely mastered the rules and regulations of the Senate that he was at all times a sure guide
and mentor, on the floor of this Chamber
as in the Speaker's chair. A man of high
moral character, Senator Power enjoyed
the esteem and confidence of the community in which he lived and of all his parliamentary colleagues.
Senator Domville was also an old parliamentarian. His political career was of less
even tenor than that of his colleague and
neighbour by the sea. Senator Domville
entered this Chamber only in 1903, after
having gone through nine elections in New
Brunswick. He sat in the House of Commons from 1873 to 1878 and again from
1896 to 1900. The son of Lieutenant-General James W. Domville, he was all his life
identified with our militia. For twenty
years he commanded the 8th Princess
Louise New Brunswick Hussars. In business his activities were many and varied.
He had a quick and fertile mind which was
never at rest. Every question interested
him. No problem frightened him, and he
was ever ready to give his best efforts to
find a proper solution. He was an optimist
who always smiled. He participated often
in our debates. He had a great fund of
humour, and his good nature made him
very popular with his colleagues.
Unlike Senator Domville, our late colleague the Hon. William Cameron Edwards was a pessimist. Was he posing as
such, or was his vision really a dark one?
That question is not easily answered. His
pessimism was an extraordinary trait, for
he was a happy and prosperous pessimist.
He had given the lie to the aphorism which
describes success as the offspring of optimism, for he was uniformly successful in
all his enterprises. It was not with his
surroundings that he was at variance.
While struggling to establish and develop
one of the most important lumbering establishments on the Ottawa river, he found
time to explore the fields of economics and
philosophy. It was against the world in
general and the conditions prevailing therein that he rebelled. He would have built
or rebuilt it on a more logical plan. His
theories were always interesting, and he
was a most agreeable "causeur" and com-

panion. His life was a useful one. He
played his part nobly, and his memory will
be cherished not only by a large circle of
friends but by the hundreds of families
who have lived and prospered under his
guidance.
Senator Nicholls was also one of our
worthy captains of industry. While Senator Edwards laboured in the Canadian forest, Lieut.-Colonel Nicholls specialized in
iron, steel, and electricity. He came to our
shores before he had reached the age of
twenty. He had been born in London and
had received a good college training. From
that world centre he surveyed the world,
and decided that Canada offered the best
field for his*energy and ambition. He
settled in Toronto among strangers. He
was there alone without a friend, but his
faith, courage, and enthusiasm sufficed. He
laboured not in vain, and reached the goal
of success. One need only read the Parliamentary Companion to realize the extent
of his activities and the confidence he enjoyed among his peers in the commercial
world. He is another shining example for
young men to imitate.
Should I mention the name of one who had
a right to a seat in this Chamber but who
never occupied it?-Hon. Mr. Crothers, who
was for many years a member of the Commons and the head of the Labour Department. It is regrettable that we were deprived of his presence among us. It would
have been an advantage for this Chamber
to have heard him upon the important
economic questions which sometimes diAs we have

with us his successor in that office, it would
have been interesting to have heard his
views, gathered probably from another
direction, as he did not belong to organized
labour.
Of the late Hon. Arthur Boyer I can
speak with greater ease and freedom, because he was a neighbour and friend of
long standing. He had the privilege of
arranging his life according to his taste and
inclination. He had taken a university
course abroad and had travelled extensively. He was a lover of fine arts and

his personal experiences. Listening to his
discourses and beholding his attitude, mental and physical, I often feit that the sanie
environnient and training shaped nmen as
if they issued froni the sanie mould. The
late Mr. Boyer had foliowed, at the sanie
seat of iearning, in the footsteps of the
late Hon. Sydney Fisher. Later on they
met in political association, and were cirawn
together by natural inclination. Ail thieir
views and tastes ran in the sanie groove.
One could not hear the one without thinking of the other. They were both W.herents
of the sanie doctrines and ideals in the
administration of public affairs and ever
unbending in their attitude. They were,
te my mind,'the very type of the English
gentry who constitute in the main the
British House of Conimons.
Hion. Robert Beith was one of the best
representatives of the progressive farmers
of this country. He did much to improve
the Canadian breed of bertes, and is deserving of the c-ratitude of ah for his services
in that field. He had a good heart, a sober
judgment and a wiliingness to serve.
Hon. Mr. Mimne was but a few years
with us. He brought to this Chamber a
mature mmnd and wide experience iii industrial affiairs.
He was a prosperous
manufacturer and public-spirited citizen
of the city of Hamilton. Being1 a large emiployer of labour, the probienis arising bctween the labour element and die cnmployer
were uppermost in his mind. We ofteii
heard bum on this ail-important question.
To the families of our departed colleagues
we express our most sincere sympathies.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I join
with my honourabie friend opposite in expressing our deep regret at the loss sustained by the Sennte during the recess
through the death of the severai members of
this body mentionoi ýby bum.
During the
few months of recess which transpired between the iast Session and the present one,
the messenger of death was pecuiiariy active in removing froni this Chamber so
many of our colleagues, colleagues with
whom many of us had been closely associated for a great number of years.
It migbt naturaily be thought that those
of us who have been in this Chamber for a
long period and have witnessed the departure of se nlany of our colleagues would
become somewhat famuliarized with the taking off of those with whom we bad been so
ciosely associated.
Since I entered this
chamber the deaths have iiumbered at ieast
double the membership.
Death, ho'wever,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

no matter how much or how soon expected,
cornes with mingeci surprise and unce-rtainty.
Last Siýssion saw present in this
Chamber, with one or two exceptions, the
late members ment:oned by my honourable
friend, and while most of theni had reached
the allotted s-pan of life, and alil of theni but
one had considerably exceeded it, yet ainiost up to their severai deaths, they were
actively interested in the proceedîngs of
the Chamber and in the duties of their
office.
Public Iife had claimed the services and activities of most of them during
a period when Canada was most active in
its development.
The late Senator Doinville, had reached
the age of four sc3Dre years.
He had been
activeiy engaged in public life since 1873,
a period of nearly fifty years, and bad been
a member of this Chamber for neariy twenty
years.

The late Senator Power had also reached
bis four score years, and at the tume of his
death was the senior meniber of the Senate, having entered it in 1877,' as mentioned
by my honourable friend.
During that
long period he foilowed the course of its
business more closely than probabiy any
other member of this body.
Our late colleague Senator Edwards had
reached the ripe age of 78 years at the tume
of his death, and had been an active participanit in the public affairs of Canada during

the last 30 years.
He was peculiarly identified with the development of the city in
which we are to-day. the capital of Canada,
and ieft his impress deepiy upon the busi-

ness enternris-es of this progressive district.
lis knowiedge, experience, and association
with so many of the large business interests
of Canada brought to this Chamber a mature judgmnent on questions of business and
finance which had no littie weight in our
deliberations.
The late Senator Nicholîs, although net
an oid member of the~ Senate, was one of
the most representative business men of
Canada. The large and successful enterprise with which he had been associated for
most of bis life, and of which he was the
head, stands forth prominently to-day as
a great monument te his enterprise and t<
the faith which he had ln the progress and
development of Canadian industry.

COLD

STORAGE
FIRST

WAREHýOUSE

BILL

READING

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY presented Bill
B, an Act to Amend the Cold Storage
Warehouse Act. He said:
The purpose of this Bill is to deal with
two important matters that are within
the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, namoly, health, and trade and commerce. The Bill is intended, in the first
place, to protect the lives and health of
the public hy preventing cold storage
warehouses from holding foodstuffs until
they hecome unsafe for human consumption and then selling them to an unsuspecting
public,
the result
being
ptomaine poisoning, causing great suffering and often death.
The second purpose of the Bill is to prevent the waste of foodstuifs such as
meats, poultry, and oggs. Tons of preclous food are annually destroyed by cold
storage warohouses oither because they
have beon held too long or because of
faulty storage.
The third purpose of the Bill is to restore trade to its proper channels so as
to hring producer and consumer more
closely together.
Under the present
system cold storage warehouses have succeeded in diverting trade in foodstuifs
from its legitimate channels. They operate as middlemen to the great detriment of
hoth producer and consumer, and to their
own enrichment.
On the second reading I hope to be able
to give a more detailed explanation.
The Bill was read the first time.

Hon. Mr. DAVID inquired:
Does the Government intend before fixing
the rel)resentation of the provinces in the
Dominion Parliament. to have the last census
corrected and rectified where it is presumed as
established, that it nas been improperly and

He said: I desiro to say that in giving
notice of this inquiry I forgot to, mention
that I would caîl the attention of the
House to this suhject, in order that we
might have an expression of views from
ýhonourable memýbers.
I think this question deserves
the consideration of the
House, because if the hast census returns

However, I can bring
up the question at another time, soe that it

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. MURPHY inquired of the Government:
Have notices been sent out by the Departmient of marine and Fisheries to dismiss or discontinue the services of the captain and crew
of Patrol D which has been engaged in the
Fisheries Protection Service on the east and
west coasts of Prince Edward Island, with
headquarters at Tignish in the province for
some years past?
Is it the intention to replace them by others?
2. Is it the policy of the Fisheries Department to discontinue this very necessary patrol
service for the prevention of illicit lobster
flshing? If se, why?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The crew of
the "D" was paid off as usual, when the
boat was laid up at the endc of the season.
The captain was paid off at the end of!February. It has not yet been decided, who
will be employed on the boat next season.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I beg to ask the
honourable gentleman if the laying off of
that crew is the thin end of the wedge.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: 1 do not know
what the honourable gentleman means, for
do I know w*hat has been the practice in the
past; so I can-not answer hi§ further query.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I arn probably oeut
of order, but I might explain that this crew
has been in charge -ever since the patrol
boat service was estabiished for the protection of the lobster industry in Prince Edward Island. There was, an efficient crew.
The captain, who l'.as the efficiency stripes

Service, was retained ail the year round,

nothing.
Neithe-r. was the en-gineer, who
might be called a temporary man. Without any reason at ail, the captain and his
whoie crew were laid off at the end of February and given officiai notice of their dismissai.
I asked the honourable gentleman
if this was the thin edge of the wedge, and
the sooner we know the better it wili be fore
ahl concerned.
1 think the honourabie
leader is not; so obtuse as not to lonow what
I mean.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope that
the Minister of Marine and, Fisheries will
uniderstand the lsnguage better th-an 1 do.
I wiil transfer to him the reniarks of my
honourable friend.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I arn extremely
sorry if my Engiish is 'not as good as that
of -the honourable gentleman from De Lorimuér, but I think It probabiy is.
Honourable members o! this House will agree that
I have been quite explicit, and there may be
some suggestion in the remarks which I
have made. I do flot think the honourable
gentleman who le2ids this House needs to
refer to the Minister o! Marine and Fisheries to understandl what I mean.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

CRIMINAL

CODE

(APPEALS)

BILL.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS nioved the second
reading of Bill A, an Act to extend. the
Right of Appeals from Convictions for
Indictable Offenses. He said:
Honourable gentlemen, in rising to move
the second reading of this Bill I feel that
some explanation is due from me. I have
been asked by several honourable gentlemen if this is the saine Bill that was
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

passed by this House two sessions ago.
I desire to explain for the information of
those honourable gentlemen who have recently become members of the Senate that
two years ago a Bill was introduced here
to provide for appeals from criminal
sentences, so that a court of appeal might
revise a sentence given by an inferior
court or by a judge. That Bill, after passing this honourable House three tumes, was
finally passed by the Bouse of Commons.
Sa the present Bill, of which. I have the
honour ta move the second reading, is in
no way connected with that. At the last
Session I moved the following motion:
That in the opinion ai' the Senate it is essenliai for the better administration ai' the crimmnai law that a court aof Criminal Appeal
shouid be established In the different provinces,
with jurisdiction similar ta that po)ssessed by
the Court aof Criminai Appeai in Engiand, and
wilI inquire whether It is the intention ai' the
Government ta create such Courts.

That motion was very fully discussed in
this Bouse last Session, and it is owing ta
the very favourable comment mnade on it
here and ta the suggestions affered by
several honourable gentlemen that I have
been led ta introduce the present Bill. Perhaps it is unnecessary for me ta re-argue
the question or re-state the case, but I
would say for the benefit of those honourable gentlemen who have recently become
members of the House that the Bill provides for a very wide departure froni the
way in which criminal law is administered
hn this country. I have no hesitation in
saying that Canada is to-day the only
civilized country in the world in which
there is no appeal in criminal cases. Our
law is in this pecuhiar state, that no matter
how innocent a man may be, if he is once
found guihty by a magîstrate, a judge, or
a jury, there is no way in which he can
ever be pronounced innocent. In the few
remnarks I made last Session 1 cited instances of innocent men having been sent
ta the penitexîtiary. One man was in peni.
tentiary for seven years. He was arrested
a second time and sent down again for
seven years. Be was proven ta be entirely innocent-to have had absolutehy
nothîng whatever ta do with the case, but
there was no power under the British haw
as it then -existed by which that man could
be pronounced innocent.
As a further instance, I would point out
that the British North America Act says
that if any member of this honourable
Bouse, is convicted of a crime he forfeits
his seat. Mind you, it does not say, "guilty

MARCH 22, 1922
of a crime"; it says, Ilconvicted of a
crime." So if any of xny honourable
friends should be so unfortunate as to be
brought up before a court and found guilty,
no matter how innocent he might be, he
could neyer prove his innocence and would
forfeit his seat in this House. The only
reniedy he would have would be to apply
to the Department of Justice and ask for
the mercy of the Crown. The Crown could
pardon him of an offence which he had
neyer committed.
1 have flot framed this Bill or brought
it into the House without giving it some
consideration. Prior to the year 190
there was no court of criniinal appeal in
England, although it had previously been
discussed for about eighty years. The
question was introduced Session after Session. By one Administration a committee
were appointed to consider the matter, and
they made reports on it. As you know,
it is a very difficult thing to get a departure from the regular course of procedure in a country like England . However, after various Bis had been introduced on niany occasions in the course of
many years, the question was referred to
a Board of Judges, who took it up and reported favourably on a Bill to reconstruct
the criminal law in so far as it related
to criminal appeals. A Court of Criminal
Appeal was finally established on the recommendation of those judges, and after
an investigation by the British House of
Commons into two very glaring cases in
which persons entirely innocent had been
convicted of offences and undergone punishment. I will not enter into the details
of those cases, because I have deait with
tjiem before. The only way in which the
convicted man in either of those cases could
obtain any remedy was to go to a member
of the British Rouse of Conimons and ask
ta have his case investigated by a coinmittee of the bouse. Accordingly that was
done, and in those instances that I mnentioned the office of the Home Secretary,
who deait with applications of this nature,
was severely criticized. It was pointed
out by the gentlemen composing the coinmittee in the British House of Commons
that if there had been the right of appeal
in criminal matters the accused would
neyer have had ta undergo the punishment
which he did.
One of the writers on this matter has
pointed out why, in his opinion, there
should be a court of appeal in England:

Mr. Boulton, one of the members of the
British House of Commons, in the introduction
to bis work on the Court of Criminal Appeal
sald :
Both the public and the profession had
therefore arrived at the conclusion that sorne
review of the evidence upon which convictions
in criminal cases restefi was necessary.
The disadvantages of the laie system may be
summed up in a few words. In the first place,
the Home Office bas no power, If it is dissatisfied with a conviction, of quashing it. If, after
full inquiry, the case appears doubtful, the
Home Secretary may advise the granting of a
pardon ta the prisoner, or he can grant a reBut the Home
mission of the imprisonment.
Office can give no definite and final judicial finding such as a court of law can give.
In the second place, on a petition ta the Home
Office the prisoner's case only is before it. The
resuit of that is that the Home Office has ta
disoover the case against the prisoner, te test
his conviction and bis guilt in order ta establiah,
if possible, bis innocence.
In the third place, there is no legal finality
in the position of the Home Secretary. The
consequence is that. although he might corne ta
a clear and definite decision, he is always exposed te pressure to reconsider his decision.
In the fourth place, the Home Office cannot,
as a general rule, state its reasons for Its
decision.
Fifihly, the Home Office cannot take fresh
evidence on oath and alaw the cross-examinatien of witnesses.

0f late there bas undoubtedly been a

The Bill at present before the House,
honourable gentlemen, is not framed in
such a way as to create courts of criminal

48

SENATE

appeal. There is no court created, and no
additional expense put upon the country;
the Bill merely enables the judges of the
courts of appeal of the different provinces
to entertain applications.
To-day we have the peculiar position in
Canada that in a criminal case you can
appeal upon a point of law stated by the
trial judge; and the time of the court of
appeal may be taken up for days hearing
argument as to whether or not certain
evidence was admissible. But the court of
appeal, after hearing the argument, cannot say that in their opinion a man has
been improperly convicted. They are not
in a position to pronounce upon the guilt
or innocence of a prisoner. If the case is
referred to the Department of Justice, and
it comes to a decision, the reasons for its
decision are not made public; and therefore the decision is no guide to the judges
or the lawyers or anybody else.
I have here the report of a case which
was made in September, 1921. A woman
was assaulted on the outskirts of Winnipeg and a crime committed against her.
She went home and complained to her
mother. The next day she went to the
police and described the man, and finally
pointed him out. He was arrested, tried
before a jury, found guilty, and sentenced
to a term in the penitentiary. The trial
judge stated a case to the court of appeal
on the question, whether or not the complaint made by the woman to her mother
was evidence against the prisoner. The
court of appeal held that it was evidence
that the crime had been committed, but
that the judge should have told the jury
that it was not evidence against the man
who had committed the crime. The court
of appeal decided unanimously that there
was no reason to interfere with the verdict, and confirmed the sentence.
But
inside of a month the prisoner was walking
around the streets of Winnipeg a free
man. The officials of the Department of
Justice may have had reasons for what
they did, and I am not making any complaint about that; but I do know that one
of the judges felt that he should be informed of their reasons, and in what respect the court had erred. He wrote to
the Department of Justice asking them to
point out why this man, after having
committed a serious crime, should be walking around free; and the answer received
-I have not got it here-was to the effect
that the officials of the Departmen: were
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

astonished that anybody should question
their decision, and that it was not usual
to make the reasons for their actions publie.
I am not criticizing the officials of the
Department, but the system under which
they work. The vast majority of cases
that go to the Department of Justice go
there for the purpose of review. If the
Department review a case it is only a onesided investigation; and if they come to a
decision nobody knows anything about the
reasons for it. If they remit a sentence,
or cut down a sentence from ten to two
years, or from life to ten years, it is a
private matter and is no guide whatever
to the judiciary or to the legal profession
practising throughout the country.
I do not desire to take up any more time
on this matter. As I have already stated,
it was pretty well threshed out last Session. If the Bill passes its second reading, I will immediately move that it be
referred to a special select committee of
the House for consideration.
I do not
claim that the Bill is in any way perfect,
and my object in moving its reference to
a select committee is that the members of
the committee may have ample time to consider the matter and satisfy themselves
as to the facts, and, if necessary, call before them officers of the Department of
Justice. If our criminal law is in such
a state as I have outlined, I am quite
sure that the committee will make such
a report as will result in some remedy.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me to ask him if what
is proposed in the Bill is exactly the same
as the law in England?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The law in England is different in that there is a special
Act deals with the matter, creates a criminal court of appeal, or appoints certain
judges to sit as a separate and distinct
court. That is net proposed here.
The
purpose of this Bill is simply to give jurisdiction to the Courts of Appeal in the
different provinces to deal with the matter.
This is along the lines of the English Àct,
but there is no further expense put upon
the country.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Is this the same as
the Bill which the honourable gentleman
brought before this House last Session?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable
gentleman is probably under a misapprehension.

with the experiments, near Bienfait, Sask.,
in carbonizing lignite. The Lignite Board
bas no connection with, and does not receive its appropriation through, the Research Council of Canada.
Questions Nos. 2 to 10, answered by No.
1.
The Research Council was instrumental
in the initiation of this investigation, which
is jointly supported by the Federal Government and the Governments of Manitoba
and Saskatchewan. The Federal Government pays one-half of the cost through the
Department of Mines, and the Provincial
Governments each pay one quarter of the
cost. The Lignite Utilization Board consists of representatives of the three Governments concerned, and is not connected
with the Research Council.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I regret that the
answer is very indefinite and gives no facts,
and is not an answer to the question I have
asked.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the honourable gentleman will leave the question
on the Order Paper, I will see that further
inquiry is made.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It might be well to
make a motion for a return.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps the
honourable gentleman will let the question
drop and redraft his inquiry.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
is:
How much money has been expended to date

I understood the answer to be that no
money had been spent. From what I know
of this matter I may say that it is the
Lignite Utilization Board that spends the

nothing to do with it.

BRITISH EMPIRE STEEL CORPOR'ATION LABOUR DISPUTE
,DISCUS'SfION AND IjNQUIRY

Hon. CHARLES E. TANNER rose in
accordance with the following notice:
That he will caul attention ta the matter of
the wage disputes between the iBritlsh Empire
Steel Corporation and employees of the cornpany in Nova Scotia, and the relations of the
Department of Labour to the said niatter, and
will inquire :-1. What action the Departnient
of Labour has taken in regard to the said matter since the Gillen Award was made.
2. Whether the Minister of Labour, or any
officer of the department, bas been personally
in communication wlth the parties in the province of Nova Scotia.
3. Whether the Minister of Labour, or any
officer of the department, bas been lnvited by
the representatIves of the miners ta visit the
part of the province in whlcb the disputes arose,
and whether the minieter, or any officer of his
department accepted sucb invitation and visited
the locality and canferred there wlth the parties
ta the dispute.
4. Wbrat other action has the Minister of
Labour, or officer of bis department, taken In
regard ta the matters?
5. Wben was the Gillen Award made?
6. At wbat times did tbe Minister of Labour,
or officers of bis department visit Nova Scotia
for tbe purpose of conferring in tbe said matters?

lie said: Honourable gentlemen, my object in asking these questions is to ascertain how far the Department of Labour
has intervened for the purpose of bringing
about a settlement of these labour difficulties, which have assumed very alarming
proportions.
These difficulties have existed for a considerable time. In IJecember last there
was an agreement, called the Montreal

agreement, made between the workingmen
and the management of the Dominion Coal
and Steel Company in regard to mages.
That agreement apparently was not satisfactory ta the campany, and I do not know
that it was very satisfactory to the men.
At ahl events, disputes arase out of it, with
the result that a Board of Conciliation was
constituted in the latter part of December, I
think; but the company refused to be a
party ta that Board, with the result that
the Departinent of Labour was called upan
ta appoint two of the arbitrators, the mine
workers appainting the thjird. A gentleman
of the name <0f Gillen, 1 believe from
Toronto, was the chairman of that Board of
Arbitration. The Board sat in Halifax
during January, and made an award. Mr.
Gillen and the other gentleman appointed
by the Department of Labour, Col. Thompson, agreed upan certain reductions of
wages. The gentleman who was appainted
by the mine workers differed with them in
regard ta the reductions, claiming that what
they proposed was entirely too great.
I» might mention, however, in passing,
that the three arbitrators unanimously
agreed upon a statement, which I think has
some significance as far as Nova Scatia and
the cast of coal âin that province are concerned. After having had an opportunity
ofe examining the cast-sheets of the company
-these were flot praduced at the arbitration
for the examination of the mine workers
representative, but were shown ta the arbitrators privately-the three arbitrators
agreed in the statement that there was too
much spread between the cost of production
and the cost ta the consumer of the coal
which the company was placing upon the
market. In plain language, as I understand
that, and as a good many other people in
Nova Scotia understand it, it ineans that
the campany is taking tao much profit; and
at the sanie tume, they are seeking ta make
very drastic reductions in the pay of the
mnen who work in the mines.
1 may further say that there is a genera]
opinlian, and 1 think it exists among the
miners themselves, who are of a reasanable
state of mmnd, that there should be same
reduction in wages. On the other band.
it is very questionable whether the majarity
of the Board of Arbitrators, particularl>
under the circumstances which I have just
mentioned, did not go taa far. I have had
a good many years experience among-the
miïne workers of Nova Scotia, and I want
ta say that generally speaking, they are a
body of mien of more than ordinary intelligence. After having had some twenty or
twenty-five years direct connection with

SENATE

52

them in political life, I want to say for them
that, while there may be and undoubtedly
are at the present time extreme men in
some of the higher places, the great body
of the mine workers of the province are
responsible and intelligent citizens.
After the Gillen award was made the
matter went back to the men, and as is
their practice, a vote was taken, and the
award was overwhelmingly rejected by the
miners. Then further negotiations, I tbink,
took place between the representative of
the Provincial Government and the miners,
and citizens generally in the eastern part of
the province, who were deeply interested
endeavoured as best they could to bring
about a settlement. It looked for a while
as though there was going to ýbe a general
strike which would involve some 10,000 or
12,000 workingmen, and which would have
tàed up absolutely the industries of the
province, and would have prevented the
Provincial Government from receiving a
very substantial revenue;-because, as I
have no doubt honourable gentlemen know,
a very substantial part of the revenue of
the province of Nova Scotia is derived fron
royalties. So I do not need to say a word
to impress upon the Government and the
honourable members of this House the very
great importance of bringing about a speedy
settlement of the difficulties.
The mine workers' executive met in
Truro after the Gillen award was made,
and they were invited to Montreal by the
representative of the company. Some of
them went up, and they came to an understanding which it was hoped would be
agreeable to the mine workers. But that
second Montreal arrangement was recently
referred to the men, and their vote was
again overwhelmingly against a settlement on the lines proposed.
I am not going to attempt to absolve
the extreme leaders of the men for things
they have done nor to make any excuse
for them, because with some of them I
have no sympathy whatever. At the same
time, I do not want to be understood as
exonerating the company, because my information, which I believe to be well
founded, is that for a very considerable
time before the British Empire Steel Corporation was organized, as well as since,
the management of the companies composing it has been anything but politic in dealing with the men. My information is that
they have contributed very largely to the
crisis which is now confronting the people
of Nova Sceotia. So I think it is a safe
basis to start from that there are faults
upon both sides.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Now, honourable gentlemen, there is occupying a very high position in public
affairs in Canada at the present time a
gentleman who, I understand, holds to the
principle, and it is probably a very sound
principle, that there are more people interested in these labour disputes than the
men and the management and the capitalists. As I understand it, he lays down the
principle that the community is also interested.
That capital, labour, managment, and the community are all interested is a doctrine vhich the Prime Minister of the country lays down. Therefore
it is that I am inquiring, on behalf of the
community of Nova Sceotia, as well as on
behalf of the men and of those who have
capital invested down there, what the Minister of Labour and his Department have
been doing to bring about a settlement of
these very important matters. I understand, of course, that the honourable gentleman is new to his office, and I suppose
it •is only fair to allow him some consideration. But, nevertheless, when such
vital questions are outstanding, and such
great interests are at stake. I would have
expected that the Minister of Labour, instead of travelling out to the Pacific coast
to take part in an election, would have
travelled down to the eastern part of Nova
Scotia in order to endeavour to bring about
peace in this very serious labour difficulty.
The duty which the honourable gentleman
performed on the Pacific coast was very
dear to his heart, and in a sense I do not
begrudge him the pleasure.
Under other
circumstances I certainly should not.
But
I observe that after performing his duty
there, as he saw it, he came to the province
of Ontario, and, while these vital questions
were pending in the industrial centres of
Nova Sceotia, he stopped off at some point
or points in Ontario to address political
meetings.
I should have expected that
the Minister of Labour, if he took his duty
as minister to heart, would have been hastening eastward, as I suggested a moment
ago, to endeavour to bring about peace.
I
observe that in the Toronto Globe he discussed the urgency of practical, cohesive
effort and co-operation, and the great necessity of grappling with the questions
whidh are confronting the Çovernment.
From what I have observed of the honourable gentleman since he has entered upon
the important duties of Minister of Labour,
as well as for some time before, 'he has been
very free to give advice and at times very
free to criticise.
He seems to have been
desirous of getting into the limelight by
making speeches.
Early in his career as

unfair to him under the circuTnitances; but
I do want to urge upon him and upon, the
Government the very great importance of
endeavouring to the utmost of their power
té bring about a sttilement of these grave
questions in tbe island of Cape Breton.
It appears-if I may be allowed to refer
to another aspect of this matter-that, after coming back to Ottawa, the honourable
Minister of Labour leaTned that; a document
bad been issued by an old-time friend of
his, a colleague in labour matters, a gentleman with wbom bie had coilaborated on

for the time being Mr. McLachlan is receiving considerable support.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Does the hofiourable member know if the miners have foilowed the advice whicb was given them
to limit production in order to attain their
object?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I cannot tell my
honourable friend witb certainty, but I

53

believe that tbe proposai received a good
deal of sympatby in the way of discussion. Whetber the employees bave actually entered upon the operation or not; I
arn really unable to say at bis moment.
1 was going to say that the Minister
of Labour, ohserving this document, at
once entered into a telegraphic duel with
Mr. McLacblan. I arn at a loss to understand why the Minister of Labour did
not go down to Cape Breton. Surely this
was a matter of sufficient importance to
demand bis presence, or at ieast the presence of some of bis leading officiais. An
election of a member of the Government
out at the Pacifle coast was of sufficient
importance to caîl hirn ahl the way across
the continent. Surely, then, wben ten
tbousand men and their families were
threatened with stoppage of work, with
tbe coal mines of Nova Scotia tied up
and the Government of tbat province prevented from receiving its revenue-surely
ail these things were of sufficient importance to have caiied the Minister down
to that part of Canada. Apparentiy hie

paragraph of it, for it is rather interesting in connection with what I want té
say. Tbe telegram is a iengthy one. The
Minister might have travelied. down to
Cape Breton at Iess expense, I fancy, than

tbe Minister said:

Witb that sentiment 1 amn in entire

But is Mr. MeLachlan in
agreement? Without reading the whole of
Mr. McLachlan's statement, I want to give
honourable gentlemen the substance of
wbat Mr. McLachlan said in reply to the
Minister of Labour. This la a telegram,
too. Mr. MeLachlan also seems to be weli
supplied with funds té pay for such
lengtby wires:

SENATE

I have preached it to individuals-

That is the doctrine referred to-to
tens, to hundreds, and to thousands.
I
I have done it on land and on sea, in miners'
halls and in churches, on the hillsides of Nova
Scotia, and on her busy streets; and, Mister
Minister, what are you going to do about it?
I shall do it again this week, knowing that a
miner has a perfect right to work with his coat
on if he wants to. But what kind of innocent
or hypocrite are you? Did you not, one year
ago, call a strike of the trainmen employed at
the iSydney steel works owned by the British
Empire Steel 'Corporation? And did you not
circularize the trainmen on the Sydney end of
the Government railway to institute a blockade
on all Steel Company products, and tell the
trainmen to leave the cars with Steel Company
goods in the sidings in the woods where there
were no telegraph offices? And you made no exception to perishable goods. That was "sabotage" from top to bottom, from start to finish.

That is the response which Mr. McLachlan made to the Minister of Labour,
and in view of that I must confess that
I get a glimpse into the reason why the
Minister was not anxious to go to Cape
Breton. He remembered that Mr. McLachlan remembered that in 1920, in
November, this Minister of Labour, Mr.
James Murdock, went down to Cape
Breton, organized the railway trainmen of the Dominion Steel Company,
stayed right on the ground to see the
strike through, stayed there till about
Christmas week, and induced the four
heads of the big National railway organizations to issue a statement, which I have
under my hand, commanding every railway man in the division to practise sabotage on the work-when any goods were
coming out from the steel company, to
sidetrack them; when any goods were
coming into the steel company to sidetrack them. That was the order the honourable the Minister of Labour, before he
became Minister, caused to be put into
effect; and it is in effect to-day, because,
honourable gentlemen, the strike which
the honourable Minister of Labour organized in November, 1920, has not been
settled to this day, and, so far as I know,
the order for sabotage on the National
railways which he instituted, or caused to
be instituted, stands to-day as it did in
December, 1920. That is the situation
which confronts the honourable the Minister of Labour. The strike took place on
the 23rd of November. On the 23rd of
December the four big heads of the National railways sent a notice to General
Manager Kingsland, of the Canadian National Railway. It recites circumstances
affecting the trainmen and the Dominion
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Steel Company and the Nova Scotia Steel
and Coal Company, and then comes down
to this formal advice:
We therefore advise you that, after serious
considieration of the entire situation, it bas been
decided by us to instruct the men we represent on the Canadian National Railways Lines
east, effective December 28th, 1920, to absolutely
refuse to handle any material or cars, to or from
the property of the above-mentioned companies
until such time as these companies will agree
to submit the questions involved to arbitration
for final settlement.

Honourable gentlemen, if there are extremists, and there undoubtedly are, at the
present time taking part in the impending
strike between the companies and the mine
workers, I want to say that there is a
very large measure of responsibility for
that situation upon the present Minister
of Labour.

He

is one of the men who

educated those workers in Cape Breton
into that state of mind, when in 1920 he
went down to Cape Breton and set up
that strike and then the blockade upon the
railway. He need not be surprised if his
disciples who helped him in that work are
to-day taking his counsel and emulating his
example.
I want to say further that in my opinion
the Minister of Labour is largely to blame
for allowing this matter to drift.into the
critical stage in which it is to-day. If
that honourable gentleman were alive to
his responsibilities and his duties, be would
have gone right into the island of Cape
Breton among those men, among his old
confreres. Surely he would have had some
influence with the men with whom he
formerly collaborated, and, by taking this
riatter in hand at an early date, by grappling with the question, as be himself says,
in a practical way, would have been able,
I would hope and expect, to obviate the
great difficulties which have occurred. At
any rate, the Minister of Labour should
have some knowledge, if he bas any common sense at all, of the mentality of those

men in Cape Breton.
to them.

He bas been close

He ate and slept with them in

the old days. Therefore he must understand them, and should have gone down
to them instead of seeking to spread himself in the newspapers by engaging in this
telegraphic duel for the mere purpose, as
I understand, of satisfying his cupidity for
publicity-for that seems to be the great
desire which moves him at all times. If
the honourable gentleman had any common sense be would have kcnown that the
exchange of telegrams would inevitably stir

up worse blood in Cape Breton rather than
remove the difficulty. With any common

MARCH 29, 1922
sense at all, knowing those workmen in
Cape Breton as the honourable gentleman
ought to know them, or knowing them as
I know them, he would understand that
the sending of such wires as those the Minister of Labour sent to Cape Breton would
only pour paraffine oil upon the fire. That
is shown by the response the honourable
gentleman has received. There is the response from Mr. MeLachlan: "What are
you going to do about it, Mr. Minister?"
he says. "You are as bad as I am-what
are you going to do about it?" What reply
can the honourable Minister of Labour have
to that statement.
Hon. Mr. MARTIN: Does he reply to it?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: He has not replied
at all, for the 'simple reason that his own
order of sabotage upon the railways is set
down side by side with McLachlan's order
The

chickens have come to roost-that is all
there is about it. I want to be fair to
the honourable gentleman. I do not want
to say unkind things about him so soon
after his assuming the position; but, from
what I have observed of his career, both
before his entering this Government and
since, I am forced to the conclusion that
the honourable gentleman is more concerned about being heard from the housetops than about doing practical things in
the interests of the public.
Some of the gentlemen, the mayors of
the towns in the mining districts, who are
here interceding with the Government, and
who, I understand, had an interview with
the Prime Minister the other day, also
put themselves on record as resenting the
attitude which the Minister of Labour had
adopted towards the men of Cape Breton.
I am referring to what one of them said
-Mayor Morrison, of a very large town,
as it is called, which as a matter of fact
is a city-this was published on the 23rd
of this month. He said:
Long ago, the miners of Nova Scotia began
requesting Intervention by both the local and

of Labour. The first lecture drew a fitting reply

think it good policy to call the miners of this
province un-British, un-Canadian and cowardly
but he may be assured that their record for
personal and moral courage will compare favourably with his own.
"We are going to Ottawa," Mayor Morrison
added, "because we feel that the time bas
arrived when all the authority of both the local
and Federal Governments should be addressed
to this question. We have had enough of backand-filling. We want some effective action."

55

That is the attitude of independent men
like the Mayor of Glace Bay. It indicates
how ill-advised on the one hand was the
want of action, and on the other hand,
the action of the Minister of Labour, in
sending these telegrams, with which in a
sense we may all agree as an assertion of
principle, but which he should never have
sent if he had, as I would suppose he
would have an understanding of the mentality of the men whom he was addressing.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I have no
wish to prolong this matter any further. I
simply wished to place the situation as I
see it before the Government and before
this House, hoping that the leader in this
House will be able to give us an assurance that some practical action is to be
taken to bring about a settlement of this
very serious affair.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the honourable gentleman sits down, may I ask
if the company did appoint any of the
arbitrators?
Hon Mr. TANNER: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: By whom were
the arbitrators appointed?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The law, as I understand it, is that when the company refuses
to appoint an arbitrator the Department of
Labour appoints one on behalf of the company. The company in this case refused
to become a party to the proceedings by
appointing an arbitrator; consequently the
department appointed two and the miners'
organization appointed the third.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Did the company
accept the award in which they had no
part?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The company appeared before the arbitrators, and I think
were quite willing to accept the award, because a very considerable reduction was
made.
ROBERTSON: HonHon. GIDEON
ourable gentlemen, I rise not to join in the
criticism of any Minister of the Crown,
but because I happened to occupy the responsible position of Minister of Labour at
the time this trouble started, and therefore I feel that maybe I can say a few
words which will throw some light upon
the situation, and which I hope may tend
in some respect to assist in pointing towards a solution of the trouble.
The difficulty between the employers and
the employees in the mining industry in the
province of Nova Scotia is one of long

SENATE
standing, and one which cannot, in my humble opinion, be solved in a day.
I firlst became familiar with it four years ago.
In
January, 1917, there were lying in the harbour at Halifax ships loaded with munitions of war and foodstuffs for our armies
overseas, and there was no coal by which
they could have been propelled with those
munitions and foodstuffs to their destination.
Sir Robert Borden, then Prime Minister of Canada, called upon the owners
of these coal properties in Nova Scotia to
facilitate and increase the production of
coal in order that Canada's part in the war
might more successfully be carried to a
conclusion.
It so happened that within
three weeks of the 1917 election this matter
was under consideration, and while I was
not Minister of Labour at that time I was
by the grace of the government of that day
a member of that government, and was
called in consultation with regard to the
matter.
It was determined that steps
must be taken to produce coal, and the
Prime Minister undertook to find out what
the trouble was.
It was represented to
him:by a high official of the employing company, who was then but is not now connected with the company, that the difficulty
was that the men were-not as my honourable friend has put it, indulging in sabotage, but were not producing the coal.
I
do not agree with his interpretation of that
word.
However, I will deal with that
later.
Figures were produced to show that in
1914 so many men produced so much coal
a day, whereas in 1917 so many men were
engaged and a lesser amount of coal was
produced, proving mathematically that the
quantity of coal produced per day per man
had been reduced from 1914 to 1917. That
appeared to the Prime Minister of that
day and to some of his colleague-s to be
proof positive that the men's production
had been decreased; but whether or not it
was wilful or intentional could not be determined.
A few minutes' analysis of the
figures, however, proved exactly the contrary to be the fact.
What happened between 1914 and 1917?
Honourable gentlemen in this Hou'se, especially those from
the Maritime Provinces, know that within
twenty-four 'hours after the declaration of
war between Britain and Germany had
reached this country, more than 2,000 of the
men employed in the mines of Nova Scotia
came out of the mines and threw down their
shovels and started for Valcartier. Their
friends and relatives who were left behind
continued to mine coal and continued to
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

support the dependents of those who had
gone.
In 1917 there were more men employed above ground by these coal companies than there were in 1914; but there
was a su'bstantially smaller number engaged in the actual mining of the coal
below ground; and that number, when divided into the number of tons produced,
showed one-fifth of a ton per day per man
of an increase from 1914 to 1917.
Therefore the Prime Minister of that day dealt
with the matter upon that information, and
proved to the Administration, from the
figures of the employers, that some investigation was justified.
Within two weeks a
visit had been made to Glace Bay and
Sydney by a member of the Government,
who met the company and the men; and
subsequently they met again in Montreal,
with the result that an adjustment was
made with which the men were satisfied, or
pretty well satisfied, and under which the
employers were able to get labour by reason
of the improved conditions offered.
Labour was at a premium in 1917. The
wages offered elsewhere were superior and
the conditions much more pleasant than
those in the mines.
That is the explana..
tion why coal was not being produced.
The cost of living had rapidly risen
from 1919 to 1920.
And just in passing
let me say a word in connection with that,
if my honourable friend the leader of the
Government does not think I am digi-essing too far. From the time the war broke
out until 1919 there was in existence in
this country a Food Board under the Department of Agriculture, and a Cost of Living Commission under the direction of the
Department of Labour. The cost of living
rose slowly-less rapidly than it did in any
other country engaged in the war. In 1919
conditions were changed by legislation
known as the Board of Commerce Act, and
during that year the cost of living advanced
more than 300 per cent above the advance
in any preceding year. It was during the
year 1919 that these men in Nova Scotia
had to submit to these conditions that were
so onerous.

In 1920, as a result of the situation
which existed, they came back to their
employers and wanted further consideration.
There were, I think 17 coal companies involved. The men applied to the Department
of Labour under the Industrial Disputes
Act to get an adjustment with their employers. The Department could not very
well establish a Board unless the companies
agreed upon one man to represent them.
They failed to agree, and it was thought
that the best way out was to establish a

MARCH 29. 1922
Royal Commission. That course was followed, and a Commission appointed by the
Government went to Nova Scotia, went to
the mines, talked with the men and heard
what they had to say, and heard what the
employers had to say, and after spending
several weeks at the task sat down and
made a finding which, as sometimes occurs
was flot wholly satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would the honourable gentleman tell us what the finding
was?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not knowing
that this discussion was going to take place,
I may say that 1 have not; any facts or
figures before me. Ail 1 can say is that
the report, as I recali it, was unanimous,
that in some respects it was satisfactory to
both the employers and the men, and in some
respects was satisfactory to neither.
Subsequent to, the filing of the report
the Department did not; cease its efforts
to bring about an adjustment, as appears
to have been done in this recent case, and it
did not; send telegrams telling the men
they were unpatriotic and disloyal. It
brought the parties together at Montreal,
and the Assistant Deputy Minister of
Labour went to Montreal and met theni
and succeeded in ,bringing about the
Montreal agreement, which was in effect
fromn Octoher 1920 to, the end of December 1921. That brings us up to the present
situation.
On the Slst of December 1921 the Montreal agreement expired. Prior to that time
steps were taken to ascertain the attitude
of both parties with 'reference to a working agreement after the Tht of January
1922. The workmen were interested, and
endeavoured to find ont what was going
to happen. The employers informed them
that a wage reduction must occur, and
notice of such intention was given. The

citizens, the miners, through their organization, made application to the Department
of Labour for the establishment of a Board
of Conciliation under the Industrial Disputes Act, and the Board was established.
My honourable friend from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) may be correct, but, if my
memory serves me, the employing company
named Colonel Thompson of Halifax as
their representative on the Board. They
may not have appointed him ofllcially but
I feel sure that he was appointed, and that
if the Department appointed him it was
with the consent of the employers.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: 1 do not think so.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The workmen

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Strike on the job.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
He said,

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What does that
mean?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That may have
meant what my honourable friend has in
mind; but there was nothing illegal about
it. No law or no contract was violated by
the making of any suc'h statement.
A year ago another strike occurred down
there in which the present Minister of
Labour was involved in another capacity.
The 12,000 miners employed in Nova Scotia
are dependent to a very large extent upon
the stores of the employing companies for
the goods they purchase and the food they
cat; and I can well imagine that when their
food and goods were set off on side tracks
in the woods where there was no telegraph
office, presumably for the purpose of losing
them, and when those people were per'haps
short of necessaries of life-and when any
of the goods were destroyed in transit by
reason of delay, probably prices were raised
and the men paid through the nose-those
I2,000 miners did not feel altogether kindly
towards the man who played them the
trick. I am not going into the trouble
of a year ago, however, because I do not
vish unnecessarily to raise any controversy with the Department; but in my
humble opinion that should not have
occurred then; and in my humble opinion
sabotage tactics, or lying down on the job,
as it is sometimes called, is not going to
help any.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could not the
honourable gentleman tell us what the
action of the Department was a year ago?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It did not interfere; it was none of its business. When
the Minister of Labour said to Mr. McLachlan, " You are un-British, un-Canadian,
and cowardly," when Mr. McLachlan had
broken no agreement and violated no law,
I say the minister interfered and did something that was none of his business.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But is it not
the business of the Minister of Labour to
reproach a labour leader for giving advice
to labourers generally to work with their
coats on-to loaf on the job?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Minister
may have felt it within his prerogative to
give advice, but J submit that he has no
prerogative to say to a man that he is
unpatriotic and cowardly unless that man
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

has done something in violation of the law
of the land.
Now, honourable gentlemen, all this discussion will serve no good purpose unless
we have something constructive, looking
to the future, which may help to find a
way out of the difficulties.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is that?
That is what would be interesting.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I understand
that a delegation of gentlemen representing
the different communities in Nova Scotia
came here during the last couple of days
for the purpose of interviewing the Government on this subject, and, while I do
not know the details of what occurred at
their conference, I understand from press
reports that not much satisfaction has thus
far been accorded them, but that the suggestion has been thrown out that it might
be possible to reconvene the Board of
Conciliation that made a recommendation
a few months ago. The request presented
by those gentlemen from the Maritime Provinces on behalf of their communities was
that a new and independent Commission
should be constituted under the Inquiries
Act without delay, for the purpose of making a free and full enquiry on the ground
into the whole matter. I would respectfully recommend to the honourable leader
of the Government in this House that it
is far wiser to look with favour upon that request and to grant it rather
than to attempt to reconvene a defunct
Board. In the first place I do not think
the Board could be reconvened, because
it bas ceased to exist. Its functions were
completely fulfilled and there is now no
Board in existence. If I had been a member of that Board and the Minister said,
"Go back and do the work over again,"
I would most assuredly hesitate about swallowing the recommendation that I made
two months before. I do not think it is
fair to either the employers or the men,
nor is it fair to the members of the Board,
for the Government even to suggest the
reorganization of the same Board to deal
with the same dispute. I therefore hope
that the Government will lend a sympathetic ear to the suggestion made by the
delegation, representing not the miners, but
the people of those communities, who are
vitally interested in what may occur if this
thing is not settled. I hark back to 1909,
when there was a serious strike down there
which lasted all winter. Men were evicted
from their homes, and men were ishot
in the streets. Whose fault it was, I cannot say. Great suffering occurred at that

MARCH 29, 1922

want to say that that gentleman at the

in a veiled manner, intimating stili that
it was a fact. Mr. iMeLachian came back
with a reply which the Minister did flot

that reply Mr. bILachlan pointed pout
that it was flot the Federal Government

anything to do with it; it was another
Government, and no responsibility in that

it is only fair and due to the late Government that the facts should be publicly

Hon. RAOUL DAN DURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I thought that rny duty
would be to answer a certain numnber of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

All right.

Hon. JOHN McCORMICK: Being a new
member of this House, I had intended not
to speak thus early on any subject, but
rather to wait a while.
However, this
matter is of great importance not only to
the twelve thousand miners who are emplayed in the mines of Nova Scotia, but
to the five hundred thousand people who
live in that province, and to the people of
Eastern Canada generally.
I am glad to
know that the advice offered by McLachlan,
an extrene radical, to strike on the job, has
not been acted on by the miners of Nova
Scotia.
While I do not agree with the
attitude that that man takes on a great
many labour matters in Nova Scotia, yet I
recognize that he has great support from
the mining population there. The source
of his strength in this matter, I believe, lies
in his public statement that in the organization of the British Empire Steel Corporation, there was included not only the capital involved in the constituent companies,
but also nineteen million dollars of watered
stock.
Now, the sum of nineteen million
dollars on which a dividend is expected to be
declared is a very important factor in any
industry in this country. I can remember
the time, and it is not so very long ago,
lion. Mr. TANNER.

when the earnings from all the mines of
Nova Scotia were 'less than what are expected to be the earnings on nineteen millions of capital in this company.
The
matter is one that I think should be inquired into.
The steel works at New
Glasgow are idle.
The steel works at
Sydney Mines have been idle a year last
November.
The shipbuilding plant at
Halifax, and works of that kind, are not
producing, and they are likely to be nonproductive for an indefinite time to come.
Under these circumstances,
when
the
miners are told that they have to work to
produce the dividends not only on the
capital of the companies incorporated in
this new concern, but aiso on $19,000,000
of watered stock, that statement is one
cause of the unrest and dissatisfaction and
one reason why it is not easy to settle this
question, which, as I have said, concerns
not only the 12,000 employees, but also
the 500,000 people in the province of Nova
Scotia.
It is stated that the labour cost in connection with the mining of coal in Cape
Breton is less than three dollars a ton.
When the people are charged seven dollars
a ton, there ought in my opinion to be some
explanation. I think it is a matter that
should be inquired into. Up to this time
it has not been possible to have the matter
investigated before a Conciliation Board.
You can understand how the situation
affects the people down in the province of
Nova Scotia, where we have that great
deposit of coal. It affects the people who
want to engage in any sort of manufacture
or industry, as well as those who must use
coal to heat their homes. They are discouraged. There is a handicap on them because of the exorlitant price of coal. An
inquiry should be made for the purpose of
ascertaining whether it is not possible to
pay the men well, as they ought to be paid,
because their calling is hazardous, and at
the same time to provide a reasonable or generous return on the private capital invested.
I do not know what the powers of this
Parliament are. The Company was incorporated not here, but in the province
of Nova Scotia. However, the matter is
of such importance that, even if there is
no legislation at present, some action ought
to be taken which would bring about
an inquiry to let the people understand precisely the state of affairs.
If something is not done you will not have
peace nor a settlement that will be satisfactory to the people down there. In view
of this state of affairs I urge upon this

MARCH 29, 1922
House and upon the Government the necessity of taking steps ut as early a date as
possible to inquire into these matters; to
see whether in Nova Scotia coal is mined at
a cost of less than $3 per ton for labour
and sold to the people at $7 a ton. Why
should there be a spread of $4 a ton? That
is a very large difference betwen the cost
of production and the selling price.
This situation affects not only the matters 1 have referred to, but it concerns the
operations of the railways. In 1919 $4.30
a ton was paid for coal for the Government
railway, and last spring the price was
$6,30. If there is any truth in the statement of Mr. McLachlan, which, up to this
time has not been contradicted, that there
is $19,000,000 of watered stock in addition
to the capitalization of ail the constituents
of the British Empire Steel Corporation,
Il do not wonder that the miners are dissatislied. iIf there is any power in this.
Parliament; to prevent this company demanding from the mining population of
Nova Scotia an earning on capital that does
not exist-if there is any power to prevent this company denying coal at a reasonable price to the people of the province of
Nova Scotia, and to a large extent of
Eastern Canada, and at the same time
curtailing the operations of the railways
of this country, it should be exercised. I
would therefore urge this House to make
every effort to obtain an inquiry into the
whole question of the cost of coal.
When the inquiry was held at Halifax
the Board was told, as my honourable
friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) has
said, that the operators were prepared to
produce their costs to the gentlemen of
the Board, but that they refused the information to the men representing labour.
They said that if they did that they would
be giving away their costs to their competitors in the United States. I have no doubt
that their competitors in the United States
know to a five cent piece the cost of production of many of the mines in Nova
Scotia. This is too important a matter to
be brushed aside for any isuch reason as
that. The coal miners should be in a position to know whether or Ûot the exactions
of the company with regard to wages are
what they should be.
I saw the statement in one of the financial papers of Montreal the other day
that the ininers of Nova Scotia were receiving fancy pay. There are something
like 12,000 mnen engaged in the coal mines
of Nova Scotia; and when I tell you that
8,000 of those men are offered $3 a day,

61

including the increase proposedl by the company, and when you know that during the
winter of 1920-21, and during the summer
of 1921 th&~ mines were working only about
haif time, you wîll corne to the conclusion
that the men are flot overpaid. These men,
working down in the. mines, go to a depth
in some places of 1,500 or 2,000 feet, and
as far as 2ý and sometimes 3 miles under
the sea. They are exposed to the dangers
of gas, falling roof s, and ail that sort of
thing, and yet 8,000 of them are paid only
$8 a day. I simply mention this to correct
any mistaken opinion that may exist with
regard to the statement that they are gettîng fancy pay.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My only reason for
not reading these letters in f ull when I was
speaking a few moments ago wats that 1
did not want to detain the House any
longer. However, this is the wire f rom the
Minister of Labour to Mr. McLachlan:
My attention has been called to a despatch
appearing in to-day's Ottawa Journal, dated from
Sydney, and reading in part as follows: "The
war is on, class war." In these words of a manifesto issued to-night, J. B. McLachlan, secretary of District 26, United Mine Workers, calis
on the 12,00-0 miners of Nova Scotia to join
him in a policy of cutting the output as the
most effective method of waging a labour war
agalnst the British Empire ýSteel Corporation.
i have thought il well to brlng the above statement to your attention and ýshould be obliged
if you would let me have word immediately
if any such document as is here outlined has
1 trust the
been issued with your approval.
published statement may -prove to be without
foundation and take ihis opportunity, in any
event, of expressing the hope that yourself and
other officers and members of your organization
will cast your influence deflnitely agalnst any
such polîcy as is lndicated in the statement
above quoted.
You will, I think, on reflection agree with
me that any strength whlch organizefi labour
possesses at the present time le the resuit, not
of the underhanded and dishonest methods of
undercutting, or, as il is sometimes called, sabotage, but of stralght and honest dealinge, each
worker giving the best that is in him for the
wages agreed upon. Any union or trade practice which. ie fot in absolute agreement with
this principle will inevitably brlng disaster, and
workmen who unwisely allow themselves t0 be
misled into the adoption of such methods will
ultimately repudiate the leadership of those who
I trust I mnay recelve
have betrayed them.
from you an assurance that you are in sympathy with the view expressed in tbis message,
and, since the despatch from which I have
quoted and which has credited you with action
on contrary lunes bas received much publicity, 1
shall gladly do my best to es that any reply
receivefi from you by way of disavowal or otherwise receives equal proniinence. I am handing
this message to the press.

The reply from Mr. McLachlan to the
Minister of Labour, which Is dated March
2Oth, -1922, is as follows:

32

SENATE

Replying to your lengthy telegram of Saturday, wish to state that in manifesto issued by
me on 16th inst., neither the thing known as
"sabotage," nor the word itself, were mentioned.
Once, however, I did in that document strongly
advise the miners to cut down production to a
point where all profits for the British Empire
Steel Corporation would vanieh.
This tactic,
as a method of retaliation for a highly unjust
encroachment of the employers on the wages of
their workmen, and an invasion on an already
all too slender living, I have proclaimed openly
and in the face of day, and there is nothing
dishonest about it; you to the contrary, notI have preached this with the
withstanding.
blessing of my friends and amid the curses of
my enemies. I have preached it to individuals,
to tens, to hundreds and to thousands. I have
done it on land and on sea, in miners' halls and
in churches, on the hillsides of ýNova Scotia and
on her busy streets ; and, Mister Minister, what
are you going to do about it? I shall do it again
this week, knowing that a miner bas a perfect
right to work with his coat on if he wants
to. But what kind of innocent or hypocrite are
you? Did you not one year ago call a strike
of the trainmen employed at the Sydney Steel
works, owned by the British Empire Steel Corporation, and did you not circularize the trainmen on the Sydney end of the Government
Railway to institute a blockade on all Steel
Company products and tell the trainmen to leave
the cars with Steel Company goods in the sidings
in the woods where there were no telegraph
offices? And you made no exception to perishable goods. That was "sabotage" from top to
bottom, from start to finish.
Our method of fighting this unjust wage imposition is effective and within the law, and
the prime reason why the stock gamblers at
Montreal got you to wire a lecture to me is
this: Listen, Caledonia mine, for the week ending December 16, hoisted eight thousand five
hundred and sixty-one tons of coal, at a labour
cost of two dollars and two cents per ton. That
was before the cut in wages was made. Since
the first of the year wages have been out thirtytwo per cent.
For the week ending January
thirteen, the labour cost per ton was one dollar
and sixty-two cents. And then the miners refused to strip themselves naked to the waist
to give the best that is in them, as you put it.
Instead they cut dlown production, and for the
week ending January 27, produced two thousand
three hundred and twenty-two tons, at a labour
cost of two dollars and twenty-five cents per
ton. Add on the other overhead charges on that
miserable two thousand tons of coal, and you
may be able to guess why the hallelujah chorus
is ringing in the soul of the miners who are
actively fighting an unjust wage, and why the
stock exchange gamblers at Montreal are reduced to seek the assistance of an innocent like
you.
There is no wage agreement of any kind here.
The British Empire Steel Corporation is seeking to impose a rate as low as two dollars and
eighty-five cents per ;day, and refuses to give
men with that small wage anything like six
days per week. They are imposing these miserable wages to enable them to pay dividends on
huge blocks of watered stock and on acres of
idle junk that they call steel works.
We shall continue to fight the imposition of
this iniquitous wage reduction, if we have to
rock the ramshackle institution known as the
British Empire Steel Corporation from its rotten sills to its bending and shaking rafters.
J. B. MeLachlan.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

Now the reply of the Minister of Labour,
addressed to Mr. MeLachlan, and dated the
21st of March:
Your telegram received and handed to the
press. The written and actual record of the
action authorized by the undersigned with others
in connection with the strike of train and engine men in the steel works at Sydney in 1920
speaks for itself, and cannot be changed by any
interpretation you may care to place on such
action.
Have no doubt whatever you have
preacheid, as you say, so-called passive strike
methods for some time and will continue to do
so. In my judgment it is un,British, un-Canadian and cowardly to pretend to be working
for a wage rate in effect while declaring to
the world that only partial grudging service
will be given. [My experience bas been that
men quit like men and walk off the job when
unwilling to work for wage rates or conditions
offered. but the advice you give would place
you and those who accept such advice surely
in some other class.
Be assured that the undersigned has no brief for or personal sympathy
with certain methods adopted by the British
Empire Steel Corporation, and I regard it now,
as during the recent general election campaign,
as one of Canada's tragedies that any corporation should appear to be able to undertake to
dictate government policy or to shape the course
of public events to its own purposes.
Two
w'rongs, however, do not make one right, and
red-blooded Canadian citizens will not, in my
judgment, follow your advice in the pretence of
loyally staying on the job for the purpose of
penalizing the employer.

The message is signed "James Murdock,
Minister of Labour."
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am
giad the honourable gentleman has read
that correspondence, because I had not a
very clear recollection of the words used
by the Minister of Labour, although I had
a clear recollection that very many newspapers, representative of all shades of
opinion, had approved of the declarations
and statements of the present Minister of
I abour, more especially the statement that
it was un-Canadian and un-British to
practically cheat an employer by system&tically loafing on the job. I am quite sure
that every member of this House will approve of the sentiments contained in that
telegram.
Of course, the propriety of
corresponding with Mr. MeLachlan by telegram has been questioned; but the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Ianner) himself has said that he had no
complaint to make as to the expressions
used by the Minister of Labour in criticising
the action of MeLachlan.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What I said was
tnat I would not approve of men pretending to work and not working and drawing
pay for what they were not doing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what
the Minister of Labour said. This state-

MARCH 29, 1922
ment of the Minister of Labour referred to
the action of McLachlan, and expressed
the hope, as my honourable frîend to the
right (Hon. Mr. McCormick) has done, that
ne miner would follow that advice.
As to the conduct of plain Mr. James
Murdock in the year 1920 1 bave nothing
to say.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: And hie himself has
nothing to say.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have net; a
statement of the facts before me, and I
would leave him to the tender mercies of
the ex-Minister of Labour, who was then
in a position to apply proper chastisement
if it was deserved. He inforrns us that
he did not then intervene.
I arn not~geing into the question of the
strike itself. I had intended limiting rnyself te reading the answer which came
frorn. the Department cf Labour. I know
sornething of the difficulties that occasionally crop up between employer and ernpioyed in the ceai mines cf Nova Setia.
We are face tu face with the fact, hcwever,
that an arbitration teck place, that a judgment was rendered, that the labour element
refused te comply with that judgment and
are deing their best te, upset it by using the
v'arious means at their dispesal.
The situation is a very difficult one. The
eperators have net; enough contracts te
give empicyment te the men six days a
week. During the last fine months-and
I think rny hencurable friend the ex-Minister cf Labeur wili cerreborate me in
this-they worked about three days a week,
and for some months during the winter they
simply banked ceai. Now the cempanies
ire effering the men a lesser wage. The
nmen are striking for the maintenance cf
their wage. Wages went up periedically
during the war, and it is net; fer me te
stand between two parties and say what
the wage should now bie. The econemic
laws wîll prevail in the matter cf ceai
mining wages, as they sheuld and will prevail in the case of wages of railway ernpleyees. 1 expressed my opinion last year
-ts te the extraerdinary wage, and in some
cases, as I said, the scandaleus wage that
was being paid te the men under the
McAdoo award. I feit then, and still feel,
that that wage forced up freight rates te
an extraordinary extent, and that it is a
contributery cause ef the present depressien.
TUhis is the situatilon that now confronts
us. ýSome people think they can lift themselves by their boot-straps, but it is found
that as wages increase, so dues the cest cf

63

living.
This is 'but travelling in a vicious
circie.
How shall stabi'ity be restored
and normal conditions maintained?
That
1 arn not prepared te say. I have my own
feeling regarding the conditions as they are
to-day and what they wili be to-morrow, but
we rnay have te pass through more critical
times.
The situation as it prevails in
Nova Scotia wili develop in the United
States, for our neighbou-rs are threatened
with a formidable ceai strike.
A like situation wiii deveiop in Cana-da because of our
close labour relations with the United
States.
There may be a sirnilar menace
w-hen we corne te the readjustrnent of
raiiwaymen's wages.
However,' ail these
matters mnust be ýadjusted sorne day, and
the country may feel a considerable tremor
before we return tu normal tirnes.
The answers te the questions asked by
the honourabie gentleman frorn. Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) are as foiiow:
1. (a) On receipt cf the findings of the
Board cf Conciliation and Investigation certificated copies of the saine were forwarded
te the respective -parties te the dispute, with
the request that each party would state its
attitude to the ifindings.
(b) An officer of the Departrnent was
present at the negotiations which took place
subsequentiy at Mentreai as between officers of the employing company and officers
cf the workrnen's union, at whieh was
framed a draft working agreemnent based
largeily on the Board's findings and approved
at the conference in question 'but subject
te ratification of the union rnerbershîp.
2. The present Minister ef Labour and
the Minister cf Labour in the la-te administration and varieus offioers cf the Department cf Labour have been in communication
frorn time te tirne with both parties concerned in the dispute in question.
3. The files of the Departrnent do net disclose any recent invitation from representatives of the miners to, the Minister cf Labour or te any officer cf the Departrnent te,
visit the -part of the Province in whîch the
dispute arose, but an efficer of the Department visited the i'ocaiity and conferred there
with the parties te the dis-pute.
4. The Industrial Disputes Investigation
Act, 1907, the statute unéer which. the dispute was referred te a Board of Conciliatien and Investigation, dees net contempiate
actibn on the part of the Minister er Department of Labour l'ooking te, cornpeliing
or requiring either .party te the dispute te
accept the findings of a Board.
In view,
*however, of the importance of the present
dispute this situation bas been 'foliowed

SENATE
closely with a view to taking advantage of
any opportunity that might offer for the
protection of the public interests in so far
as this may be necessary and practicable.
Whilst the tentative agreement made at the
Montreal conference mentioned in reply to
question No. 1 was not ratified by the union
membership, the agre'ement in question is
understood to be still supported by certain
of the union officers, and it is not yet clear
that means may not be found of continuing
work and preventing the injury to the publie interests which would arise from a shutdown of the coal mining industry.
5. The text of the award in question was
received by the Registrar on January 30,
1922.
6. An officer of the Department of Labour
spent some time during February in the
affected portions of the province.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, if it is permitted to me to make a
few remarks in connection with this allimportant matter I will do so. I feel a
certain dutyThe Hon. THE SPEAKER: I call the
honourable member's attention to the fact
that after the Minister bas replied it is
not customary for any honourable member
to speak.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I bow to your ruling, Mr. Speaker.

PASSENGER TRAFFIC ON C. N. R.

1. A list of all licenses issued by the Government, now in force, for timber berths and the
right to cut timber on Crown Lands in the
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta
and .British Columbia?
2. The names and residence of the holders
of such licenses and the area contained in each
berth.
3. On what terns and conditions were such
licenses granted?
4. What'is the area and location of timber
berths in said provinces still unlicensed and
the estimated quantity and description of timber
in each berth?

The motion was agreed to.

printed but is typewritten. It is hoped
that the printed report which bas been
distributed to the members of the Ser.ate
and the House of Commons will be satisfactory and that the country will not bc
called upon to go the expense of printing
the typewritten report.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It depends on how interesting it is.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

MOTION

LISTS

WITHDRAWN

On the notice of motion:
By Hon. Mr. DAVID:
That an Order of the Senate do Issue for a
statement showing1. The approximate number of women Inscribed on the electoral lists of the different
provinces, and the approxImate number of those
who voted.
2. The comparative cost of the preparation of
electoral lise, and of the holding of the elections
in 1911, 1917 and 1921 reapectlvely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suggest to
the honourable gentleman that he should
not press bis motion. The first portion of
the motion asks "The approximate number
of women inscribed on the electoral lists
of the different provinces, and the approximate number of those who voted." The
preparation of such a statement would
entail the examination of the poll-books of
the whole of Canada, and would involve a
considerable outlay. 0f course, my honourable friend can press for the information; but if he will be patient. the electoral
officer may, be able to satisfy him by
taking a poil here and there and reaching
an approximation.
As to the second part, "the comparative
cost of the preparation of electoral lists,
and of the holding of the elections in 1911,
1917, and 1921 res-pectively," I may inform
my honourable friend that the reports for
1921 are not yet complete so as to allow of
an officiai statement such as he asks for
being issued. Perhaps, after seeing the
Electoral Officer himself, the honourable
gentleman may decide to put bis question
in another form or may renew it.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I will renew it at
another time.
The motion was withdrawn.
ADJOURNMENT 0F THE SENATE
On the motion to adjourn:
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I have been asked when the
Senate could be freed from its duties for
the customary Easter holidays, My answer
is that we have been waiting during the
whole week for an interim or provisional
Supply Bill from the Gommons, which has
not yet reached us. I trust that by tomorrow afternoon we may receive it,
because it would be advantageous to ail
that we have it before we go; but my inclination is to move that when the Senate
adjourns to-morrow it do stand adjourned
until the l9th of April. If this Bill does
S-5

65

not reach us before the adjournment tomorrow we shail be able to deal with it in
the week following Easter. I give notice
that I will move that when the Senate
adjourns to-morrow it do stand adjourned
until the l9th of April.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: If tbe 'Estimates
were passed by the House of Commons tomorrow, could we not adjourn till Saturday,
se as not to be obliged to come back next
week?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: If the Supply
Bill should be passed in the Gommons at
any time to-morrow, we could arrange to
sit to-morrow nigbt and pass the Bill and
have it sanctioned before we go.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If the interim Supply Bill does not.corne up from. the Gommons to-morrow, is it the intention te wait
until it does corne, or is it the intention to
adjoura to-morrow wbether it bas corne or
not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have just
stated that my inclination would be for
the House to adjourn to-morrow until after
E aster if the Bill does not reach this Chamber by to-morrow evening.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I understand, bonourable gentlemen, that the money will be
needed on the lSth of April. That is, tbe
supply is exhausted. Are you going to
adjoura till the l9th of April and disrupt
ail the financial arrangements of the Government for the sake of the Senate having
a long holiday? I do nlot wish to see this
Government abused.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would not
like to wrench the conscience of my honourable friend, but I would draw bis attention
to the fact that the l6th of April is Easter,
and that the 17tb, Easter Monday, is a
legal holiday. We shaîl be bere on the
l9th, or the lSth-my notice was for the
l9th, but we might revert to the l8thin due time to allow of cheques being issued
and the liabilities of the country met.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: In case the Gommons passed the Supply Bill next Monday
of Tuesday, would the Senate be beld responsible for delaying it until tbe l7th or
18th of April?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But, as I
understand, there 'will be no special need
of the Bill until after the lSth of April.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I see.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I would point out
that it is customary to pay the Civil

SENATE

Servants on the lSth, and, as there are a
few holidays about that time, a great many
Civil Servants will be disappointed in not
getting their pay for the month, and will
probably flot be able to make any trips
they had intended.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY:
hats.

Or buy Easter

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It seems to me
that to keep thenm waiting four or five days
longer is somewhat of a hardship.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would ask the
honourable leader of the' House whether,
if the Supply Bill is passed by the Commons to-morrowv, this honourable body is
to have no time at all to consider it? Are
we to pass it and adjourn the saine day?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. When
the Senate receives the Supply Bill it can
proceed with it froni day to day to its full
satisfaction.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow

date until the 1919 Seed Grain Act was
passed the rate of interest remained unchanged. On advances since 1919 the rate
of interest is 7 per cent.

Advances made under the 1919 Seed Grain
Act are made through the chartered banks

SENATE
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, while we in this Chamber
recognize that it is peculiarly the function
of the House of Commons to vote supplies
for the carrying on of His Majesty's Government, yet it has fnot been unusual for
this Chamber to reserve to itself the right
to criticise Supply Bills.
I am sure my honourable friend opposite who has charge of the Bill would
be disappointed if this Bill passed the
Chamber on the present occasion in silence.
This Supply Bill, probably more than, any
other, bas been peculiarly associated with
features which have come under the attention of both H-ouses of Parliament and of
I have no desire to
the public generally.
enter upon any discussion on what might
be termed parliamentary ethics, so far as
the treatment of such Bills is concerned,
but the attitude of those related politically
with my honourable friend, in respect to
interim Supply Bills, has been, to say the
I recaA that about two
least, interesting.
years ago, when the l'ate 'Government submitted to Parliament an interim Supply
Bill, it met wit.h very emphatic opposition
in another place, because of the principle
involved of asking Parliament to pass supplies en bloc, without an opportunity being
given Parliament to discuss the details of
the BilA.
On that occasion, I remember,
the leader of the Opposition, the present
Prime Minister, ventured to say in effect
that it would be only over his dead body
and those of his followerls that the Bill
However, no tragedy
would be passed.
of the kind was at that time enacted, so
far as the gallant leader and his merry men
were concerned.
Our adoption of more
peaceable methods in the passage of the
Bill averted such a tragedy, and accordingly
they were spared to discharge in a larger
sphere other duties than that of sacrificing
themselves to prevent the passage of an
interim Suppily Bill.
During the last Session of Parliament
similar obstruction met the submission -of
the Supply Bill by the Government, and
that Bill, for a month or six weeks, remained in the cockpit of Committee, and
was attacked most vigorously, until finally
the Government had to use more persuasive
tactics in order to give finality to the
measure.
My honourable friends had
scarcely warmed their seats in Parliament before they submitted an InHon. Mr. BOLDUC.

terim Supply Bill.
It was presented
to Parliament last week, and on twentyfour hours' notice Parliament was asked
to vote the supplies embodied within
its four corners. I might point out, in
pleasing contrast with the obstruction
which was offered to former Supply Bills,
presented by the late Government, Parliament bas on this occasion assented to
the present Bill within a week or very
little longer. Now, there is such a thing
in parliamentary life as consistency. It
may be an old-fashioned virtue, yet it seems
to me it is one of the most valuable assets
that either Parliament or public men constituting Parliament can possess; and when
consistency is trampled upon for the sake
of party expediency, it seems to me that
it would not be out of place to point out
the desirability of maintaining something
like consistency in dealing with subjects
such as the one now under consideration.
The Main Estimates amount to $466,983,359. When this Bill was introduced it
was placed upon the Table of Parliament
in silence. No remarks were made in explanation of its contents. We were surprised on the following morning to observe
in the press that the present Government had reduced last year's Estimates by
no less a sum than $136,000,000. A pæan
of praise of the Government at once went
up from the press in fact, a hallelujah
chorus was sung throughout the whole Dominion, and the genius of the present
Finance Minister was very much enlarged
upon for his having effected this marvellous reduction in so short a time. The
next morning, I must say, the press of the
Dominion seemed rather to have reconsidered the pronouncements they had made
on the preceding day as to the amounts
saved to the country. In the meantime
no explanation was made by the Government as to how its marvellous reduction
had taken place. The Government. with
a maidenly modesty, which was really delightful to behold, accepted the tribute of
praise as a tribute to which it was entitled.
It is quite apparent, and I fancy that
every honourable gentleman in the Chamber
is familiar with the fact, that, instead of
a reduction having been made from the
amount of the Main Estimates of last Session, the present Supply Bill, when analyzed
correctly, means that a very much larger
expenditure will be made than was provided by the Supply Bill of that time. Up
to the 20th of March the expenditure arising out of the entire Supply Bill of the
Session of 1921-22, including a guarantee
for $50,000,000 payable in connection with

APRIL 5, 1922
railways, amounted to only $422,889,000,
whereas upon making a close anahysis of
the present Supply Bill, we find items ehiniinated that appeared in the last Bill which
would reduce the Main Estimates of hast
year's Governinent by $124,339,346aniounts which were absolutely unrelated
to economy; amounts whieh liad been voted
]ast year and were ineseapable and obligatory, growing out of the war, and which
would not have to be renewed.
Take, for instance, the railway vote,
which was reduced by $82,617,000; soldier
settiement, $23,017,000; shipbuilding, $8,330,000; interest on publie debt, $2,229,393; soldiers' civil re-establishnient, $4,956,500; housing, $2,449,920; and the votes on
behaif of the Canada Temperance Act,
and for the memorial war graves, amounting in round figures to about $1,000,000.
Had the late Governient reniained in
office, these items would have been eliminated from the Supphy Bill for the present year. Hence we find that, instead of
a reduction of $136,000,000 having been
made, as was chaimied by the press favourable to niy honourable friends, there is an
increase in the Estimates by at heast $10,000,000; and, furthermore, in comparison
with hast year's Estimates there would
be an increase by $50,000,000 if expenditure
is carried out according to the lines of
the present .Supply Bill.
Notwithstanding the pledges of retrenchment and economy given by the present
Governient during the hate election, we find
that no such atteîpt is made. 1 am not
hyperenitical of the course pursued by the
present Governient on the question of retrenchient, because they have been in
office onhy since the beginning of the year,
and I quite freely admit'that; a full opportunity has not been given them up to the
present tume to make a close investigation
into ail branches of expenditures with a
view to reducing the Estimates. At the
saine tume, honourable gentlemen, there
should be soie evidence on the face of the
Supphy Bill, as we have it before us, to
show a desire on the part of the Government to practise econoîy and retrenchnient. But that evidence I do not find.
On the contrary, I find evidence of a desire not only to vote but to expend larger
suis than were expended during the abnormal tumes through which we happily have
passed so successfully. I need scareelý
point out that a new Governient is in a
pecuhiar position to practise econoiy, to
enter upon a new regime of expenditure
that will be characterized by thrift and
retrenchnient. A Government approaching

a general election, as the late Government
did, would naturally be called upon to make
expenditures, where a succeeding Governnment would not; be called upon to do so.
It would be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tempted.
It is the saine
Hon. Mr. CLORAN:
thing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
should flot yield to such temptation. However, that would be an unimportant; matter
to my honourable friend. Sometimes there
is a certain amount of pleasure in yielding,
and 1 see evidence of that in the present
Supply Bill. However, I desire to point
out to my honourable friends, and to impress upon them during these times of reconstruction, when there is flot only a
strong desire, but a national effort to return to normal conditions, that there should
be practised by the Government such economy and retrenchment as wilh reduce the
expenditure of this country, and thus restore business and national affairs to the
footing upon which we seek to place them.
This requires courage. I need not say that
courage in a Government is probably the
eleinent most wanting. It is more difficult
almost to find courage among Ministers
than among any other class of persons.
I quite appreciate the fact that so much
pressure is brought to bear upon Ministers
and Governments to make expenditures
that it is almost irresistible; but since Confederation no other Government has ever
entered upon office with as great an opportunity of establishing a record for economy
and thrif t and national retrenchment as
the present Government, and I hope when
the ýSupply Bill of next Session is presented
to this House we may see rnanifest evidence of the desire of the Government to
reduce expenditures.
Hon. RUFUS H. POPE: Honourable
gentlemen, before we proceed with thîs
measure, I desire to eall the attention of
the representative of the Government to
the condition of the returned soldier on
the farn in Canada. I notice that in
another place they have, as usual, an Agniculturel Comîittee to deal withmnatters of
agnicultural importance. But this is away
and beyond that, and I do not think we
should wait for another day to announce
to the disappointed men on farma in
Canada the fact that we are going to corne
to their relief at an early date.
You 'will appreciate the fact that the
property they bought-not only the farm,
but the stock and the inachinery- -is to-day

72

SENATE

not worth 50 cents on the dollar compared
with what they paid for it. If a farmer
had 10 per cent to put up, he bought a
farm; that is to say, if he had $400 to
put up on a farm costing $4,000, he was
allowed to go on the farm after inspection.
The machinery and cattle were purchased
for him at the prices of that day, which
certainly were three times as great as they
are to-day. There is not a farmer, however good he may be, or in whatever part
of Canada he may be, who during the past
year bas been able to make both ends meet.
Whether he happened to be a soldier or an
old practical farmer, when all things were
paid for, nothing was left. Think of a
man who was put upon a farm under the
conditions I have just mentioned, and who
has paid only 10 per cent of the principal
and still has interest to pay on the balance, trying to make a living and meet his
payments upon the property. It is absolutely impossible for these men to carry out
their agreements. What has happened? In
my part of the country, as in other parts,
some of them have been sold out, with the
result that the farm is either in the hands
of the Government, or has been sold for
about half of what the Government paid;
and the same is true as to everything associated with it.
I beg to call the attention of the Government representatives in this House to that
fact. Why should it not be intimated at
as early a date as possible that there will
be a readjustment in these cases? If the
principle of returning men to the soil was
sound and good, surely, it is equally sound
that they should be kept there; and that
cannot be done under present conditions
if these men do not get relief. Whether
the relief should be in the form of an
extension of the time for payment or a
reduction of values, or both, it is not for
ne to say. I have not that responsibility.
We have not in the Senate a Minister with
portfolio. Since the days of Confederation
until now we have had ministers in this
chamber, and we have produced some of
the best men that ever sat around the
Cabinet table. I regret that we have not
one or two now. I think the dignity of
this honourable House is worthy of that
much confidence on the part of this wonderful Government that is now in power or
any other government that may sit after
them. I think we are entitléd to some
recognition, and if I were advising the
honourable gentleman who leads this House
with such ability-and we all know his
worth, and know that he is entitled to a
place in the Cabinet-I would tell him that
Hon. Mr. POPE.

if they had offered to nie the job he bas,
I would have told them to go and stick it
up on the wall somewhere: I would not
have taken it. In the government that has
just passed out of power we had in this
House the Minister of Soldiers Civil Reestablishment. We know the tremendous
task that was imposed upon him in dealing
with the returned soldiers and the hospitals; and I want to take this opportunity
of saying that, so far as Canada is concerned, irrespective of politics, no Minister
of that government bas received more
thanks or recognition for his services than
the honourable gentleman who leads this
side of the House. What we did then we
can do again with the material placed at
our disposal on the other side of the House.
J am sure it is a healthier condition for us
to be able to discuss matters with a fullfledged Minister of the Crown rather than
an apology for what?
I do not intend to move any resolution,
and I do not desire to take up the time of
this House; but I wish to say that the
situation I have just pointed out with regard to the returned men is of a very serious character. We are just coming to the
spring season when we begin to sow grain
and prepare for the next year; and some immediate hope should be extended te the men
who fought the fight for us, and whom we
attempted to recognize when they returned.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, as this will probably be the only
day on which we may discuss the public expenditure before the Main Estimates come
down, I wish to say only a word or two.
I think it must be admitted that the criticism of the leader of the Opposition bas
been very mild under the circumstances.
However, I quite agree with the action of
the Government in bringing before us in
the present situation this Bill, for part of
the money that is necessary to carry on the
business of the country. But, as the leader
of the Opposition has said, it comes with
rather bad grace from the men who had se
much to say about that policy a year or
two ago; but it just proves that there is
very littIe consistency in politics at any
rate.
I have not the slightest doubt that
the criticism of a year or two years ago
was for the one and only purpose of playing
politics, and not because of any real objection to voting the Estimates.
I altogether agree with what my honourable friend has said about the lack of any
evidence of economy on the present occasion.
There may be many thousands of
people throughout the country who have

APRIL 5, 1922
looked upon the present Government as being likeiy to introduce econorny, and under
the cîrcurnstances economy is absolutely
necess'ary; but if the present policy is persisted in, and there is not more evidence
of econorny wben tbe Main E-stixnates corne
up for discussion than one is at present led,
to expect, I woufld flot tbink the Governmrent
would succeed in getting a great deal of
the support that they are no doubt expecting, and that they wiil need in order to

admit, however, that they have been only a
few months in power: the Estimlates were
prepared -by their predecessors, I nnde'rstand, and I know sometbing of the diffiBut
culty of cutting down expenditures.
if we are going to make the revenue of
this, country kee'p pace with the expenditures, we bave got to do it, not by increasing
the taxation on the people, but by cutting
down unnecessary expenditures; and it can
be eut down by at least $100,000,000 witbouit any great enterprise suffering to, any
extent whatsoever. The pruning bock wili
have to be applied, and vigorously applied,
ail round. I arn not going te condemn the
Governrnent just now; but if there Is not a
great deal more evidence of economy next

be seme evidences of economy if we are to
face the future with any considerable hope
of success.
That is about aIl I want to say on that
subject at present. Just a word on the
subject raised by rny bonourabie friend
from Compton (Hon. Mr. Pope). I agree
to a certain extent witb wbat he bas said.
It would have corne better, however, from.
tbe honourable member two or three years
ago. I tbink I was probably one of the
few members wbo pointed out in this
House, as I bad pointed out in the House
of Gommons before coming bere, witb regard to the proposition of putting returned
soldiers on the land, under the auspices of
the departrnent of my bonourabie friend

record as baving made that statement both
in tbe House of Commons and bere, and
1 arn net at ail surprised that tbey are
no'w finding difficulties and are not able
to succeed. Wbat led me to tbink that
success would be impossible was the fact
tbat I have lived for many years eut in

73

the West. I arn now speaking only of the
West. The farmers down East rnay be
able to do f ar better than our farmers out
there can do. I know hundreds of cases
in which a man who had two or three
thousand dollars of his own would get a
loan of, say, a thousand dollars, and year
after year, for five, ten, or fifteen years,
hie would be unabie or would find it inconvenient to pay off that loan. ýSuch being the case, how can a man succeed who
bas only $500 of bis own and bas very
littie experience-wbo bas neyer farmed at
al], but bas taken a short course of tbree
or four months at some agricultural college? He bas obtained a loan of $4,000,
$5,000, $6,000, $7,000-up to $7,500, and
after a couple of years' exemption frorn
interest hie must pay interest on the
amount. I ask, what chance on earth bad.
He bad no
that .man to make good?
chance whatever, and I ar n ot; in tbe least
surprised that those men are not niaking
a success.
I do flot; agree witb my bonourable
friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) that
the Governrnent must corne to their rescue
and revalue the lands that bave been sold
to them. The lands bave not decreased
in value by 50 per cent. I can understand that tbe implernents and stock bave
depreciated more than 50 per cent, but flot
the land. The Governrnent is going to make
a loss of tens of millions on that scbeme.
Almost $100,000,000 bas been put into it,
and I will venture to say that in the end
the Government will flot get back from it
$35,000,000. I believe that the more rnoney
advanced by the Government now the
greater will be the loss, because under
tbe circumstances, -and tbe terns most of
those men cannot be successful. Giving
them more money will only put off tbe
evil day. There can be but one result:
the great majority of thern will certainly
fail.
There is at present a great deal of taik
about immigration, and I want just bere
to say to tbe -Government that, so far as
the tbree Prairie Provinces are concerned,
unless we bappen to bave a good crop out
there next year, and perbaps even if we do
have, tbe problern for the Governrnent will
be, not to bring immigrants into that
country, but to try to keep on tbe land
tbe men wbo are there to-day. Tbere Is
going to be an exodus frorn the land unless
sometbing is done, in the way of lower
freight rates and iower duties, to enable
tbe men on the land to make a living. I
refer now, flot to the returned soldiers who
bave received the Governnient loann, but to

74

SENATE

the settlers generally, and I maintain that
unless there is a great reduction in freight
rates and in duties, the problem will be, not
to get immigrants, but to keep our settlers
from emigrating.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, who is responsible
for that state of affairs?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I think the Liberal party was responsible for a great deal
of it; and I think the Conservative party
was responsible for a great deal of it.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: That is very
kind of the honourable gentleman. The
party which he supported was responsible
for it, and the honourable gentleman knows
it. There has been no legislation by the
present Government.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Certainly. -That
is just what iI said to the honourable gentleman a minute ago--and perhaps that
is why I left the party. There is no doubt
that both parties are responsible, and the
people of the country are also responsible.
But we have now to deal, not with what
the Liberal party did twenty or ten years
agoo, nor what the Conservative party
has done since 1911. What we have to
deal with now is the present condition of
affairs: how are we going to better that?
I say the thing for the Government to do is
to practise rigid economy, of which we
see so little evidence now, but which I hope
will be more apparent a year from now
than at present. The Government will
also have to be mighty careful about piling
another $25,000,000 or $50,000,000 on the
amount advanced to the men who are on the
land, because the men are not going to
make a success anyway, and the more
money is paid out now the bigger will be
the loss in the end.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Would the honourable
gentleman suggest that they be driven off
the farms?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Well, then, go to them
and help them.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I offered no remarks in
moving the adoption of this Bill, because
I took it for granted that the principles
underlying'the Supply Bill would be discussed when the Main Estimates came before us. Of course, I recognize that this
will be at the last hour of the Session, and
I would welcome any suggestions that might
be made, in detail rather than generally,
Hon.

Mr. TURRIFF.

in favour of a reduction of expenditure.
This is but an interim measure; we are
voting supply for two months of the twelve.
I hope that the general discussion in both
Houses may tend towards a reduction in
expenditure. The reductions that have appeared, amounting to quite a large sum,
we cannot but regard with favour. I would
like to see a large reduction of expenditure in all the departments, if possible. In
expressing that hope I am not pledging myself personally, for I have no department,
and the effort does not fall to myself. I
will not discuss the action which may have
been taken by the political parties in the
Commons in resisting demands for interim
supply. Those objections may have been
justifiable. A Session might be called in
time for passing supply before the fiscal
year is out. In the present instance the
Government was sworn in about the lst of
January. The members of the Cabinet with
portfolios had to go before their electors,
and were not back in their departments to
attend seriously to business until the end
of January; so they had hardly five or six
weeks in which to look about and see what
might be done in their various departments.
I have reason to believe that when the
House met they had hardly familiarized
themselves with the faces of their deputies
in their respective departments. The Estimates which are before us have therefore
been prepared mainly by the deputy heads.
I recognize, with my honourable friends
from Calgary (Hon. Sir James Lougheed),
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) and Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff), that the situation calls
for very great efforts towards economy.
The revenue shows signs of weakness in
many departments. We do not know what
revenue the present year will yield; we do
know what are the fixed charges upon our
debtË, upon our pensions, and upon our
railways, and I feel that it should be the
effort of the Government to reduce the expenditure to the lowest possible minimum.
My honourable friend from Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Pope) has spoken of the effect
of the policy of placing soldiers on the land.
I would rather have had the honourable
gentleman address those remarks to the
Senate before my honourable friend from
Calgary (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) rose,
because my honourable friend from Calgary
would have been in a better position to
treat the subject to the satisfaction of this
Chamber. I know that he will have occasion to do so. The policy he inaugurated
was a large one. It was a laudable effort
to try to place as many soldiers as possible

APRIL 5, 1922
on farms. The question was as to the
selection of those soldiers, and as to their
ability to make good on the land. I have
not been able to ascertain Upon what principles those selections were made. I have
no doubt that one of these days, in the
Senate, my honourable friend from Calgary
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) will have occasion to discuss in detail the policy that he
pursued while he was at the head of the
department and its results.
My honourable friend from Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Pope) has complained that there
is in this Chamber no Minister with portI would draw his attention to a

little bit of history.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Ancient.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend need not go very far back; he
need not go back farther than 1911. My
honourable friend from Calgary (Hon. Sir
James Lougheed) was Minister without
portfolio for five or six years, and perhaps
longer.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And he did very
well.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He was the
only representaitive of the Cabinet in this
Chamber.
I do not intend at this stage to elaborate
more fully my own views as to the part
which the Senate should be called upon to
play and as to how we should assure its absolute independence and fireedom from outThat we may have occaside influences.

honourable gentleman who spoke before me
in expressing the hope that next year the

be thereby substantially diminished.

EXPORTS TO FRANCE
INQUIRT

Hon. Mr. DAVID inquired of the Government:

75

Is it true that a certain class of articles exported from Canada in France are taxed two
or three times more than the same articles exported from the United States In that country
and does the Government intend to try to have
that discrimination removed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under a Ministerial decree dated the 28th of March,
1921, the French Government incneaséd its
maximum tariff to a considerable degree,
and such Canadian articles as fall under
that maximum rate are paying a higher
duty than the United States producer, that

NOTICES OF MOTION
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I would draw attention to the
rule of the Senate which calls for notices
of motions or questions being given to the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

House. It seems important that that rule
should be observed by honourable gentlemen giving the notices in such a tone that
they may be heard by the House. In the
first place, if the notice is worth anything
it is worth listening to. In the next place,
sometimes it may be in violation of a rule,
and yet the Senate does not know whether
that is the case or not if it does not hear
the notice. I make this general remark,
because it is of interest for the Senate to
know the purport of the preliminary proceedings in the form of notices of motions
or inquiries.
LEINSTER ROYAL CANADIAN REGIMENT
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
1. Has the Government received any communications in regard to the lst Battalion,
Leinster Regiment, Royal Canadians, In regard
to the disbandment of the said regiment?
2. From what persons have the communications been recelved?
3. What is the general nature of the representations which are made to the Government
in this regard?
4. What action ls the Government taking In
this matter.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1. Yes.
2. From the Officer Commanding the lst
Battalion, the Leinster Regiment, and from
the late O.C. (Lt. Col. J. D. Mather at
present residing in British Columbia).
3. Asking to be retained in British Army
as "Prince of Wales Royal Canadian Regiment," and pointing out that Canada is
the land of their origin.
4. The matter was referred to the Secretary of the War Office and the following
reply was received:
. . . I am to say that it is with very deep
regret that the Council have felt compelled to
recommend the disbandment of this corps. Such
action is rendered necessary by the Articles of
Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain
and Ireland, which contemplate the establishment of a military defence force by the Irish
Free State. In view of the present need for
economy, Involving a general reduction of the
Army, it would be impossible to substitute reformation in another form for disbandment.

REPARATION CLAIMS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT inquired:
1. What is the total amount of the claims
filed with the Government of losses incurred
during the late war and for which claims for
reparation have been macle.
2. What steps have been taken by the Government to provide for the payment of these
claims.
3. Is the Honourable Mr. Hazen still the Commissioner appointed to deal with such claims.
If not, when did he resign?
4. If the Honourable Mr. Hazen resigned bas
any one been appointed in his -place? If so, who?
5. If an appointment bas not been made does
the Government intend to appoint a Commissioner or take steps to enforce payment of said
claims?

This in itself shows that, although the
ideal was new and hitherto unattempted,
yet in the effort to realize it the nations
that stood by their first faith have been
joined by other nations; and, as a result
of two years of work, all the members
of the League stand by it and under it with
deeper conviction and greater force than
at the period of its inception. That is an
argument for us to conclude that there
must be in it a possibility capable of being
translated into a great and crowning good
to the human race.
My remarks this afternoon will be
directed to the answering of three questions. One is: What is the League of
Nations? Another is: How does it operate or function? And the third is: What
bas it accomplished in the time it has been
at work?
I have already explained to the House
what the ideal of the League of Nations is,
and how it arose out of the war and the
horrors entailed thereby. The Constitution
of the League, from which it gets its primary powers, is contained in the Covenant
of the League of Nations, consisting of 26
articles. The first article bas reference to
membership.
Then follow six articles
which have to do with the organs or functioning agencies of the League. There are
nine sections devoted to what is the primary object of the League-the prevention
of war-by the diminution of armaments,
by arbitration, by reference to Council and
Assemblies, and by a judicial court which
it was proposed to have established and
which has since been established. That is
the kernel and gist of the whole Pact, and
the whole plan involved in the Pact. After
that we have sections dealing with the
registration of treaties and with the rearrangement of treaties which have become inapplicable, or which are contrary
to the spirit and aim of the League of
Nations. Then we have sections in the
Constitution which have to do with mandatories, a new form of administering backward and conquered countries. Sections
23, 24 and 25 refer to the humanitarian
and philanthropic agencies and activities
of the League, which form a very important
part of the League's work.
Section 26 provides for the amendment
of the Covenant. For, please bear in mind
from the first, that, while the Covenant
of the League of Nations was the product
of the best thought and ripest experience
which could be bestowed upon it at that
time, it is an amendable document, open to
such changes as suggestions and experience
and altered conditions may necessitate.
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

Another point to be borne in mind is
that the League of Nations under its Constitution is no super-government. It rests
absolutely upon the assent of the nations
that belong to it. There is no coercion, no
attempt to interfere with national prerogatives or national functions. All depends upon the consent of the members of
the League.
I think that is sufficient to indicate to
the Senate what the League is.
Now, as to how it functions. Because on
paper a League may be very fine and look
very promising, but it can only attain
success in proportion as its functioning
arms and organs are sufficient and capable
to embody in practical working the ideal of
the League itself. These are simple, and
it is scarcely possible for one to understand the League in any proper way unless
he bas an idea of its organs, its manner
of functioning, and the way in which its
activities are carried out.
First, then, as fair men, I think we must
bear in mind, in making up our judgment
as to the work of the League, the fact that
it was not in operation until January 10th,
1920, when, by the ratification of the
Treaty of Peace and the proclamation of
peace, it became an entity. Then it had
one sole officer, the Secretary General,
who had been appointed by the Peace
Conference for the succeeding five years.
It had no home; it had no staff; it had no
plan of operation. Deducible from that is
the patent fact that the first part of the
work of the League of Nations, coming into
existence as it did, was to organize itself.
And if organization is a wonderfully coinplex and wonderfully important thing in
even small endeavors, what must it be with,
reference to a world of nations, fifty-one
of whom are alre, dy in the League, and
when there are others who shall come in
from time to time in the future? So, in%
asking ourselves the question what the
League of Nations bas done, and forming
our judgment on the answer, we must take
into account the fact that a large proportion of its time during the first year was
spent in organization.
Again, we must keep clear of what I
think is an error. Some people have the
idea that the League of Nations was formed
in order to bring about peace. That is not
true. The League of Nations had nothing
to do with the formation of the terms or
conditions of peace; that was a work which
was carried on by the great powers, Allied
and Associated, and to which work the
Conference in Paris had devoted itself. It

APRIL 26, 1922
was the supposition that the League should
come into operation after peace had been
made, after the terms of peace had been
signed, and after the willing assent and
accordant action of the nations who had
signed the treaties had full effect. But
everyone knoWs that after the Armistice,
for months and months, countries were in
turmoil all through Europe and in other
sections of the world; and that even up to
the present time the last Treaty of Peace
has not been ratified and is consequently
still hanging in the air. We must take that
into account when we form our judgment
as to what the League of Nations bas performed.
The organization of the League of
Nations is simple, and, as it has stood the
test of experience, turns out to be a wonderfully skilful and practical organization.
Looking at it, you will find that there are
some points in which there seems to be
overlapping of authority between its organs
of action. There are defined special duties
and there are co-ordinating duties between
its two organs. Over and above these it
bas general powers of dealing "with any
matter within the sphere of action of the
League or affecting the peace of the world."
The first organ of activity of the League
of Nations is the Council. The Council is
formed of eight members; nine were supposed to be its number at the formation
of the League of Nations. There is one
representative for each of the great powers.
That would be one for Great Britain, one
for France, one for Italy, one for Japan,
and one for the United States of America;
but the chair reserved for the United States
of America is still vacant, and consequently
up to the present time the great powers
are reDresented by four in the Council.
Then the League Assembly has the authority to select four members of the Council
who shall represent the other nations of the
League-members of the League outside of
the great powers. So that the Council has
been functioning up to the present with
eight members, made up of one for each of
the four great powers, less the United
States, and four selected by the Assembly,
who at present represent China in Asia,
Brazil in South America, and Spain and
Belgium in Europe.
The authority for action and the scope of
action of the Council is laid down in two sets
of documents--in the League of Nations Covenant itself, and in the various Treaties,
where, for the carrying out of their terms
and conditions, the supervising or directS-6

81

ing authority is conferred upon the Council
of the League of Nations. So that you
have to search the Treaties as well as the
Covenant itself to get the full powers and
obligations that are imposed upon the Council.
The Council meets from time to time as
occasion requires-sometimes in Paris,
sometimes in London, sometimes in Italy,
sometimes in Belgium; and, since headquarters have been established at Geneva
it meets there as well.
The Council can be called together in any
emergency. As a matter of fact, during the
first broken year of its existence, it met
ten times, and any one reading the reports of those ten meetings.would be somewhat astonished at the variety and importance of the business that came up for
adjudication, examination and decision;
and the uniform success which attended the
decisions and recommendations of the Council.
Before any primary matter can be disposed of by a decision it is necessary that
the Council shall be unanimous with referThat provision at first
ence thereto.
caused a deal of criticism against the
League of Nations and doubts as to its
funètioning. It was said, " That makes an
unworkable proposition, since a majority
of the representatives in the Council may be
in one direction, but one dissentient can
avail to make the Council's opinion and
conclusion nugatory." The very same criticism was made in relation to the Assembly, which is composed, as I shall afterwards explain, of representatives from all
the nations. It was objected that if in
the smaql-and yet not very small-Parliament or House of Commons of the world's
fifty-one nations you made it impossible for
any prirnary matter to be concluded without
the unanimous consent of the represented
countries, you would throw into the practical workings of the Assembly a wrench
which would render its best efforts futile.
But there was wisdom in that proposition in both cases. In the first place,
you were starting out on an unknown and
hitherto untried venture, to the success of
which were necessary the amity, the lack
of suspicion, (the full confidence of as
many nations of the world as possible-all
of them, if it were possible to get all.
But you have small nations and you have
great nations; and the small nations are as
tenacious of their national standing and
national privileges as are the large ones.
The fact that you must have unanimity
was a guarantee to the small nations that

REVISED EDITION

82

SENATE

they could not be overridden in (their
rights if it came to a question and to the
great nations that they could not be overruled by a combination of small nations.
This rule has had the test in both the
Council and the Assembly for now nearly
two years, and in no single instance has
that condition of unanimity been a bar
to the examination, the consideration, and
the conclusions arrived at by either one
or the other on any important matter.
The next great branch or organ of activity of the League is the Assembly, which
meets yearly, and is representative of all
the nations which are members of the
League. Each nation-member of the League
bas three representatives, but bas only one
vote. The three representatives sitting in
the Assembly have the privileges of expression and of examination, but when it comes
to the vote it is the nation that votes,
and not the delegation: one nation has
one vote, though it be the biggest of all;
and one nation has one vote, though it
be the smallest of any.
So that there
you have perfect equality; and there
again, you have that guarantee to the
small nations that their rights will be
respected, and will not be overridden. The
method of decision referred to has had its
test in the Assembly of the League of
Nations for two sessions, and bas not
been found to interfere with the speedy and
efficient despatch of business, or with the
ultimate conclusions of the Assembly.
The first Assembly of the League of
Nations met in the old Hall of the Reformation at Geneva in the autumn of 1920. It
was made up of representatives of 47 different nations of the world, of every language,
of every creed, almost every nationality and
colour. They were about 120 in number,
and very few of them had ever seen the
other members of the delegations or had
any acquaintance with them.
People said: "You will have a second
Tower of Babel on a small scale; how
will you understand each other? How will
you shake yourselves together? How will
you come to the essential end of understanding the viewpoints of one another,
and so get on efficiently with your business?" An ounce of experience is worth
a ton of speculation in that respect. When
I say to you that that assembly of men
from all portions of the world met and
organized themselves, chose their president, their rules of procedure, their vicepresidents, organized their committeessix great committees with 42 members upon

the grand committees, and all within
six days of the date of their assembly-I
give you a key to the problem. If anyone
had been asked to express an opinion as to
the possibility of that accomplishment before the thing happened, he would have said
it would be absolutely impossible. But it
was not impossible, and the solvent that
made things easy, and made action prompt
and efficient, was the spirit of loyalty and
devotion to the great object of the League,
which was to procure peace for suffering
humanity; and in doing that every possible
effort was made, and every possible sacrifice of what was comparatively unimportant, in view of the great object ahead. And
so we have the experience of that first Assembly through a session of a little over six
weeks during which subjects of the greatest
importance were taken up, thoroughly
threshed out, and conclusions reached, and
there was no difficulty in one delegation
understanding the viewpoint of another.
The official languages were French and
English.
Translations were quickly and
most efficiently done; in fact, very often the
translator made a better speech than did
the original speaker himself; but, such was
the facility and the wonderful power that
they possess, that they would sit beside you
whilst you made a half-hour's speech, take
a few shorthand notes, and then give every
point you made, much of the language you
used, and sometimes a great deal of the
spirit in which you made it. So in that
regard we had no more difficulty than we
found at the Peace Conference in Paris.
I have thus hurriedly explained what are
the two important organs of the League.
For all the early part of the year the
Council of eight did the whole work of
the League-mostly organization, but a
large amount of executive work as well.
But it was not until the Assembly of
the Nations-the popular body, the body
fresh from every nation-member of the
League-met and took on its duties, and
functioned in those duties, that the vital
fluid passed from the nations to the Council
through the Assembly, and the organization became thoroughly effective and in
good working order.
What about a possible clash between
Council and Assembly? That was a possibility much spoken of and largely criticised. But men are sensible, and from the
first to the last, in both the first and
second Assembly, no clash took place. Men
thought and spoke about defining the respective duties of the Council and of the Assembly, but no definition of them was made;
and, as in that wonderful creation, the Con-

stitution of the British Empire-which bas
been left to gather itself out of the void,
unrestricted and not formulated in writing,
but which bas worked out in a practical
way of great advantage and utilityso the operations of Council and of Assembly, instead of clashing, have gone on
in the greatest harmony and with the best
attendant results.
But I must not leave out another of the
organs of activity and work by means of
which the Council on the one hand and the
Assembly on the other have carried out
what they proposed and decided to have
done, and that is the Secretariat. The
Secretariat of the League of Nations is a
wonderful body. It is not nominated by
the different nations who are members of
the League of Nations.
The SecretaryGeneral, who was appointed by the Peace
Conference, had instructions to form a
Secretariat, and he formed it with the
approval of the Council,. His nominations
went before the Council, and the Council
approved of them or not. The Secretariat
is therefore not a series of groups representing national bodies. It is a Secretariat
of the League of Nations, that is, of the
51 nations, and it owes its allegiance to,
and does its work under, the supervision of
the Secretary-General of the Assembly and
of the Council. It is chosen for merit.
To judge the Secretariat one has to see
what are the various operations carried on.
Let me give you two that are carried on
by the Council and the Assembly. Take, for
instance, that great organism known as the
Commission on Transit and Communication. If I get on a car at Quebec or Halifax
and go to Vancouver, I pass entirely
through one country. I may extend my
voyage through the United States of
America; I pass a border, but a border
where I perceive no difference. But if
you start on the Orient railway froin
Paris or froin Berlin and go to Anatolia or Mesopotamia, you pass through
a succession of different nations with
widely different forins of government,
with racial and credal and national prejudices, and after the war, in the rebuilding
of parts of dismembered empires, and in the
new aggregations of naitionalities, you
meet every here and there a distinctively
hostile border.
Thus transport became
disrupted into a dozen sections, where it
should have run on uninterruptedly th.rough
the whole. Now, the Transit and Communication Commission was one of the
first technical bodies formed. For that work
you must have the best experts you can
get in the world. Those experts must be
S-61

33

on the job all the time, and au fait with
all the conditions. They are men of
sterling worth, sterling experience and
sterling probity. They form part of the
Secretariat. It is not mere formal work:
it is work which calls for the best that
mankind can give it. Again, you start
from central Europe with the idea of
getting out to the open waters, and if
you start from Poland or some other inland country of Europe and pass down
the Danube you use water communication,
and you meet with the same series of
obstacles. Again, the air is open and above
every nation, and as air services multiply
and extend you must have transit and
communication arrangements between all
the nations of the world.
That is one example of a Commission
operating with the Secretariat under the
Council and the Assembly; and it carries
out its purpose through conferences of
states that adjoin each other, and through
conferences of all the states that would be
interested in any agreement or arrangement made.
By constant pressure they
are carrying on the work, by methods the
nost pacific possible to get at desired results; and, although there are still tr-ubles
in Europe, and large troubles up to the
present time, the amount of amelioration
which has been brought within the last
year and a half by virtue of such action
as I have spoken of is very encouraging
in its ultimate results.
Then, there is the Economic and Financial Commission. Anybody who reads the
newspapers-and we all do-anybody who
has any relation to business-and most of
us have-knows the dire state of confusion
in which Europe and the world have been
plunged as 'a result of the war. One of
the first actions of the Council of the
League of Nations was to .summon the
greatest and most representative financial
and economic conference that the world
has ever seen. Thirty-nine nations, the
foremost nations of the world, were represented. It was brought to Brussels, and
there in six weeks of deliberation it examined the economic and financial questions
of Europe and the world. It laid down its
conclusions in resolutions and recommendations which have been since, and are today, invaluable in the foundations they
give for the readjustment, painfully slow
though it is, which is taking place in
Europe. That Economic Commission is a
surviving and persisting body made up of
foremost financial and economic experts,
and their aid is called in by country after
country, and their aid is given. Austria

was dismembered. The head was left; all
the productive portions of the body were
eut out and made up into other nations.
That was 'not done by the League of Nations; that was done by the Allied and Associated Powers in setting out the terms
of peace. Austria was close to bankThe Economie and Financial
ruptcy.
Commission took it in hand, applied with
modifications the principles adopted at the
Brussels Conference, and, by hope first and
by practical work afterwards, saved Austria from immediate bankruptcy and chaos.
In order that the financial readjustment of
Austria might be worked out, the immense
debts which overwhelmed her had to be in
some way disposed of; so the effort of the
Commission was to get every country to
which Austria owed debts to postpone
those debts for a period of twenty-five
years. Up to within six months ago every
nation had done that with the exception
of the United States of America; but until
the United States of America joined in,
the thing was incomplete and could not be
completed. At the present session of Congress a resolution was passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives
making the postponement in the case of
the United States; and now, all postponements having been made, and Austria
having agreed to the conditions upon which
the credits should be used, under the supervision of the League of Nations, the financial and economic reconstruction of Austria is well within view. That is one of
the many things that have been done; and
the same principle is now being applied, or
is sought to be applied, to other states. But
for such work high-grade and experienced
men are necessary.
Hon. Mr. PELCOURT: Would my honourable friend ,allow me at this stage to
ask him a question? I hope he will not
mind my interrupting his narrative. The
subjects which my honourable friend has
just mentioned-the economic question,
now being debated at Genoa, and the disarmament conference at Washington-are
both, I take it, quite within the jurisdiction of the League of Nations. I do not
know-I want the information, and I have
no doubt my honourable friend can give it
to us-how it is that these conferences, the
one at Washington and the one at Genea,
and others, have taken place and that the
League of Nations has not dealt with those
subjects, which are, as I assume and believe, quite within its own jurisdiction.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If my honourable friend will allow me, inSir GEORGE FOSTER.

stead of giving him the answer just now,
I will take the question in the order of
my remarks. Both of those subjects I will
treat shortly, before I finish what I have
to say.
Now, I do not think that at this time
it would be profitable for me to go farther
in reference to these three great organs
or functioning agencies of the League. It
is open, to every member of the 'Senate to
study the matter for himself, and the materials for study are ready at hand. Meanwhile the time at my disposal admonishes
me to pass on to something else.
I corne now to answer, very briefly and
perhaps somewhat imperfectly, the third
question, what the League :of Nations has
accomplished in the short period of its existence; and I will do that by citing particular instances.
It has administrative
functions to perform, which plainly could
not be performed as well, if at all, by the
Great Powers.
These obligations are in
some cases laid upon the League by the
Treaties thenwelves.
Take as one example of administrative
work the Saar Basin.
During the course
of the war, and particularly in the latter
part of it, the French mines in the north of
France were almost completely destroyed.
They were not destroyed for military reasons, or for military purposes; they were
destroyed solely and entirely for the sake
of destruction and of crippling the future
prosperity of France. When we came to the
treaties of Peace it was decided that reparation in kind was due to France for that
destruction of her coal mines. It is said
that some of them will never bu reconstituted, that many of them will take
twenty years to put into fully as good form
as before, and so on in proportion to the
destruction done to them. One condition in
the Treaty was this, that the Saar Basin,
which is a great producer of coal, should
become, so far as its coal mines were concerned, the absolute possession of France for
fifteen years, and that during those fifteen
years France should have the sole right, undisputed and untrammelled, to work those
mines.
It was also part of the Treaty
that the Reparations Commission should
take into account the values of the coal
taken from those mines and should malce

to go on under the management of the
League of Nations, and at the end of fifteen years a plebiscite should be held and
the district so administered for fifteen

APRIL 26, 1922
years would be able to say whether or not
it preferred to keep the League status,
whether it preferred to go to Germany, or
whether it preferred to join France.
With a population of 750,000 people in
an intensely complex industrial and productive region, where German laws have always
been in force and German customs and
German regulations followed, two things
were impossible: it was impossible that
France should put a 'representative of
France in there to do that administration;
and it was equally impossible that Germany
should be allowed to put a German in there
for that purpose. Two nations separated by
a half century of hate and discord, enlivened
and burnished by the late war, in which that
hatred and discord was emphasized, could
neither of them be trusted to make an impartial administration of the district. So it
was made obligatory that the administration
should be placed in the hands of the League
of Nations, and the Council of the League
nominated the larger 'part of the Delimitation Commdttee and afterwards nominated
the whole administrative Commission of
five. On thai Administrative Commission
of five Canada has a representative in the
person of Mr. Waugh, of Winnipeg, whose
work in that adininistration has been-not
to say anything out of the way-as practical and as efficient as that of any other
member of the Commission.
That Commission has the right to levy
taxes; it has the right to constitute additional courts, if these are necessary; but it
governs according to the German laws which
were in force there at the time of the Armistice, modified, if they can or ought to be
modified, by consultation with the people of
the district assembled in a representative capacity. I need not go into detail with reference to that. Any disturbance or dispute
or disagreement which takes place is subject to appeal to the Council of the League
of Nations, and appeals have been quite
numerous, but they have all been decided by
the Council of the League, and the decisions
have been acceded to by the people of the
district. There is an instance in which it
would seem that no authority other than
the sublimated authority of 51 nations acting in an un-national, impartial and loyal
way could possibly be sufficient to carry
on the administration as it should be carried on. That is one example.
Poland, up in the north of Europe, is

parts, long segregated, it was made into a

but they had no access to the Baltie sea.

There was Danzig, an immense German
city. I do not know what percentage, but
by far the larger proportion of its people
are Germans. An article of the Treaty
provided that a corridor should be opened
from Poland to the sea, so that Poland
might get breath and sea-water for ber
commerce. The administration of Danzig
was put under the League of Nations, and
Danzig was to be made a free city; but,
unlike the case of the Saar Basin, the
people of Danzig were to have the right
to form a constitution, which, however,
must be made in conformity with the
view of the High Commissioner, who at
first was appointed by the Great Powers
and afterwards by the League. The Constituent Assembly has been formed, the
Constitution drawn up, modified by the
League, has been virtually assented to, and
Danzig is now a great, free, self-governing city with a corridor attached to it, but
under the supervision of the League of Nations. It is interesting to read its history
of the last twelve months. There is a
large German population, with Poland
surrounding it. There are 15 millions of
people who demand access, personally, individually, and for their commerce, to and
from the sea. There are the railway and
other transit equipments, partly German,
partly Polish, partly of the city of Danzig.
All these things have to be brought into correlation. Suffice it to say, in a word, that
at the present time all those conditions
bave been brought into correlation, and the
trade of both Germany and Poland, under
proper agreements and proper supervision,
goes on uninterruptedly and in peace.
Never could a Polish or a German administrator be allowed to undertake an administration of that kind. Again I say, it requires the sublimated authority of all the
members of the League. I do not know
whether that word "sublimated" applies
exactly or not, but my meaning is this.
In the Council of the League of Nations
you get a composite of 51 different nations
belonging to the League; consequently it is
not the case of a foreign power interfering
with a Pole, or a German, or a citizen of
Danzig; it is an impartial, just and helpful
tribunal, whose only object is to bring peace
out of dissension and to administer so that
the greatest good may come to all.
Another example, of a somewhat different nature, shows what the League is purposeful to do and what it succeeds in doing.
All of you will remember the trouble which
took place with reference to Upper Silesia.
That is a district which is made un of Poles,

;6

SENATE

Germans and other peoples, but mainly
Poles and Germans. There was to be a
plebiscite held, and according to the plebiscite the territory was to be allocated. The
plebiscite was held, but the allocation of
the territory was the troublesome thing,
and the great Powers, Allied and Associated, had to struggle with that problem.
Upper Silesia has a most complex series of
affiliated industries and productive agencies. If in the delimination of territory
a line of demarkation were to be drawn
through it, the division of these would be
like the dividing of the Siamese Twins by
cutting the connection between them. The
essential thing in making the allocation
was to maintain the complex affiliations
of production and exchange in practical
and efficient working. Well, differences will
arise, even amongst the great powers, and
iifferences arose between the great powers
in reference to the allocation in Upper
Silesia. France had one view, Great Britain
had a different view; and France and
Great Britain stood pretty closely to
their contentions. For twelve months or
more no progress was made, and all the
time armed bands and armies stood ready
to engage in internecine strife. At last
the great powers Lit upon the practical
expedient: "Why not hand it over to the
League of Nations and bind ourselves to
agree to the recommendation and the plan
that they propose?" Agreed! The Allied
Council was at one. Poland assented, Germany assented, and then the Council of the
League of Nations took up the matter.
They employed practical peace methods.
They chose Mr. Calonder, who is an exhead of the Swiss Republic and is a very
clever and very much respected man. They
made him Head Commissioner: they sent
him up to the district. Germany chose its
members of the Commission, Poland chose
its members. Mr. Calonder headed them,
got them around a table, divided them off
into eleven different committees, gave to
each of these its special subject, told the
committee to examine it and to ýprepare
its report for him, and to meet him at
Geneva. They did so: they met him at
Geneva; but before they came there Mr.
Calonder made a second personal visit and
sat in with these commissions, every one
of them, at the same table, and talked with
them as a friend would talk to a friend.
When they finally brought their report to
Geneva they had agreed upon most points,
but had not agreed upon al], and the night
before the day on which he was to give
the decision if they had not agreed, they

told him that they had found it impossible
to agree. He said to them: "Gentlemen,
I am to give my decision to-morrow; but
I will send you back. Get around a cornmon table and come to an agreement if
you possibly can. If you do not come to
an agreement by to-morrow, I will make
my decision then, and it will be final and
must be accepted." They went back, saw
light, and made an arrangement, and today the work is going on pleasantly, peacefully, and efficiently, under the direction of
the League of Nations.
Now, if I am not wearying you, let me
give you one other point which has a different range entirely. Finland and Sweden
are coterminous countries with a stretch
of water and ice and islands between them.
The Aaland islands, since 1808, have belonged to Finland, but 95 per cent of the
population of those islands are Swedish
and speak the Swedish language, so that
often before, and more especially when the
Peace Conference came on, self-determination got into their heads, and they asked to
be annexed to Sweden. Sweden did not
push her rights, but said: " We think they
ought to have the privilege of a plebiscite
and to choose for themselves." There were
interested in that question some eight or
ten of the Baltic Nations, and upon the
settlement of this particularly tinder-like
point depended the peace of those smaller
Baltic countries, and perhaps of others
contiguous thereto. So the question was
delivered over to the League of Nations
The Council used the same means that
I have mentioned: they sent out a Commission, which made its investigation, got
together delegates from Sweden and Finland, and in the end made their report,
vhich, by a convention of twelve nations
signing its ratification, Las been finally
agreed to and is of record; and the Aland
islands, for all time to come, are lifted
out of the area of probable dissension and
possible war.
What has been done is
this. Finland keeps her right to the territory,but gives guarantees as to how she shall
act with reference to the islanders themselves. The terms are set out in the Convention signed by twelve of the Baltic nations, and by Sweden and Finland, and
made a definite document. If trouble arises
the League of Nations is to look into the
trouble; if anyone violates the pact, the
League of Nations is to say what shall be
done to bring the violator to justice; and
the twelve nations pledge themselves to see
that the decision of the League is carried
out. One term of the agreement is that no

APRIL 26, 1922
armaments of war of any kind shall be established, made, imported into, or in any
way had in the islands. They are neutralized so far as that is concerned.
I will now pass from that class of cases,
which are largely administrative, but the
last of which is more than administrative
-because the Great Powers seeing the recent results of their own unsuccessful
efforts to bring about a proper solution
said: "Here is a comparatively neutral
body, the friend of all; hand it over to them
and let them settle it in the best way
possible, and we will stand by their decision." In the year and a half of its existence the League of Nations has been gradually conquering a position of trust and confidence among the smaller nations of
Europe, and among the larger nations as
well; and to-day their activities and efforts
are legion in connection with the clearing
away of disputes and dissensions and the
bringing about of agreements which result
in peace and avoiding war.
Now, I come to the question of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt): Is it
not a proof that something is wrong when
the United States, for instance, must call
a convention on naval armaments, and when
to Genoa must be called a convention of
the different nations on economic questions,
both of which subjects, the first more particularly, are to a large extent handed
over and made part of the duty of the
League of Nations? Well, we have to take
the circumstances into account. Take armaments. The doing away of armaments
down to the minimum of national securitythat is all that is contemplated-is a
chief duty of the League of Nations, and the
League of Nations bas not forgotten or
been unmindful of that duty. But take
into account the circumstances. Here is
a Europe which is not yet pacified. There
is a Russia on one aide that bas and

boasts of an army of 1,500,000 Reds and

200,000 of a gendarmerie, or police, in
addition. There is maintained in Poland
itself, on a long border which may be
disputed any hour of any day in the year,
an army to preserve her national existence.
There are the other nations of Europe, all
in a greater or less degree maintaining
armaments. There is the United States,
which is not a member of the League, and
which does not sit in with the other members of the League in their examinations
and in their conclusions. Could you ask
Japan and Great Britain to dismantle their
fleets, and so come within a recognition of
the demands of the Covenant of the League

of Nations to diminish armaments, when
they did not know what the United States
was going to do, and when the programme
of the United States was set for the building
of a fleet which would have made it the
most powerful in the world? If the United
States, who sat in during the war, and
during the formulation of the terms and
conditions of the peace, but who sat out
directly the work of readjustment commenced, could have sat in with the other
51 powers of the world, then the question
of armaments could have been taken up
and settled in Geneva and settled for all
nations and not merely for four. But until
the mind of the United States was known,
and that great uncertainty was removed, no
great power was justified in scaling down

her naval equipment.
with reference to war armaments by land
and by air.
Now, what happened? Immediately the
League and the Council were formed, a
very influential Armaments Commission
was framed. It went to work and made its
reports, and came to the Assembly with the
reports; but at that point the Assembly
said: "We cannot go any farther; the
United States is not here; Russia is not
here; it would not very much matter if
Russia were not here, if the United States
were here; but she being out, we cannot
make much progress." Though the United
States is, not a member of the League, I
yet have faith to believe that she ultimately
will be. Nine-tenths of the people of the
United States, to every heart-beat, are one
with the aspirations and ideals of the
League for the destruction of war methods
and for the substitution of peace methods;
and the conference called by Ptresident
Harding, and the stand taken on naval
armaments, have cleared one difficulty out
of the way of the Armaments Commission
of the League of Nations, and have made
their future work much more easy than
it has been in the past or would have been
had this not taken place. Meanwhile the
Armaments Commission is pursuing its inquiries, gathering its statistics, and will
submit to the next Assembly its plan of
disarmament.
The League of Nations has no grudge
against the operation of any other powers
inside or outside its membership. If they
will facilitate the objects and aims of the
League, so much to the good: that makes
the path it has to travel all the easier
of being travelled. Take the position with
reference to the economic re-establishment
of the world. It is true that incidentally

88

SENATE

it is part of the function of the League of
Nations to bring about economic and financial resettlements and readjustments. It
is a gigantic task; it cannot be done in a
trice; the situation in Europe is so tense,
so widespread, so permeated with national
dislikes and prejudices, and so honeycombed
underneath with lack of production, lack
of credit, and consequently lack of earning
power, that it requires every possible aid;
and the Genoa Conference has been called,
not as a rival of the League of Nations
but as a coadjutor and helper; and if it
comes to any conclusions which are helpful
along the lines which have been set out, it
is so much accomplished and makes so much
easier the work that the League of Nations has to perform.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I have given
in a somewhat unconnected and not very
efficient manner some explanations with
regard to the League of Nations. I must
hurry to a conclusion. My brain is but
a small portion of the brains of this Chamber. Other people have made their inquiries and have their views, and will
probably express them. I have done my
part in introducing the question. There
is no worse god to whom adoration and
tribute may be paid than the god of lazy
forgetfulness. So long as I am a member
of this Senate, I shall make an opportunity
at least once every year for passing in review that wonderful thought, being wrought
out in an almost equally wonderful practical way, certain of much in the past and
promiseful of much in the future, so that
we may be an informed public in 'Canada.
The League of Nations will do its work
and be kept up to its prime of energy and
efficiency only in proportion as the democracy of every nation that has membership in it is an informed and intelligent
and convinced democracy in favour of
peace and against the war methods of the
past. So it becomes us to study this question.
We are greatly interested in a
country post office; and what one party
has said and another party has said assumes tremendous importance to a politician. Honourable gentlemen, we went into
the war; we did our part in it; we came out
leaving 60,000 of our dead on the field of
battle; we shouldered two and a half
billion dollars of debt and bore all the
scars of war.
Would not we all have
given our last dollar and the last drop
of blood in our veins to have avoided
such a war? But there will be another war

fast fading out of our minds; lest we forget that we as a constituent part of the
League of Nations have our work to perform, and do that work as loyally and
efficiently as we did the work of the war
when the war was on. That is our duty.
We must avoid the pitfall of apathy; we
must get behind this League the moral sanction of the Dominion of Canada, as other
nations are getting the moral sanction of
their people behind the League. One man
says: " You cannot do anything without an
army; you have got to have force." At
first sight, there seems to be a great deal
in that contention; but who will limit the
frontier of moral force in the world? We
have in this country a police which is but
a fraction of the 8,000,000 people who live
in Canada and observe the conventions of
society. It is the moral sentiment of the
community, the force of law and its administration, which, after all, is only moral
sentiment put into the shape of statute
books, that keeps our people on the right
track; it is not the few police or the few
regular soldiers that we have. And, depend upon it, in this matter that we are
discussing moral force never had such a
widely-distributed basis or such a fervour
behind it as is behind the prayer of the
women and children and men of the
world: "Give us peace." Fifty-one nations
have pledged themselves to forego war
and to employ the methods of peace. That
is a wonderful moral force in the very beginning. Councils, Secretariats, Assemblies, Leagues are behind these principles,
gaining credit for them and efficiently carrying them out.
All the philanthropic
and religious societies of the nations are
behind peace and against war; and in
every mother's heart that breathes its
prayer for peace is a perennial source
of moral force to be exerted along
the lines of the League of Nations.
My own conviction is that it is absolutely
possible to bring the League of Nations to
the fulfilment of those ideals without the
force of arms or equipment.
Put the
United States along with the other fifty-one
nations of the world in the Council of the
League of Nations and you will not need
either armies or navies. There is no force
in a single nation, even if there is a desire,
which will make it a violator of its covenant
in the face of the moral sanctions of 51
nations of the world, plus the United States
of America. And so it is that the moral
sanctions, strong in themselves, growing
constantly, are the backbone and the subbasis of that which is to be reared and
supported-this great machinery for good

all cases of dispute, whether the parties
agree to the matter or not.
I leave with you one question: if not
this, what? In the words of Mr. Balfour,
"Were the League of Nations abolished tomorrow what body either exists or could be
found to take its place?" And with Mr.
Balfour I hazard the assertion that no reasonable, intelligent person will rise from the
pondering of that question, and the perusal
of the information upon which it depends,
without becoming a life-long and convinced
supporter of the work of the League of
Nations.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I would
like to ask the honourable gentleman to
explain one question. I understood from
him that if any member of the League of
Nations were to backslide the other members could send him to Coventry. Now,
is there anything in the constitution of the
League of Nations which prevents any
member from honourably resigning, thus
leaving him free to declare war on the
others?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is nothing to prevent any member
of the League of Nations from severing
its connection with the League. As I said
before, the League of Nations depends on
the assent of the nations, and if a nation
becomes dissatisfied and wishes to end its
connection, the Covenant of the League
provides a way of honourably severing
that connection. But there is in the Covenant of the League itself, and there is
in the purposes of the League, this: that
suppose you get the great majority of the
nations into the League itself, and some
nations remain outside, and those nations
propose to carry on war, they may be invited to make use of the instrumentalities of the League in order that war may
be avoided and that peace may in the end
prevail and if they still persist they too
could be effectually sent to Coventry.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, we have listened with much
pleasure, and I think great profit, to the
able speech which the right honourable gentleman has just finished.
There is one
phase of this important question which I
think merits some attention, and probably
the time and other business of tihe House
will not permit that to be dealt with today.
I therefore beg permission to move
the adjournment of this debate until tomorrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate was adjourned until to-morrow.

JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend the
Judges Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
very short Bill, composed of one 'paragraph,
which has for its object the increasing of
the number of rpuisne judges of the Court
of Appeal for Saskatchewan from three to
four, and authorizing the treasury to pay
the salary of that jud:ge.
This increase
has been sanctioned, and the Bill is presented as a sequence to a provincial Act
which constituted the Court of Appeal. As
every honourable gentleman knows, under
our Constitution the provinces create the
office; the Federal Government fills the
office and pays the salary.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What necessity is
there for another judge in Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN'D: Of course,
that lies largely, I would say exclusively, in
the discretion of the legislature of each
province.
The Legislature of Saskatchewan has affirmed the necessity for an additional judge, and I have observed that
the members from that province who spoke
in another place on this subject endorsed
the need. The Attorney General of that
province communicated to the Minister of
Justice his opinion to the same effect, and
the Federal authorities, including the Minister of Justice, have deemed it expediert
to comply with the demand frcrn Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does this Bill cover
the province of Prince Ediward Island,
which I understand is asking for another
judge?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill covers only the case of Saskatchewan.
I do
not know anything about Prince Edward
Island.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is a matter of
some importance now, in view of the very
considerable salary that is paid to a judge,
and in view of the financial condition of
this country at 'the present time, and of the
fact that it can no longer subsist by taxes
taken from us without our feeling it extracted from us imperceptibly by means of
custons duties. We are to-day paying taxation for Federal purposes by an income
tax which some of us feel pretty keenly,
and I say it is a matter of some importance that an additional judge should be
appointed and the additional cost placed

APRIL 26, 1922
upon the country. It is a very simple matter for provincial legislatures to create
judgeships from some political necessity,
in order to get rid of some politician, perhaps, who cannot be otherwise provided for,
and who is a stumbling Mbock in the way
of effective government by the party-for
party reasons solely, and not for reasons
of public necessi;ty. I say that this Parliament should be very careful before they
provide for additional judges. In many of
the provinces there are too many judges
now; there are more judges than there is
work for. That goes to show that we are
not a litigious people, and se we have a
larger bench of judges than there is real
necessity for, and the country .pays -the cost.
1 think that this government and this Parliarnent would be weal advised to insist on
some good and ýcogent reason-a public reason, not a party reason or a private reason-why the country should be saddled
with the ccst of an additionai judge in the
province of Saskatchewan. I question very
much if the public desires or requires an
additionaa judge in that province, or in any
one of the provinces of Canada. So I
would hope that better reasons would be
advanced why we should vote this a.mount,
or why we should pass this Bill. Indeed,
no0 reason whatever has been given by the
honourable leader of the Government, who
is charged with the duty, in this House at
least, of protecting the treasury of this
country. We have just borrowed one undred millions of dollars in the Unite
States.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And paid two
and a haîf millions for the privilege.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We are not paying
our way to-day in this country. Outside
of the province of Quebec, and perhaps
the province of British Columbia, there is
flot a province in Canada to-day that is not
more in debt at this time than it was at
the saine period hast year. Where are we
going to end? Where are -these things
going to stop? Surely the Federal1 Government should set an examiple. Our income
to-day is 'not equal to our expenditure;
and yet we are asked, in this off-hand way,
to dechare that there shahl be another judge,
and another large amount taken out of the
treasury to support that judge.
I ask honourable gentlemen to think over
this. 1 ask them to consider whether or
not they are doing their duty to the people
of this country, who pay the bills, in gaily
voting this amount, or passing legislation
which will caîl upon Parliamient to vote

this amount. I appeal to the honourable
gentlemen in this Chamber, who are nlot
swayed by party passion, or party prejudice, or party reasons, but are prepared,
or should be prepared, to give every matter
that cornes before them a fair, independent
and impartial treatment-I appeal to them,
to remember that, no0 matter what attitude
may be taken by gentlemen of the Lower
House, who dlaim to be the representatives
of the people, there is laid upon us the
duty of seeîng that no hasty legisiation is
passed which shall injure the body politie,
and that we are just as good judges of
what is best for the people of Canada as
are the men who are directly elected by the
people. Now I have nothing further to
say. I rnerely sound a note of warning and
ask the honourable members of this Chamber to think over this before passing legislation which would make further imposts
upon this country.
Hlon. Mr. MeMEANS: May 1 asIc the
honourable leader of the Government when
the legisiation was passed requiring the
appointment of a judge? At what session
of the provincial legislature of Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: At the last session
of the legisiature of Saskatchewan. The
Minister of Justice referred to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. I was
looking into the statement of the Minister
of Justice. I arn told that hie made the
statement that it was at the last session of
the legisiature.
Before answering the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Fowler) I will wait to see
if there are other honourable gentlemen to
speak on this matter. If no0 one desîres to
put any further questionHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend permit me to put a
question? I amn unaware whether hie is in
a position to answer it or not. It seemns
to me that throughout the provinces of
Canada there is no0 well established practice
by which the judiciary is increased intelligently. As my honourable friend from
Kings and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) bas
just pointed out, a political exigency may
arise and suddenly a Bill is introduced in
the legisiature to increase tihe number of

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is he another barrister?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think he is,
and I infer from a statement which I will
now quote that he was at one time a member of the judiciary. He said:

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We were going ta
have a long debate. Surely you are not
going to shut us off now.

I think it was quite well understood throughout the province of Saskatchewan that there
would be a request for an additional Judge of
Appea) for the bench in that province, no matter' what party was returned to power as a
result of the last election. The Estimates show
that in Manitoba there are five judges in the
Court of Appeal.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I looked
around ta see if anyone intended ta speak,
and the honourable leader of the Conservative party (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
did rise and speak, and I thought he was
closing the debate. But if the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Tanner) wishes ta
speak, perhaps it might be done by general consent.

The population of Manitoba is much
smaller than that of Saskatchewan.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The discussion is
not going ta close as early as that.

The estimates show that in Manitoba there
are five judges in the Court of Appeal, in
Alberta five, and in Saskatchewan four. I was
formerly connected with the courts of Saskatchewan, anad I am well advised that the Court
of Appeal in that province is crowded I arm not
sure that they are despatching the work as
expeditiously as some other courts are doing,
although I am perfectly sure that they think
they are. I suggest to ton. gentlemen that if
this Parliament could arrogate to itself the
right to say that Saskçatchewan shall not have
this judge, then it would have the same right
to stop the wheels of justice altogether in that
province or in any other province.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I was waiting until
other honourable gentlemen had finished.
I had a few remarks ta make about the
matter. As I have said, I was interested in
it for one reason. There has been unfortunately a vacancy on the Supreme
Court Bench of Nova Scotia since the
16th of March, and we have only six Supreme Court Judges in that province. These
six Supreme Court Judges have ta try all
the cases; that is ta say, they have all
the ordinary King's Bench work, they
have ta hear all the appeals, they have ta
dispose of all divorce cases, of which there
were fifty last year and fifty the year
before. Since the 16th of March there are
only six ta do the whole work of the Superior Court. In Saskatchewan there are
at the present time eleven Supreme Court
Judges and eighteen District Court judges.
It occurred ta me that, if there is need for
a great deal of hurry in the creation of
another judgeship in the province of Saskatchewan, there should be some reason for
the Government moving in regard ta the
vacant judgeship in the Province of Nova
Scotia.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is a beautiful argument, surely.
Hon. M. DANDURAND (reading):
If we can refuse this request we can refuse
to implement any other action which any province, under the constitution, has the right to
take in matters relating to the administration
of justice. I certainly think that the province
should have the additional judge.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I will swear that
the man is not a barrister who talks in that
way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These are the
only two members from Saskatchewan in
the other Chamber who spoke on the matter,
and I give their opinions for what they are
worth.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Both those men are
farmers, I understand; so the information
the honourable gentleman got from alongside of him is somewhat defective.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I was a little interested in this
matter for one reasonThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I do not
like ta interrupt the honourable gentleman,
but I understood that Uhe honourable
leader of the Government was making his
reply, and if any honourable gentleman
wanted ta speak he ought ta have spoken
before the honourable leader of the Government.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And

Hon. Mr. TANNER: And particularly
on the man who is appointed. Now, I
want to say in this connection, too, that I
think there should be a better reason given
for the creation of an additional judgeship
in Saskatchewan. Like any other honourable member, I have no desire to prevent
Saskatchewan from having all the judges
that the business of the province requires,
but I think, agreeing with my honourable
friend in front of me (Hon. Mr. Fowler),
that we are entitled to have reasons. For
my part, I dissent absolutely from the
ground which I understand was taken in
the other House, and which apparently is
taken here, that we must accept the judgment of the provincial legisilature. Would
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), for example, accept the judgment
of the provincial legislature if this were a
recommendation to increase the number of
judges in Saskatchewan by three or four?
Or, suppose they came down with the pro-.
position that they should double the Court
of Appeal, would he accept that without
any question? Would he not feel that,
inasmuch as we here in this Parliament
are the custodians and trustees of the
money of the people, we have a duty to
perform, as well as the gentlemen who compose the provincial legislatures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman allow me to put to
him a question?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is there not

Saskatchewan :s

sides of Saskatchewan-in Manitoba and
Alberta-there are five judges in the Court
of Appeal.
My honourable friend speaks
of a demand being possibly made for four
or five more judiges.
Just at present there
seems to be an equalizing procedure as
amongst those three provinces.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Take one judge out
of the eleven and put him in the Court of
Appeal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And Saskatchewan bas a larger population.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not accept the view that because
the province of Alberta bas five judges in
its Court of Appeal the province of Saskatchewan is entitled to five.
There must
be some sounder basis to proceed upon
than that. I would prefer to proceed upon
the basis of the litigation work that is to be
done.
If there is work in Saskatchewan
for five judges, very well, let them have
five.
But if there is not work in that
province for five judges, why should they
want that number?
Simply because the
province of Alberta bas five?
I do not
accept that as a reason, any more than I
accept the reason which is given, that because the legislature chooses to pass an Act
saying that the Court of Appeal shall
consist of a chief and four instead
of
a chief and three, this Parliament is bound
to accept that as the final judgment.
I
regard it as the duty of this Parliament to
satisfy itself that these judges are necessary. We are not appointing judges merely
as ornaments; we are appointing judges to
administer the law; and if there is work
for them, welll and good, but if there is
not work for them, they should not be appointed.
I think that it is the duty of
the honourable leader of the Government
in this House to satisfy this House that
owing to the quantity of work in that province there is need for another judge upon
the Court of Appeal in the province of Saskatchewan.
I have gone to the trouble to read over
the reports.
I have taken the provinces
of Saskatchewan and Alberta for comparison w:ith Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
In Saskatchewan they have four judges in
the Court of Appeal, seven judges on the
King's Bench, and eighteen district judges.
In the province of Alberta they have five
judges in the Court of Appeal, six judges
on the King's Bench, and twelve district
judges.
In Nova Scotia, as I explained
a moment ago, we have seven judges, who
do all the work-trial svork, chamber work,

APRIL 26, 1922
appeal work; and seven county court
judges.
In New Brunswick they have
three in the Appea1 Court, four on the
King's Bench, and six county judges. That
is the outfit.
I have taken the Law Reports for these provinces for the last three
years that I could find in the Library, and
averaging these three years I find that the
province of Saskatchewan had an average
of 75 appeal cases each year for the three
years; the province of Aiberta had an
average of 149 appeal cases; the province
of Nova Scotia had an average of 102 appeal cases, and the province of New
Brunswick had an average of 70 appeal
cases.
If seven judges in the province of Nova
Scotia can try all the cases at nisi prius
and can do all the chamber work and carry
on all the admiralty business, as they have
to do, and dispose of the divorce cases,
which have accumulated very greatly, and
also hear 102 appeals, what reason can
be advanced to satisfy us that four appeal
court judges who have nothing to do but
hear appeal cases cannot dispose of 75
appeals? Three Appeal Court judges in
the province of New Brunswick disposed
of an average of 70 cases a year.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And they have
not enough to do to keep their feet warm.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I submit, honourable gentlemen, that the work to be done
is the only basis upon which the membership of a court can properly be increased.
If there is so much work that the present
Appeal Court cannot overtake it, if they
are overwhelmed and business is dragging
behind and suitors are delayed, these are
reasons for increasing the number of
judges. But the mere fact that there is out
west a politician who is in close communication with this Government, a politician
in distress, for whom the clock has struck
twelve, and who has decided to get out
while the getting out is good, is no reason
for increasing the number of judges on
the Appeal Court Bench in the province
of Saskatchewan. That is no reason for
adding $9,000 a year to the pay roll. This
gentleman may be a very good lawyer, or
he may not. I know nothing about him
in that regard, but I take it for granted
that the leader of the Government will
not deny for one moment that this legislation is going through with a view to
the appointment and for the personal advantage of Hon. Mr. Martin, ex-Premier
of the province of Saskatchewan.

95

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He never heard
his name before. He does not know him.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am aware that
it was said in another place that that
information had not leaked through to the
Department of Justice. To my knowledge
it bas been paraded in the newspapers for
the last four or six weeks; in fact, one
could not take up a newspaper containing news from the West without learning
that Mr. Martin was going out of the Government of Saskatchewan, that he was
to be succeeded by Mr. Dunning, and that
he was to be appointed to a place on the
Appeal Court of the province.
I have that very interesting information under my hand. No later than the
18th of this month a very responsible newspaper known as the Citizen, published in
Ottawa, announced in connection with the
creation of the new Government in Saskatchewan:
That when the Senate returns, the Bill
creating an extra Judge of Appeal in Saskatchewan wiil be passed, and it is expected that
former Premier Martin's appointment will follow immediately.

That is only one of a score of announcements made in the newspapers, and I am
very much surprised that that information
has never drifted into the Department of
Justice, as would appear from remarks
made in another place when this Bill was
under consideration.
I do not know how other honourable
gentlemen were impressed during the latter
part of last year, but I was very much
impressed by the statements which were
frequently made by the Prime Minister and
by gentlemen who were supporting him in
regard to the morality of appointing
political friends to public offices; and,
on the other hand, the great rurgency of exercising economy.
These
were two staple subjects upon which
the Prime Minister and his friends expressed themselves on numerous occasions.
On more than one occasion the Prime Minister held up his hands in horror at the idea
of the late Government appointing political
friends to this Chamber and to the Bench,
and I for one got the impression that when
that honourable gentleman had come into
the position which he now occupies we
would have a new era in 'this regard, and
that no longer would men be appointed-to
important and responsible positions for
mere partisan purposes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Did you really
think so?

SENATE

96

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Thinking that, I
never thought for one moment that the
Prime Minister and his colleagues would
so far forget what they had said, and that
they would be doing not only what they
had been charging against their political
predecessors, but actually consorting and
agreeing-I would not like to use the word
conspiring-but consorting and agreeing
with a politician in distress at the western
end of the string, not only to appoint him
to an office, but to have an office and a salary created for him. As I understand this
matter-and if I am wrong I shall be glad
to be corrected-that is precisely what is
being done in this instance. What is the
situation at the other end? The honourable
gentleman who is to be put upon the Bench
was the Attorney General and Prime Minister of the province of Saskatchewan. The
time came when the invasion of the farmer
hosts began to menace his position. The
signals of danger went up. The honourable gentleman came to the conclusion that
if anything were to be done on his personal
behalf, it had better be done quickly. The
announcement went out that he was going
to leave the Government. But before he
left the Government he was very careful
to leave something which would provide the
ways and means to prevent his being altogether shipwrecked. The honourable gentleman himself, as Attorney General and
Premier of the province of Saskatchewan,
introduced a Bill in the Legislature of that
province. I have a copy of that Bill under
my hand. It is entitled, "An Act to amend
the Court of Appeal Act," and it provides
that:
His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, enacts as follows:
1. The Court of Appeal Act is amended in
the manner hereinafter set forth.
2. Subsection 1 of section 3 is amended by
substituting the words "four" for ",three" in
the fourth line.

That is the section which provides for
the number of judges in the Court of Appeal; and that Bill was introduced by Mr.
Martin, whose name is on it. It became
law on the 9th of February, 1922. One
month after it became law the Minister
of Justice in this Parliament introduced
his resolution providing for the approval
of this action and the creation of an additional judge and the payment of $9,000. I
think we ought to have some explanation
of a matter of that kind, if honourable
gentlemen are going to the length of creating judgeships for the purpose of providing
for their friends. This honourable gentleHon. Mr. FOWLER.

man in the West creates the office, and
my honourable friend opposite and his colleagues are going to put into that office
the gentleman who created the office.
That is a queer kind of political morality,
as I understand it, and I think it is a very
queer kind of reason for asking this Parliament to authorise the appointment of an
additional judge at a salary of $9,000.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And there is more:
there are his expenses.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: As I said before,
it is plain to me that the whole matter is
arranged between Ottawa and Regina. The
statutes of Saskatchewan were consolidated in 1920. This amending Act relates
to the Consolidated Act of 1920. If there
was a great demand for an additional judge
in the province of Saskatchewan I would
presume that they would have had some
idea of it in 1920, a little over a year ago,
and would have made provision at that
time. But when the statutes were consolidated they said that three judges with the
Chief Justice would be enough in the Court
of Appeal. Out of political exigenciesand I use that phrase advisedly on the
evidence I have before me-and not because of the need of another judge, we are
being asked to create a new judgeship and
to provide $9,000 for pay for it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Could
my honourable friend say whether in his
researches he met with any indications of
this necessity previous to the 6th of December last?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: None. I think the
great extremity arose when ex-Premier
Martin was playing on both sides of the
fence during the early part of the campaign. In the last week of the campaign
he decided to come out in support of the
present Prime Minister. That caused a
break-up in his Government, Mr. Maharg,
a Progressive member, resigning. It was
then that the light came into the mind of
Mr. Martin that he had awakened enemies
and created a situation that would be his
own undoing; and he consequently decided
that he had better make the going good,
which he did by this little Bill to which
I have referred. Now my honourable
friends opposite come to his assistance. I
say, honourable gentlemen, the reasons
given by the leader of the Government are
not sufficient for the passing of this Bill,
and I think he should defer further consideration of the Bill before asking us to
vote this additional charge on the Treasury.

APRIL 26, 1922
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I regret that I have no informa
tion to give to the House in regard to this
matter; but while the honourable gentleman who has just taken his seat was speaking it struck me that there has been undue haste in this matter. I know of cases
in which provincial govern-ments have made
provision for an extra judge and in which
no appointment has been made for several
years. Here we have the case of an Act
of the Legislature being passed in February
and a Bill being introduced in the House
of Commons as soon as it meets and being
sent to us so that we might act as a rubber stamp-or, rather, it is a case of dropping a nickel in a slot and out comes a
judgeship worth $9,000 a year. A short
time ago I listened to a discussion in another place in which it was stated that we
could not afford to send the militia of this
country out for five or six days training.
I have no desire to oppose this appointment if there is any necessity for it; but
if it is put on political grounds, I think this
honourable body should not be expected to
carry out any political manoeuvres at the
instigation of honourable gentlemen in another place. I know that at the present
time there is a vacancy in Manitoba, and
I do not know of any haste to make an
appointment.
The leader of the Government in this
House has not given us any facts in regard
to this case. In the province of Manitoba
is the third city in size in the Dominion
of Canada, where there is a great deal of
litigation of a very important character,
and I have no hesitation in saying that
even there the Court of Appeal could get
along very well with only four judges. We
all know that an Appeal Judge does not
try any cases, but that before they come
to him they must be tried in the first place
by the trial judges. I should like to ask
the leader of the Government if this appointment is going to be made immediately
if this Bill goes through?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I know
nothing about it. I may also say that I
have not read in the newspapers the information which my honourable friend from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) has imparted
to this Chamber. But, as my honourable
friend has asked for some further data as
to litigation in !Saskatchewan, and the
necessity for the fourth judgeHon. Mr. McMEANS: The. fifth judge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to adjourning this motion in order
S--7

97

to get the information that he desires and
that is probably in the possession of the
Department.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Under these circumstances, I move the adjournment of
the debate.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Before the debate is adjourned, may I say a few words?
Not being a member of the legal profession, I do not know anything at all as to
the amount of litigation in Saskatchewan
as compared with that in the other provinces; but I would like to point out that
Saskatchewan bas about 200,000 more
people than either the province of Manitoba or the province of Alberta. The conditions in the province of Saskatchewan
are absolutely the same as those in the
adjoining provinces.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
not at all. One is agricultural, and the
other is very varied indeed.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: There is very
little difference, except that in Alberta they
have less grain growing, and more cattle
raising, and that there is a good deal of
coal mining. The conditions are very
much the same, and naturally there will
be more litigation where there are 200,000
more people in a province than where there
are that many less. Yet my honourable
friends thought it was all right to appoint
five judges to the Appeal Court in both of
those adjoining provinces. My honourable
friends are very anxious to practice
economy, but there is another case along
these lines that I would like to draw
to their attention as to the Government
making places and positions and providing
salaries for their friends. If there is one
case in the country that is objectionable I
think it is that of the late Minister of Justice, a man drawing a good pension from
Canada; yet when he resigned the office
of Minister of Justice a position was made
for him, and a salary, not of $9,000 a year,
but of $10,000 a year was provided in addition to his pension, and he is drawing
that salary now.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Why don't you
cut it off?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: If there is not
work enough for judges to do in some of
the provinces, there is ten times less need
for a man to do the work for which that
honourable gentleman was appointed. My
honourable friend bas taken a sudden fit
of economy.

acceptability to those who constituted the
committees. Re had been a business man
during practically his entire life. He had
been identified in a large way with business,
in this Chamber we had the advantage of
the experience, observation and judgment
which he brought to bear upon ail business
questions and problems with which we
have hadl to deal.
His death has corne as a shock to ail of
us. It was, I think, only a week ago that
I had the pleasure of dining with him.
Although at the beginning of this Session
he carne to us in impaired health, he was,
at the tirne ta which I refer, optimistic as
to his early recovery and seemed to me
to possess his usual health and spirits. I
was therefore particularly shocked whe-.,
the other day I learned that hie had been
taken to the hospital in a very serious
condition, a condition which has proved
fatal to hirn. It reminds us, honourable
gentlemen, of what shadows we are and
what shadows we pursue. I arn sure that
this Senate will for rnany years cherish
the pleasant mernories which we entertain
for our late colleague, and we to-day
express aur sympathy with his family in
the great bereavement which they have
suiffered.
DAGENAIS

DIVORCE CASE

REPORT 0F COMMITTE

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT moved concurrence in the twenty-fourth report of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, to whom
was referred the petition of Marie Louise
Dagenais, together with the evidence taken
before the said Committee.
Hon. GEORGE W. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, usually Bills of this kind
pass, through this Chamber without contest. The House is perfectly satisfied,' as
a usual thing, with the conclusions and
judgment of the Comrnittee. But, looking
over the evidence adduced before the
Commrittee in this case, I ar n ot satisi4ied
that this divorce should be granted. I do
know whether or not honourable gentlemen
are familiar with this evidence. It is
largely o! a hypothetical nature, and it
seems to me does not under ail the circumstances cornpletely support the findings
o! the Cornmittee. It was alleged that the
husband was unable to consummate the
marriage; that owing to some physical
infirmity hie was not capable of that conS-7à

summation which is so important, and, I
suppose, pleasurable, in connection with
the ancient institution o! matrimony. This
lady lived more or less in connubial bliss
with Mr. Dagenais for twenty-four years,
during ail o! which tirne the sarnie incappacity on his part was present, without
any complaint or effort being made by
hier to have the marriage tic dissolved.
This !act, it seems to me, militates against
hier. It does seem to me that having passed
the period of youth and exuberance, when
the consummnation would be of great
importance to the lady, she niight have
spent the rest of hier existence in the
sanie condition. Because for some reason
or other the lady desires to get another
partner in life is not in itself sufficient cause
to dissolve the marriage contract. There
is no evidence, nor is any attempt made to
introduce evidence, that outside o! this one
particular thing the husband was flot a
proper husband and did not do his duty by
his wife faithfully, honestly, and honourably. So I ask that honourable gentlemen,
before voting for this Bill, will carefully
scan the evidence in this particular case.
I do flot profess to read the evidence in all
these cases, but this case had peculiar incidents connected with it, which caused me
to look it over. The evidence of the lady
hersel!, it seerns to me, is faulty. She
clainis that certain things occurred during
the attempts that were made at consummation, and it does seeni to me that it
would be difficult for hier to speak accurately as ta what the results were. The
evidence of the medical man certainly does
not add any strength at alI to the case,
because hie was unable to say that the
husband was incapable of perforrning the
act which is necessary for the consummation of a marriage.
As I have said before, I do not think that
the Senate should encourage divorce; for
it is a solernn thing for two persans ta
pledge thernselves in a contract for ife, and
it is only in exceptianal cases that that contract should be dissolved; and I must say
honourable gentlemen, that ta my mind the
evidence adduced. hered, particularly the
evidence of the medical man, does not support the case for the petitioner.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He was very carefuI.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He was very careful, properly sa.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Was the case
defended? Was anybody heard representing the opposite aide?

100

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No; the case was
not defended. I suppose that the husband
probably did not like to appear in a case
of that kind. My honourable friend, I
fancy, would feel likewise. So that is not
to be taken against him, honourable gentlemen. He would have a natural reluctance
to come before the Committee and exhibit
himself or give evidence in regard ta the
matter. I do not know how that might be
done except in the presence of the Committee, and it would be shocking, I am sure,
to the Chief Justice who presides honourably over that Court to have an exhibition
of that kind. Taking it all in all, honourable gentlemen, I think that this report
should be rejected. I-for one--will vote
against it, because I do not believe in easy
divorce. I look upon the marriage contract as a very sacred thing, and I think it
is only, as I say, in exceptional cases that
marriages should be dissolved. We should
require before this tribunal, this high court
of Parliament, at least as strong evidence
as would be required before a court; and,
as a barrister of considerable length of
time and practice, I confidently state that
no court in the land charged with the conduct of divorce would grant a divorce on
the evidence adduced in this case. I am
sure that in my own province it would not
be donc, and I do not think this high court
of Paliament should accept less evidence
than would an ordinary court of divorce
and matrimonial causes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Which is the
honourable gentleman's province?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Mine is the province of New Brunswick, I am happy and
proud to say.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Not a bad province
either.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I thought the
honourable gentleman might be from the
province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not know of
a better province in Canada. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) has
spoken of Quebec. I do not know whether
or not he speaks in slighting terms, but
I want to say right here and now, though
I do not come from the Province of Quebec,
that, so far as legislation is concerned,
Quebec is the most sane province in Canada.
That is my answer to the suggestion of
my honourable friend that I come from
Quobec. Quebec is opposed to woman
suffrage, which is one of the greatest
curses ever inflicted on this country; and
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Quebec is opposed to prohibition, which is
another fact in its favor. Honourable
gentlemen, even if alone in doing so, I
intend to vote against this report.
Hon. WILLIAM PROUDFOOT: Honourable gentlemen, as Chairman of the
Committee I want to say a few words on
this matter. The evidence given was, to
the mind of the Committee, satisfactory,
and I am certain that if any honourable
member of this House will sit down and
read carefully the evidence as it was given
before the Committee, he will come to the
conclusion that this was a proper case in
which to grant a divorce. We had the
advantage of hearing the witnesses; we
had the advantage of knowing the stand
that was taken, not only by the petitioner,
but also by the doctor who gave evidence.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There was no stand
taken, that was the trouble.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Well, the
statement made by my honourable friend
just now shows clearly, if it is correct,
that the Committee were perfectly justified
in taking the course they did take.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That was the
allegation.
I was only
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
referring to what the honourable gentleman said.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I say that was the
allegation.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is a pity
that such an eminent barrister as our
honourable friend is not a member of that
Committee.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: God forbid!
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If he were a
member of that Committee, I am perfectly
safe in saying he would have taken exactly
the same view that the members of the
Committee did, and would have favored
the granting of the divorce.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The honourable gentleman says no now because he
desires to raise the question in the House.
I do not know exactly why he desires to
make objection to this particular divorce,
but of course every one is entitled to his
opinion. All I have to say, honourable
gentlemen, is that if you have not had an
opportunity of reading over the evidence
and you feel that you are not in a position
to deal with the case to-day, we can let the
report stand over. I have no desire to

APRIL 27, 1922
push the matter to a vote to-day if honourable gentlemen have not had the opportunity of examining the evidence.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Fowler) is satisfied
with the explanation now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Stand.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Stand.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The Hon. the Speaker declared the
motion carried.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We will have a
vote.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: No, no; I say it is
"not content". I want a vote on this
question called by His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to honourable gentlemen that His
Honour the Speaker has already declared
the report carried. It is too late now.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I say it is not carried. I want a vote taken.
The Hon. The SPEAKER: I would explain to honourable gentlemen that I
waited long enough for members to rise,
and I did not see more than one honourable
gentleman standing. That is not sufficient
according to our rules.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There were two
who rose.
The Hon. The SPEAKER: I declare the
motion carried.
The report was concurred in.

BRITISH EMPIRE ASSURANCE
COMPANY
SECOND READING

Hon. G. V. WHITE moved the second
reading of Bill 2, an Act to incorporate
British Empire Assurance Company.

101

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, the title of this Bill is the British
There was
Empire Assurance Company.
a company called the British Empire
Mutual Life Assurance Company, which
was amalgamated with the Phoenix Assurance Company of London, and absorbed by
it, as I am informed. I have been asked
by the Phonix Assurance Company ýof
London to object to the same title being
given to this company as was held by the
former company, because it would conflict
with the other company, and might induce
intending insurers to think that they were
insuring in the Phonix Assurance Company
of London when they were insured in the
other company, and to prevent further
friction. I have carried out that request
by giving notice of this protest. I have no
objection to the remainder of the Bill, its
machinery or its conditions, and I would
move that it be submitted to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, so that those
who promote the Bill might there have an
opportunity of conferring with the Committee and altering the title of the company. The other objects of the company
can then be carried out.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: In reference to the
objection raised by the honourable member
from Halifax, I beg to state that when this
matter came before the Committee on
Banking and Commerce of the House of
Commons this objection was raised. I
have taken occasion to look into the matter,
and have discussed it with the Superintendent of Insurance, and I find that the facts
are as follows. Prior to 1903 a company
was incorporated under the name, British
Empire Mutual Life Assurance Company.
In 1903 this company was merged with the
Pelican Life Insurance Company under an
Imperial Act, with the name Pelican and
British Empire Life Office Act, 1903, this
company doing solely a life insurance
business. The British Empire Assurance
Company, whose Bill is before us to-day, is
a fire company. In the Pelican and British
Empire Life Office Act as passed in 1903
was the following section:
6. From and atter the commencement of this
act the British Empire Company shall wholly
cease to undertake any new business In the
way of Life Assurance or otherwise and when
the transfer of the assets of the British Empire
Company has been completed pursuant to the
Memorandum of terms the British Empire Company shall ipso facto be dissolved and the
British Empire Mutual Life Assurance Act
1852 shall be and the same is hereby repealed.
A certificate in writing under the hands of a
majority of the directors of the Combined Office

02

SENATE

that the transfer aforesaid has been completed
shall when filed with the Registrar of Joint
Stock Companies be conclusive evidence thereof.

This goes to show that that company
waived the right to the use of that name.
I understand that in 1908 these companies
were merged with the Phoenix Assurance
Company of London, England, and did
away entirely with the former name. In
so far as this objection is concerned, I feel
that it is not well founded I might also
point out that one of the other companies,
the British America Assurance Company,
also raises objection to the name in view of
the fact that they had a subsidiary or underwriters' company called the British
Empire Underwriters of the British America Assurance Company. I am not a lawyer, but from all I can learn these underwriter companies are not incorporated companies, and the Insurance Department does
not recognize them as such.
That being
the case, the objection raised by the British America Assurance Company does not
seem well founded. Under these circumstances, and in view of the fact that the
Superintendent of Insurance informs me
that this company has satisfied all the
requirements imposed by the Insurance
Act, it seems to me that no just grounds
can be taken for objecting to the name of
this company.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: I rise to second
the resolution offered by the senior member for Halifax. I hold in my hand a
letter from one of the managers of the
Phoenix Assurance Company, which refers
to clause 6 in the Dominion Insurance Act
of 1917:
Before issuing a license to a company, the

minister must be satisfied that the corporate
name of the company is not that of any other
known company incorporated or unincorporated,
or any name liabe to be confounded therewith
or otherwise on public grounds objectionable.

That is a very essential matter, I think,
which would engage the attention of most
policy holders. The British Empire Mutual
Life Assurance Company was owned and
controlled by the Phoenix Assurance Company for some time. I am told it has hundreds of policies throughout this country,
and I fail to see why this company could not
select some other name that would not conflict with a name that has been in existence
for such a long period. I think they could
easily find some name that would be just
as reasonable as the one they have selected.
The difference is very slight; one of them
is known as the British Empire Mutual
Life Assurance Company, which is owned
Hon. G. V. WHITE.

by the Phoenix Assurance Company, Limited, whilst the other one is the British
Empire Assurance Company. I think there
is too much sameness, and that policy
holders would be apt to make the mistake
that the member from Halifax has mentioned.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I do not usually
agree with my honourable friend from
Halifax, but in the present instance I think
he has made a very reasonable suggestion
-that this Bill should go to the Banking
and Commerce Committee and be threshed
out there. There is a good deal to be said
on both sides of the question, and when
five or ten men get together around a table
they will probably arrive at some conclusion that will be reasonable.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I think there is
another objection to the title of this Bill.
We have in Canada a large insurance company doing business under the name of the
North Empire, which is very much like
the name of the proposed company, and a
good many people could very easily get the
names mixed-North Empire or British
Empire. The North Empire'is a fire insurance company; I do not know whether
the proposed British Empire Company is
for fire, or life, or what.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Fire.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Then they are
both in exactly the same business, and one
would be known as the British Empire and
the other as the North Empire. I think it
would be very objectionable to have two
names so much alike. As the company is
not yet incorporated I think it would be
possible to choose a name that would not
be objectionable.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: I would like to
point out that the incorporators of this
company submitted several names to the
department, and no objection was taken
by it to this name. Might I also point out
that at the present time there are numerous insurance companies doing business
in Canada with the word "British"
attached to the title, such as the British
Crown, the British General, the British
Traders, the British Colonial, and the
British Northwestern. I would also say
that when this matter came up one of the
officials of the Insurance Department
telephoned to the agents of several
companies in this city and asked them
if they did business in connection with a
British Assurance company. They immediately asked whether he meant the

1Uf

APRIL 27, 1922

British Colonial, the British Traders, the
British General, or what specific British
company was alluded to. Therefore, I
think the objection raised, that the term
"British" would be misleading, is not wel
founded.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: In reply to
the honourable member from Pembroke. . .
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I do not like
to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but
he bas already spoken. I would also point
out to the House that the motion made by
the honourable member for Halifax is
really unnecessary. After the Bill gets its
second reading, it goes to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, where it will be
discussed as to title and terms.
Ion. Mr. DANDURAND: The general
practice bas been to leave these matters
of title to the Committee, which reports
upon them.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

PENITENTIARY BILL
SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 25, an Act to amend
the Penitentiary Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill bas for its object the settling of a
difficulty which bas existed for a number
of years in the transfer of prisoners from
a common jail to the penitentiary after
they have been condemned.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is,
for a capital offence?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, for ahl
offences. The Penitentiary Act requires
that the surgeon of the jail in which the
prisoner is detained shall give a certificate
of good health to the prisoner, and that
when he has reached the penitentiary the
surgeon of the penitentiary shall certify
again to the state of health of the prisoner,
and to the fact that he is not infected with
a contagious disease. If he is the warden
of the penitentiary is not authorized to
receive him, and yet he has been delivered
over by the jailer or the sheriff of the
district. The question has arisen as to the
right of the jailer to receive him back
after he has been refused at the penitentiary, and it is in order to overcome that
difficulty that the present Bill has been
introduced. I do not know whether honourable gentlemen wish me to read the Act
as it stands and then the proposed amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Reserve
it until the Committee stage.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
NATIONAL DEFENCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 27, an Act respecting
the Department of National Defence.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
has for its object the uniting of the Department of Militia, the Naval Department,
and the Air Service of Canada into one
Department, namely, that of Defence. The
Act will be cited as the National Defence
Act. It is for the purpose of simplifying
the work of these various branches of the
defence of Canada, and, if possible, reducing the expenditure.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is it the intention
of the Government to reduce the staff by
getting rid of some of the heads of departments, and thus effect a saving in salaries
to the country, or are they going to carry
an unwieldy staff?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think there
is power vested in the Minister to retire
some of the officers who may be deemed to
be useless, and to allow them pensions.
When we go into Committee I think my
honourable friend will find that machinery
is provided for reducing the staff. To what
extent the Minister will succeed I do not
know; but, if I am not mistaken, he bas
indicated in the other Chamber his desire
to do so.

Lui

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can my
honourable friend say to what extent this
fusion has been carried out up to the present time? I understand that the Naval
Branch of the Marine and Fisheries Department is a distinct department. I
undestand that the Naval Department is
now under the authority of the Minister of
Militia.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, that is
as I understand it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And the
fusion is already taking place. Of course,
since its inception, the Air Service has
been connected with the Department of
Militia; hence the only department of the
public service which will become fused with
the Militia Department is the Naval Department. To what extent has that merger
been carried out up to the present time?
Have the officers of the Naval Department
been retained, and are they administering
the services of that Department as separate and apart from the defence duties as
formerly administered by the Department
of Militia?
And before my honourable friend rises
to answer, may I ask to what extent are
we maintaining the Air Service at the present time? Shortly after the Armistice was
entered into, the Air Service was established on a rather elaborate scale, but I
think it has since been diminished very
considerably.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Instead of
giving my honourable friend pure and
simple impressions, I will 'postpone my
answer until we go into Committee on the
Bill, when I shall have the exact data.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the

adjourned debate on the inquiry of the
Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster:
That he will call attention to the aims and
work of the League of Nations and will inquire :-1. If the Government bas re'ceived any
report from the representatives of Canada as
to the second Assembly of the League of
Nations held in Geneva in September and October, 1921, and if so, will this report be laid on
the table for the information of members?
2. If the Government bas received the printed
reports of the Council of the League of Nations
made to the first and second Assembly, and if
so, will copies of these reports be laid on the
table for the information of nembers?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

3. If the Government has received the printed
monthly summary and supplementary reports
of the League of Nations, and will copies of
these reports be brought down?

Hon. GIDEON D. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, it is not my purpose
long to detain the House in the discussion
of this question. I think we all appreciate
the usefulness of the very frank and instructive address made yesterday by the

right honourable member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), who
very fittingly mentioned his purpose in
bringing the question before this House,
and his intention to remind the House and
the country from time to time of this important institution, its prospects, its opportunities, and its accompli'shments.
There is, however, one feature of the
work of the League of Nations which my
right honourable friend did not specifically
refer to; and it is not because of any particular desire on my part to bring before
the House the achievements or the desires
of Organized Labour throughout the
world, but rather for the purpose of
smoothing, if possible, the way to better
understanding on the part of public men,
and to help to promote, if possible. better
relations between employer and employed,

that I take this opportunity of saying a
few words with reference to the Labour
Convention and the labour clauses of the
Treaty of Peace as set out in Article 13
of that document.
In ancient times war usually emanated
from one of three causes: the desire for
conquest; the desire for revenge arising
out of the memory of previous contests;
and, very often, the prospects of plunder.
But, due to the march of civilzation, conditions changed throughout the world, and
wars were brought about by other causes,
and we find that economie pressure due to
the desire and the necessity of commercial
expansion, the restriction of countries because of lack of raw materials required for
their industrial life, and sometimes immigration, wield an influence on this question; and, again, we frequently find wars
arising because of a desire to turn the
attention of the people of a nation from
their own internal difficulties. I think that
the ast great war was perhaps at least
hastened in some degree by reason of the
latter cause.
For some years past Organized Labour
throughout the civilized countries of the
world bas steadfastly turned its attention
in the direction of promoting and assisting
in the promotion of universal peace.
It

APRIL 27, 1922
formed an organization known as the
International Organization on Labour
Legislation, to render aid and assistance
to the Hague Tribunal in the efforts being
made in that direction. In 1914, when the
unfortunate World War swept down upon
us, there were millions of working people
who still clung to the hope, and, indeed,
the belief that that determination of
Labour throughout the world would have
a sa-lutary effect in preventing a world
war. That hope was clung to tenaciously
by some for a considerable period, but as
time went on it became apparent that it
must be set aside, and that every country
that loved liberty, and the people in every
country who believed in democratic institutions, must put their shoulder to the
wheel and do their part to carry on the
great struggle.
If there is any doubt in the mind of any
honourable gentleman, I can perhaps best
illustrate that and prove it to the House
by simply referring to the actions of
Organized Labour on the North American
continent. There are resolutions on record
as far back as 1913, clearly indicating the
tendency that I have mentioned, and the
desire on the part of Organized Labour in
North America to foster and promote
universal peace. In 1916 that idea was
temporarily abandoned; and we know that
in that year the legislative mouthpieces of
Organized Labour on this continent the
Trades and Labour Congress in Canada,
and the American Federation of Labour
in the United States-went on record as
approving, as necessary, unstinted participation in the war. We know that in 1917 the
American Federation of Labour at its
convention made very strong pronouncements upon this subject. We also know
that in March of that year there was
held in the city of Washington a gathering
of representatives of something over one
hundred different labour organizations,
representing over 4,000,000 men, the result of which was that a delegation waited
upon the President of the United States
and submitted to him the views of Organized Labour. It is a matter of history
and record that within three weeks of the
time that document was placed in the
hands of the President of that great
country, the period of procrastination
ended and the United States came in.
During all this time, and again in the
fall of 1917, Organized Labour reiterated
its faith in the policy of universal peace,
and its readiness to participate in such a
oolicy; and urged that whenever the war

105

might end the common people, the wageearners who, by the way, represented more
than 50 per cent of the Canadian army,
and I assume that the same percentage
might be found in every army in the fieldshould have some right to recognition and
consultation when the terms of peace came
to be discussed. Resolutions to that effect
were passed in various countries, and
submitted to the Governments of those
countries. The Governments, however, had
already recognized the necessity of cooperation with the men who must do the
work, and that the war was not being won
on the field of battle alone, but in the
munition factories, the mines, and other
institutions throughout the countries
participating in the war.
Perhaps I may best emphasize that
fact by pointing out a few simple illustrations. In France, I think just about the
time war was declared, if not shortly
before, two outstanding gentlemen in the
labour world, both socialists, were wielding a strong influence against military
aggression. One of them for reasons which,
so far as I know, have never been ascertained, was assassinated; his colleague was
on the point of touring France and speaking in protest against that crime when the
war came. What was the result? That
gentleman, who is now the head of the
International Labour Office at Geneva, was
almost immediately taken into the Cabinet
of the French Government, and became
Minister of Munitions. I mention this to
indicate that when the pinch came, when
France was in danger, when the people
and the Government of that country were
attacked by a foreign foe, what may have
been regarded previously as advanced
radical views on labour and social questions
were set aside in the mind of that man and
many others like him, who turned in and
did their part, and an important part, in
the carrying on of the war.
Likewise in England we find such men
as the Hon. George Barnes, Mr. Clynes,
and Mr. J. H. Thomas all taking a prominent part as members of the Government; also another prominent labour man
in England, Mr. Peter Wright a gentleman
who has visited this country on several
occasions. We know the sentiments expressed by those men, and believe them
because of the work they did in assisting
to carry the war to a successful conclusion.
In North America, we know what the
President of the American Federation of
Labour did-his bringing together in
April the convention of which I speak, and
his voicing of labour's views before the

D6

SENATE

President of the United States. We know
how Labour got behind the efforts of the
Governments of the United States and
Canada.
So when the time did come to sit around
the table at Versailles and discuss the
Treaty of Peace there was practically no
voice raised in opposition to the desire of
Labour to have representation and to have
its future considered when the conference
was attempting to reach its conclusions.
Quite early in January of 1919, quite early
in the formulation of the Treaty of Peace
-I think, in Article 22-the high contracting parties agreed upon certain basic principles on this all-important subject and
appointed a special commission to deal with
it. I do not desire to weary the House by
reading at length, but I would like to quote
just that one little paragraph. This is
Article 22 of the Treaty as it was proposed:
The high contracting parties will endeavour
to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women and children,
both in thier own countries and in all countries
to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and to that end agree to establish as part of the organization of the League a
permanent bureau of labour.

A special commission was appointed, as

I have said, to deal with this all-important
subject and to work out such clauses and
regulations as were necessary to be inserted
in the Treaty itself. Mr. Samuel Gompers,
the President of the American Federation
of Labour, was unanimously elected by the
delegates from the various countries there
present as the chairman of that commission. The commission held thirty-five sittings, and in April, I think, brought in its
conclusions and recommendations, which
formed the basis of what is Part XIII of
the Treaty of Peace. Doubtless honourable gentlemen have perused the Treaty,
but perhaps they have not read that one
clause with all the attention that it merits,
and I crave your attention for just a moment. Let us consider why the nations,
members of the League, inserted Part XIII,
what their object was, and whether or not
it was a proper and laudable one. If it
was, does it not deserve our best support?
Section 1 of the Labour part, Part XIII
of the Treaty, states:
Whereas the League of Nations bas for its
object the establishment of universal peace, and
such a peace can be established only if it is
based upon social justice;
And whereas conditions of labour exist Involving such injustice, hardship and privation
to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and harmony of
the world are imperilled; and an improvement
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

of those conditions is urgently required: as,
for example, by the regulation of the hours
of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of
the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living
wage, the protection of the worker against
sickness, disease and injury arising out of his
empiloyment, the protection of chiýldren, young
persons and women, provision for old age and
injury, protection of the interests of workers
when employed in countries other than their
own, recognition of the principle of freedom of
association, the organisation of vocational and
technical education and other measures;
Whereas also the failure of any nation to
adopt humane conditions of labour is an
obstacle in the way of other nations which
desire to improve the conditions in their own
countries;
The High Contracting Parties, moved by
sentiments of justice and humanity, as well as
by the desire to secure the permanent peace of
the world, agree to the following:

Then follow the various clauses of the
Labour convention in the Treaty. Briefly
they provide for the organization of a permanent office which shall be the central
point from which shall emanate to all the
governments of countries that are members of the League, and to the organizations chiefly representative of capital and
of labour in those countries, all information
respecting
industrial
conditions
throughout the world; and it is provided
that there shall be held annually a conference which shall be attended by four
delegates from each country in the League,
two representing the government, one
representing employers, and one representing labour, together with such advisers
as the country may determine to send, a
schedule in that connection being outlined
as a recommendation.
The first International Labour Conference was held in the City of Washington
in November, 1919, and was attended by
representatives of governments, of employers, and of labour from thirty-eight
countries of the world. It was an experiment. It was, as I might term it in my
homely way, a glorified board of conciliation. Instead of individual employers and
workmen sitting down to adjust a difference or dispute, there were representatives
of employers from thirty-eight countries,
representatives of labour from thirty-eight
countries, and representatives of thirtyeight governments, sitting in conference
and trying to harmonize different viewpoints. When one discovered the tremendous divergence of opinions and the
great difference in conditions in various
countries, one could readily realize the difficulty of trying to bring about on any
particular subject any standard of condi-

APRIL 27, 1922
tions that would be satisfactory, or even
fair, to all of those different nations.
The various subjects under éonsideration
were naturally and properly referred to
different committees, upon which most of
the countries had representation, and on
almost all subjects unanimous conclusions
were subsequently reached.
On some questions, it was obvious, uniformity was not possible. For example,
on the question of hours of labour it was
obvious that some of the countries represented at that conference could not adopt a
universal eight-hour law, or even go back
and recommend such a law to their government under their existing conditions--why?
Because they had not yet advanced one step
along the path of progress and in those
countries people were working twelve hours
a day and seven days a week, and children
of eight to ten years or age were employed
in their factories. It would entirely upset
their system of industrial activity to make
all these changes overnight.
The International Labour Conference
was wise enough to realize that a revolutionary action of that sort could not be
taken at once; but steps were taken in
the proper direction, and the three countries principally concerned-Japan, China,
and India-all made promises of improvement. They determined what those promises should be and then made them to the
Conference. As a result, the industrial
conditions in those three countries have
improved since then, and as time goes by the
conditions of employment ànd of life among
workmen throughout the different countries of the world, parties to the League,
will become more and more standardized;
so that the disputes that arise because of
the competition of cheap labour in one
country as against the labour of our North
American continent, for example, will guadually fade away and the possibilities of
international disputes arising out of those
industrial questions will dissappear.
I want to express, however, my very
sincere and honest conviction that, while
the League of Nations is theoretically an
admirable institution and we all hope and
pray for its final success, we must not be
under the illusion that its stability is in
any way, as yet, really assured. It is to
me a house of cards. It is beautiful in
appearance and is destined, if nobody kicks
a hole in it, to be a great blessing to the
world; but that can be accomplished only
by the exercise of consideration and care
and thought and patience on the part of
all the members. I may be a little
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

pessimistic on this point because of
some years of experience in connection with the adjustment of industrial
disputes. In thinking of the difficulties
that we encounter even in the adjustment of
disputes on a reasonably large scale, my
thoughts wander back to 1918, when in the
city of Vancouver there were 10,500 men
on strike, members of eleven différent organizations, employed by 55 employers,
and I had a committee of 24 employers
and 52 labour men sit down and try to
adjust that dispute. Well, we had a merry
time for nine days, and finally a conclusion was reached that satisfactorily ironed
out the difficulty. But I can imagine what
it must mean to magnify the situation to
the extent of seating together representatives of fifty odd nations, each of whom is
in his own country more or less a dictator
of policy and comes to a convention of that
sort firm in his conviction that the methods
and views of his own country are right.
There must be a great deal of care and
patience exercised and diplomacy indulged
in to prevent accident if not disaster. I
think we cannot too highly appreciate or
commend the splendid progress that has
been made thus far and the sagacity with
which these questions of tremendous international importance have been handled;
and, so far as our country is concerned. I
sincerely hope that it may continue along
the lines that it has followed since the
League came into existence, and that
Canada may continue to do her part.
There is a great responsibility upon
each member of the League-a responsibility that cannot be excused even
because of failure to participate in the
deliberations of the League and of the
organizations subsidiary thereto. At the
Washington Conference, for example, there
was an almost everwhelming desire and a
persistent attempt on the part of at least
two countries to arrange internationally for
the control and direction of immigration
in the various countries of the world.
Honourable gentlemen can readily appreciate how Canada would view a proposition of that sort. A young country
that is receiving immigration and has no
emigration to other countries to speak of,
Canada necessarily takes the position that
it must 'retain local autonomy in the matter of its immigration policy. So I say
that so long as Canada is a member of
the League of Nations she must, in order
to fulfil her obligations, take an active
interest in the deliberations not only of the
League itself, but of all the organizations
subsidiary thereto; otherwise, if something

108

SENATE

is "slipped over"-may I use that term?
-we cannot repudiate our own responsibility because of not having paid attention
to it.
There is very much that might be said
in connection with this important branch
of the work of the League of Nations. I
am confident that there is no doubt of the
help that Organized Labour can be, and
will be if the governments in the various
countries, parties to the League, will continue the same policy of recognition of
Labour and co-operation with it that they
followed during the war, when they needed
Labour's assistance, and will not revert
to policies that were followed by most
countries prior to the outbreak of the war.
Referring just briefly to our own country, I
think honourable gentlemen know full well
that from 1917 on, with the exception of
some radical minds and radical advisers in
Canada, the working population of this
country did its duty. It stood behind the
Government and the State in performing
its part in the war. When we think of
some of our large industrial and transportation organizations and of what their
men did-when we remember that over
11,000 men out of about 60,000 in the employ of the Canadian Pacific railway alone
voluntarily offered their services to their
country; that in the city of Toronto, out
of 2,300 men employed on the Toronto
street railway, 832 men, or more than 25
per cent, voluntarily enlisted for military
service; that in the Maritime provinces,
where a large proportion of the industrial
population is of Scottish or other British
descentHon. Mr. MURPHY: Not all British.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -at least 20
per cent did likewise,-we must appreciate
that the working population feel, and have
a right to feel, that now that the dangers
consequent upon the war have ipassed they
are entitled to consideration and consultation when matters of national interest and
national policy are under discussion. During the period of the war, from 1917 on, it
was the announced policy of the Government-and I have never heard anyone
say it was not properly and fully carried
out-to give labour representation on all
important commissions, boards, etc., that
had to deal with public matters. Labour
was given representation, I think, on every
single one, and I have heard no complaint
in that connection. When it came to the
negotiation of the Treaty of Peace, the
Premier of Canada took with him probably
the foremost and most experienced man in
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the organized labour world in Canada-I
refer to Mr. P. M. Draper, Secretary of the
Trades Congress-with him to Versailles,
and Mr. Draper and Sir Robert Borden
played an important part in the working
out of the details and the final consummation of Part XIII of the Treaty of Peace.
Then it became Canada's duty to do its
part and to participate in the conferences
to which I have referred. To the Washington Conference in 1919 the Government
sent two Government representatives and
the full complement of employer and labour
delegates. It participated in the conferences at Genoa and at Geneva, and succeeded in obtaining representation for this
country on the governing body of the International Labour Office. The impression
that was made and the prestige obtained
for Canada at the Washington Conference,
largely through the splendid work of the
Hon. Mr. Rowell, who was one of the Government's representatives
there, have
placed the Labour movement and Canadian
Labour high in the opinion of other countries of the world. I hope to see that
position maintained. I regret to note that
during the past few months there has not
seemed to be that same desire for Canada
to co-operate fully and to do its full part
in these meetings.
In addition to our participating fully in
those international questions, I think each
member of the League is under obligation
to attempt to do its best to maintain such
relations internally between Capital and
Labour as will ensure its ability to play a
useful part in any international field. It
is in that connection that I fear somewhat
for the -future. I recall that about the
9th of January last an announcement went
forth from a Minister of the Crown that
the labour difficulties in Canada must be
sqttled by Capital and Labour getting
together, and that they must and shall do
so. One week later, on the 17th of January, one of the largest organizations of
employers in this country, who had been
working in close co-operation with the
organizations of workmen in that sane
industry-I refer to the Building and Construction industry, which employs many
thousands of men throughout Canadawent on record by passing a resolution repudiating any attempts at further co-operation along the lines of an industrial
council, and, referring to the declaration
that was made by the Minister of the
Crown, asked, "Who is this that says we
must and shall do these things?" Honourable gentlemen, it is to me lamentable

ing for a fairly long time, while I attempt to
deal with a matter of very great importance. I regret that I am not in better
form, and I would ask that you bear with
me if I very often refer to my notes.
Before discussing the Bill proper, I think
it wise, honourable gentlemen, to review
briefly the history of the cold storage
system as we have it in Canada to-day,
so that we may all be seized of the information and know exactly what we are dealing
with. In looking over the records of the
legislation in Canada on this matter, I find
that the first was a short Act, passed in
1907, intituled "An Act to encourage the
establishment of cold storage warehouses
for the preservation of perishable food products." The Statute is a short one, and
it may be well to place it ou record, so that
the House may know exactly what was done
in the first place. It is cha iter 6:
His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:1. This act may be cited as The Cold Storage
Act.
2. The Governor in Council may enter into
contracts with any persons for the construction,
equipment and maintenance in good and efficient working order, of public cold storage
warehouses equipped with inechanical refrigeration, in Canada, and suitable for the preservation of all food products.
3. The location, plans and specification of
every such warehouse, its equipment, and the
amount to be expended theron, shall be subject
to the approval of the Governor in Council.
4. The Governor in Council may, out of any
moneys appropriated by Parliament for the
purpose, grant towards the construction and
equipment of any such warehouse a subsidy not
exceeding in the whole thirty per cent of the
amount exipended or approved of in such construction and equipment, and payable in instalments as fohlows: upon the warehouse being
completed and cold storage at suitable temperatures being provided therein, ail to the

10. Chapter 7 of the statutes of 1897, Intîtuled
An Act respecting Cold Storage on Steamships
from Canada to the United Kingdom and In
certain cities In Canada, is repealed.

This, honourable gentlemen,

was

the

initiation of our cold storage system as
we have it in Canada to-day. Strange to

say, nothing further was heard of that
.Act until 1914, when 1 find. there was an
Order in Council passed providing that
cold storage companies that had received
subsidies should give the publie preference
in the use of any refrigerated space in
such warehouses. Evidently the subsidy
had already been paid to ail the cold starage warehouses that had been builit under
the Act of 1907. These Acts, ap.parently,
were neyer enforced and were not enforcible. ;Shortly alter this -the Government realized that it had paid out aver
$700,000 of the people's money to create
this great cold storage systeni in Canada
without having secured any interest in, or
any cantrol of, the industry.
Before draftilng the Bill which is now
be-fore the House, I took the precaution of
writing to the Department of Agriculture
asking what regulations, if any, had been
fraýmed under the Cold Storage Act of
1914, and I received frorn the Deputy
Minister of Agriculture the following
reply:
With further reference-

I had been speaking to him over the

Warehouse Act, 1 arn including herewith a copy

connection would advise you that up ta the

been approved by Council and, consequently, as
It is through regulations that this act would
be administered, you can readily understand
that there is nothing being done by the department In this regard.
As to the reason why no regulations have
been passed, I arn including for your informa-

tien copy of a letter addressed to me by the
Deputy Minister of Justice in 1919 when certain proposed regulations were submitted to
hini.
From this you wlill note that there Is
very grave doubt as to the validIty of any
regulations-

I would like you to mark these words,
honourable gentlemen-for dealing with the licensing and Inspection
of coid storage warehouses under this act.

In order that the House may be properly
informed, I arn going to read the letter
of the Deputy Minister of Justice, as I
think it is very important:
Department of Justice,
Ottawa, April 28, 1919.
Regulations cf Cold Storage Warehouses
Sir,-I have been requested to advise upon
the draft regulavtions which have been submitted ta the Governor in Couneil for approval
under the provisions of the Cold Storage Warehouse Act, 4-5 George V. chapter 22, as to
whether the same may be regarded as within
the legisiative authorlty vested in the Dominion
by the British North Âtnerica Act. I note that
these reguilations provide tin effect that no person shall operate a cold storage warehouse
without a license from the Dominion. The purpose of this proposed licensing systema is, I
understand, to insure that the proper temparatares and humidities and sanitary conditions
aýre snaintained in these warehouses to preserve
the articles of food In the best possible condition.
The regulations are applicable to all
cold storage warehouses whether the same are
publie warehouses or are operated exclusively
for the preservation of the articles of food ol
the owner cf thre warehouse.
It appears further more from the regulations that it Is not
the Intention to control. thre rates charged for
cold storage service In the publie warehouses
and that you do flot anticipate that any serlous
opposition will develop to the licensing and Inspection systemn proposed to be adopterl.
The validity of such legisiation as this must
be regarded as somewhat doubtful In view cf
the decision of the Ilrivy Council In thre Insurance Reference in 1916. In that case a provision of the Dominion Insurance Act was
under consideî,ation, which prohibited every
person from engaging in the insurance business
without a Dominien license, and it was held by
the Judlicial Committee that the authority te
legisiate for the regulation cf trade and commerce does not extend to the regulation by a
liceneing systemn of a particular trade In which
Canadians would otherwise ire free to engage in
the provinces. The restriction thereby imposed
upon the Dominion to legislate with respect ta
trade and commerce was not satisfactorily defined but I should say, upon the assumption
that the main purpose of this legisljation is the
regulation of trade and commerce that, at least
in s0 far as the warehouses ln question handile
articles of food which may be sald ta be intended for provincial trade they cannot be
validly subjected to the provisions of thre
Cnld Storage Warehouse Act by reason cf thre
authority of the Dominion to legislate for thre
regulation of trade and commerce.

I would like you to note this, honourable
gentlemenHowever, it occurs to me that possibly the
chief purpose of this legislation may be said to
be the protection of public helalth and if this
be true, other consideration may be urged in
support of it. Upon the whole I am not very
sanguine about the validity of this measure,
but you may nevertheless consider it expedient
to undertake to put it into operation.
I have the honour, etc. etc.,
E. L Newcombe,
(Sgd.)
Deputy Miister of Justice.

The House will note that, while the
Deputy Minister of Justice doubted the
power of Parliament to control the licensing and inspection of cold storage warehouses under the Act of 1914, he did hint
very broadly that the Act might be enforced
under the powers held by the Federal body
to protect the health of the people of Canada. This is one of the points that I am
stressing in this Bill-the protection of the
health of the people. The Department of
Agriculture, however, failed to take the
hint and up to this moment absolutely
nothing has been done to frame regulations
under the Act of 1914. Therefore we find
that the cold storage system of to-day, in
1922, so far as government control was
concerned, is in exactly the same position
as in 1907, when it was initiated in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It bas not been
enforced, then?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It has never
been enforced. When the Government first
undertook this legislation it was proposed
that the Government subscribe thirty per
cent of the total cost of construction of
many large warehouses throughout Canada.
I would like the House to note that,
although the Government adopted the Bill
of 1914, it made no attempt to enforce any
part of it until 1919, five yearp after. So
it must be apparent to everybody that
there was no inclination on the part of
those responsible to control the cold storage
system of Canada.
This is the condition in which I found

points of .my BiH; in fact, in many cases
it was a copy.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 'That is strange.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: When the Government introduced their Bill, however, one
great ýdifference between it and my BiH was
that mine was obligatory in most cases,
but the Government measure held a joker
which reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may make such
regulations as he deems necessary or expedient,
to provide for a supervision of cold storage
warehouses.

The consequence of this is that not one
regulation has been framed on that BiH.
The cold storage system as it now exists
in Canada is practically the same as it was
when first inaugurated in 1907.
In looking over the records connected
with this matter, it would seem that from
the very inception of this system there was
a lack of intelligent effort on the part of
those responsible to control the cold storAlthough Canada

are run entirely in the interest of the stockholders.
No doubt when the system -was conceived
it was intended that there should be great
public storehouses, available to all citizens
who desired to use them at a rate to be
fixed by the Government; but unfortunately
those responsible for the Government aid
extended to this industry failed to safeguard the public interest by making proper
provision that the public should be allotted
space to store what foodstuffs they desired
from time to time.

That this is a faet is

evidenced by a letter received by me a few
days ago from the Deputy Minister of
Agriculture, after 12 years' experience in
the operation of these cold storage warehouses, which the Government had aided to

the extent of 30 per cent of their total
cost.
The Departmnent advised'the Governnient to discontinue the policy of sub-sidizing cold storage warehouses.
Now, in order that the Rouge xnay
properly understand the niatter I arn going
to read this document:

submitting as follows:
The Cold Storage Act of 1.910,7as amended
In 1909, provides that with the approval of

approved cost;
It is also ýprovided that the rates to be

Under the provisions of the sald Act, 34

The total refrigerated space thus provided
was 4ý9!218084 cubic feet, and the total oost

Only one contract has been entered into
since the beginning of the War, and the said
contraet was for the revival of an old one.
It was origlnally intended that the sald
subsidy should be paid only to public warehouses, but as ail 'the attractive locations had
already been occupied before the said Act

1hardly possible
te
operate
a
warehouse
strictly on a public basis, that ln order to makc
these warehouses successful. the owners were
obliged te engage in trade to fi11 the space.
Difficulities bave arisen, however, in, this
connection. There has 'been a tendency on the
part of owners after the four year period lias
expired, during which the said subsIdy is paid
in instalments, to restrict the use of the
warehouses te their own business and, thus
exclude the public.
In view of the above,
it
would

to continue

subsidies, except On the case of warehouses to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What is the
date of that Order in Council?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY:
There is no
date on it, but it is enclosed in the letter
that the Deputy Minister sent to me stating
that this was the Order in Council that was
passed after they found they could not
control the warehouses, after 1919. not
only has our money been wasted, but we
have helped to create what.may bie a very
dangerous industry if not properly controlled by the Government. It will be noted
that, as usual, the people have been miade
the goat by lack of proper and efficient control of this great industry.
It is worth while to note the great difference between Canada and the United States
in this regard. While the United States
have absolute control of every foot of Cold
Storage, private or otherwise, that holds
good in a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, the states have flot contributed
one dollar to the building of these great
plants; but we, on this side of the line, have
furnished part of the money to create this
huge industry that is owned and controlled
absolutely in the interest of private investors.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend permit me to ask a question?
Is the control over cold storage in the
United States exercised by the federal
authorities, or the state authorities?
.Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: By both. My
information in that regard is that the state
primarily bas control, but the federal house
in Washington passed a federal Bill giving
them control of -ail the cold storage bouses
in the United States to a certain extent;
just how far it goes I am not aware.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Giving theniyou mean the federal authorities?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Giving the federal authorities control.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Taking control, rather.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I would like to ask,
what is the nature of this control in the
United States, and how far does it go?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I will deal with
that before I get through.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER:
Would the
honourable gentleman explain to the House
the difference in rates charged in the city of
Ný,ew York in cold storage, and in the city
of Montreal?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That question I
am not dealing with now, but when I come
to that I will answer my honourable friend.
However, that is really not germane to
what I am dealing with, which is, the lack
of control of the cold storage system that
we have in Canada to-day.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Is there any control?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: There is no control in the Dominion. The cold storage men
are all-powerful.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman implies also the lack of inspection.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Lack of inspection and control. The result of the cold
storage system in Canada is that, although
the people have contributed generously to
the construction of many of those cold
storage warehouses, they are owned and
controlled privately. There is absolutely
no limit to the power of this great industry.
I would like honourable gentlemen who are
interested in the cold storage system to
listen to this-it will not be new to themHon. Mr. FOWLER: Will the honourable
gentleman point out some of the evils which
are coming to the people of Canada by
reason of the lack of control of the cold
storage by the Federal or the provincial
Government.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: If the honourable
gentleman will just possess his soul in
patience for a little while, I will come to
that. There is absolutely no limit to the
power this great industry holds at the
present moment regarding the control of
our food supply.
The purpose of the Bill before the
flouse is to invoke the two great subjects
that were specially reserved under the
British North America Act for Federal
enforcement viz. Health and Trade, both
of which have been violated at times by
this great cold storage system. If this
Bill is adopted the obligatory clauses will
go far to safeguard the health of the people,
by insuring to some extent, at least, that
the foods taken out of the cold storage
and sold to the public will be wholesome;
and the Minister can, if he will, exercise
control which would not only protect the
health of the people but would enable him
to order foods released from storage when
he had reason to believe the best interest
cf the consuming public would be served.
In other words, it puts the matter up to
the Government of the country to see that
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER

the cold storage warehouses are kept in a
sanitary condition, and the food stuffs are
pure and wholesome which are taken froin
these storages and sold to the people, and
that hoarding of foodstuffs will not be
tolerated. My honourable friend would realize, if he had given half the attention that
I have given to the Bill, that there is an
inclination on the part of these great cold
storage systems to hoard the foods of this
country-in other words, to corner them.
I will now deal with the Bill proper, and
I will take it up clause by clause so that
I will be able to explain, as fully as I ara
competent to do, what the clauses mean.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow me at this stage, before
he goes into the Bill clause by clause, to ask
that he give us any information he has in
regard to the constitutionality of this Bill;
I mean, as to the Power of the Dominion
Government to deal with this subject. I
am inclined to think it is an infringement
on the provincial constitution, which gives
the provinces exclusive jurisdiction in property and civil rights. It seems to me
that this is a matter of property and civil
rights. I have very grave doubts whether
we have power to pass such a bill as this.
If my honourable friend has information
(n that subject, I would like to have it.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am not a lawyer, but before proceeding with this Bill,
when I realized the position that the Department of Justice had taken regarding
the legislation of 1914, I did ask if
it was competent to pass legislation to
protect the health of the people, and if
any legislation aiming at the protection of
health would come within the jurisdiction
cf this House; and I am stressing that
point in this Bill specially.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then why is it
that the Department involved, the party
interested, bas not done anything to enforce these various acts? After parliament passed them surely it was up to the
departments concerned to endeavour to
make regulations and enforce them. Is
is not because of the opinion of the Department of Justice that the Act was not
constitutional?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In reply to my
honourable friend's question, I think not:
The
I think it was a lack of inclination.
mere fact that the legislation was passed
in 1914 taking all these powers, and no
attempt was made to enforce them until
1919, would make me very suspicious of

MAY 2, 1922
the department that had control of this
Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Unless there
was some good reason such as the one I
have indicated.
Hon.. Mr. BRADBURY: If there are
any such reasons, they are flot on record.
I have read to you everything I could get
in connection with it. I have given yon
the reasons given hy the Minister of Justice, and honourable gentlemen realize that
while the Minister of Justice pointed out
his doubts regarding the power of the
federal parliament to, legisiate in connection with the licensing of these institutions,
he hinted very broadly that fromn the standpoint of health they might bie enforced.
That is why this Bill is introduced. Clause
1 is as follows:
No article of food which is tainted or otherwise unfit for human consumption shalh be
piaced in cold storage.

This clause is intended to protect thc
health of the consumer by prohihiting the
storage of tainted or bad food such as
poultry, meat, fish, or eggs. It is wellknown f act that especially eggs, fish and
poultry have been placed in cold storage
after having shown signs of decomposition, and when they ought not to have been
placed there.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Where does the honourable gentleman get bis autbority for
that statement?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I[f the honourable gentleman will give me time, 1 will
try to give bim aIl the information hie asks
for.
While cold storage, with a proper temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or
lower, may arrest decay, it cannot restore
the food to its earlier state of freshness or
purity. Consequently, wben food already
showing signs of decomposition is admitted
to cold storage, sncb food is a standing
menace to the healtli and lives of the general public, who evcntnally consume these
decaying foods, which may (be held for
months, sometimes for years, in storage,
and then taken ont and 'sold to an unsuxpecting public, resnltinýg in serions illness,
often poaiepoisoning and death. Wbile
this may sonnd startling, it falîs short of
descr.ibing in full the serions resuits that
occur from the consumption of tainted or
impure foods.
This clause, if properly enforced, rwonld
also bave the effect of saving mncb of the
great and sinful waste tbat takes place

117

on account of foods being stored in an improper condition. IL is a well-known fact
that tons of food stuif is destroyed eitber
on account of improper storage or because
it was stored after decay had set in,
and therefore was not in a fit state
to ibe placed in storage, or, as sometimes happens, food bas been beld longer
than it ought to have been -in storage. If
we can prevent tbe storage of decaying
food we will bave done mncb to protect the
bealth of tbe people who eventually consume the food knowing notbing about its
Pure, wbolesome
condition or bistory.
foods are essential to good health.
This is one of the most important clauses,
if flot the most important, in tbe Bill, and
is contained in almost every cold storage
law adopted in the different states to tbe
soutb of ns. The laws affecting this industry in force in the states are f ar more
drastic than anytbing I am proposing in
the Bill before the Honse. For instance,
Ohio Law in tbis regard reads as follows:
1156,4D&. It shali be unlawful for any person,
frrn or corporation to place ini any cold storage
warehouse, to keep therein or to sell, offer or
expose for sale, any diseased, tain-ted, or otherwise unwhoiesomne food.

I want to say, honourable gentlemen,
f rom my own personal experience, that it
would bie a godsend to Canada to bave
sncb a law on the statute book. There is
food sold in this city every day that is
absolntely unfit for buman consumption.
The Illinois law is as follows:
No article of -food intended for human consumption sall be placed, knowingly, received
or kept In any cold storage warehouse, if
diseased, tainted, otherwise unfit for humnan
consomiption, or in soch condition that it will
not keep wholesome for-human consumaption.

And tbe New York law also says:
No artiole of food shahl be placeid, received or
kept In any coid storage warehouse cr temporary storage place unless the saine is in an
aipparently pure and iwholesome condition. The
commisionoe' inay seize and condemn any
articles of food in any cold storage warehouse
or temiporary storage place which are foond to
be unfit for humian consomption, and such
articles cf fo.od shall be destroyed cr otherwise
disposed of under such conditions as he shall
prescribe.

This clause is the foundation of necessary legisiation to protect the health of the
consumers of this country. If 1 attempted
to quote ail the authorities snpporting similar clauses in cold storage laws on the
other side of the line, I could fill a good
sized Hansard proving the wisdom of such
legislation. I have had the assistance of
reading nearly every cold storage law

SENATE
passed by the larger states of the Union,
and with one exception they contain provisions to prevent the putting into cold
storage of food that is tainted or otherwise
not fit for human consumption. 4A, subsection 2 reads as follows:
Articles of food which have been taken out
of cold storage shall not be returned to cold
storage except in such cases and subject to
such regulations and conditions as specified by
such regulations.

In looking over this clause, I believe it
can be very much improved, and in Committee I will move an amendment which
will read as follows:
Eggs, poultry, fish and other fresh meats
which have been taken out of cold storage sha'l
not be returned -to cold storage. Other foods that
have been taken out of cold storage shall not
be returned to old storage, except in such
cases and subject to such requirements and condition as may be specified by regulation.

It will be noticed that this amendment
is obligatory as far as fresh meats, poultry, fish, and eggs are concerned. The
Minister can permit other foodstuffs that
have been taken out of cold storage to be
returned to cold storage if he is satisfied
it is perfectly wholesome and fit for further storage. It is quite a common occurrence that boxes of eggs, crates of poultry
and fish are taken out of cold storage,
where they have been for months, and
are exposed to the air and offered for sale.
They lie exposed often all day in store windows or in other parts of the store. The
same can be said of fresh meats. The
eggs are not frozen.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Sometimes they
are.
Hon. Mr. BRADHURY: It is a scientific certainty that all such foods as I
have mentioned, that have been held in
cold storage, when taken out and exposed
to the air and a warmer temperature deteriorate very rapidly.
Consequently,
when such foods are again returned to cold
storage after this experience, it becomes
a standing menace to the innocent and
unsuspecting public, who eventually have
this same food served up to them in one
shape or another. This food when restored may remain there for weeks or
months, and then is again taken out and
sold to the consumers, who know nothing
about its history, and as a result serious
hardships are entailed upon the public by
eating diseased food which often causes
serious illness, causing much suffering and
often death.
But even where immediate
illness does not take place, scientific inHon. Mr. BRADBURY.

vestigation has proven without any reasonable doubt that the eating of impure
or decayed food is often the commencement of a long line of ailments such as
intestinal trouble which develop at times
to be very serious. We are told that it
impairs the lives and certainly the health
of children, and on the whole it works
great and lasting hardships upon the general public. Therefore I am asking the
Government to intervene in order to protect as far as possible the health and lives
of our people by making it impossible to
return to cold storage foodstuffs such as
I have mentioned, that have been taken
out and exposed to the air.
I might say that almost every state of
the great Republic to the south of us that
has cold storage has, after years of experience, adopted this clause only in a more
drastic shape in their storage legislation.
For instance, the Ohio law reads as
follows:
Section 1155-14. After food has been withdrawn f·rom any cold storage warehouse for the
purpose of placing it on the market for sale, it
shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to return such food, or any portion
thereof, to such warehouse, or any other similar
warehouse. Food may be transferred from one
cold storage warehouse to another provided,
that the total length of time such food shall
remain in cold storage, for the purpose of sale,
shall not exceed the time specified in section
thirteen of this act. (107 v. 596).

-which is twelve months.
The Minnesota law reads as follows:
Returning food to cold storage-transfer.
Section 12. After food has been withdrawn
from a cold storage warehouse, for the purpose
of placing it on the market for sale, it shal1 be
unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to
return such food, or any portion thereof, to such
cold storage warehouse, or to any similar warehouse. Subject to such regulations as may be
prescribed by the Commissioner of Agriculture,
food may be transferred from one cold storage
warehouse or refrigerating plant to another ;
(u) provided, however, that the total length
of time such food shall remain in such cold
storage for the purpose of sale, shall not exceed the time specified in section 8 of this act.

For the information of the House I
have a clipping from the evidence taken
before a Committee in Washington, in
which Dr. Wiley was examined on this
very subject. I may say in explanation
that Dr. Wiley is perhaps one of the
greatest food experts in the world; his
name is known, I think, all over this continent.
Senator Frazier: Is it not true that there
is more probability of ptomaine poisoning
existing in nine months than there is at the
beginning?

That statement would

apply to the provisions in oold storage for
three months as well as provisions in cold
storage for nine months?
Doctor Wiley: 1 think that would take place
in any cold storage goods no malter how short
a lime they are kept. The mere, act of freezing
does increase the tissues.
The Chairman: I lhink before you came in
the Doctor slated more aI length that any
chickens or gonds that had been subjected t0
cold sînrage, afler lhey are thawed out, causes
the progress of disintegralion as quickly after
a short period as afler a long period. That is
the real danger point. He said thal in his
judgment they should be sold while yet frozen
and exposed t0 sale 'white yel frozen.

No aicile of food mentioned in the sohedule
of this Act shall be kept in cold storage longer
than the time scheduled for such articles.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: How would they
eat them 'when they were frozen?

This is similar to legisiation adopted by
nearly ail the great States to -the south of
us. The Farm and Market Laws of New
York State provides:

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Honourable
gentlemen, in view ni this indisputable
evidence of the great danger of taking
food Vhat bas been frozen out of a cold
storage plant, exposing it for sale, and
putting it back into cold storage and selling it again-and this, is what has been
gning on in this country for years-I arn
asking the Government to intervene and
to adopt legislation similar to that which
bas been adopted by every great state of
the Union to the south of us. I thk we
niight learn a lesson £rom those states
which have had such vast experience in
connection with these matters.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable
gentleman bas stated that goods have been
taken out nf cold storage, thawed and
allowed ta becorne un6it for fond, then refrozen and put back into cold storage.
Has he any evidence to produce before
the House to show that that has been done
in any ni the cold storage plants of Canada?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am not dealing with just that phase of the question;
rny Bill says that it shal not be done. I
presume it bas been done, and I arn
making provision to prevent its being done
again.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why do you want
to pass a law when no offence bas been
cormîitted?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I think there
will be no difficulty in 'proving that there
Clause 4b of the
have 'been offences.
Bill reads in part as follows:

On further consideration of this clause,
honourable gentlemen, 1 realised that the
schedule might complicate matters, and
decided to change this clause, and will in
Committee move the following amendment:
No article of fond shall be kept in cold
storage longer than 12 mnonths provided, hnwever, that if the Minister is of the -opinion that
the conditions of the market are such that any
such artidie Ibe no longer held in cold storage.
he may require such article to be taken out
of cold storage forthwith, provided also that
if the Minister is of opinion that the further
keeping of any such article in cold storage 15
likely to resuit in deterioration he may order
that such article be forthwith taken out of
cold storage.

94. (b) Time that cold storage fondIs may
be kept. It shahl be unlawful for any person,
firm or corporation to keep or permit to remain
in any cold storage warehouse, any article
of food which has been held in cold storage,
elîher within or without the state, for a longer
aggregate perlod than twelve calendar ynonths.

You will note, honourable gentlemen,
that this ineludes ail articles of food. My
Bill deals only with perishable fonds. I
hlope the House and the country will becorne educated to legislation nf this kind,
and that in the near future there will be
a far more drastic law passed by this
Ebuse. The Minnesota law reads as follows:
,Section S. Length of Storage Period. No
person fi-ni or corporation shahl keep or permit
10 remain ln any cold storage warehouse any
article of fond which has been held in cold
storage either within or without the -state for
a longer aggregate period than twelve months
(n) except with the consent of the Commissioner of Agriculture, as herein provided.

The State of Ohio makes this provision:
No person, flrm or corporation shall seli, or
offer, or ex!pose for sale, any of the -following
fonds whlch. have been held for a -longer period
of time than herein specified ln a cold storage
warehbouse.
'Whoqe carcasses of beef, or any parts thereof,
six months: whole carcasses of pork, or any
parts thereof, six month.s: whole cardasses of
sheep, or any Parts thereof, six nionths: whole
whole carcasses of lamb, or any parts thereof,
six months; whole aarcassesl o! veal, or a ny
parts thereof, four months; dressed fowl, ten
moniths; eggs, ten rnonths, butter fine months,
and fresh fish, fine mnonths.

That is the regulation in force in the
State of Ohio. It seems to me that we
ought to be able to learn soine very valuable

120

SENATE

lessons regarding this subject from the
long and varied experience of our cousins
to the south of us, who have had to protect
the food supply of millions of people. They
have wrestled with this problem for years
and have had to fight powerful interests
which were controlling their food supply.
The resuit of ail their efforts is legisiation
similar to, but more drastie than, that
which I arn asking this House to adopt.
1 think it wise to put on record here the
opinion of one of the greatest food experts
on this continent, Dr. Wîley, on the subject
of cold sterage. His evidence, honourable
gentlemen, was taken before a Federal
committee, and I had the privilege of procuring a copy of the findings of that Comnmittee and of gleaning some of these things
frem their report. Dr. Wiley says:

extensively used for baking purposes and ln

I hold in my hand a further extract
from the evidence of Dr. Wiley, which
I want to place on record. I know I am
taking a good deal of the time of the House
on this matter, but I believe that it is very
important; that if this House can assist
in framing proper cold storage legislation
that will protect the publie it will have
done one of the most popular things it has
ever done in its history. This is the evidence as continued by Dr. Wiley:
The Chairman: I believe yeu suggested that
eggs in cold storage should be disposed of by
the first of March.
Dr. Wiley: Yes.
The Chairman: Would you suggest such a
provision requiring their disposition by the
first of March in preference to fixing a twelve
storage
for
cold
limit
months maximum
commodities?
Dr. Wiley: I do not think an egg ought to
be kept in cold storage longer than the first
of March of any year. They could not be
sold in competition, after March, with fresb
eggs. You could not sell them in competition
with fresh eggs very well, even at a lower
price.
The Chairman: You suggest a Bill compelling their disposition by the first of March of
each year, instead of allowing them to remain
in cold storage the full twelve months?
Dr. Wiley: I think that would be the limit
for eggs.
The Chairman: What limit would you suggest
for all products that enter into cold' storage?
Dr. Wiley: I would make twelve months the
extreme limit-

I would like honourable gentlemen to
realize what the doctor is saying here.
I would make twelve months the extreme
limit, and ala articles that have a natural
market or scarcity within the twelve months
should be brought out durinig that period of
scarcity. I would say that all footd, with the
exception of the surplus grain, which we must
hold up to the next harvest, ought to go out
of storage early in the season, even before
the twelve months are over.
The Chairman: It has been suggested that
different time limits be fixed for egge, butter
and other commodities.
Dr. Wiley: I think that is the sensible thing
to do-to fix a different time limit for the
different articles. April and May are the great
butter months, and November, December and
January are the scarce monthe. Butter ought
not to be kept over the second summer, in
my opinion; so it comes almost under the sama
a
ruling as eggs, only you ought to have
different period for storage-up to June even.
The Chairman: In your opinion, should a
maximum time limit be fixed for which all
articles may remain in the cold storage?
Dr. Wiley: A limit on all articles, but not
the same for each kind.
The Chairman: What limit would you suggest
for butter, for Instance?
Dr. Wiley: Well, I think butter ought to go
out by the fIrst of May anyway of the succeeding year. There Is always plenty of fresh
butter coming In then, and all that Is with-

121

held is kept out of the currents of trade and
increase the price of that that is freshly made
to the consumer.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Has the honourable gentleman any Canadian evidence to
offer? Hitherto the evidence has all been
from the United States.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Where the storages are not, nearly as good as those in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Give us some Canadian evidence.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It is really
amusing how anxious these honourable
members are to secure information that
they must know does not exist.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Selkirk fish is good
evidence.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: How was it
that the butter that came from New Zealand and Australia at the close of the war,
and that was three years old, was sold in
the City of London, where they have the
best inspectors in the world?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: :If the honourable gentleman noticed the way the clause
readHon. Mr. WEBSTER: I noticed it.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: -he must have
seen that Dr. Wiley was not stressing very
strongly the unsanitary condition of the
butter, but was pointing out that it was a
crime against the public that this butter
should be held when the public needed it.
He pointed out that it was kept out of the
currents of tradeHon. Mr. WEBSTER: They needed that
butter in London.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: -and that it
was held in storage for the purpose of increasing the price.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Not so in Australia.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why should a butter maker sell his butter at a very low
price, perhaps below the cost of production? Why should he not hold it in cold
storage?
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: That is his liberty.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The manufacturer
does not hold it.
Hon. Mr. BRADBUltY: It is pretty hard
to answer all these questions. The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Fowler) is going

122

SENATE

to have a splendid opportunity to make an
answer himself.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The butter maker
does not hold the butter.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is pretty hard
to answer that question on the honourable
gentleman's (Hon. Mr. Bradbury's) line.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY (reading):
The Chairman: What limit would you suggest for fresh meats?
Dr. Wiley: Weil, there is another thing. The
meat market is going on all the time. It used
to be that a farmer bad his food cattle in the
fall, but now they have them in every month.
In our county there is not a month that there
are not cattle ready for the market. I do not
think any meat ought to stay in storage over
four or five months. It ought to be stored to
improve it, and then after four months, about,
get rid of it.

CASGRAIN:

That is long

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY (reading):
The Chairman: In your opinion does

it

Now this will answer the question of
some of my honourable friends.
Dr. Wiley: In freezing meat there is not so
much deterioration, but it is infringing on the
future's rights. We have got not only to live
to-day, but to-morrow, and the fairmer bas got
to live for to-diay and to-norrow as well as the
consumer. Any withholding of the food supply
is hard on the consumer and hard on the farmer.
They equally suffer.

That is very sound, I think. That is
exactly what is occurring in this country
to-day.
The Chairman: low long can frozen meat be
kept and still be palatable?
Dr. Wiley: I do not think that meat ought
to be kept over twelve months at the maximum,
frozen meat. I think most of it ought to go
out at the end of four or five months. If it has
been frozen alil the time-

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Will the honourable gentleman say cold storage works injuriously to the farmer?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I most undoubtedly say so, and I think I shall prove it
before I take my seat if the honourable
gentleman will just wait.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable
gentleman is always promising what he
is going to do, but he has not done it yet,
and I would like to see the proof.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: 1 would point
out to this House that the honourable gentleman (Honourable Mr. Fowler) is not
new or inexperienced in Parliament. He
has had a great deal of experience and
has made a good many speeches, and
likely he has stated that the information
sought by honourable members on different
sides of the House was to come later. If
he will just wait, the information he seeks
will be given a little later.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do not make it
too late.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY (reading):
The Chairman: 1ow long can frozen meat
be kept and still be palatable?
Dr. Wiley: I do not think that meat ought
to be kept over twelve months at the maximum,
frozen meat. I think most of it ought to go
out at the end of four or five months. If it
has been frozen all the time, it will still be
edible, but if it is thawed once it would go
all to pieces; it just breaks down; you cannot refreeze it and make it good. If meat is
frozen and kept frozen it is edible after a year,
I will admit . I would not like to eat it, but
it is edible. But you thaw it once. and refreeze
it, that is where the danger is.
There is one point that I perhaps should
mention, and that is that the length of storage
to which food can be subjected is not the
point that is before you, as I understand it,
because I can show you foods that have been
canned five or ten years that are still good.
That is not the point. What is the use of
withdrawing food that long from commerce?
It is an outrage and an indefensible expense.
It is not how long you can keep food, but how
short a time it should be kept. It seems to
me that is the problem in the conservation of
our food supply.
The Chairman: Is food, in your opinion, ever
held in cold storage for the purpose of enhancing the price?
Dr. Wiley: I think there is a great deal of
food in storage for that sole purpose. L feel
convinced about it.

This is the opinion of one of the greatest
food experts, if not the greatest, in the
world. He has been chief of the Bureau
of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture,
Washington, for many years. He has devoted his life to the work of determining
the wholesomeness of food, and many
years to the effect that cold storage has on
foods and on their proper distribution.
To-day he is 77 years of age, and after
long years of investigation he strongly
urges the absolute control of the cold storage system. Surely we can learn something from men of this stamp.
It will be noted that if this clause is
adopted the cold storage warehouses will

MAY 2, 1922
be empowered to hold any foodstuffs for
a period of not longer than twelve months
and regulations can and ought to be tramed
so as to compel these warehouses to be
emptied and thoroughly cleansed at the
end of this period. This would have the
effeet of guaranteeing to some extent the
purity of the food that 'was placed on the
market trom these great sterehouses. It
wiil also be noted that in the case of hoarding by cold storage corporations, which
may cause a shortage on the market or
enable dealers te exact unreasonabie prices
for foodstuffs, which. may be held in large
quantities by cold storage companies, the
Minister can under this clause order al
such foods to be released trom storage.
This would have the effect of steadying
the market and giving to the publie such
foods at reasonable and fair prices.
I submit that powers of this kind are
absolutely necessary te control the food
speculatorrs, who are enabled te gaither up
the food products ail ever the country and
cause a shortage on the market, and consequently inflated prices.
I submit further that the cold storage
system as operated in Canada has diverted
the trade in toodstuffs from its proper and
legitimate channels and in doing se has
worked serieus hardships on the masses
of our consumers.
These great sterage plants have become
the middlemen between the producer and
the consumer, et ten te the detriment of both.
Owing to the financial strength of these
great corporations during the season et
plenty, they become serious and active
competitdrs with the consumers of this
country and are able practically to control the supply by gathering in from the
surrounding country such toods as eggs
and poultry during the season when thrifty
housewives usually are Iaying up their
year's supply. I submit that they are
otten able te do this without in any way
beneflting the producer as regards prices,
simply because they can go te the different;
districts and control the food at the lowest
possible price prevailing in the district.
There are times, however, when, because
it is necessary to secure their ends, they
inflate prices, and te such an extent that
the average wage-earner cannot compete
and secure these foodstuff s, which are
really necessary te ail who live in a country like ours.
There is ne doubt in my mind that the
cold storage system as operated here is
practically a moneply. As far as the food
supply of Canada is concerned, they work

12:3

Take eggs and poultry,
systematically.
for example-they may have, and I find
they do have millions of dozens of eggs and
millions of pounds of poultry stored in
these Cold Storage warehouses. For instance, on April lst, according to returns
furnished by one of the departments, they
had one million dezen eggs and about six
million pounds of poultry. You can understand how this must affect the market. It
practically means they have a corner in
poultry, having taken it out of the legitimate channels of trade, and in doing s0
have caused an inflation of the price to the
consumer, however, this is one of the methods adopted by the food speculator. It is
a cold business proposition. They buy as
cheap as they can and seli as dear as they
can. 1 presume that under ordinary circumistances that would be called good business, but I doubt the wisdom of this country allowing any set of men to gamble in
the necessaries of lite te the extent that
this Cold Storage system enables them to
do at the present moment. The f£armer
suflers from the tact that these storages have secured a large quantity
of any of the commodities they deal in.
They can very well slacken up from buying
until the preducer is wihling to take less;
then they can fill up their store-houses
knowing that the consumer has eventually

succeeded in making a luxury out of what
is an everyday necessity-meats, chickens
and eggs. The average wage earner canflot afford te provide very much of this
luxury for his grewing tamily. Under
the present system of distribution of our
perishable foods there is oniy one ciass of
people who are benefitting, and they are
becoming millienaires-that is, the food
speculator. The producer and the consumer are both victims of the greed and
avarice of these men.
Now I am going to answer my honourable triend's question: lias the Cold
Storage system been a blessing to the
farmer, as is often asserted? I think net,
and to give some reasen for this opinion, 1
am going to review briefly the conditions
surrounding the live stock in4u.stry of
Canada. This, honourable gentlemen, is
illuminative, and if my honourable friend
is anxious that 'the farmer should be properly protected, that he should have a fair
chance in this country, surely he should
support this bill that is before the Huse,
in order to give him that opportunity.

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Honourable gentlemen, I ýdon't need to stress this.
I do
not think it is very hard to answer my honourable friend's question whether the cold
storage was a benefit to the farmer or not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Who made this
profit-the butcher?

than they can in the meat market. I know
that as a fact, because I have tried it.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am afraid my
honourable friend's facts are not very well
founded.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, they are; they
are founded on actual experience.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: You can pick up
a paper any morning you like and you can
find beef selling down at the Ottawa market at 5à cents for fore-quarters and 6 to
7à cents for hind-quarters; so if that answers my honourable friend's questionHon. Mr. FOWLER: If you buy meat by

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Oh, no, you don't.

honourable gentlemen, are surely illuminating, and ought to open the eyes of every
honourable gentleman as to the absolute
necessity of controlling the cold storage
system of this country, when they reaize

sound when it is used for the purpose of
caring for the surplus perishable goods of
this country, but when it is allowed to practically control all the perishable foods, it
is in a position to dictate the price that it
shall pay to the farmer, as well as dictate
the price the consumer shal pay for it.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I do not
think my honourable friend would have any
difficulty in realizing that the cold storage
system is not a great friend of the farmer.

on record here that the cold storage companies filled -up their plants when meat

posed to sell their cattle, and this great institution that had cold storage facilities,
could have cared for a let of this meat, and
if they had been generous and fair, would
have taken this meat and paid fair prices
for it, because they knew that the consumer
was going to pay just whatever they asked
for it, and thus they would not lose anything. Instead of that, they took full advantage of the farmer's unfortunate position. -Steers were sold in Ednonton last

did not make one cent difference to the consumer.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But the fact
that there was an immense quantity of
meat stored in cold storage warehouses
caused the dropping down of the price
of beef to the farmer. That is, the
farmer could not sell his beef for anything at all in the west. I know places
,where he could not even pay the freight
on it when it was sent to the stock-yards;
but it was explained to me that the reason for that was that the cold storage
warehouses had stored up such a huge
quantity of beef that they did not want to
buy.
Hon. Mr. BOLDUC: But how is it the
consumer had to pay so much more than
before?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I have no
doubt there is a good deal in what my
honourable friend says, but it carries out
what I have said-that those cold storage
people are able to fill up their warehouses
and to say to the farmer, "We are full;
we don't want your meat." But when it
came down to the last possible cent-some
of it, I am told was sold for 2 or 3 cents
a pound, live weight-they made a good
profit on it. I can prove it by the returns
here.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Is the honourable
gentleman aware that there was not a
cold storage plant in western Canada last
year, or for a number of years, that
bought one single pound of beef? The
packers who bought it, but not the cold
storage people. The cold storage people
do not buy beef at all.

126

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: My honourable
friend seems to make a difference between
the packer and the cold storage man. I
am not making any difference.
I am
speaking of the cold storage men that
buy this meat. My honourable friend
knows that the packers are cold storage
people; they have had cold storage warehouses. He knows that the people in Winnipeg have perhaps one of the biggest cold
storage warehouses on the continent. He
knows that Pat Burns has a cold storage
house at Calgary, and one at Edmonton
on the very same line.
My honourable
friend's cold storage may be a little different, and may be run on a different basis,
but I am not criticising that kind of cold
storage.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should like
to clear up a point here. The honourable
member has stated that in certain cold
storage plants the cold storage regulations
have not been effective, for reasons which
he stated, and that there was no supervision. I think it is true that all the
packing houses are properly supervised by
government inspectors, and every bit of
meat that passes through them is properly
inspected, and that the observation in
reference to no inspection does not apply
so far as meats are concerned.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is that meat for
export, or is any of the meat that passes
through packing-house refrigeration?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am thoroughly
aware of what my honourable friend has
said; but he has gone a little far. There
was an inspection under the Bureau of
Statistics, I think it was, that took powers
that it did not have.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Department of Agriculture conducts an inspection.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: The Live-stock
Branch do, but it is only in the abattoirs and
packing houses. They have no more right
to-day to go into the cold storage warehouses and conduct an inspection than they
had in 1907. The honourable gentleman
can see that from the letter of the Minister
of Justice.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: We are informed that meat is not stored in such
places.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: It is not stored
in the public warehouses; it is stored in the
packing-house-owned abattoirs.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I do not know
whether my honourable friends are anxious
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

to mix me up, or whether they are sincere
in trying to enlighten the House, but what
I say is this: that we have absolutely no
control over the thirty-four cold storage
plants subsidized by the Dominion Government, at an expense of $700,000 of the
people's money. We cannot command one
square foot of storage; we do not own one
share of stock, whether they store meat
or not. I am dealing with the storehouses

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I have before
me some returns, that I should like to place
on record to show how rapidly the quantity
of meat in storage grew.
On October lst, 1921, there were 3,882,000
pounds of fresh pork, 16,223,000 pounds of
pork off all kinds, cured and otherwise, and
9,947,000 of beef; in November of 1921 there
were 4,285,000 pounds of fresh pork, 17,607,000 pounds of pork of all kinds, and 15,282,000 pounds of fresh beef; in December of
1921 there were 5,711,000 pounds of fresh
pork, 23,435,000 of pork of all kinds, and
21,847,000 off beef. In January of 1922,
when the farmer was selling his stock cheap
because he could not keep it-and, of course,
when the market broke in the West the
packers did not buy, and the market broke
down here-there were in storage 6,355,000
pounds of fresh pork, 24,381,000 pounds of
pork of all kinds, 25,318,000 pounds of beef;
in February there were 10,697,000 pounds
of fresh pork, 27,200,000 pounds of pork of
all kinds, 22,890,000 pounds of beef; and on
the lst of March there were 10,176,000
pounds off fresh pork, 27,851,000 pounds of
all kinds of pork, and 19,840,000 of beef.
I have given you these figures, honourable gentlemen, for the purpose of
confirming the statement which I have
made that the cold storage people took
advantage of the condition of the farmers.
These gentlemen filled up the cold storage
warehouses when meat was selling at 4l
cents a pound in Winnipeg and 51 cents
a pound in Toronto. If they had giver
the consumer the benefit of the drop, it
would not have been so bad; but I wilh
ask any houourable gentleman who knows
anything about the prices paid for meat
whether he does not realize that the consumer got no benefit whatever from the
condition of the market, and that the farmer lost heavily.
Honourable gentlemen, I have spaken at
greater length than I intended. I have

COLD STORAGE BILL
SECOND READING-REFERRED
SPIJOIAL OOMMITTEE

TO

The Senate resumed from, yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. George H.
B.radbury, for the second reading of Bihl B,
an Act te amend the Cold Storage Warehouse Act.

128

SENATE

Hon. GEORGE H. BRADBURY: When
the House ad'journed last night I was disçussing the effect of cold storage warehouses or abattoirs upon the live meat
trade.
During the discussion, I presume
largely on account of the many interruptions that occurred, I failed to explain that
under another act there is a certain inspection into the killing of and caring for

our meat.
I stated that there was absoJutely no inspection or control of any kind
under the Cold Storage Act, and in that
respect I was quite right; but there is another Aot under which the Live Stock
,Branéh of the Agricultural Department
was given authority to inspect all animals
killed, and all 'meats placed in cold storage
warehouses or abattoirs for export purThis
poses or for interprovincial trade.
fact, honourable gentlemen, proves to my
mind beyond any doubt the constitutionality
of the Bil now before the House; ýit
proves that the Government can control
every cold storage warehouse in Canada
that holds food for trade between the different provinces or for export purposes.
The ruling in that regard was made by
Sir Allen Aylesworth some years ago, and
I understand that the departnent bas been
carrying on an inspection of abattoirs and
packing houses throughout Canada ever
since that date. I want to be absolutely fair
in this matter, and I make that explanation
so that there may be no misunderstanding. I
have no quarrel with the men ýconducting
the cold storage 'business, but I believe that
the Government ought to have absolute control of al storehouses that are storing the
food supply of Canada.
During the discussion last evening, a
number of gentlemen took objection to the
coupling of the meat trade and the cold
storage system.
What I said regarding
the manner in which the livestock trade
of Canada was encouraged, or rather discouraged, by the action of these men who
store meat, referred to the cold storage
system only.
I understand the situation
thoroughly, honourable gentlemen.
I understand that a large number of private
cold storage warehouses do not store one
pound of beef; at the same time, honourable gentlemen, every abattoir, every packing bouse bas its large cold storage system;
if it had not, it could not care for its
products.
So, in referring to the meat
trade, I was referring, of course, to the
packing bouses, the abattoir businesses,
and the men who kill the meat and store
it. Other cold storage systems in Canada
are concerned by this bill only in so far as
they handle the products dealt with by the
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Bill; if they store eggs or poultry or fish,
they will come within the scope of the Bill.
'I contend, honorable gentlemen, that the
Parliament of Canada is properly seized with
power to legislate on this matter.
I cannot for the life of ;me understand why the
Cotd Storage Bil passed in 1914 was practica-ly al-lowed to become a dead letteir
through lack of enforcement, particular'ly
in view of the ruling of Sir Allen Aylesworth that the · overnment had power to
G
inspect the abattoirs, and every pound of
neat that goes tbhrough them, and the
buildings themseives, and to insist upon a
cleanly and sanitary condition being maintained.
To my mind that fixes the responsibility upon the Federal Parliament to
legislate to control every cold storage warehouse in Canada containing perishable
foodstuffs, for either expoat or interprovincial trade.
You will understand, honourable gentlemen, that there are some, cold storage
warehouses that do not hold food for interprovincial trad'e.
I am not sure, but I
presume, that in a great city like Montreal,
there are cold storage warehouses that store
food for use only within the province.
A
storehouse of that kind, perhaps, would not
be affected by this Bill.
Such a situation
might require provincial legisiation. But
I contend that the federal Government
shouild go as far as it can along the lines I
have indicated, to take control of these
great storehouses that store the necessaries
of life in such huge quantities.
I was going to deal with the effect of this
system upon the hog industry of Canada;
but I really do not think it is worth while
taking up much more of the time of the
House. I simply wish to say that every
argument I have advanced in regard to the
methods of these great packing bouses
throughout Canada in connection with beef.
applied equally to their operations in connection with the hog industry of this
country. All these great packing bouses
are business concerns run on business lines;
and I am not quarrelling with their methods
of taking advantage of the markets and
securing products from the farmers at the
lowest possible cost. I find that last fall
hogs sold in Toronto at $9.45 in October;
$9.13 in November; and $10.33 in December.
During those months, and later, when the
market was depressed, the great packing
bouses were filled up until they contained, as
they do to-day, something like 30,000,000
pounds of pork. If the consumer was reaping the benefit of the low prices received
by the farmer, perhaps there would be

MAY 3, 1922
some argument in favour of the methods
einployed by the great packing houses;
but when honourable gentlemen realize that
to-day we are paying practically war
prices for bacon and ham-60 cents a
pound for bacon in the city of Ottawa, and
45 and 50 cents a pound for ham; and in
proportion no doubt for other parts of the
animal-they will understand the huge
profits that these packing bouses are
making.
While arguing along this ue last evening, I was interrupted by the honourable
gentleman fromt New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
Fowler), who said, "Why should not the
manufacturer or maker of butter store it
and hold it for a greater price?" Honourable gentlemen, there is no reason in the
world why he should not do it; but the fact
is that he does not do it. The butter, in
ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, leaves
the manufacturers and passes into the
bands of speculators. They are the men
who store the butter and the food products
of this country. If proper facilities were
provided in which the producers could store
their products until they could command
reasonable prices, there would be no just
argument against them doing it; but I submit that when a combination of business
men with millions of dollars behind them
can go into the market and control every
pound of butter and every dozen of eggs
produced in Canada, and put them into
these great warehouses and hold them
there until the consumers are ready to
pay whatever price they may be asked,
they are taking advantage of a condition
which is immoral, and which ought not to
exist in any civilized country. What is the
logical resuit of a system of that kind?
The logical resuit is that a combination of
these men, being all-powerful, and having
millions of dollars behind them, can practically starve the people of Canada by holding
up the foodstuffs of the country. Honourable gentlemen may laugh, but 1 want to
say that during the last two or three years
probably hundreds of thousands of people
in Canada have not been able to purchase
some of these products, because they could
not afford the prices that were being asked.
This is not a secret: it is a well-known fact.
In view of the facts, I appeal to this
bluse and ask whether it is not; wise to bave
a system which would give the Government
control over these institutions? If there is
nothing wrong with them, why should they
object to Government control? If everything is above-board, they should have no
S-9

129

objection to the Government having control.
In the interests of the health of our people
we ought to be assured that everything that
is sold on the markets of Canada is at
least pure and wholesome.
In another
place at the present time an agitation is
going on for the creation of a Wheat Board
in Canada. What for?-To intervene between the speculator and the farmer. I am
not going to argue whether that is justifiable or notHon. Mr. DAVID: That is not the same
case.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: But I am going
to say that if the Government can justify
the creation of a Wheat Board to control a
commodity that is not perishable, a commodity that will keep for years when properly stored, they are in duty bound to
create a system of abattoirs and cold
storage warehouses throughout Canada to
protect the man who is raising live-stock,
the real farmer of Canada. Think of what
ccurred in the West last year. Hundreds
of our farmers lost almost everything they
had in live stock, simply because there was
a shortage of fodder, and because there'
was no way of taking care of the animals.
If the Government had had a system of
abattoirs, a cold storage system, these cattie
could have been killed and put in cold
storage by the producers, and the
consuiners of this country wou.ld have
got the rbenellt, because they would
have been in a position to buy their
ineat a great deal cheaper than they could
buy it from the speculators. I contend
not only that this is practicable, but that
there can be good, sound reasons adduced
as to why it should be done-far better
ieasons than can be given for the creation
of a Wheat Board in Canada.
Now, honourable gentlemen, Il am not
going to weary the House much longer.
I just wish to refer to another clause of
the Bill. Clause 4d provides that:
Ail Parcels of food which have been in cold
storage and are exposed for sale shall be
marked with ia card attached so as to be
plainly in view of the pulic, on which shahl be

that the long and varied experience in
legislatîng to control. the handling of foodstuifs by our neighbors to the south is
very valuable to us who are endeavouring

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

to formulate a wise and sane policy on this
question.
For the information of the flouse I will
xead from two or three of the Cold Storage
Acts adopted by different states, bearing
on the clause in question. The Nýew York
State law reads as follows:
Clause 94-Cold storage foodi when sold must
lie represented as sucis. It shall le unlawful to
seli, or to offer for sale, any article of foodi
which has been held for a perlod of more than
thirty days in cold storage eltiser within or
without tise state, without representing thse same

commodities, using the words "cold storage
In case of transfer of ownership of
goods".
foods while still held in cold storage the seller
of the same shahl notify the buyer in writing
of the day, month and year in which said food
was originalhly placed in storage.

This, honourable gentlemen, may seem
pretty drastic legisiation, but those who
have paid attention to the question know
that the State of New York has been fighting this cold storage question for years;
and after long experience hias adopted that
clause. The argument is that the public
ought to know what it is buying, and when
a consumer goes into a store, and is offered
cold storage goods, hie should be notified
that they are such. The Ohio State laws
are very much the same as those of New
York.
I have here a short statement frnm Dr.
Wiley, bearing on the necessity of notifying the public what they are buying.
Speaking of poultry, Dr. Wiley said:
Whenever a fowl is kept for a longer period
than a week or ten days for the purpose of improving its flavor and palatability, it is necessary that it be placed in cold storage. This
method of keeping poultry or other foods Is
wholly unobjectionabie. unless carried to excess. Poultry is a fooýd product whicli under the
present scientiflc methods of production ean be
furnished in a fresis state ail the year.

That is
should we

absolutely true; and if so, why
have 6,000,000 pounds of poultry
in the cold storage warehouses
to-day? Dr. Wiley continues:

Thse necessity for cold storage therefore, is
flot so apparent in this case as in that of fruit
and other perishable foods. It appears, then,
that cold storage onqy should be extended to
that limit necessary to secure its delivery to
the consumer. There can scareely be any excuse
for thse placing of poultry in cold storage at
certain seasons of the year when they are
slightly less in priýce by reason of thse abundant
production than at other season. The me thods
of producing poultry are such at the present
time that this excess in supply can easily be
avoidefi on the part of thse producer, and thus
maintain an even price and an even supply tise
year round. The producer as well as the consumer is benetittefi by such a condition. The
necessity, often. for cold storage in the limhted
sense above referred to is acknowledged by ail,
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY.

and a reasonable degree of time in colfi storage
cannot be regardefi as in any way measurably
harmful with reference to the character of the
product. It is probable that as long as four or
six montlis may be regarded as a justifiable
limit for securing a proper market for pou.ltry

whatever for carrying fowls for a longer periofi,
and especially, as has been known, for a year
or even two years. Tihe deterioration, even if tise
temperature is far below the freezing point, is
very marked during tisese long periods of time,
and actual danger may accrue to the consumer
of poisonous
development
in the possible
degradation products in the flesh. Municipal,
state, and national regulations sisould be of a
character to inform the consumer of thie exact
length of time which tise poultry lie proposes
to purcliase has been in cohd storage. This is
the least which tise consumer lias tise rigist to
know, and is a riglit whicli tise producer and
r.acker asould concede witisout discussion. Tise
unwihhingness which lias been manifested on tise
part of dealers in poultry to make public tise
lenglis of time wisich it lias been in coid storage
is of itself a suspicious condition. Tise argument
s constantly iseard tisat tise length of time
î)oultry isas been in cold storage does not impair its -palatability or wliolesomeness. If this
be true, tisen a statement of tise length of time
cannot in any way injure tise market. But to
this, reply is made to tise effect tisat if tise
consumner is tohd thse fowl lias been i0 cold

should you deceive tise consumer by selling hlm
an article which, if lie knew its character, he

1 have read that for the purpose
of giving the bouse the benefit of
the opinion of one of the greatest
food experts on this continent. In addition to this, permit me to say that cornmon
decency and honesty demand that the consuming public should not be deceived, but
should lie informed as to the nature of the
foods they are buying. The public at the
present moment bias absolutely no protection regarding the quality or wholesomeness of perishable foods. The authorities
have sadly neglected what is perhaps the
most important factor in preserving the
healtii of our people, that ýis, a thorough
and efficient inspection of ail perishable
foods that are offered for sale. I have
seen in this city and in others fish, poultry
and meat exposed in windows for sale that
I would not give to a dog to eat, except
that I wanted to destroy the dog. I have

MAY 3, 1922
in the backbone of the fish it is absolutely
unfit for consumptien; yet thousands and
millions of pounds of such fish are sold to
the people of Canada to-day owing to the
lack of proper inspection. Some innocent
person would likely get this food not knowing anything about its condition or history.
If they were vigorous and strong they
would likely throw off the poison that would
be occasioned by eating this food, but if
they were not strong the poison would
likely take effect and their health would be
undermined. I don't think this is overdrawing the situation. The lack of proper
supervision by the authorities on the foods
that are selling to the people in this country is certainly a sad reflection on those
responsible for protecting the health of our
people. I am, therefore, stressing this
clause in the Bill, in the hope that it will
be made law, and if properly enforced it
would go far towards protecting the health
of the consuming public.
I intend to move an amendment at the
end of the Bill, to give the Government
more power than it has at present. I am
asking that the following be added to the
Bill as clause 3:
3. The said act is hereby amended by inserting therein irmnediately after section 6 the following as section 6a.
6a. The minister shall cause every cold
storage warehouse to be inspected at least once
a year for the purpose of ascertaining whether
the cold storage warehouse is in a sanitary
condition, 'and also for the purpose of ascertaining how long each article of food therein has
been held in cold storage therein.

This, I believe, is necessary to insure
proper inspection of the cold storage warehouses in Canada, and thus protect the
health of the people by assuring that all
these plants are kept in a clean, sanitary
condition. This is following along the lines
of the precautions taken by many of the
states to the south in their cold storage
laws. I find that Ohio and Minnesota have
this law, and I presume also New York,
and many other States. This gives the
Government power to go in and examine
every cold storage warehouse in Canada.
While the proposed bill does not deal with
all these phases of the question which I
have discussed; but honourable gentlemen
will notice that I have purposely broadened
out the discussion and dealt with matters
not mentioned in the Bill for the purpose
of awakening the public opinion in regard
to this matter. The fact that the cold
storage system of Canada has at the present moment locked up 20,000,000 pounds of
beef, 30,000,000 pounds of pork, 6,000,000

S-91

131

of mutton and lamb, and 6,000,000 pounds
of poultry, will give honourable gentlemen
some idea of the stranglehold those institutions have upon the producer and the
consumer in Canada just now. I claim,
and it is not hard to demonstrate, that the
locking up of this meat works injuriously
to the consumer. But the question arises,
why is it locked up there? It was placed
there last fall, and during the winter much
of it was put on the market and sold; but
just now very little is taken out and put
on the market. because cold storage meat
will not stand exposure to warmer temperature without breaking down.
The
gentlemen who control the cold storage will
hold this meat until next fall, when it will
probably come into the market in competitition with the farmer who has his live
stock ready to sell then. Because of the
fact that the cold storage men have their
warehouses filled from the fall previous,
they will get the opportunity of purchasing
from the farmer at prices very much lower
than he ought to receive.
Any man who knows anything about
farming conditions in Canada, especially
Western Canada, realizes that it had been
the hope of public men to build up in those
Western provinces a great live stock industry; but that is absolutely impossible
under present conditions. Something must
be done to give the farmer some guaranty
that if he raises cattle, sheep or hogs he
will find a market at reasonable prices
when he wants to sell. That can be done
by the Government creating abattoirs, or
even by taking possession of some of the
big ones that exist.
When I was speaking last night one of
my honourable friends interrupted me with
the statement that not one cold storage
house in the West had stored any meat.
Of course the honourable gentleman had
overlooked the great cold storage warehouses and the packing bouses in Edmonton and Calgary, the great Gordon-Ironside cold storage warehouse and packing
house in Winnipeg, the Gallagher packing
bouse in Winnipeg, and the Swift Company warehouse, an American concern. I
venture to say millions of pounds of beef
are stored in those plants.
In view of these facts, and what I have
stated in argument, I ask this House to
give this Bill fair and honest consideration. I do not claim it is perfect; I know
it is not; but I ask the House to assist in
framing legislation that will be effective
in protecting the public of this country.
I will go further than that. I would say

SENATE

132

to the Government of the day that I would
be only too glad to have them take this
Bill over, provided they retain in it the
obligatory clauses, without which I would
have very little hope of any legislation
being effective which the Government
would pass.
When this Bill comes to its second reading I intend to move that it be referred
to a special committee with power to secure
persons and papers such as may be required.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: No doubt this Bill
deserves the most sympathetic consideration of the House, and I believe the intent
is very good, because I know that in Montreal thousands of dozens of eggs and
thousands of pounds of butter became
rotten after remaining in cold storage
warehouses during two or three or six
months. But I do not see that the time
is specified in the schedule referred to in
Would my honourable friend
Section 4B.
show me where the time is mentioned?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In framing this
Bill I believed that limiting the time
in -a schedule was the proper way
of legislating, but I realize that it would
occasion a good deal of misunderstanding,
and as I was anxious to accomplish something I modified that, and I intend to
move this amendment:
That Clause 4b be struck out and the following substituted:No article of food shall be kept in cold
storage longer than twelve months, provided
that if the minister is of the opinion that the
conditions of marketing are such that it is
desirable that any such articles be no longer
held in cold storage he may require such articles
to be taken out of cold storage forthwith;
Provided also, that if the minister is of the
opinion that further keeping of any article in
cold storage is likely to result in deterioration,
he may order that such article of food shall be
taken out of cold storage.

That gives the Minister absolute power
to take it out of cold storage.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemien, the Bill which has been submitted by
the honourable member for Selkirk (Hon.
Mr. Bradbury) is one that should receive
from the members of this Chamber the
greatest possible care and study, not only
because it relates to the commerce of the
country, not only because it is of interest to
the farmer and consumer, but because a very
wrong impression may very easily go out
in connection with the manner in which he
bas presented it, as to the attitude that
this Chamber takes in regard to this legislation. I am perfectly well aware that
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY.

the motive of my honourable friend was to
secure the enactment of the bill which he
submitted, but as in the discussion of it he
has invoked the possibility of cheap food
and the wrongs done to the farmers and
to others, it is important that the people of
Canada should understand that our attitude
is one which we believe to be in the interest
of the country at large.
My first criticism of the legislation proposed by my honourable friend is that he
has selected the wrong time in the commercial history of our country to introduce
this Bill. I submit that this is not the time
in which this Parliament, or any other
legislature in Canada, should pass a law
which would interfere with the commerce
of the country or cause a state of unrest
among the farmers, who are trying to
carry on and make a living. I am informed that there is to-day in Canada no
industry that is giving greater worry and
concern to those interested in it than is the
business of packing bouses and cold storage
plants, to which my honourable friend bas
referred. While I do not share the opinion
that is entertained and expressed by certaiq
people in regard to the condition of the
farmers, yet I do know that we have in
Canada so many farmers who are uncertain as to their future that we ought not
to do or say anything, or pass any legislation here, that would tend to add to the
unrest and hardships from which they already suffer. My honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Bradbury) has quoted largely frorm
American authorities with regard to the
legislation that is in effect in the United
States. I would cite to him one more American authority that it would be well for him
and other members of this House to bear in
mind. In a statement made the other day
by the President of the United States he
.aid that what the business conditions of
that country needed was that the politicians
should let business alone; that there should
be less politics in business, and that sound,
well-tried business methods should be applied to legislation more than they are at
present in the different legislatures of the
United States. And I say to this Chamber
to-day that under present conditions in
Canada, as they are known to the members
of this Chamber, we should hesitate very
much before adopting a course that would
add to the unrest that already exists.
In the presence of so many men who
know the cold storage business far better
than I could hope to know it, I will not
attempt to deal with this question in detail, but I want to say one word regarding
the cold storage proposition from the stand-

MAY 3, 1922
point of the farmer, and I shall leave it to
other honourable members to suggest the
remedies for the wrongs that have been
mentioned by my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Bradbury). The history of the cold
storage business in 'Canada is a short one.
In 1894 modern cold storage was practieally unknown in this country. From 1894
to 1919, aided by the very bonuses from
the Government to which. my honourable
friend sneeringly refermed, there developed
in this country a splendid, first-class business known to us as the packing and c3ld
storage industmy, which is not only of great
importance in the preservation of food
for consumption in Canada and in the promotion of Canada's foreign trade, but is
likewise important to the farmers of Canada. I do flot know wh.at we in this country would do fto-day if it were not for the
cold storages that exist, and against which
my honourable friend appears to have a
grievance. With a scattemed population in
a vast country, limited only by the two
oceans, and with each province in a position to grow products that other parts of
the country cannot raise, we have to depend upon cold storage.
Vegetables,
fruits and other produets-some of which
are luxuries, though we often think of
them as necessaries-are grown in distant
parts of this country and are available to
evemy mamket in Canada solely because we
have developed cold storage in the manner
which I have indicated.
In order that
honourable gentlemen may appreciate the
development o f cold storage in this country,
I would ask your permission to read from
a report which was made on this subject
in 1919. There weme at that time 266 iitstallations of mechanical refrigemation in
cold storage warehouses, abattoirs and
other manufacturing establishments. Nine
were equipped with the gmavity brine system, and there were forty-four small freezers where ice and sait were used as mefrigThe total refrigerated space at
erants.
that date was 33,347,774 cubic feet. Of the
total number of wamehouses 76 were classified as public or semi-public cold storages,
46 were for creamery purpoases, and 200
were listed as private establishments connected with packing bouses, etc.
Since 1919 many additions have been
made to, the cold storage plants. The principal one is the erection in the city of Montreal by the Harbour Commissioners, of
the largest cold storage warehouse in Canada. When completed, as it will be in a
few days, it wlll be not; only the lamgest
in this country, but one of the most modern
and most scientific cor structions in the

world. I mespectfully suggest to my honourable fmiend (Hon. Mm. Bradbury) and
to this House that at this ti-me, when it is
necessary, as we all appreciate, to encourage such. enterprises, it is not; right or fair
to the commerce of Canada to raise any
unrest

I am going to caîl the attention of this
House, not to all the details of the Bui
that my honoumable fmiend has submitted,
but to two only. In doing so I desire to
say that I am acting solely on behaîf of a
class of people in whom I am interested
more than in any other, namely, the farmers. If the business of the farmers of this
country is going to be further înterfered
with by legislatîon, their output will be
cumtailed and the prices -at whlich they can

I do not know what will be the future of
this country. Theme are in my honourable

I know, to the farmers throughout the

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I did flot have the

answer the principal cmiticism that I have

134

SENATE

made, yet it removes the great wrong which
would make the Bill as presented to us a
crime against the people of the eastern part
of our country.
I do not think, honourable gentlemen, that
we are justified in passing the Bill at
present. I should like to move at the proper
time that its consideration be adjourned
for one year. During that period we can
obtain more information, nearer home, than
my honourable friend has given us to-day
and yesterday. We shall be able to study
the question and know more about the
conditions of trade and of the farming
class than we can possibly do to-day. We
shall hope that the farmers may be in a
better position then, and we may then be
able to meet some of the objections that will
be offered under present conditions. I believe that in the matter of cold storage
there are regulations enforced by the
Government of this country for the protection of life and health, that amply protect
the people from the dangers pictured by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Bradbury). I
have never known of any person to die from
eating goods that were proven to have been
in cold storage. I am aware that as
pointed out by the hon. member from Montreal, some goods taken out of cold storage
have not been in first-class condition-there
is no question about that; but on the other
hand I do not know in what condition those
goods were when they were placed in storage. Their condition may be due not to the
length of time they were in cold storage,
but rather to the condition in which they
were when placed there. It may be a question of the desirability of having such goods
inspected when they are placed in storage.
When we have had time to study the
matter thoroughly we may find useful the
suggestion to establish a system of inspection. I do not know whether there is anything in this suggestion or not, but I give
it to the House for what it is worth.
The Bill which my honourable friend
proposes, and especially the amendment to
it, would seem to entail the expenditure of
money. As I understand, he proposes that
inspectors of perishable products should be
appointed. I do not know to what extent
the Senate has the right to originate a Bill
of this kind. That point is worthy of consideration by the Government.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Do I understand that the honourable gentleman wishes
to move a motion?
Hon. G. G. FOSTER.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Yes. I would move,
if I can find a seconder, that the consideration of this Bill be postponed for one year.
Hon, Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out to my honourable friend that that
would be entirely out of order. It would
carry the Bill over to next Session.
This Chamber certainly has no authority
to pass a resolution, to be effective next
year, which would prohibit the members
from dealing with the same subject then.
Hence it is customary to move that the
Bill be not considered for six months, or
three months, as the case may be.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Six months.
Hon. The SPEAKER: Is there any seconder for that motion?
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: Yes, I second it.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Honourable
gentlemen, I listened with the deepest interest to the honourable member from Selkirk
(Hon. Mr. Bradbury) discussing this Bill
pertaining to cold storages in Canada. In
the statement ho made last night he referred to some members who were butting
against their own interests. I want to say
that I have not one dollar invested in any
way in cold storage, in Canada or anywhere else; but I have been a patron of
cold storages, to a greater or lesser degree, for the past thirty years, and I fully
realize the necessity for the cold storages
which we have. Let me say further that
I have been in a good many of the cold
storages in the State of New York, including the city of New York, and, to the
credit of Canada be it said, we have in
the city of Montreal the best cold storages
to be found anywhere on the American continent. The Canadians, in following up
this business of cold storage, have adopted
the latest improvements.
I quite agree with the honourable member from Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbury) that
a year is long enough for any food product
such as fish, eggs or meat to remain in a
cold storage. There may be some other
food products which it might not be advantageous to remove in a year and which
would not be injured by being kept longer
in 'cold storage. Take, for instance, 'dried
fruits. such as prunes, dates, evaporated
apples, apricots and peaches. They would
not be injured at all by being kept in cold
storage. But one point of the Bill that I
object to is the labelling of everything that
has been in cold storage and is offered
for sale in any merchant's place of busi-

contract for the printing houses of this
country. Take for instance a man who
imports a car of lemons. Anyone who is
familiar with the trade knows that lemons
must be put into cold storage immediately
on reaching this country; otherwise they
will not be preserved and the loss will be
considerable. But why should a man who
brings a box of lemons from storage and
offers it for sale in his store be required
to have on the box a label a foot and a half
by two? Every person knows that the
lemon3 were in cold store. It is not necessary to tell any one.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman? I am sure he
does not wish to be unfair. The Bill does
not deal with lemons at all; it deals only
with butter, eggs, fish, poultry and meats.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: It mentions fish,

I for one would be glad to make any suggestions I could to the honourable gentlenan in the way of improving the present

consumer. Any legislation that we have in
this House should be caref'ully thought out
and should be in the interests of the citizens
of Canada as a whole, and not of any one
class of people.
A great deal of the information afforded
us last night by the honourable gentleman came from the south. He refers to
Dr. Wiley as an expert. I could give him
some information that is perhaps much
stronger. I would refer to the record
made during the war by 'Canadian doctors
at the soldiers' camps, where we had the
least mortality of any nation in the world.
Such men as my honourable friend from
Manitoba (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) looked
after their business, and there were not
any cases of poisoning. I think we have
in Canada just as intelligent doctors as
they have in the United States, and I
should like this Bill to be very carefully
looked over by my honourable friend be-

13ti

SENATE

fore it comes back to the House. I agree
with the honourable gentleman from
Brome (Hon. G. G. Foster), that this is
not the time to introduce legislation of this
kind. There is enough unrest amongst
the farmers of this country at the present
time, owing to the Fordney tariff, and
other things, and we should not do anything to add to it.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: The Bill before
the House deals with a subject which
closely touches the daily life of every man,
woman, and child in the country. It also
affects an industry in which millions of
dollars are invested in plant and machinery; and indirectly affects the organization and establishment of thousands of
business concerns which deal in food products, with all the business ramifications
which that involves. Such being the case,
we should approach any extensive or radical change in the present law with discretion, and any. departure from established business customs and practices
should be adopted only after the most
careful inquiry, investigation and consideration. The object of this Bill would appear to be two-fold: first, to surround the
cold storage business with additional safeguards as regards the health of the public;
and, second, to protect the public against
what is alleged to be a business system
which tends in the direction of food hoarding, the natural consequence of which is
to increase the price of food products to
the consuming public.
What are the facts? Is modern cold
storage a menace to the public health, and
does it lend itself to increasing the price
of food products? And, if so, is the proposed Bill calculated to remove those evils
and protect the public, and will it have a
tendency to reduce the price of commodities which the public have to buy?
Having been interested in the subject of
cold storage for many years, and therefore having given the subject more or less
close observation and study, I have no
hesitation in joining issue with the promoter of this Bill and challenging his contentions. In fact, I go further than to
challenge the accuracy of his claims; and
submit that modern cold storage, in solving the question of the preservation of
food products, bas conferred upon mankind a boon which scientific research has
failed to achieve in other activities of
business life. We have only to consider
what would happen to the food supply of
the country if cold storage facilities for
the preservation of food were suddenly
Hon.

Mr. WEBSTER.

cut off, or ceased to exist, in order to get
a viewpoint of the value to our everyday life, which modern cold storage affords.
There may be grievances on the part of
the public which is the keenest kind of competition has failed to eliminate. It would
be unreasonable to assume that a business,
extending so widely from the Atlantic to
the Pacific, and touching so closely the
every day life of every individual in the
community, did not in some of its details
or ramifications fail to work out to the
complete satisfaction of everybody. While
that may be true, I am prepared to argue
that the proposed Bill is not calculated to
improve matters or provide what may b
considered desirable relief; but, on the
contrary, that if it becomes law, it will
so complicate matters that the cost of
living will be materially increased, and,
as a result, that the enormous business in
food products will be disorganized, and the
object in view, no matter how meritorious,
will not be attained.
The cold storage business, honourable
gentlemen, as bas already been stated, dates
back to the year 1894, when the original
plant in Canada was started in the city of
Montreal. Since that time the business has
grown until in 1919, when the census of
industry was taken, there were 266 refrigeration plants in Canada, involving an
expenditure in plant and equipment of over
$35,000,000.
Since that time numerous
other plants have been added, so it is safe
to estimate that at least over $40,000,000
are invested in plant and machinery in this
business as now established.
I am not going to the republic to the
south of us to get authority or evidence of
the general usefulness of these institutions
in Canada. I think we have in the employ
of the Government of Canada an authority
upon whom we can safely rely. I refer to
Professor J. A. Ruddick, Dairy and Cold
Storage Commissioner in the Department
of Agriculture. This gentleman contributed an article to the Montreal Gazette on
January 7, 1922, and it will be interesting
to see what he has to say with reference to
the usefulness of this industry. He says:
The geographical features of Canada, with its
immense territory and long distances between
points of production on one hand, and large
centres of population on the other; the differences of climate, which permit of certain foods
being produced within limited areas that are
not produced at al in others ; the necessity of
securing a year's supply of many food products
during a producing season of six to eight
months, all combine to make the question of
cold storage of great importance to the country
from the standpoint of both the domestic and
export trades in perishable food products.

MAY 3, 1922
It would be natural to assume that a
business so widely extended as this is could
not grow without meeting difficulties, and
perhaps encountering misrepresentation in
connection with its various activities. Professor Ruddick, our own Commissioner,
deals with that question very succinctly in
the saine article, where he says:
The cold storage industry bas had to contend with much misunderstanding and misrepresentation. It bas been the football of the
demagogue, the self-seeking politician, and
others who pander to popular prejudice. The
general public, getting its information largely
from such sources, bas been misinformed as to
the proper functions lan-d uses of cold storage.
There bas been much confusion of mind even
in certain circes, and very often the term
"cold storage" is' used when the reference is
to something which is purely a matter of
trading, and has ýreally nothing to do with cold
storage.

Right here I wish to make a passing
reference to the power of the Federal
Government to pass such legislation as is
now before the Chamber. This question has
already been referred to by the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), who questioned the constitutionality
of passing such legislation. I would pay a
great deal of deference to his opinion on
the question of the power of the Federal
Government to pass such legislation as is
involved in this Bill. Not only have we
the question of the honourable gentleman
froin Ottawa, but we have the opinion of
the deputy Minister of Justice, clearly expressed in a letter which was read by the
honourable gentleman from Selkirk (Hon.
Mr. Bradbury) in moving the second reading of the Bill, expressing grave doubt as
to whether or not the Federal Government
has power to pass this legislation. If these
doubts exist on the part of the Federal authorities-and the fact that they are submitted in writing indicates that they dowhat kind of opposition may be expected
from the provincial authorities in case it
is proposed to exercise the functions proposed in the Bill? I submit that it is reasonable to expect antagonism and very strong
opposition to any such legisliation.
The promoter of this Bill, in moving
the second reading, covered a great deal
of ground, and it is not my intention to
follow him in his various arguments. I
wish at the outset, however, to correct an
impression which he left upon my mind-I
do not say he left it upon the mInds of
other honourable gentlemen-when he
claimed that it was an outrage that after
the Treasury of Canada had contributed
such an enormous sum to put this business

IWÎ

on its feet the Government should find
itself absolutely without control over it. He
quoted with great enthusiasm the statement
that the Government had contributed the
sum of $700,000 to assist in the establishment of certain cold storage plants; and
he went further and said that the value of
the cold storage plants which had been
assisted amounted to some $2,000,000. When
we consider that the total investment
in this property in Canada amounts to
between $35,000,000 and $40,000,000, the
amount that he mentioned, namely $2,000,000, is a mere bagatelle; and when we
remember that the amount contributed
under the Government bonus system was
only $700,000, we surely will not say that
any great injustice has been done to the
country when the Government find themselves without the control that they expected. Out of the $35,000,000 expended,
private industry has contributed more than
$32,000,000. So, I submit, the promoter
of this Bill cannot fairly claim that the
country is sufferling, or that any injustice
is being done.
The honourable gentleman also referred
to the hoarding of food products. Well,
it may be that in some institutions, particularly the packing plants where large
quantities of meat products are stored, this
hoarding process is carried on to some
extent; but these packing plants do not
constitute the whole cold storage system
of Canada. There are from one end of this
country to the other private institutions
affording cold storage facilities to farmers
and business men and anyone else who
desires to use the service which they render.
I have in mind some cold storage plants. I
know of one which sells its facilities to the
farmers in the surrounding district; JI
know that there are over five hundred farmers wlo kill their teef during the winter
and place it in this local cold storage plant
where it remains until it is drawn out by
the farmers themselves on Saturday nights
during the summer months, so that they
always have their own meat at their disposal, and kept under proper conditions. I
have in mind another institution in which
over 1,000 farmers place their meats under
similar conditions. I have in mind an institution in which the facilities are patronized
by the butcher for a radius of 50 or 100
miles around the countryside. They place
large quantities of beef in there in the
winter months, and during the summer
months they cause shipments to be made to
them by express of one, or two, or three

SENATE
or four quarters of beef, as they require
it, and in that way are enabled to carry
along during the summer months. So, from
the standpoint of hoarding, the farruer, the
business man, and the private individual
has the same opportunity as anybody else
if he desires. And what applies to beef
applies also to eggs and to every other
perishable product of the country.
The promoter of the Bill bas also made
the statement that tons and tons of food
products are constantly being destroyed in
cold storage institutions. I have had a
close and intimate relationship with this
business during the last fifteen or eighteen
years, and I do not think I can recall more
than one or two instances during that
period in wh!ich any quantity of food products was thrown out and destroyed as
being of no further use. I think the speech
of the honourable gentleman has been very
largely exaggérated, no doubt due to the
information which has come to him, and
which he, no doubt, has believed, but which
is wrong in many respects. I do not believe
that such a condition of affairs as he describes exists in this country or in any part
of it.
Another statement he made was that
tons of eggs were put into cold storage
after decomposition.
Those were his
words. That is another statement that I
cannot credit, and which no man who
knows anything about the cold storage
business can credit, and for this reason:
In cold storage plants certain rooms are
set apart for the storage of eggs, and if
a quantity of eggs such as the promoter of
this Bill bas referred to were put into a
room containing 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 cases
of eggs, every egg in the whole room
would be tainted and they would all be
destroyed. No cold storage plant would
allow a condition of affairs like that to
exist. Many of the provinces specifically
provide in their legislation that no eggs
shall go into cold storage without first
being candled, and that if they remain in
storage for thirty days they must be recandled.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Would the bonourable gentleman explain then how it
comes that the honourable gentleman from
Montreal (Hon. Mr. David) bas just told
us of a large quantity of eggs being thrown
out of cold storage in Montreal?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Hear, hear. I know
that is true.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: And in Winnipeg and lm Ottawa too.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Chinese eggs.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I cannot explain
every individual case that bas occurred
but I can say this: that I do know of a
shipment of Chinese eggs that came
through from Vancouver and were delivered to Montreal and Ottawa-and it
is just as fair to assume that it was those
eggs, that were ordered to be confiscated
and destroyed, as it is to assume that it
was some others. If they were not Chinese
eggs, I am not in a position to accept the
statement that this enormous quantity of
eggs was thrown out as being unfit for
use.
In considering the Bill before the House,
I want to draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to one fact which bas
a very important bearing upon the whole
argument, and that is the fact that the
Bill is directed against all cold storages.
In considering this business we must bear
in mind that there are cold storages in connection with packing plants, where a large
quantity of beef products are kept and
stored; then we must remember that there
are all over this country private institutions which confine themselves exclusively
to the storage business. These institutions are cold storage plants just as much
as the others. This Bill is directed against
all cold storage plants; consequently the
effect of it will be directed against the
private cold storage plants, which confine their activities to storage and which
own nothing within the walls of the building except the machinery and the equipment, and which have not a dollar invested
in eggs or meat or any other food product.
The Bill is bad in that it affects the institution which does not own any of the contents of its building just as much as it
does the packers whose business it is intended to control. That is one of the objectionable features I have found in this
Bill. It makes no exception at all; it
deals with all institutions of this kind, on
the same basis, whereas they should not be
so considered. Now, there are other authorities than federal authority which deal
with this matter of cold storage.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Did I understand
my honourable friend to say that there
were provincial regulations dealing with
cold storage?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Yes; I am coming to
that.
We have Dominion legis'lation on
the federal statute book, to which I will
refer, and we also 'have ýprovincial statutes
in connection with cold storage plants.

motion for second reading, when we are
d'iscussing the principle of this Bill, I presume the only thing we can do is to consider it as it stands and not what it may
possibly be at some future 'date.
The Bill, in clause 4B, tmakes provision
that food mentioned in a certain sdhedule
at the back of the Blill cannot be kept in
storage except for the tine specified opposite the names of the various produets. This
It may be
may have a two-fold purpose.
to protect the public from a health standpoint, as the originator of the Bill said;
but he also stated that it was for the purpose of preventing the public from hoarding food produets.
Viewing the Bill from the standpoint of
hoarding, I submit that anyone who wants
to hoard meat products in a cold storage
plant has just as much right as a farmer
who wants to hoard his grain on his farm
or in an elevator. I submit that we would
be as fully justified in passing a bill to
prevent a man from keeping a certain
quantity of grain for a certain time; or to
compel thé farmer to sell his cattle, for
instance, after they were two years of age,
or his hogs when they were one year old;
or to require that a merchant should not
carry sugar on his shelves for over six
months. The principle is exactly the same,
from the standpoint of hoarding. This
Bill might possibly be justified, in the mind
of the honourable member for Selkirk, from
the standpoint of public health; but from
that of hoarding the principle is absolutely
the same as in the cases I have cited.
In this schedule there are many items
which are objectionable, and I am glad to
see the promotor of the Bill bas possibly
arrived at the conclusion that they are
Others are not
more or less absurd.
reasonable, because if the articles were kept
as long as the schedule provides their sale
would have to take place in the next producing period, which I submit is absurd
on its face. Such provisions are not necessary, because the cost of storing these
produets for the period mentioned in the
schedule, plus the interest and storage
charges, would eat into the cost of the
goods so much that no man with any common sense, no firm or business institution,
would carry them in storage so long.
There are other provisions in the Bill
that upset the whole object of cold storage,
which is to preserve food in times of plenty
and provide for periods when there is no
supply. I refer particularly to the matters
of eggs and poultry; but I see that the
honourable member for Selkirk bas been
'vise in removing those articles from the

140

SENATE

schedule in order to save the fate of his
Bill, instead of providing that under certain
circumstances eggs should not remain in
storage longer than two months, or poultry
longer than three months. I commend his
action in that regard, and believe that the
Bill will have a better chance than it otherwise would in getting through this House.
Another provision of this Bill is that
the Minister may extend the time in which
goods may be kept in storage. Well, that
seems to me a very great responsibility ta
place on the Minister. There are cold
storage plants in this country and the
United States that are paying enormous
salaries to men who can read the future:
and if we had a Minister of Agriculture
wvho could tell what future prices of food
products were going to be, I think he would
be wasting his time in serving the people
cf this country as such Minister when he
could get the enormous salary that would
be open to him as manager of some produce
concern whose vital existence depends on
the knowledge of future prices. If the
Minister were a fortune teller of that capacity he would command an enormous revenue, such as he could not get as Minister
of a department of Government.
There are other objections to the Bill,
namely, the labelling of goods when they
go into storage and when they come out.
Under clause 4C it is necessary to attach
a label to every article that goes into
storage. This label, bear in mind, must
be in black letters at least one-haif of an
inch in height, and must give:(a) A description of the article.

(b) The name and address of the firm or
person on whose behalf the article is to be
stored.
(c) The date of killing, taking, packing,
manufacturing, or otherwise procuring or producing, as the case may be.
(d) The net cost of the article on the date
of storing per 'pound, dozen, package or other
unit of price.

Now. it is quite a proposition for an

owner of goods, who wants to put them
into cold storage, to fill out labels contain-

mg all that information. Bear in mind
that he must put the net cost of the article
on the label.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A label on each
egg.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I presume that
eggs would be labelled by the case; but
I am not responsible for this Bill, so don't
ask me. I submit that the provision requiring the net cost of the goods to be put
on the label is manifestly unfair.
Why
should a man have to display the cost of
goods in the produce business, when the

dry goods man and those in other trades
do not have to submit to such a requirement?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I do not suppose it is of any use to draw attention to
the fact that that is amended. My honourable friend is discussing the Bill just
as it is; but that clause ýis not in the Bill
that is coming before the House.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I thank the honourable gentleman for his information. I do
not recollect having been told that. I was
not aware of that, and there are a number of others here that were not aware of
it. Now, that is the label that has to go
on for a commodity entering into storage.
Then, the storage men have to put on their
labels all this information:
(a) The number of the license under which
the warehouse is operated.
(b) The name of the firm or person operating
the warehouse.
(c) The date on which the article was delivered for cold storage.
(d) The date on which the article was placed
in cold storage.

The manager of the storage plant under

this Bill, is held responsible for performing this duty, the neglect of which is a
criminal offence. I would like to ask the
promotor of the Bill how the manager could
manage an institution and at the same time
see that these labels go on for every commodity that enters his warehouse, and thus
protect himself from criminal prosecution.
Now, two labels are not enough, but
there is a third label, although the proposer of the Bill in introducing it mentioned
only one label. I would ask him now if
he stands by his Bill, and requires the
three to go on.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In reply to my
honourable friend, I might say the labelling as set out in the Bill with which he is
dealing is the Bill that is before the House.
all excepting where it refers to net cost;
that line is struck out. That method of
labelling bas been adopted by every state
in the Union that has legislated on this
question; I have copies of the labels here.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: So that, according to
the intention of the promotor of the Bill,
we are to have a third label; and this
third label is placed on the goods when
they go out, and it is to contain:
(a) The date on which the article was removed from cold storage.
(b) The name and address of the firm or
person to or for whom the article was delivered
by the cold storage warehouse.
(c) The date of such delivery.

It wlll cer.tainly be put up to, our dear old
friend. the consumer, and he wlll have

I submit that this system of labelling is
flot necessary in the case of vegetables or
fruits, because when they are offered for
sale the customer can see them and inspect
them. The fact that they are in cold storage does not make any difference in them;
there is nothing hîdden in their appearance; consequently labelling is unnecessary
on those things; but the Bill makes it necessary. In the case of meats, eggs, etc., the
trade itself provides a means whereby the
length of the storage period can be traced
by the warehouse rcceipts which cover the
goods when they corne into storage. That
is a matter which cvery man in the trade
knows. For instance, if one broker sells
another broker 1,000 cases of eggs, or
100,000 pounds of beef, he naturally asks,
"How long bas this been in cold storage?"
-and he is told. He does not have to accept the word of the man who seils these

parent]y my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), 'has doubts on
this question. The Deputy Minister of Justice has very grave doubts about it, and so
states in a letter quoted by the promoter
of this bill.
But the provincial goveraments are flot doubtful; they have very deciýded opinions on ithis question, for they
have proceeded to legislate with regard to
it.
I have before me a copy of the Egg
Marketing Act of the province of Saskatchewan, controlling the sale of eggs.
It
provides in clause 3:
No person shal] buy for resale or seli or offer
for sale eggs which are unfit for human food.

That is sîmilar to, one of the clauses of
my honourable friend's (Hon. Mr. Bradbury's>
bi]l.
So the province of Saskatchewan has already legislated in this
respect.
Clause 5 of the Saskatchewan
Act says:
Every person who receives on consignment
or buys eggs for resale, whether from producers or from any other source, shall candle
the same.

It says that eggs cannot go into cold
storage unless they are candled.
That
means the elimination of bad eggs.
Subsection 3 says:
Ail eggs which have been in storage for more
than thirty days shall be candled when removed
therefrom.

That prov'idýes for another candling and
another inspection.
The act further provides that a record ýmust accompany the
eggs.
There shýah be placed on the top flat of every
case off candled eggs by the person candling the
same a record in a printed form on a card or
sheet off paper flot smaller io size than two
and three-eighths loches by four and one-quarter ioches, which shall give under the word
"Saskatchewan" the liceose number of the person for whom the eggs were candled, the name,
initial or other distinguishing mark of the person by whom they were candled, and the date
off candling.

The other western provinces have established the saine principle as the province
of Saskatchewan: they have already undertaken the inspection and control of foodstuffs.
So we do not have to ask what the
provinces think about the question. They
have already legislated on it.
Moreover, I may inform my honourable
frien-d with regard to the matter of inspection, in order to show how close a system of inspection is already provided, that

cases, is shipped, a Federal inspector wîll

the 450 and will himself canýdle every egg

his inspection that if hle find more than six

whole carload on that grade.
A carload
cannot be shipped without being subject
to that rigid inspection by an inspector of
this Gove'rnment, and, I repeat, if six off
eggs a"e discovered, in the case of 360, the
whole car lIoad is condemned and canlnot be
shipped as No. 1 eggs.
Then the municipal authorities corne in.
Hardly a week

communýity does flot; call.
He sees to it,
particularly in the sunimer, that everything is in sanitary condition. So it is apparent that we already have a pretty rigid,
efficient andi effective inspection of food
products.
Now, to sum up what'I have endeavoureti
to make plain. The promoter of this Bill
stresses the period of twelve months as the
longest that food products shoulil be allowed to remain in storage.
'So far as
that ýperîod is concerned, that wiIl be
perfectly satisfacetory to ýevery cold storage man
in
the country,
because,
as I can state lhere on authority, no food
products are kept in storage for anything like twelve months. No cold storage plant wants to keep goods in store
longer than twelve months; so a provision
of that kînd is not necessary. It would not
be objected to by the trade that is interested. Another main point that the hionourable gentleman made was that nothing
should go into storage that was unfit for
human consumption. No one would object
to that provision, because nothing does go
in that is unfit for human consumption.
There is not a cold storage plant in the
country that would object to that. However, as those are the two main points
the honourable member stresses in his Bill,
it strikes me that instead of this measure
being passed, its real purpose could be
achieved by having regulations passed under the Act that is now in force-chapter
22 of the Statutes of 1914, which 1 have
already cited and which gives the Governor
in Council the power to pass such regulations. If the Governor in Council passed
those two provisions which the honourable
gentleman has advocated, there would be
no objection from the cold storage business, and if the honourable gentleman has
faith in the correctness of his «arguments,
lie must regard such regulations as a relief to suffering huir.anity in this country.
Therefore I submit that instead of handicappir.g the enornsous interests of cold

MAY 3, 1922
storage throughout Canada by paternal
legislation of this kind, we should lend our
efforts rather ta encourage the industry and
make it more useful ta the public. Improvements have been made in the business
since 1894, when the first Canadian plant
was installed in Montreal, and improvements will continue ta be made.
The farmers, I think, might very well,
and with profit ta themselves, utilize the
facilities which are offered by local cold
storage plants. Last year there was in the
country a superabundance of onions and
no one would buy them and put
them .into cold storage ta be kept
until the time when there would be
none on the market. What bas been the
result? Only three weeks ago I saw with
my own eyes a carload of onions which had
been brought all the way from Australia,
a distance of ten thousand miles, into the
interior of Canada, and were being placed
in cold storage there for the purpose of
keeping the public supplied with anionsin a country like Canada, which can grow
more onions than would feed the entire
world. Simply because the farmers did
not take advantage of the facilities which
were at their doors, it is necessary ta send
all the way ta Australia ta buy onions for
our own use.
I have said that the cold storage business would make great strides. It offers
greater opportunities and openings for the
future than have been possible in the past.
Within the last year or two experiments
have been made by the Department of
Agriculture of the United States, and the
results of those experiments have now
been given ta the public, bearing the imprimatur of the statistican and the food
experts connected with that department.
It is recommended ta the people that instead of having small fruits and vegetables tinned, they can advantageously
have them frozen in the time of plentythat is, in the summer-and put into cold
storage. Fruits like raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, loganberries and
others that I cannot at the moment recall,
and vegetables like the tomato, can be
frozen in a cold storage plant in the summer, when they are plentiful, and considerable saving can thus be effected. The
housewife can be saved the labour of putting them down-preserving them. The
tinning of them and the manufacturing of
cases can be saved, and likewise the freight
on all the extra covers and casings. The
fruits when taken out of storage at any
time during the winter will have all the

flavour of fresh fruits. I made the experiment myself last summer, and found
this method ta be very effective. During
the months of January and February I
was able ta have fresh raspberry pie on

is an advance which the cold storage business has made, and the improvement is
going to be more pronounced as time goes
on. It is possible that within a reasonable time people in far-away parts of the
country will be able by utilizing cold storage facilities ta preserve small fruits and
vegetables in a frozen condition until they
desire ta use them in the winter, and will
then be in the happy position of having
fresh fruit instead of stale canned stuff
ta consume during the winter months. Sa
I say that this is a business which is
capable of great expansion and of conferring great benefits on the peopfle of
the country, and instead of imposing handicaps and holding it back by paternal legislation such as this, we ought ta
encourage the efforts which are being
made ta develop the cold storage industry
and to make it more useful ta the general
public.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me a question? Would
the passing of this Bill adversely affect
the proprietors of cold storage plants in
the Dominion in a financial way?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: My answer ta that
question is that it would, by reason of the
onerous impositions with regard ta labelling and the serious inroads it would make
upon the revenues of many of the cold
storage plants. In fact it would make it
practically impossible for them to carry
on under present conditions. They would
have ta enlarge their staff, management,
etc., ta such an extent that unless they
could pass the extra cost on ta the consumer it would be impossible for them ta

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, it is not my intention ta speak at
length on this subject, for the simple reason that it is a subject with which I am not
very familiar. My honourable friend from
Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbury) is deserving of a good deal of thanks from this
House and from the country for introducing this Bill in the way that he has done.

come from persons who are interested in
cold storage, seems to furnish all the more
proof that this bill should be proceeded
with; that is, that it should be given a
second reading and referred to a committee,
in order that we may all learn something
more about the question and determine
which is right-the contention of my honourable friend from Selkirk or the statements made and criticism offered by my
honourable friend the cold storage man
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird). I judge
from the statement of my honourable friend
from Regina that practically the whole
objection to the Bill is that it would add
considerable cost in the way of labelling
goods that were in cold storage. If that
is the case, surely we can adjust the matter when the Bill comes before the special
committee or the committee of the whole
House.
Usually I am quite in agreement with
my honourable friend from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Foster). Very seldom do I find myself in ýdisagreement with him. But I must
say that I do not follow him in the argument that he advanced this afternoon, that
because conditions are not very good for
the farmer in Canada at the present time,
or for the business interests, we should
not take any action or try to better the
conditions. The way to better conditions
is, in my opinion, not to give the Bill the
six months' hoist, but to look into it very
closely and try to determine whether or
not the Bill is necessary.
If it is found
to be unnecessary, it will be time enough
then to throw it out; but if it is necessary,
let us amend it in such a way that it will
be a good Bill and in the interest of the
people of Canada.
As I understand my honourable friend
from Selkirk, what he is trying to bring
about is something that will be of advantage to the general public. I have not
heard one word from him in any way
against the cold storage business of Canada. We all agree that cold storage is
one of the modern developments, one of
the necessities in business.
But if the
proper condition does not exist in Canada
at the present time, surely there ought to
be some way of remedying the situation.
If I understand rightly my honourable
friend who introduced the Bill, he is trying
to bring about conditions which were evidently intended by the Government in
1914 when they introduced the Cold Storage
Warehouse Act. It provided for certain
safeguards. To my mind, one of the great
safeguards which my honourable friend
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

from Selkirk wishes to have enacted into
law is that there should be an inspection of
food products, particularly perishable goods,
going into cold storage, in order to see that
they are in absolutely perfect condition at
the time they enter. The desirability of
having such a safeguard has not been
refuted at all in any criticism offered so
far. If food that bas started to decompose or -is in any way tainted is placed
in cold storage, the fact that the cold st-rage is 'all right will not improve it. There
is no doubt, honourable gentlemen, that
tons and hundredis of tons of all kinds of
perishable food placed in cold storage are
thrown on the dump-heap every year. My
honourable friend from Regina could not
call to mind any instances of considerable
quantities being thrown out, but I remember reading time and time again of such
instances. Scarcely a week goes by that
we do not find in the newspaper the statement that some perishable food has been
taken out of cold storage and dumped
in the nuisance ground as being unfit for
human food. In all probability that food
was never inspected before it was placed
in cold storage. The Bill of my honourable friend from Selkirk would provide
for the inspection of the food before storage. A great deal of food that is tainted
when it goes in is sold to the consuming
public before it becomes so bad that it
would have to be thrown out. I have
read accounts of hundreds of tons of food
being wasted in that way.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Two hundred tons
of fish at Selkirk.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend from Portage la Prairie tells me
that 200 tons of fish were thrown out at
Selkirk. I know in particular of one case
of ptomaine poisoning in which the man
almost lost his life as a result of eating
some canned fish; but I do not know
whether the fish had been in cold storage
or not. It may never have been in cold
storage at all. However, I do think that
in the interest of the people of Canada we
cannot be too careful about the quality of
the food that goes into cold storage.
The honourable gentleman from Regina
(Hon. Mr. Laird) two or three times quotes
the Deputy Minister of Justice as expressing grave doubts regarding the right or
the power of this House to pass this legislation. True, my honourable friend from
Selkirk read us a letter in which the Deputy
Minister of Justice stated his grave doubt
that Parliament could pass this legislation
under a Cold Storage Act; but the Deputy

SENATE
to be advanced in favour of the Bill that
I think it should go to Committee, and
I am going to vote for the second reading.
The question of the relative jurisdiction of
the Dominion and the provinces in matters
of trade and commerce and public health
have been the subject of discussion ever
since this Parliament first existed. If you
read the debates of either House you will
find that at no time has this question been
satisfactorily settled. It is still an open
question, and for my part I do not know
just exactly which side presents the strongI sometimes ithink that
est argument.
when the question goes to the Privy Council, it may be deci.ded by the flip of a coin.
If this Bill is unconstituional, we are driven
to the conclusion that the following Acts,
which are in force to-day, are also unconstitutional; the Animal Contagious Diseases Act; the Act with regard to Tuberculosis in Cattle and Hogs-and in parenthesis it is perhaps not out of the way to
say that we ought to give the animal man
as much consideration as we give the animal hog-the Inspection of Animals Act;
the Inspection of Foods Act; the Food
Adulteration Act. These are all subjects
which are as much open to question with
regard to constitutionality as the one now
under discussion. At the time these Bills
were introduced there was a great deal of
diversity of opinion with regard to them,
but they were passed, and they are being
acted upon to-day. Another Bill in which
I took a great deal of interest was the Bill
respecting the Pollution of Navigable
Rivers. The constitutionality of that measure was queried in the same way. This
House, however, passed that Bill unanimously on five different occasions; so, after
all, I think the balance of argument is at
present in favour of the constitutionality
of the Bill before us; and I should be very
sorry if anybody voted against the second
reading on the ground that it may not be
within our jurisdiction.

from Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbury), who

trouble, to look into it thoroughly and not
give it what I might almost call the contemptuous hoist.
The subject of cold storage, so far as
Parliament is concerned, commenced, I
think, about fifteen years ago. At that
time, I remember, the honourable Minister
of Agriculture of that day-I think it was
the honourable Sydney Fisher-was instant,
in Parliament and out, in pressing the
great importance of cold storage, and in
speaking of refrigeration on board our
steamers as well as on the ordinary railway transports. At the present time we
all know that the great improvements which
have taken place in the methods of refrigeration have been such as to pretty
well clear away all the objections to cold
storage as it was when it started out
originally, I suppose, from the domestic
ice box. It is now so general that it bas
become practically a part of our domestic
existence, and we are really dependent to
a large extent upon the cold storage system
for a large proportion of the food that we
eat. In this way, it becomes important as
a health matter; it really affects the public health to such an extent that all of us
must naturally take an interest in it.
I know nothing more of the legal aspect
than has been expressed by the Deputy
According to his
Minister of Justice.
opinion it is certainly within the power of
this Parliament to make rules and regulations affecting the public health. It would
almost seem, therefore, that under the circumstances it would be better to place the
cold storage system of this country under
the iDepartment of the Minister of Health
rather than under the department of Agriculture. In that way the Department, in
the interest of public health, could make
regulations dealing with cold storage plants,
so far as they might be considered necessary.

Now, what does this Bill do? As far as
I am able to see, it simply makes an attempt to protect the consumer. My experience in Parliament has been that to a
very large extent-the largest extent, indeed-the protection given by legislation
bas been to various classes: the manufacturers, the farmers, and people like that.
Here we have a very great change; here is
a Bill brought in to protect the ordinary
public; and, as we are all consumers, I
think we ought to look upon it with the
very greatest sympathy. The objection
has been raised by some of those who have
spoken against the Bill that the label

MAY 3, 1922
would be very objectionable to the cold
storage people. It appears to me that the
label showing the date on which the goods
are rèceived, and other information, is the
crux of the whole business. If you take
that provision out of the Bill, to my mind
the rest of it would be of very little use.
At the present time the consumer bas no
knowledge of what he is buying; he does
not really know, I suppose, that what he
is purchasing has ever been in cold storage at all; and there is nothing'to guide
him in that respect. I think he is entitled
to know what he is buying.
So far as the cold storage people are concerned, I do not see that this provision is
going to affect them injuriously. I am
told that they do not fill up their warehouses with goods, but that other people,
traders in food products, speculators, if
you like, buy these things and put them
into the cold storage warehouses. The
burden of putting on the label containing
the information as to date, and so on, is
not put upon the cold storage proprietor,
but upon the man who puts the goods in
the storage. Why should the cold storage
people object to that? I do not see that it
is going to injure them at all. On the
other hand, it is going to protect the consumer; and as that is all I can see in this
Bill, I feel compelled to vote against the
amendment, and I sincerely hope that it
will be defeated. After all, the trouble
which the honourable gentleman from Selkirk has taken in preparing this Bill, I
think the least we can do is to give it
proper consideration. I would say, give
the Bil its second reading and send it to
some committee where it may receive the
study of which the subject is worthy.
Hon. JOHN McLEAN: Honourable gentlemen, my objection, in the first place, is to
the schedule of the Bill. For instance, it
says that butter should not be held in cold
storage longer than eleven months; that
eggs, in April and May, should not be held
longer than two months.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY:
changed.

That is all

Hon. Mr. McLEAN: The objection I
took was to the Bil as it was introduced.
For instance, fish, not for export, should
not remain in cold storage longer than
eight months; fish for export, three
months.
I am not interested in the cold storage
business any further than this. Our firm
have a chemical cold storage plant; we ship

S-101

fish right to the city of Ottawa; we do not
get those fish until August, September and
October.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why is- it that
we get such bad fish in Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: You do not know
how to cook them.
I can show the
honourable gentleman as good a haddock as he ever saw in his ilife, and
it was put into cold storage last October.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
them here.

You never see

Hon. Mr. McLEAN: You do not go to
the right store. The honourable gentleman
who introduced this Bill quoted American
authorities and spoke of the inspection of
fish, and alil that sort of thing. I leave it to
any honourable gentleman from the Maritime Provinces to say whether or not the
regulations proposed would be applicable in
the Maritime Provinces. Herring, for instance, are caught down the Richibueto and
in that vicinity in May and June; aiong the
coast of Shelburne they are caught in July,
August and September.
We catch our
mackerel in the month of June, and put
them into cold storage. We ship them to
New York in the month of Janaury, because we have no accommodation for shipping them across in the summer time;
and I could produce a letter which was
written about six weeks ago saying that
mackerel had never been received in better
condition than those we had put into cold
storage last June. Those fish went into the
United States without any certificate and
without any labels. If the authorities there
had been as particula.r as my honourable
friend from Selkirk says they are, those
fish could not have been shipped into
New York.
I have no objection to the inspection of
cold storage; my objection is to the times
named in the schedule, which, to my mind,
with one or two exceptions, are wrong. In
the case of fish, not frozen for export the
schedule states three months. If you put
that into force it shuts out the business
altogether.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Will my honourable friend permit me? I know he wants
to be fair. This Bill was introduced for
the purpose of trying to do good, not harm;
and the honourable gentlemen must have
heard me state that I was going to move
an amendment which would wipe out that
schedule altogether, and that twelve months
would be the period for all goods.

SENATE

r48

Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: I would suggest
that the Bill be turned inside out, and another Bill brought in, because this schedule,
with one or two exceptions, is wrong. It
might be corrected in Committee, and I
would have no objection to that being done.
In reference to the honourable gentleman's
statement that $700,000 was paid in
bonuses to cold storage businesses, I would
point out that a great deal of that money
was thrown away, not by the Government
intentionally, but the Agricultural Department tried a system of cold storage by
salt and ice, and 25 or 30 such plants
were started in the Maritime Provinces,
but they all proved failures, as goods could
not be kept for any length of time by that
system. They then commenced the subsidizing of chemical freezers, which have proved
a great success in the Maritime Provinces.
In regard to labelling goods that corne
into cold storage, we have a cold storage
plant for our own particular business,
fish; but in the fall of the year people
kill off their fowl, and farmers will come in
and want to put 20 or 30 fowl, geese, ducks,
etc., into storage and hold them till the end
of the year. They do the same in regard
to carcasses of beef and pork. If we had
to label all those things we could not allow those people to put their goods into
storage without charging them for the
cost of the clerk to keep the record. If
we had the Bill in committee, and subpoened practical men from cold storage
plants, we could probably frame a Bill
which would meet the approval of the whole
House, and be a benefit to the entire country. While I object to the Bill in its present form, especially in regard to the
schedule, I would be very glad to assist
the Committee to improve it as far as
possible.

Honourable
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY:
gentlemen, in conformity with what I said

That Bill B, entitled An Act to amend the
Cold Storage Warehouse Act, be referred to
the consideration and report of a special
committee composed of the following Senators:
Hon. Messieurs Belcourt, Casgrain, Daniels,
Foster (Alma), Michener, McCoig, McHugh,
McLean, McMeans, Pope, Tanner, Taylor, Turriff and the mover; and that the special committee have power to send for persons, papers
and records.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the
pleasure of the House that the name of
the Hon. Mr. Laird be added to the committee?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am not going
to object to that. The reason why I did
not put the honourable gentleman on the
committee was that I thought there was a
rule that honourable gentlemen who were
directly interested should not be on a committee or take part in it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You put Senator
MeLean on, and he is directly interested.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I did not know
he was. However, I am quite satisfied to
have Hon. Mr. Laird on.
The motion, with the addition of the
name of Hon. Mr. Laird to the committee,
was agreed to.

UNMARRIED WOMEN VOTERS
MOTION

Hon. L. O. DAVID moved:
That this House is of the opinion that it
would be opportune to amend the articles of
the Electoral Law respecting female suffrage
in such a way that unnarried women not being
at least thirty years of age be not entitled to
vote.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I do
not intend to make a very long speech on
this motion. As usual, I content myself
with only a few words. Enjoying as we do
the benefit of political institutions, I have
always thought that in the application of
those principles we ought to be guided as
much as possible by what is done in England, in order to secure the good and efficient working of those institutions. When
one reads the books written by the great
historians of England and the speeches
made by the illustrious members of the English parliament, one cannot but admire the
Hon. Mr.

DANDURAND.

principles which they advocated and act in
accordance with their teachings. One of
the questions which has most exercised
their minds is the question of the franchise, and men like the famous Lord
Brougham, Fox, and others thought and
said that the best law on that matter was
the law that gave the right to vote to the
greatest number of those who were able to
give an intelligent, independent, and honest vote. There is no doubt that if the vote
were always intelligent, independent, and
honest, democratic institutions would be as
nearly perfect as human institutions can be.
It has been under the influence of the principles esitablished by the great English parliamentarians that British institutions have
done so much good to the world and have
produced so many great men. Naturally
the number of those able to give an intelligent, independent, and honest vote has
increased, and the progress of democracy
and of education has required and obtained
that suffrage should be extended as much
as possible and even given to women. That
was the extreme. But it was restricted
or limited to women being at least thirty
years old and occupying premises of the
yearly value of five pounds or married
to men duly registered. Why did the British parliament make that restriction? It
was because the members thought that a
woman below that age would not have the
qualifications, and could not give a vote
based upon sufficient knowledge to be in
the best interest of the country.
If our law had been framed in accordance with the English law, it would be less
objectionable and less dangerous; and it
is in order to make it as similar as possible to the English law that I move this
resolution to have it amended. If there is
reason for that law in England, there is
more reason for it in a young country like
Canada, where what is wanted is not
political women, but women who will give
their time and solicitude to their children.
I have a high idea of the mission of woman
and of her influence, when she limits berself to the function which has been assigned to her by Providence-when she
devotes herself to the welfare and happiness of her family and society. There is
the realm in which she must exercise her
activities, her zeal, and her moral influence;
and she must keep away from everything which may weaken her authority and
prestige, and prevent her from doing what
the interest of family and society requires.
I have always had the greatest admiration
and praise for woman and the role which

MAY 9, 1922
she plays in this world. Experience will
show that her introduction into the political
field will do her no good and w'ill do no good
to society. But I want to protect at least,
our girls, our daughters, from the contamination of politics at an age when they
should be preparing thenselves to fulfil their duties as mothers and wives, and
when they are not in the condition enabling
them to give what the great English parliamentarians called an intelligent and independent vote. 'Generally they do not
wish the right to vote; and I think honourable gentlemen will be obliged to admit
that they were wrong in giving them that
right. What do girls between the ages of
21 aqd 30 years know about politics? They
kntw nothing at all about politics, and they
do not care to know anything; and, if they
were consulted, I am certain that the great
majority of them would be opposed to the
law giving them the right to vote. There
are thousands of girls who voted at the
last election who did not know who was
the Prime Minister or who was the chief
of the Opposition, or what their policies
Think, honourable gentlemen, of
were.
the thousands of servant girls, poor girls,
who never heard a word of politics or read
a political paper, and who did not even
know what the word " tariff " meantwhether it was a man or a woman.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: You may laugh; but
I know what I know. How can they give
an intelligent vote, honourable gentlemen?
They will vote as they are told by either
their master or their mistress, and you
simply have a useless and costly multiplication of votes. You load the electoral lists
with voters who do not cast an intelligent
vote.
But there is something worse. Sioner
or later they will come under radical influences, and the result will be that the
vote of the man who has studied political
questions for twenty-five or thirty years
will be annulled by the vote of his little
Is it not absurd? I am told
servant girl.
that in the last election, in a little town
not far from Montreal, the girls employed
by a big manufacturer were saying: "Our
masters are for the Government candidate;
we will vote for the other man."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, they were
right.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: It is said that there
is no reason for refusing them a right
which is given to boys or young men of

1b3

the same age. Yes, there is a reason-a
strong reason. A great number of these
young men are students, who, in the colleges and universities, have acquired political knowledge, who have studied political economy, and have continued to learn
what enables them to give an intelligent
vote. And generally almost all young men
between 21 and 30 years of age read political papers and frequent the clubs and
assemblies where political questions are
discussed. But where and how will girls
of the same age acquire political knowledge? Will they be advised to attend
clubs and public meetings, to go to places
where they would see and hear nothing
good, where their modesty, delicacy of
feelings and moral qualities would be more
or less affected? Knowing what I know,
if I had girls of that age, I would certainly
forbid them going to these places, or these
meetings. It is not the atmosphere where
they will acquire what family and society
will require froin them, where they will
prepare themselves to fulfil the duties of
their noble mission. We know how girls
are impressionable and subject to all kinds
of influences. Let us leave them at home
under the beneficent influence of their
mothers, in the sanctuary of the family,
as far away as possible from everything
more or less dangerous.
We like to say that we are preparing
the destinies of a great country-of a great
nation. Women must do their share in
that patriotic work, provided they do it
in the family and social sphere and leave
to men the political domain. There is so
much good to do in the social world, so
many miseries to relieve, so many evils to
remove, as to afford an unlimited field for
their devotedness, their intellectual and
moral activities.
Not wishing to discuss the whole
question of female suffrage, I wish only
to remove what I consider the worst
features of our law, and I hope that the
members of this House will consider my
motion worthy of their consideration. I
have often said that the Senate was the
place where the political and social problems which concern the welfare and the
future of our country should be properly
and independently discussed, in order to
show its usefulness. It is the place where
everything which may affect the good
working of our beloved British institutions
and disorganize our social world must be
opposed and fought with energy.
The motion was negatived: yeas, 19;
nays. 33.

PENITENTIARY BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 25, an
Act to amend the Penitentiary Act.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.

On section 1-prisoner may be kept in
penitentiary, etc., until necessary documents, including a certificate of health, are
delivered to warden:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a gap
in the Act which, according to my information, had been noticed by very many Ministers of Justice, but as there seemed to
be no difficulty arising it was not sought
to cure the difficulty by legislation.

What

has prompted the present Minister of Justice to move in that direction I cannot say,

except that I see what is sought by this
legislation.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend, while ho is on his
feet, tell us where the prisoner would be
kept except in the penitentiary to which
he was sentenced, and within the walls of
which he is in custody until he is transferred to some other?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will listen to the reading of
section 45 of the Penitentiary Act to which
it is proposed to add this proviso, the
matter will be made clear. Section 45 of
the Act reads as follows:
Whenever a prisoner is ordered by competent
authority te be conveyed to any penitentiary
from any other penitentiary, or from a reformatory prison, or from a gaol, there shall be
delivered to the warden of the penitentiary receiving such prisoner, together with alil other
necessary documents, a certificate signed by
the medical officer of the institution from which
such prisoner has been taken, and countersigned
by the official in charge of the penitentiary,
reformatory or gaol from which such prisoner
bas been taken, declaring that such prisoner is
free from any putrid, infectious or contagious
disease, and that he is fit to be removed.

Now, the addition runs as follows:
Provided tha.t a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary, or ordered by
competent authority to be crmveyed to any penitentiary from any other penitentiary, or from
a reformatory, prison, or from a gaol, may
remain and be kept in lawful custody in the
penitentiary, reformatory, prison or gaol fron
which he was sentenced or ordered to be conveyed until the necessary documents, including
the certificate hereinbefore required, shall have
been delivered te the warden of the penitentiary
receiving such prisoner.

This covers the case of a prisoner conveyed
te the penitentiary without that certificate,
and while the certificate is sought for his
detention in the penitentiary, although he
may be returned later on, under clause 46,
which is to be amended, to the gaol from
which he came. So this empowers the warden
of the penitentiary to retain him provisionally while this certificate is being obtained.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I

intended to prevent prisoners affected with
infectious and contagious diseases from

MAY 9, 1922
Not

being a lawyer, and not knowing about
these things from a technical viewpoint, to
my mind such a prisoner, as soon as he is
sentenced, comes under the control of the
Federal Government, which becomes liable
for his detention and all the expense in
connection with him. I understand that
there are very few ordinary gaols and other
prisons throughout the country that have
the necessary accommodation for sick prisoners, and it would certainly become
rather a serious question as to how such
prisoners would be looked after and who
would be responsible for them. I think
the clause ought to stand a while and have
a little more consideration. Apparently it
does not make any difference what is the
cause of the prisoner's sentence. It might
be for murder, or for some other
serious offence; still the local authorities
would be responsible for his care and
keep, and all expense in connection with it.
I think consideration of the clause ought
to be postponed, and some amendments
made to it so that the local authorities on
whom the prisoner is imposed may have
some idea as to how they are to be reimbursed. Considerable expenses may be
incurred for extra guards, nursing, doctors, etc. Perhaps the honourable gentleman who introduced the Bill will explain
that matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amendment sought by this Bill simply sanctions
a practice that has so far been uniform.
As to the objections of my honourable
friend to the Federal authorities throwing upon the Provincial authorities the
obligation to attend to sick prisoners, they
relate more properly to the legislation at
present on the statute book. The amendments now proposed are but consequential.
The principle embodied in clauses 45 and
46 is that after a prisoner has been condemned to the penitentiary he must be
conveyed from the provincial jail to the
penitentiary, and the warden of the penitentiary is prohibited under clause 46 from
receiving himHon. Mr. MURPHY: Even now.
now,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -even
if he has not the certificate from the
medical authority of the jail from which
he comes and that certificate is not ratified by the medical authority of the penitentiary. Yet there is in the conveyance
of the prisoner this little difficulty, that
he has been transferred to the penitentiary, he is there practically in the hands

of the warden, and the warden has him
under his charge, but has not the certificate of the doctor of the jail nor the
certificate of the penitentiary doctor. The
provincial authority-the jailer or the
sheriff of the district from which the
prisoner comes-could perhaps say: "I
have delivered the prisoner to you and will
not take him back." That is the second
case. In the first instance the warden may
say: "I am prohibited from accepting the
prisoner until I have the two certificates:
he
I have not got the first one." Or, if
has received the first one, he may say:
"I have not yet received the certificate
from the penitentiary doctor." Still, the
warden has the prisoner irregularly in his
charge. This amendment is simply to provide that the fact that the warden has the
prisoner shall not prevent the warden from
complying with clauses 45 and 46 and
requiring those certificates.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
clause is all right as it is-no doubt about
that.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: A man's liberty
may be taken away under our laws. The
purpose of this amendment, I suppose, is
to protect the public, particularly persons
who may innocently get into contact with
that man. Does the honourable leader of
the Government not think it would be
better to let this matter stand, and to have
in our penitentiaries a place of segregation where competent medical service could
be rendered to prisoners? We know that
such service is not rendered, and there is
no place to render it properly, in the ordinary municipal or provincial jail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
question does not arise in this connection.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Under the circumstances I want to make just this remark,
that our penitentiaries have not the proper
safeguards. It is provided that there must
be a certificate. Well, it is very easy for
a man who is not qualified for his position,
or whose conscience is not scrupulous, to
write out a certificate. I have seen a good
many instances. However, I want to draw
attention to the fact that there is in this
country no penitentiary that should not
have a place of segregation where prisoners
could be properly treated. A man sent to

be put away and cured of that disease. I

did not arise when the Bill came before the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can my
honourable friend give us at the moment
any information-and if he cannot, will he
be good enough to inform the House after
he bas made inquiries-as to the provisions
touching pensions, with reference to the
Militia, the Department of Naval Service,
and the Air Service? Are there special
Pension Acts touching all those services?
And what would be the policy of the Department as to the future?

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 27, an
Act respecting the Department of National
Defence.
Hon. Mr. Bolduc in the Chair.
On section 1-short title:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend be good enough to say

how the Act will operate? What will be
the effect of the absorption of the other
Departments into the Militia Departmentfor instance, with regard to pensions and
as to the different advantages or provisions
now extended to the memhers of the Militia? Is it proposed that there shall be
any distinction as between the Naval Service, the Militia, and the Air Service, and
will their separate rights be continued and
maintained, or is it proposed ýo merge all
the services in one general fu,.ion, so that
the policy of the Department, say respecting the matter of pensions, will extend
similarly to all branches? I do not find any
provision made for that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
From my
reading of the Act I see nothing that
changes the positions of the different
classes of service men. Authority is taken
for retiring a certain number of them,
and pensioning them off, but I do not see
anything that would vary their positions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What is
the intention of the Government, so far as
my honourable friend can inform us, as
to bringing all branches of the service under one policy? Or is it proposed to maintain a different policy in regard to each
service, or to continue that which now pertains to each, instead of placing all the
members of the different services upon the
same basis in one Department of National
Defence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, I
do not know whether a uniform rule could
be applied to the Naval Service and the

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to tell
the honourable leader of the Government
that the Pension Board's classification with
respect to venereal diseases is the most
absurd that there could be. I will not go
into detail or discuss the matter in its
finest points. I hope the Government will
reconsider this classification and put it on a
rational basis.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
I think that the
Committee might be given some reason
why the Government is making this change.
Is it on the score of economy, or for what
reason are the diTFerent departnerts anited?
If it is on the ground of economy, I think
the honourable gentleman who leads the
Government should give us some idea of
what economy will be effected, by this
change. Will there be any difference in
the deputy ministers? Will there be any
fewer than there are now?
Or what
economy will really b effected by placing
these three departments under one headoutside, of course, the economy of having
one head instead of two.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was felt
that logically the three departments pertaining to defence should be united, and the
hope was expressed that in uniting them
considerable economy might be effected by
amalgamating the staffs that are now doing similar work in the three separate
departments.
I know, for instance, that
there will be an amalgamation of the
accounting staffs and a reduction in num-

Naval and Militia departments have each
its purchasing staff, and gradually-though
in what form I do not know-the two
staffs will be brought down to half their
present number. Various economies can
be effected, but the principal object was
to unite under one head the departnents
of defence-the Air Board, the Naval Service and the Militia Department. I find
that on that point there was unanimity
amongst all the members in the other House
who had occasion to express themselves.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Could
not my honourable friend give us some idea
or some illustration to show where in those

to me that when the Government of the
day first took up the proposal to merge

it ought to be an easy matter to inform the
House what those economies are, or to give
us some outline of the method that will be

reading of the Bill, there is no provision for
doing away with the Deputy Head of the
Naval Service, or with the staff of that Department.

to do so. I have no -doubt that the uniting
of the departments will give the Minister
an opportunity to use the pruning-knife.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If the amalgamation is not made on account of economy, I
cannot understand what reason there would
be; and the more I examine and consider
the matter, the less can I see where economy will be effected, unless there are
changes to be made of which the honourable gentleman who has just taken his
seat has not been able to assure us. There
will be one Deputy Minister whereas there
are now at least two. I think the Air Service
was always -more or less under the Militia
Department; but, the Naval Service was
not a department by itself, but was under
the head of the Marine and Fisheries Department. There is no Cabinet position
saved by this change; there is no head of
a department saved; and what is saved?
Apparently not even a deputy minister.
As far as the purchasing branch is concerned, as I understand it-perhaps I am
wrong-there is a Purchasing Board which
makes the purchases for all the various departments. So I do not see where there
is. going to be any economy effected there,
so far as the heads of departments are
concerned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There will be.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: There cannot be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is not the
intention of the Minister of Militia to retain two deputy heads for this department
when it is united.
Hon. Mr. POPE: It would seem to me
that under the present Administration it
is useless to take up the time of this House
in asking questions as to what the Minister
of Militia proposes to do, particularly
after the exhibition in another place a
few days ago. He informed the Dominion
of Canada from his seat in the House that
so far as the militia was concerned he

SENATE
would reduce the expenditure to the lowest
possible consideration, which was $1,400,000. After the caucus of the party to which
the honourable gentleman belonged, it was
discovered that a further economy of $700,000 could be made, and that efficiency
could still be maintained. I say it is useless to take up the time of this House
asking the Minister of Militia what economy he proposes to effect by this Act. I
think it would be far better if we were to
send a delegate to attend the caucus of
the Government, and to ascertain what the
Government is going to be permitted to do
with regard to the Militia of the Dominion
and other matters affecting the welfare of
the country.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I would call the
attention of the House to the fact that
this movement is along the line recommended some time ago by the Committee
of this House on the Machinery of Government, the ground taken by that Committee
being that the more you could concentrate
similar services the greater efficiency you
would get. This step in this direction, I
take it, is possibly due to the work of that
Committee, which received more attention
in other countries than it has in Canada.
It is a step in this direction just in the
same way that the establishment of the
Department of Public Health was a step
towards getting greater efficiency.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What is the connection between the army and the navy?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: They are both
for the purpose of defence; and it concerns
us that there are two branches of the
same thing, one on land and one on the
sea.
Hon.
Mr.
GRIESBACH:
Generally
speaking, it can be said of this Bill, as
of any other proposai of a similar nature,
that a good scheme with poor men to
carry it out will probably fail; conversely,
it may be said that a poor scheme with good
men to carry it out will probably succeed.
The arguments put forward in support of
this Bill in another place, and suggested
here to-night, are the arguments of economy and efficiency. I do not know that I heard
very much said here about efficiency, but
there was a great deal said about it in
another place. As a matter of fact, there
is only one real argument which influences
me, and which will induce nie to support
the Bill. That argument is the fact that
you have here three services-the army,
the navy, and the air force-three great
departments of the Government, which
Hon. Mr.

POPE.

function in three distinct elements-on
land, on the water, and in the air. These
three departments have nothing in common. Some reference has been made to a
purchasing department.
The purchasing
departments will scarcely be merged, because they are not purchasing the same
things. The argument which appeals to
me in support of this Bill is that these
three Departments of the Government, having a common object to fulfil, namely, the
defence of the country, will function best
if they are all brought under the control
of one brain. That is the argument which
should induce honourable gentlemen to support this proposal; and what I said in the
beginning follows, that the best possible
scheme will fail unless you have the right
men carrying 'it out, just as the worst
scheme may possibly succeed if good men
have the control.
The Bill as advanced by the Government
is based upon two arguments: firstly,
that of economy, and, secondly, that of
efficiency. There is not very much in common between these Departments; and, in
order that they may be properly administered, they must have heads in the future
as they have had in the past.
I can see no economies, except arbitrary
economies, which are probably false economies, and which will seriously affect the
efficiency of all the services. These economies probably mean a lower standard of
efficiency, if that be possible. I have prepared a statement of the figures which are
involved in the discussion, in order to show
exactly what the economies are which will
be claimed by the Government from the inauguration of this scheme. Last year the
expenditure on militia was $11,954,178.75;
this year 'it is $10,718,400, a decrease of
expendliture, or an economy, if you like,
of $1,165,778.75. Last year's expenditure
on the Navy was $3,726,980; this year it
is $2,701,400; a decrease or an economy
of $1,025,580.
On the Air Force last year
we spent $1,625,000; this year we will
spend $1,000,000, a decrease or an economy
of $625,000. The total of these three services last year was $17,306,158.75; this year
it will be $14,489,800, a decrease or an
economy of $2,816,358.75.
These are the economies for which the
Government will claim credit. It then becomes interesting to inquire how these are
arrived at and what will be the results as
to efficiency. My first observation in that
regard is that these economies are not and
were not based upon technical advice; they
were not based upon expert opinion; they

MAY 9, 1922
have no regard for national sentiment,
national status, our aspirations or our
responsibilities. They are, in fact, based
upon political expediency, and, what is
probably worse, political impotence, as has
been stated by the honourable gentleman
opposite. Let us consider for a moment
the Militia estimates as brought down. In
the first place, there is no possible doubt
that the technical advisers of the Government who prepared these Estimates had
been told that they would be required to
bring down Estimates in these three
branches of, the public service which would
be less than the expenditures of last year.
That is the starting point-that they must
be lower than were those of last year.
However, they are brought down and
handed to the Minister. The Minister carries out the paring process; he says he
pared to the bone. The Estimates are then
brought to the Cabinet and pared closer
to the bone; they are finally agreed upon
and brought to the House. Then we see
the spectacle of a measure which has been
carefully considered by the Cabinet, and
brought to the House as being the lowest
possible expenditure consistent with efficiency, being rejected, and of the Estimates
finally having to be disposed of in a caucus
of the supporters of the Government, with
the result that there was, so we are told,
a substantial reduction. I recollect that
in a similar case Lord Roseberry saw fit
to resign his portfolio; and I would commend that incident to the consideration of
the honourable Minister of Militia.
Military efficiency is based on men,
money, and leadership; and the greatest of
these is leadership. But leadership without money is helpless. What is the use of
the best leadership in the world if it is not
backed by men and money? We in Canada
have never had such leadership in things
military as we have at the present time.
Our experience in the war has produced
men who know what ought to be done in
things military. But these gentlemen have
not been heard; their advice bas not been
taken; and the matter is being disposed of
on a basis of political expediency-and
that is the basis of these economies.
Now, the Bill to amalgamate these two
Departments is before the House, but it is
now being practically carried into effect.
What is the result of the amalgamation so
far, and what is the result of the situation which bas been brought about by the
Government at this time? The first result
is that, by reason of these arbitrary and
false economies, service in the permanent
army of Canada is becoming a joke. There

159

are curtailments of expenditure which involve a shifting and changing in the service.
Positions are being done away with or
minimized, and the future of a man in the
permanent service of Canada is not worth
bothering about. To-day, good men who,
distinguished themselves in the great war,
and who are competent and qualified to
occupy their positions, have decided that
there is no future for them in the permanent force of Canada, and they are getting
out. Some have gone, and others are going.
That is the first result of the economies
under this proposal. The second result is
that it is now manifest to every man who
bas interested himself in the militia work
of this country that there is no encouragement in the Service. There are to be no
funds; nothing is to be done; the Service is
to stagnate and perhaps to die; and there is
no reason why any high-spirited man should
bother himself further with it.
As a result of these things, failure is in
sight, and men who have given a great
deal of time and money to the Service
have already made up their minds that
under this Administration they had better
get out while the going is good.
The next effect of the economy under
this proposal is confusion. To-day preparations are going forward, or ought be,
for the annual training of the Militia. That
is a large undertaking. It involves the
securing the camp grounds, the moving of
large bodies of men and horses, provision
for fodder and food; it also involves in every
hamlet in Canada the gathering together
of men, the issuing of clothing and equipment and arms. Under normal conditions
the whole Militia would be astir now; we
are within thirty days of the opening of
this training. But because of vacillation,
lack of courage, and impotence of the
Government, no one knows whether or not
there will be training; and there is such confusion as there has never been before.
If money is not found for the annual training of the Militia this year, it means that
in one year the Militia will go back so
far that it will take five years of hard
work in the future to bring it to where
it is now. These units are for the most
part, indeed almost wholly, commanded
by men who served in the war; men who
are tired of war, war weary, and who would
have liked very well to have been relieved of
the responsibility of raising these units
and endeavouring to reorganize the Militia;
but they have been induced by officials of
the Government to take the work in hand,
and asked to give their time and money

160

SENATE

to the work. But they have been confronted
with the greatest possible difficulties; and
now, at this late date, within thirty days
of the annual training, when they hear the
discussion which has taken place, they
are left in doubt as te what is to happen in
the future. One thing only would seem
to be clear, and that is that the Government
do not appreciate their services; indeed,
that the Government does not require their
services. In another place there have been
discussions of the iMilitia which, in my
humble opinion, are not at all creditable to
the gentlemen who have taken part in them.
There is on the part of some people a
contempt for the Militia and for the men
who are giving their services. One member of the other House referred to the
officers of the Militia as parasites; another
gentlemen referred to the annual training
as "gold-lace parades." How long do you
think these men are going to continue to
give their services? How long do you
think the military spirit of this country
is going to stand up against this sort
of treatment, and what do you think is
going to be the future of voluntary militarv
service in Canada unless the Government iprepared to support that service in the
only way that it can-by adequate grants
of money.
Now, passing from that aspect of the
case-I will return te it again-I would

like te draw the attention of the House
to a few facts in connection with the
world situation. There are to-day in the
world three times as many men under
arms as there were in 1913. There are
fifty times as many men trained for war
to-day as there were in 1913. There are
situations in China, in India, in Germany,
in Russia, in Ireland, in France, South
Africa, and in scores of other countries
which arouse the greatest concern.
In
Europe three old empires have gone down,
and in their places have arisen eleven
states which are armed camps, and which
nourish grievances against each other and
causes for quarrels, any one of which might
be sufficient te embroil the whole world.
We hear a good deal of talk in these
days te the effect that the last war was
a war to end war, and a great many people
base their calculations for the future upon
that. Well, that statement was a piece
of propaganda designed to delude the
ignorant, and it appears te have done se.

revolution in South Africa, which flared
up apparently unnoticed, but which required
for its suppression all the resources of the
Government and the use of all the engines
of warfare. Against such forms of revolutionary activity as oppress the world today, there is only one answer, and that is
armed force.
We hear the argument that because Germany is done with and powerless there is
no need in these days for any armed force.
But that >is a false conclusion, drawn
from false premises. As a matter of fact
Germany is not powerless. You have
before you in the public press fairly definite information as te the existence of a
military treaty between Russia and Germany. Seven millions of trained men live
in Germany. German industry is the most
scientific, energetic and aggressive in the
world; and the Germans can turn out war
material in larger quantity and in a
shorter time than any other race in the
world. Sixty-five millions of people live
there-a homogeneous people occupying a
solid block of country, highly patriotic,
and intensely earnest in their determination that they shall net be made te suffer
the full effects of the great war. Every
few weeks one reads in the papers that
the Disarmament Committee of the Allies
constantly discovers great stores of arms
hidden in secret places throughout Germany, all of them bearing dates of manufacture subsequent te the Armistice.
Then, it must be remembered that we
never armed against Germany. Field
Marshall Wilson, speaking in the House
of Commons in England the other day,
said: "We did net arm a man, we did net
build a gun, nor did we move a wheelbarrow in anticipation of war with Germany." We armed previous te the great
war for a general situation, and that general situation is worse to-day than it was
in 1913. The very men who oppose preparation to-day are the men who protested te the country that they were quite
certain there never would be war with
Germany. All the preparation that was
then made was a preparation against the
general situation, and not a particular one.
We have the United States to the south
of us, occupying a position very much like
our own, with a peaceful neighbour on the
north and the great oceans on either sida.
They have twelve times the population that
we have. Making that allowance, and reducing the discussion te a pro rata basis,
it is interesting te observe what they are
doing in this matter. This year the United

A great weapon discovered in the war,
and used for the first time-a weapon
which saved thousands of lives, and which
was the answer to the machine-gun and
wire entanglements-was the tank. There
is not a single tank in Canada.
Another weapon which was used, and
which caused tremendous consternation
when first used-a devilish invention, one
of the most terrible things that a man
could confront-was gas. We have not in
Canada any preparation for the making of
gas; and, what is still worse, we have no
defence against gas.
There is not a gas
mask or box respirator to-day in the militia
department; and if we went into action
to-morrow we would be in precisely the
same position as we were in 1915 in that
respect.
We have an insufficiency of rifles. There
are barely enough rifles to arm the militia,
and there is a great shortage of equipment.
Our position to-day is worse, if that be
possible, than it was in 1914; and we dare
to occupy this position because in the back
of our heads we think that if we ever
got into serious trouble we might rely on
Great Britain to get us out. That was well
enough in 1914, though it never was highly
creditable to us, and was not a very honourable position for us to occupy; but,
though it might have done in 1914 it will
not do to-day. The reason is very plain.
As a result of the war, Great Britain is
tremendously in debt; the taxes are extremely heavy; there is a desire there to
retrench, as there is a desire here, and,
although the British army has not as yet
been reduced to the strength that it had in
1914, nevertheless it has been substantially
reduced. Notwithstanding that reduction,
the new commitments following the warthat is, new territories which require to

demands on the

army three times as great as they were in
1914. The consequence is that that army
is not as efficient and as ready for war as
it was in 1914, nor can it be assembled
and mobilized at is was then. The British
army is scattered over the whole world today, and cannot be called together as was
done in 1914. In that year four British
divisions were in France within a few days
of the declaration of war, and two divisions
followed shortly after. To-day the position,
as stated in the House of Commons in England, and not controverted, is that one
division could be sent to Europe in the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

event of war, another division might follow
in three weeks, and other divisions could
not be secured under several months. If
that is so-and it is-the theory that we
may continue to rely upon the support of
Great Britain to get us out of trouble no
longer holds good. The time bas come when
we should be prepared to paddle our own
canoe.
Defence is the first duty of the state.
John Stuart Mill, in his work on Political
Economy, lays down the general proposition
that defence is greater than opulence.
That I take to mean that there is no activity of the Government which transcends
in importance the duty and the obligation
of defence. Of what use is it to develop
a country, to accumulate wealth, to have
national aspirations, to demand equality
with other powers, and a place within the
Empire, unless we are prepared to back
up our pretentions, and unless we are ready
in the last analysis to put forth that force
which, when it comes down to the fine point,
is the only thing that sustains national
dignity?
I should like to glance for a few moments at the military history of this country.
Surprising as it may be to some
people, we in Canada have been going to
war once every fifteen years in our history. There are many men within sound
of my voice to-night who have recollections of many of those periods. Taking
them by their fifteen years intervals, we
have the great war, which for the purpose
of discussion we may call 1915. What was
our condition? 33,000 men were concentrated at Valcartier, to be moved across
the seas.
Every article of equipment
which was supplied to us was discredited before we got to the front.
The boots went, the clothing went, the
wagons went, the rifles went.
All the
equipment that we had was finally ditched,
because it was no good; and the first Canadian fighting soldiers did not get to the
theatre of war until six months after war
was declared, and we asked the little
British army that existed in those days to
make a rampart of their dead bodies, behind which the unprepared Canadian army
might take six months of precious time to
equip and train themselves for the struggle.
That was our record in 1915.
In 1900 we had the South African war,
which was a rather small affair, and there
was the same confusion. I remember well
our boiling white helmets in coffee to turn
them khaki colour. The troops were supplied with clothing which the rain came

MAY 9, 1922
through and the wind blew through, and
which turned white after a few weeks of
wear, and we were not completely equipped
until finally the material came to us in
South Africa from England.
In 1885 we had a similar experience
when the Militia were called out. There
was great enthusiasm. The rebellion never
would have taken place at all if sufficient
money had been spent before that time to increase the Mounted Police from 300 to 1,000
men. But there was a rebellion, and the
Militia were called out. They turned out
with what they could get. The Canadian
Pacific Railway in many parts was not completed, and the troops had to march over
those broken intervals, and the rugged
shores of Lake Superior showed a stream
of blood from the bleeding feet of Canadian volunteers who marched over those
broken strips of country in tennis shoes,
dancing pumps and all sorts of ill-fitting
boots, for lack of suitable preparation.
In 1870 we had the Red River expedition.
It took many months to get a small force
into Manitoba.
In 1866 we had the Fenian Raid, and
again the militia turned out without water
bottles, without haversacks, without greatcoats; and they ran out of ammunition in
the middle of a battle, and finally they
fled for their lives, because they were not
sufficiently equipped. The losses in casualties and the expense of that trouble would
never have been incurred-the trouble
would have never taken place-if there had
been any reasonable or adequate preparation.

163

What is true of all those events was true
also in 1837 and in 1812. Lack of preparation resulted in lack of equipment and
the Canadian soldiers were sacrificed to
this god of economy.
In all these campaigns, all these undertakings, two factors are present: firstly,
surprise; secondly, unreadiness. There is
a third factor to which also I should refer,
and it is this. There have been all through
our history men who have preached some
degree of readiness, and there have been a
very much larger number of men who poohpoohed the idea of readiness; and it is
singular to observe that the men who in
days gone by have pleaded for readiness
are the men who go to war, and those who
reject the idea are the men who stay at
home. If we are to be a nation and to give
ourselves the airs of a nation, this sort of
thing cannot go on. We are now miles
below the safety line. I have here some
figures which may interest the House, 'showing the expenditures of seventeen civilized
countries for army, navy and air forces.
These figures have been before the country
already, but they are so important and so
impressive that I desire to give them again.
Their importance lies in the fact that of
the per capita expenditure of all the civilized countries to-day for army, navy and
air forces, that of Canada is the lowest.
I would like to have this document printed
with your unanimous consent, or I will read
it if the committee thinks I ought to do so.

the Government are taking this step for
the purpose of bringing about some economy.
I think that everybody will agree
that, in view of our revenues and expenditures, if any economy can be accomplished
by putting the three departments under one
head, it is a good thing to do.
I do not agree with the criticism that
has been made on this BilIl to-night to the
effect that it cannot be definitely shown
how the economy is to be ibrought about.
Perhaps it might have been shown to a
greater extent.
I heard some of the discussion in the other branch of parliament,
and it seemed to me that a pretty fair
case was made out.
But we can afford,
I think, to give the Government a year to
see what they will do in the way of bringing about economies, and we shall be in a
better position to judge next year.
My honourable friend who has just taken
his seat has made a very elaborate and
very able speech, but all on the lin.e of
war and preparedness for war.
I think
my honourable friend will find that that
sort of thing does not go very well with
the people of Canada, and I would like him
or any one else to point out a single case
wherein ,preparedness or the spending of

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? He has

that by asking him to give me the name
of any nation which has avoided war by
failure to prepare.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I can point to the
United States as a good example. We
have had a hundred years of peace along
the border line between Canada and the
United States. Have the United States
ever suffered because of not being more
prepared for war than they were?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The United
States have been at war seven times in
that period.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend may say that, and he may tell us
that we in Canada were several times at
war. And did we not always come out
ahead? Could we have done more wonderfully if we had been prepared-prepared
along the lines that my honourable friend
indicates? I claim, honourable gentlemen,
that the country that conserves its resources is better prepared for war when
the time comes than is the country that
wastes its resources by the hundreds and
thousands of millions for many, many
years in time of peace; and I claim, again,
that preparing by spending vast sums of
money does not necessarily put any country in a good position and does not keep
it out of war.
How are we going to get the money today for carrying on the warlike preparations that have been advised here to-night?
Are any of us willing to have direct income tax imposed upon us to have them
carried on? I think not. I think very few
people would support preparedness for war
under these aircumstances. And what if
war comes? It is not so very likely to come
at the present time. L think there never
was a time when the nations were getting
together so much as they are at present.
It is true that .some outlying countries are
at present engaged in warfare. We have
had the threatenings of war close to home

MAY 9, 1922
-in Ireland. There is war in China at
the present time, but I do not think that
is going to affect us very much. I believe
that the policy followed by Britain in
the past, of conserving her resources, Las
been a good policy and Las done more to
bring Great Britain and her Allies out
ahead in the recent great war than has
any other policy that could have been
adopted.
Therefore I think, honourable gentlemen,
that the Bill before the House is a step
in the right direction, and I hope that the
day is far distant when we shall find
Canada adopting the warlike ideas of many
of the nations of Europe. I do not for
one moment agree with what my honourable friend has said of the manner in
which the soldiers of Canada have been
treated, or neglected. I notice this, that
since the war has closed, scores and scores
of men who were in the war have been
kept on when, there was no particular need
for them, and they have been given promotion after promotion right along, so that
they might be retired with a good, large
pension. Is that bad treatment of them?
I observe that a couple of officers have
been retired just lately. One is to receive
a year and a half of full pay and then a
retiring allowance amounting to either
$5,900 or $6,900 and some odd dollars. I do
not remember which figure is right. Another has been retired with a pension of
over $4,000 a year. Is that bad treatment
for any man? It seems to me it is pretty
good treatment.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Most of the
money that he draws as a result of long and
faithful service has been taken out of his
own pay. Five per cent of his pay has
been deducted and applied towards the
pension fund. So the Government Las
augmented in a very small degree the
allowance on which he retires.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: All I can say to that
is that he must have been drawing a mighty
handsome salary all along when five per
cent of it gives him a retiring allowance
of $5,000 or $6,000. So I do not think there
is any great ground of complaint in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman, I am sure, does not intend to
misrepresent me.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not think
any other honourable gentleman in this
House understood me to refer to the officers

16b

in the class to which my honourable friend
speaks. I referred not to what is behind
us, but to what is in front of us. I referred
to the officers of the Militia who are organizing units and carrying on to-day. I did
not speak about officers who had retired
after thirty-five or forty years' service.
I was talking about the Militia. The honourable gentleman appears to know so
little about the subject as not to know the
difference.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend is probably quite right when he
says I do not know as much about military
service as he does. I do not dispute that at
all: but I say this, that I know a good
deal more about the views of the people of
the Dominion of Canada regarding military
service than my honourable friend does-a
good deal more. I remember the proposition that my honourable friend made a
year or two ago, that every man in Canada
should be trained as a military man. Well,
that is all right in some countries. Some
people like that sort of thing. But I can
tell the honourable gentleman that the
people of Canada are not going in for that
sort of thing; and to my mind it would
not be a source of strength for us to spend,
as my honourable friend apparently sug-

gests we should, $100,000,000 a year in

keeping up Canada's military force. What
would be the result of that expenditure?
It would be that year after year we should
be piling another $100,000,000 on our debt,
in addition to what we are adding without
this expenditure. We are now going behind-or we have been of late years, since
the close of the war-$100,000,000 a year.
Does my honourable friend, or any other
honourable gentleman in this House, want
to go behind to the extent of $200,000,000
or $300,000,000 a year in order to keep up
a military force?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I would like to ask
my honourable friend how much this country
would have gone behind if the Canadian
soldiers who went across had not added
their assistance to the British forces and
the Allies to defeat the Germans. Suppose
the Germans had won the war, how much
would this country have gone behind?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend Las exactly proved my argument, and
I thank my honourable friend for doing so.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am glad to hear
it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: We sent our half
million men across, and we did not send

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, some of them

and they will volunteer again; and many

the cities of Canada and arrived in the
trenches a few months afterwards turned

After they were

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will my honourable friend not agree, however, that
there are thousands of Canadian boys pushing up the daisies to-day who would in all
probability not have been in that position
if greater preparedness had been practised
and proper equipment had been supplied to
them?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: If the Ross rifle
had been a good rifle, or if it had not been
used, there might have been soie difference; but I do not believe, honourable
gentlemen, that preparedness would have
kept us out of war, or would have done anything for us in that war. We did our duty
and accomplished our purpose just as well,
and better, by the course that had been
taken in Canada for many years previously.
The British army was nearly all a volunteer
army, and it did good work. So it does not
seem to me that we are going to better
ourselves in any way by following out the
course that has been advised by the bonourable Senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach).
In my judgment that would
not put us in as good a position as we shall
be in if we adopt this measure and bring
about some sort of economy in expenditure
in those three forces.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Does my honourable friend believe in educational efficiency?
Does he think that our boys over there
would not have been a lot better if they
had been trained before they went and
jumped into the conflict?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I can answer that
question by saying that they went up
against the trained men of Germany and
Austria and the other Allied enemies, and
proved better men than the ones who had
been trained for five or ten or fifteen
years.
Hon.

Mr.

TURRIFF.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: That is not my
question.
Do you not think that if they
had been properly trained they could have
done better?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I think they were
properly and well trained before they went
into the trenches. It is not necessary to
drill a man for five years to make a soldier of him. They were trained for a few
monthsHon. Mr. MURPHY: That is what they
call intensive training. Many of our boys
died as a result of it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do not think we
can do better than follow the example of
Great Britain.
Great Britain has very
largely reduced her navy, which is the
chief arm of her defence. If it is good
policy for Great Britain to reduce her defence force surely it is good policy for us,
for she has more to fear fron enemies than
we have. Whom are we to fear? Are we
likely to get into war with the United
States? I do not know of any other nation
with which we would be likely to have
trouble.
In my judgment, it is not necessary to
keep up a large standing army. My bonourable friend (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) says
that we have the lowest military expenditure in the world. I am very glad to think
that we have; I am very glad to think that
Canada bas more sense in that respect
than the other nations. If our neighbours
to the South are spending so much more
than we are, perhaps they are better able
to afford it. To my mind it would be very
foolish for Canada to undertake great military expenditures; and I think the idea of
the Government cutting tlown expenses in
some of these lines is a mighty good one,
and it is going to have my solid support.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2, 3 and 4 were agreed to.

On subsection 4 of section 5-Comptroller:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I wish to
move an amendment to paragraph 4, so
that it will read:
The Governor in Council on the recommendation of the minister may appoint an officer to
be known as Comptroller, with the rank of
Deputy Minister if deemed expedient.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
is the distinction?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen know that in the amalgamation

MAY 9, 1922
of these two departments there will be practically two staffs to consolidate. The suggestion of the Minister of Militia that a
Comptroller be appointed to take charge of
all financial matters was highly commended
by his predecessors in office who discussed
this Bill in the other House. He asked
authority to give the rank of deputy minister to the person so appointed. It may be
that someone who already has that rank
will be appointed, and under this provision
he will retain his title and all that goes
with it.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Why not add
somewhere in the Act that the retiring
Deputy shall be "as you were," because
it is apparently intended that the now retiring deputy will be advanced to deputy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The appointment of a Comptroller seems to have been

posed that the person charged with handling
the finances of the Department shall be
styled "Comptroller," and shall also have
the rank of Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it is deemed
expedient.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is no question
about its being deemed expedient. The appointment will be made, and the gentleman
who gets the appointment will receive the
rank of deputy minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say
that if the Comptroller has not that title
already, he wiil not get it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
appointment of a comptroller is necessary
to deal with an expenditure of approximately $15,000,000, assuming that the three
services are combined, why should there
not be a comptroller for each of the large
spending departments? The Public Works
Department bas to deal with very much
more important subjects financially than
the Militia Department, and the same state-

Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
are reducing very substantially in this Department.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend has had the benefit of an experience that I have not had. The Minister of

it, for such an appointment, and the late

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
time.

That was in war

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Here is a Department which is being consolidated, and
which will be formed of three branches.
Can you refuse to accept the statement of
the Minister of Militia that he needs that
cfficial-a statement which received the
corroboration of his predecessor? My recollection is that the late Minister of Militia, who left office on the lst of January,
the honourable gentleman from Wellington, was also present, and did not demur to
this section, which was rpassed unanimously. I leave this consideration to my
honourable friend:
Personally I cannot
g.ive him any better evidence of the necessity than I am furnishing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I intimated to my honourable friend in the
earlier part of the discussion, and I venture to say now with a degree of certainty,
that there must have been some outline
prepared before this consolidation was
determined upon; and it seems to me that
we should have some information in regard to the merging of these three different services. I would point out to my
honourable friend that the Navel Service
nas been taken out of the Department
of
Marine and Fisheries, one of the large
spending departments, which heretofore
administered both branches without a
comptroller of its financial affairs.
The
Department of Public Works, the Department of Railways, and the Department of
Interior, probably all spend more than the
Militia Department.
We are adding deputy ministers to deputy ministers, and I
venture to say that we have in Canada
at the present time probably twice as many
deputy ministers as departments.
The
tieory has always prevailed that there
should be a deputy at the head of each
department. We have in each department
to-day a deputy minister, and assistant
deputy minister, and various other officers,
all of whom have the status and salaries
of deputy ministers, although they are not
generally known as deputy ministers. If
xve are entering upon a programme of
economy-and I cannot commend that too
highly, and am prepared to support it in
every way-I think we should have some
information to satisfy us that economy
will be effected by thi's provision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend takes the responsibility of saying that there is no need for the appointment of such an official as is described, and
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

if there is a majority in this Chanber who
share his opinion, that settles the matter;
but, if my honourable friend is not ready
to do that, in view of what has been said
in another place by the gentlemen I have
mentioned, I ask what objection there is
to allowing the Comptroller, if he happens
to be taken from amongst the deputy heads
who wilil be freed under this Act, to retain
his status? Surely my honourable friend
would not refuse that satisfaction to one
who has had that title?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Thera
is nothing to assure us in that regard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the official
is a man who should be appointed, surely
it costs nothing to let him retain a title
which he already has:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend prepared to give us the
assurance that say the Deputy of the Naval
Service is to be the Comptroller? And if
that is the case, is my honourable friend
prepared to-night to state the qualifications
of that gentleman as to financial matters?
If there be a deputy without duty, and it
is proposed to provide for him, I should
like to know his financial qualifications
before supporting a clause of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have no
authority to inform my honourable frienj
that the Deputy Minister of the Naval
Service will be chosen as Comptroller.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
other deputy is there?

What

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If he should
be chosen for the position, I know of no
man better qualified in every respect. I
have known that gentleman since my school
days, and his record in the public service
is one of unvarying devotion to
duty,
fidelity, and efficiency.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then,
why discharge him? Why not leave him?
Hon. Mr.
DANDURAND:
As my
honourable friend knows, there is this
consolidation, and it is not intended to
have two Deputy Heads at the head of this
Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
it in other Departments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We may have,
but my honourable friend will realise that
if we want to secure unity in this Department it should be administered by one head.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: We
loggerheads, and I would ask the leader
of the House to allow this clause to stand.
By to-morrow, we shall have time to think
it over, and perhaps by that time we shall
be in a better position to come to a conclusion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill has
been before us for the last three or four
weeks, and it is important to the consolidation that the Bill should move forward.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Is twenty-four
hours going to make much difference?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I hope
my honourable friend will see his way
clear to withdraw the amendment, or to
hold it until the third reading, so that we
may give it further consideration. But if
my honourable friend proposes te put the
amendment now, he will at once be going
outside of the principle of the Bill in
appointing a second Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, my honourable friend is in error. If a comptroller is to be appointed he will be appointed. The fact that the party who will
be appointed may have or retain the title
of Deputy Minister will not increase the
expense.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Taking the whole
section, it provides really for three deputy
ministers. As the law is now administered there are but two, a Deputy Minister
of Militia and a Deputy Minister of Naval
Affairs, with the rank of deputies and with
the salary of deputies. As I read this, it
provides generally for a Deputy Minister
of National Defence. In addition to that,
it provides for the appointment of another
officer who may be given the rank of deputy minister. There being no question
at all that that officer will get the rank and
will be paid the salary of deputy minister,
this amendment practically means that to
administer the affairs of this department
there will to all intents and purposes be
three deputies instead of two, with the
salaries of three deputy ministers.
I should
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
have explained to the Senate subsection
3 of section 5:
The Governor In Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, may appoint an
officer who shall, in relation to the Naval service, administer, exercise and perform all the
powers, duties and functions vested in or exercisable by the Deputy Minister of the Naval
Service by or under The Naval Service Act,

9, 1922

.

and who shall have the rank and salary of a
Deputy Head of a Department, and shall be a
member of the Defence Council.

I may say that the present head of the
Naval service is the one who is covered by
this subsection 3, but that appointment
will be but a provisional one for the time
necessary to merge those two departments.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
do you find that it is provisional? Where
do you make provision that it is only provisional?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is not in
the Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point this out further. My honourable
friend says that the term "Comptroller"
and the status of a Deputy Minister are
practically convertible terms. But if the
Comptroller has the status of a Deputy
Minister he will get the salary of a
Deputy Minister, even though he be only
a $3,000 or $4,000 man. I do not see why
we should fix the salary of a Comptroller
at this point at $6,000 a year, with all the
advantages of a Deputy Minister. Furthermore, the question is one which, to
my mind, should have been introduced in
the Commons, and originate there. It
means that by this amendment we propose
to fix the salary of this, Controller at
$6,000, which the Senate clearly' cannot do
or should not do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not accept the interpretation which my honourable friend gives to this amendment. The
fact that that comptroller may have the
rank of a Deputy Minister, if deemed expedient, does not give him the salary of a
deputy minister.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh,
yes, it does. My recollection of the Civil
Service Act is that there is an arbitrary
provision that all deputy ministers are
entitled to a salary of $6,000, and I might
say to my honourable friend that that is
the inducement which leads so many
worthy officials in the Government to seek
and to be given that status. It is not for
the empty honour of their being termed
deputy minister; it is rather for the very
substantial advantage of receiving $6,000
a year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say
that the description which the Minister of
Militia gave of the duties of the Comptroller
of Defence, the authority which would be
granted to him, and the magnitude of his

170

SENATE

work, would quite justify to my mind a
salary of $6,000, because I know of similar
positions outside the Service which are at
least as well remunerated; but, since my
honourable friend sees difficulty in adopting this clause at this time, and as it
is an amendment of which I should have
given notice, I will ask that this clause
be suspended, and that we proceed to the
other clauses.
Subsection 4 stands.
On subsection 5-holder of any position
abolished may be appointed to another position:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Would the honourable leader of the Government kindly explain the purport of this subsection?
(5) Any person whose position is abolished
on the coming into force of this Act may on the
recommendation of the Minister be appointed
by the Governor in Council to such position in
the department and wiýth such rank, title and
salary as shall be prescribed.

It appears to me, offhand, that this subsection is in direct opposition to the provisions of the Civil Service Act. In the
case of any other Department, where an
official is retired or transferred, the Civil
Service Commission acts, and makes the
appointment. If this clause is adopted it
seems to me it would be simply riding a
horse and carriage clean through the Civil
Service Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My recollection is very clear that it is made for the
purpose of transferring officials whose positions will be abolished by the amalgamation
of these Departments.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But you
cannot give them any higher position.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it so.

I do not see

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is,
you do not keep them on the same plane
that they occupy at present.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I read the section, it means that on the coming into
force of this Act any position in either of
those Departments, the Naval or Militia
Department, may be immediately abolished,
and just as soon as that position is abolished
the Governor in Council is given full
authority to take the official and give him
any rank, title and salary it pleases in that
Department.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
ment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

In any depart-

Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, in that Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No question of that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The principle embodied in this section seems to me to be
absolutely contrary to the Civil Service Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My recollection of the information which was given
to me was that this clause was necessary
to safeguard the positions of the officials
who must be retained and placed in the
aggregated Department.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: But we will look
after that; they need not be afraid of us.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
come under the Civil Service Act. May I
ask my honourable friend why the officials
of these departments should be placed in
any different position from those of any
other department? Such changes as these
are going on continually. This change is
not something unique or novel. Every day
transfers are taking place, or positions are
being abolished.
Why should this particular favour be applied to the officials of
this Department, whereas equal advantages are not given to those in other departments?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to me quite plausible-

Well, it seems

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, it
is plausible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -quite plausible and understandable that, two departments being merged, the officials of one
department to be retained in the aggregation should not have to run the gauntlet of
examinations under the Civil Service Commission when they are already 'n the
Service.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does
not touch that at all; but this unlimited
discretionHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I might say
that I should have had the advantage of the
presence and information of the Deputy
Minister of Militia if he had not been
retained this evening in the other Chamber,
where the various Estimates are being considered. So I will ask that the Committee
rise and report progress.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
just as curious as the other House to have
information on that subject.

MAY 9, 1922
Before that
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
is done, may I point out to my honourable
friend that in the reorganization of some
other departments of the Government in
recent years-I have in mind, for example,
the Printing Bureau-there was a very
substantial reorganization, the abolition of
many old positions, and the creation of
new ones. The Civil Service Commission,
on the recommendation of the experts employed by that Department, reported what
official positions in the Bureau were necessary, and the Civil Service Commission
selected those officers, and not the Secretary
of State, who was then the Minister in
charge of the Printing Bureau. The question naturally occurs to one, why there
should be any discrimination as between
departments when a reorganization takes
place?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Before the Committee rises, I would like also to call my
honourable friend's attention to the next
section, because I propose to raise a point
in connection with it; that is, as to the
necessity of including in the last clause:
he had been retired under the provisions
-if
of any act a4pplicable to him, after adding from
one to two years, as the Governor in Council
may deem advisable, to his actual rterm of
service.

In

effect that means this, that in the

case of amalgamation of the departments,
if it is found necessary to retire any Civil
Servant, the Governor in Council asks
power to add one or two years to his service in order to fix his gratuity or retiring
allowance. I would like to know why there
should be any'differentiation between this
Department and any other Department in
the Service. It seems to me the Government is only laying up trouble for itself if
it carries that provision through. Why
should officers in the Militia or the Naval
Service of the Department, who have retired
from the Service, be treated in any other
way than any other servant in a department? There should be a very good explanation given of that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would commend to the honourable gentleman from
Edmonton this desire of the Government to
treat more paternally the officials of the
Militia Department than those of any
other Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
this is the Naval Department.
Subsection 5 stands.

ST. LAWRENCE SHIP CANAL
DISCUSSION AND INQUIRY

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the St. Lawrence River Ship Canal.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have no desire
whatever to prevent my honourable friend
from making his speech. I would like very
much to hear him; but, for the sake of

SENATE
other honourable members, who are sometimes stopped under the rules of order, I
would like to ascertain, for my own information, whether or not the honourable
gentleman can proceed on the notice as it
appears in the Order Paper. When ho
introduced it in the House it was made
under the head of inquiries. I think it is
now under the head of motions; but, as
honourable members will observe if they
read it, it does not contain any of the elements of a motion.
So far as my experience in the House
has gone, I understand that there are two
ways of bringing a question before the
Senate. One is by proposing a motion in
order to obtain the judgment of this House
upon it; the other is by asking a question
in order to ascertain the views of the Government of the day. This is a very important question, and I have no doubt honourable members are desirous, as J am, to
hear my honourable friend. It is so important a question that I presume the Government of the day has views and, no
doubt, has a policy in regard to it. If I
read the rules of the House correctly, I
should expect my honourable friend either
to ask the judgment of the House on this
question or to ask for the views and the
policy of the Government. The honourable
gentleman might learn the judgment of the
House by making a motion, which would
be regularly put before the Senate; or, under a special rule of the Senate, as I understand it, he could give notice that he intends to call attention te the matter and
to ask questions of the Government regarding it.
My principal reason, as I have said, is
not to stop my honourable friend, but to
ascertain whether or not, if it is open to
my honourable friend to proceed in this
form, it would be open to any other honourable member of this House to proceed in a
similar manner. For instance, some honourable member may desire to discuss the
Wheat Board. He may say: "I give notice
that I will call attention to the question
of the Wheat Board." Or he may desire
to discuss the question of redistribution,
and simply say: "I give notice that J will
discuss the question of redistribution." Or
he might want to know whether the headquarters of the Canadian National Railways are to be at Montreal or at Toronto,
and might give notice that he would discuss that question, without asking for the
opinion of this House, or for the views or
policy of the Government.
Knowing, as
we all do, that this Government bas no
Hon,

Mr. TANNER.

difficulty whatever in formulating its policies and in adhering to them, and bas no
unwillingness wfhatever to state what its
policy is upon any important publie question, I would presume that my honourable
friend bas no desire to embarrass the Government.
Therefore I would suggest to
him that he amend his motion, if I am
right in my understanding of the rules.
If I am not, I shall be pleased to know,
and in that event any other honourable
member may be free to proceed as my
honourable friend intends doing, on a notice
of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman state the article of our
rules which would be violated by this procedure?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The rule that, as
I understand it, deals with notices of inquiries, is:
When it is intended to make a statement or
raise a discussion on asking a question, the
Senator having such intention, as part of the
notice under rule 21, gives notice that he wi'l
call attention to the matter inquired into.

My honourable friend does not say in
this notice that ho intends to inquire of
the Government; ho simply says that he is
going to call attention to the St. Lawrence River Ship Canal. He has used
part of this rule, but bas not complied
with it fully. It is rule 40.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If no other
honourable gentleman wants to discuss this
question, I may say that in my opinion
the point raised by the honourable Senator
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) is correct.
I think that, under our rules 40 and 21, if
an honourable member wishes to raise a
question, stating that he will call the attention of the Senate to the matter and
will inquire, it should be done under the
head of inquiries. The present question
comes up under motions. Of course, the
honourable Senator for De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) may put himself
right before the Senate under rule 28,
which says:
Any Senator who has made a motion nay
withdraw or inocify the sane by leave of the
Senate.

If the Senate chooses to give leave to
the honourable member to modify the
motion, he may do so now.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, I should like, with the leave
of the Senate, to amend the motion. I will
ask the Government for the production of
papers, and that will cover the point.

MAY 10, 1922

Honourable gentlemen, it is only after
a great deal of study and thought that I
rise to discuss this question. The honourable gentleman who has just taken his
seat (Hon. Mr. Tanner) might know that
when for three or four weeks, outside of
business hours, one has done nothing but
cram oneself with information, he is in the
condition of a steai boiler which has been
overheated. An explosion will take place
if I am not allowed to let off some steam
immediately.
I may also claim, honourable gentlemen, that there is a certain degree of
urgency about this matter. You know
that a discussion upon it is going on in
another place. You know also that in
both Houses of Congress in Washington
this question bas been very much agitated.
Even the President of the United States
has written a famous letter with regard
to this matter within the last few days.
It is therefore about time that this Senate,
an independent body, should take it up.
I may say right here and now that,
although I am asking for papers, the
papers that may be brought down will
not change my opinion about this question.
I have a perfectly open mind with regard
to this most important project. As to the
opinion of the Government, I know what
opinions of Governments are, I have been
so long in this House, and much as I might
value them, especially at the. present
moment, I think you will agree that I can
live on very nicely without them, and can
also hold my own.
The question before us is certainly the
most important and involves the largest
amount of money of any question that ever
came before the Parliament of Canada.
Two Canadian Pacific railways or two
Panama canals would not compare with
it as to the amount of money required,
and, if honourable members will lend me
an attentive ear for a few moments, I
think I can prove that statement to their
Therefore it behooves this
satisfaction.
Senate at the earliest possible moment to
take notice of this question and to study
it. Remember, honourable gentlemen, that
this project bas been approved by an international joint commission, which bas
dealt with the improvement of the St. Lawrence river between Montreal and lake
Ontario for navigation purposes. That
international commission was not appointed by us, but we suggested the names
of Canada's representatives and the Imperial government appointed our nominees.
This proposal bas been unanimously ap-

proved by our commissioners, together with
the three commissioners representing the
United States of America, and I do not
know-I leave it to the honourable gentleman from Montreal or the honourable gentleman from Hamilton to say--how far
Canada may have been committed by the
unanimous approval given in the report
which has been issued. I do not know
whether many of my honourable colleagues have read this book or not. It is very
dry reading, and, I may say in all humility, it requires a little technical knowledge
to be able to master all the subjects. During the last three or four weeks, outside
of business hours, I have devoted my entire time to this question, and I thought
I might be of some use to some of my
colleagues, who have so very many other
things to interest them, if I were to give
a brief and impartial summary, and that
is all I desire to do at the present moment.
Let me say here and now that I have an

prior te the elections of 1911, but the Imperial Government had taken no action.
As you all know, there was a change of
government in 1911, and when that change

I am informed, to the Home Government:

government, were likewise changed.
The
two Canadian members who are now on
that commission and have been there from
the start,<are Mr. Magrath and Mr. Powell.
The other Canadian member is Sir William
H. Hearst, who *has replaced the Hon. T.
Chase Casgrain, who resigned the chairmanship to become a member of the Borden
Government and was Postmaster General
in that Administration until his death.
The unanimous recommendation of the
International Joint Commission is that there
be a channel twenty-five feet in depth from
Montreal to Lake Ontario.
That seems
to be a small affair-a matter of some 182
miles from Montre.al to Lake Ontario. Not
much else is dealt with in this report. That
portion, 182 miles, is only one-edghth of
the total distance from Montreal to Duluth.
Before proceeding to deal with this
question, may I 'be permitted, as this is
the first time since the opening of the
Session that I have had the honour to address this House, to call 'attention to the
galaxy of very able men, ex-cabinet ministers who have joined our ranks, adding
distinction to this House. Looking around
this Senate, I observe, as an old member,
that there are to-day only eight or nine
members of the Senate who were here in
1900, when I had the honour of entering
this House.
Among the newcomers from
another place the first whon I, as one of
the oldest members, would like to mention
and welcome to thi.s House is the right
honourable the ex-Minister of Trade and
Commerce (Right Hon. Sir George Foster).
a man who is a distinct addition to this
Chamber.
For more than thirty years,
in another place, his power of intellect and
almost unrivalled eloquence as a debater,
made the halls of the Canadian Parliament
famous.
Sometimes he was caustic; sometimes, when he was younger, he was aggressive; but now he has mellowed with old
age and has broadened out from his experience in travelling abroad, for he has
been a sort of ambassador of the Canadian
people since 1911 and has visiýted all parts
of the world.
He has been to Australia.
He was at Geneva.
He has even learned
to speak French, for he found that, after
all, when there is a diplomatic part to play,
it is very necessary te know French-and
you would be surprised at how much he
does know of it.
And he brought from
Geneva something stil more 'precious to him
than all the international experience he
gained there.
The next gentleman to whom I would
allude is the former Minister of Railways
Hon.

Mr.

CASGRAIN.

(Hon. Dr. Reid). He is an old friend, a
dear friend of mine. He also for thirty
years was in the House of Commons. I
remember very well that some twenty
years ago he joined with me in preventing
some of my own friends from doing away
with the bonds of some English interests
that I represented in Canada. Through
his valuable help I was able to protect
those interests, and they were considerable,
amounting to more than a couple of millions of dollars. I enlisted the help of the
honourable gentleman for the protection
of those interests, because I considered that
if we did not look after foreign investments
in this country and protect bondholders or
mortgage holders the credit of the country
might suffer.
Next is the honourable gentleman who
was for a long time the Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, the honourable member for Toronto (Hon. Sir Edward Kemp). Then I come to one who
was our friend for many years, and I
wish he were our friend again to-day. * He
was Minister of Colonization, I believe.
in a former Administration. Be that as
it may, he is a very able man and a great
addition to the Senate. It is a great pleasure for me to welcome also the other
honourable members who have recently
been appointed to the Senate. I must add
that these honourable gentlemen might
have remained in another place if they
had chosen to do so, but they preferred
the serene atmosphere and safe haven of
the Senate. I admit that I feel a little
overawed at the influx of such a galaxy of
able statesmen.
However, I must make
bold and get accustomed to it.
Now, the great difficulty on this question is to select from the mass of information on the subject. Honourable gentlemen can see this report, with plans, specifications, detail work of which it would be
impossible in the short time allotted to me
to give more than a very brief account.
Therefore, for the benefit of everybody, I
will avoid all details, all technical terms,
and all figures.
May I be allowed, for the first time in
twenty years or more, to make one personal
reference, even at the expense perhaps of
appearing a little bit egotistical; but I
think it is necessary for me to do so to convince my colleagues who do me the honour
of listening to me at this time-to state
that I have been familiar for a great many
years with the St. Lawrence route and the
great lakes. In 1874 I, like many other

MAY 10, 1922
students, was pufling a c'hain on the Canadian Pacific railway survey. In 1875 1
was on the construction of that railway
f rom Fort William. That is forty-eight
years ago, and honourable gentlemen know
that when a person is young the impres-.
sions are much stronger tihan at any other
time. I bave always taken a deep interesf.
in the St. Lawrence route ever since, and
also in the immense potentialities of those
great lakes, those inland seas. For Vwenty
years I have also, been connected with a
navigation company which during these
many years has turned out to be the greatest infland navigation company in the world.
If it bas a good second anywhere in the
world I would like to be informed.
This subject is so vast that I divide ît
into three parts, and at present I will
treat of only one part-navigation. As to
the development of power, I do not intend
to touch that subject, to-day at any rate.
Then, third, there is the legal and international problem, and I think I can very
well leave that question in the hands of
my honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), who can deal with
that, because it would be vain for a laymen and a land surveyor to talk about
international law, let alone the common law.
But there would be materidl for a speech,
and a long one, on each of those subjects;
therefore we will talk on navigation only.
What -is the aim, the object, of the proponents of this scheme? Notbing else, as
openly stated, at any rate, than that oceangoing vessels may go up to the Great Lakes
and corne back therefrom Vo, the ocean without breaking bulk. That is the kernel of
the question. Those people seem. Vo think
that breaking bulk in the carrnage of grain
would be the principal thing, and would be
an awful thîng. I think I can demonstrate that ýit will not; and, if it is not so,
and if the rates can be proven to be
cheaper than could be accomplished even
without breaking bulk, then why would we
be any better off?
Honourableý gentlemen have noticed that
there has been a great deal of enljhusiasm
for this project during the past two years,
particularly in the middle and northwestern
States-in those States in which are located
the very sources of the Mississippi-and
eloquent speeches have been made visualizing before the people the fact that the
flags of ail the nations of the world would
be flying on the ships that would be gracefully riding in the roadstead of every bay
and every harbour on the Great Lakes.

That is a captivating picture-that Chicago
should become an ocean port, that Detroit

sleeping just now, was far from sleeping
that night in Montreal, and none of us
threw cold water on their project. For
myseif, 1 considered tihe project so chimerical that there was no object in spoiling their pfleasure.
In Canada we are more calm on this
subject; we have been accustomed to that
story for some fifty, nay sixty, years-of
,the flags of ocean ships flying on the Great
Lakes. That was ail gone through in connection with the old Georgian Btay canal.
I niyself made speeches on that project in
this House, and 1 was absolutely sincere at
the tirne.
The Maritime Provinces appear to be
qulte unconcerned about this project, believing the seheme chimerical, because they
know too much about navigation, and they
do not care about it at ahl.
Quebec thinks the project is visionary in
many ways and at any rate inopportune.
British Columbia, very much like the.
Maritime Provinces, is quite unconcerned.
The people there* are on the seaboard and
they know what ocean ships are, and they
know they are not inade for beating against
both sides of a canal or getting into trouble
in sballow waters, and that insurance rates
are prohibitive. They know ail that.
The prairie provinces have got their
own pet scheme, and that is one thing for
which I thank the Hudson Bay railway
project. They think grain should go by
the Hudson Bay, and ail the money we
have spent on tihat scheme will have been
well spent if iV keeps us from spending
$1,300,000,000 on the present scheme.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is not wasted-

L'ib

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, it is well
spent. There remains the Province of Ontario-and when I say Ontario it is only
the southern portion thereof, called old
Ontario, because the northern portion of
Ontario has had for fifty years its pet
scheme also, which is the Georgian Bay
canal, of which honourable gentlemen have
heard in another place; therefore it has no
use for this project. But even the southern
part of Ontario is not very much excited
over this matter, as compared with what
has taken place in the Western States, but
I believe the southern part of Ontario is
favourable to the scheme.
In Canada generally the enthusiasm is
net very great, nothing like what it is in the
United States. As far as the Georgian
Bay canal is concerned, I remember very
well the honourable gentleman from Mille
Iles (Hon. Mr. David) coming to me and
saying, "Sir Wilfrid Laurier would like the
Georgian Bay canal to be expounded in this
House," and I gave a lot of thought to it.
The honourable Senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) was strongly in faveur of it,
and perhaps he is still, and he made very
able speeches on the Georgian Bay canal.
Honourable gentlemen, if they consult Hansard, will find that the speeches on the
Georgian Bay canal in this House occupied
about as many columns as ýany other
subject. There was only one dissenting
voice; that was the voice of another bonourable gentleman from Ottawa, the late
W. C. Edwards. He got up and in his
practical way explained to the House that
it would take longer for a large boat to go
up French river, through lake Nipissing,
Turtle Lake, Trout Lake, Talon Lake,
down the Mattawan River, down the Ottawa
River, and back into Montreal, and rise
some 160 feet from Georgian Bay to Lake
Nipissing, and then come down, than by
going around the other way. That threw
a great deal of cold water on the scheme,
and the discussion ended there and then,
because honourable gentlemen know as well
as I do that time is an indispensable factor
in the operation of boats. If you want to
make a profit in navigation, the boats
must be kept moving; every minute, every
hour, when a boat .is in port, the overhead
charges are running on the same-the
wages of the crew and all other expensesand the only difference is the fuel, which is
a very small item compared to the other
expenses. According to the views of the
late Senator Edwards, the Georgian Bay
canal would have been of no advantage,
as a boat going around the other way
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

would have done the trip and got to Montreal perhaps ahead of time of the one that
went through the canal.
But the demand for the Georgian Bay
canal was se great that the Borden Government apointed a Commission on it. Now,
if you want to give a project its death and a
beautiful burial and first-class funeral, you
have only to appoint a Commission, for
the Commissioners are drawing so much a
day, and they keep the thing going for
two or three years. In fact, the Commission that was appointed ten years or more
ago bas net made a report yet. I remember that Mr. Sanford Evans, of Winnipeg,
was the Chairman; General Meighen was
another one, and he had to go to war; so
I suppose he had not time te make the
report, and we are still waiting for it. But
in the meanwhile the death knell of the
Georgian Bay canal was sounded when the
Welland canal was started, because with
twenty-five foot navigation in that canal
there was no more need of the Georgian
Bay canal.
Whether the Welland canal
should have been built or not is a question
which we will not debate now, but I might
say that both the Laurier Government and
the next Government were committed to it.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Might I ask the
honourable gentleman how long it takes
a ship to travel from Montreal to Fort
William via the St. Lawrence?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am coming to
that in a few minutes; that will come in
better order when I get there. So that,
in Canada, we have heard, through the
Georgian Bay canal discussion for so many
years, of ocean vessels with the flags of
all 'nations flying on the Great Lakes,
until we got sick and tired. There was no
novelty about it: perhaps also the hard
times had something to do with stopping it.
Therefore we can conclude that Canada is
now lukewarm on the project of the St.
Lawrence Ship canal.
However, the International Joint Commission bas recommended it.
How far
Canada is committed to it is for the legal
gentlemen to say. I have nothing to do
with that, and do not attempt to deal
with it, but I do believe that this immense
project, this colossal enterprise, deserves
th;e full consideration of this House. The
magnitude of it is so great that it involves
an amount equal to half our national
debt-$1,100,000,000.
Now, the figures given in this report
which I hold in my hand are $252,000,000,
but that takes in the development of hy-

MAY 10, 1922
draulie horse-powers only in the international part of the river, which means
between Lake Ontario and the town of
Cornwall. Where Canada owns the whole
of the water-power, in this report ihere is
a dam sketched on the plans, with the
words, "Might be developed later on." If
it were, it would cost more than the other
one; therefore we can conclude that if
that one is going to cost $252,000,000, thother one, which would be erected not very
far from the city of Montreal, according
to the plans in the report, would cost as
much or more, because there is a greater
difference of level and a greater head.
This would make the cost of the project,
according to report, some $500,000,000.
Although they mention only $252,000,000,
and that is only for the development which
we would share with our friends to the
south of us-and I have absolute infornation that there is no idea at present
of developing where we might do so without having any international obligation.
In developing the power from Montreal to
Cornwall, we would have more power than
we would in the other case, because in the
former there is a difference of 129 feet
in level, while between Cornwall and lake
Ontario there is a difference in level of
only 92 feet.
I said that the St. Lawrence project
would cost two Panama canals; some
people say three. When the Panama canal
was taken over by the United States of
America the cost as estimated by very
good engineers was $144,000,000.
However, Congress voted $145,000,000, and
having had the opinion of a corps of engineers, very efficient men, one would naturally suppose that they would be near the
mark; but before a ship passed through
that Canal they had spent $280,000,000200 per cent above the estimate-and
since then, for sanitation, some fortifications, interest on money, some French indemnity, etc., the cost has amounted to the
round sum of $625,000,000 out of the Treasury of the United States of America-four
times the original amount. If we take
that as any criterion, we get for ours a
cost of $1,100,000,000, and too little at that.
We have had the experience of the
Transcontinental railway and the Grand
Trunk Pacifie railway. Honourable gentlemen will remember that at first the
Transcontinental was going to cost only
$13,000,000. Then they raised the ante
a bit and called it $30,000,000. But what
did it cost?-$200,000,000. But that is
nothing. Then we had the Grand Trunk
Pacific. According to the late CollingS-12

wood Schreiber, who gave an estimate for
the construction of that road on the
prairies, it would cost $17,500 per mile.
W.hy, the superstructure, that is, the work
above grade-the ties, the ballast, the fishplates, stations, sidings-alone cost $12,500
a mile at that time, as the ex-Minister of
Labour, who has been a railroad man, will
bear me out. That would have left the
beautiful sum of $5,000 a mile for building the road; yet the bridges from Winnipeg to Edmonton alone cost more than
$5,000 a mile, divided over that part of
the system.
Then we have, in our own time, the
Chippewa-Queenston hydraulic power being
developed by the Ontario Hydro-Electrie
Power Commission. How much more is
that costing than the original price? Will
it be three times, four times, more? I do
not know, but it seems to have run very
much above the estimate-so much so that
the province of Ontario is quite exercised
about it.
There is a gentleman whose name is prominently mentioned in this report-Colonel
Hugh L. Cooper. He is a very wellknown man in the United States of America, and also pretty well known in Canada amongst engineers. He was famous
for having built the Keokuk dam across
the Mississippi river. In one place he gave
the cost of this canal and those improvements between Montreal and lake Ontario
at $1,100,000,000. In another place he
gives it as $1,300,000,000. Well, a couple
of hundred millions one way or the other
does not matter very much just now, I
suppose.
There is another thing. Those who advocate this project say they can develop
5,000,000 horse-power.
Colonel H. L.
Cooper is one of them; he is in for the
5,000,000.
Others say 4,500,000; still
others say 4,000,000. We have in Montreal Mr. R. M. Wilson, electrical engineer,
who has just developed at the Cedars a
plant where there are at present in actual
operation 124,000 horse-power, with a possibility of a total of 160,000 horse-power.
If there is any one who should know the
problem of developing horse-power, it is
that man; and what does Mr. Wilson say
in this report on that subject? He says
that it will cost, to develop according to
the scheme recommended by the Commission, between $300 and $325 per horsepower; while at the same time, on the St.
Maurice river, horse-power is being developed at $80 to $100 per horse-power.
Honourable gentlemen will thus see that

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
by the proposed project it would cost three
times as much for horse-power as it does
on the St. Maurice river, and the latter
power would compete with it, because the
power now developed on the St. Maurice
river moves all our street railways in Montreal and does all our lighting, and so on.
Therefore, if you take Mr. Wilson's lowest
figure of $300 and multiply it by the
4,000,000, you will have the sum of
$1,200,000,000 as the cost of the enterprise.
So you see that we arrive by four or
five different ways at a cost of over
$1,000,000,000. And that is only for the
works along one-eighth of the route.
If you are going to have navigation, it
will entail dredging for stretches all the
way along down to a depth of 25 feet, and
the deepening of the harbours, at an
enormous cost.
It is said that the United States need
this electric development and are very
anxious to use it. Well, honourable gentlemen know as well as I do that within
a radius of 300 miles of the Long Sault,
where this power is supposed to be developed, the United States now have 10,000,000 of horse-power actually in operation, while Canada has a development of
roughly 2,000,000 horse-power also in
use. Therefore I ask where would you sell
all this horse-power? In addition to the
development that I have mentioned, the
United States has at present 10,000,000
undeveloped horse-power in their own territory, which would be available for development without the waste and expense of the
long transmissionThen I would refer to another authority.
The New York Times, a very serious and
reliable paper, estimates the cost at $1,300,000,000.
And all this is to compete, at
three times the price, with the power from
the St. Maurice river. In the province
of Quebec, we have a dam, commonly
called the Gouin dam, at the headwaters of
the St. Maurice river. While I am not in
favour of Government operation, I should
like to refer to a most interesting fact in
connection with this work. Before it was
decided to commence the Gouin dam, in
order just about to double the horse-power
development on the St. Maurice river, before a dollar was spent, the provincial Government went to the users of water on the
river, and said: "What will you give us
if we double your power? Will you pay so
much per horse-power toward the creation
of a fund?" And these users, solvent companies like the Laurentide, the Shawinigan,
and others, actually signed up with the
Hon.

Mr.

CASGRAIN.

Government, agreeing to pay so much for
every extra horse-power over and above what
they then had and were using. So that
the Government in the backward, priestridden province of Quebec were able to
go ahead without taxing the people of the
province one dollar. The bonds were issued; and in the specifications it was stipulated that the contractors would have to
accept the bonds of the province at 4 per
cent.
The amount derived in that way
from the various users of water amounted
to enough to pay the interest on the bonds
and to extinguish the bonds, by sinking
fund or amortization, ýso that after forty
years the province will be in possession of
the works in connection with the Gouin
dam without the expenditure of one cent
of the people's money.
But there is more. Every new user of
power brings a profit to the province.
Last year, after paying all expenses, the
Government realized a profit on these works
of $200,000. The original users of the
power paid enough to finance the whole
works, and every new user brought a profit. Between that and the Liquor Commission the province of Quebec will have
enough to pay off its debt and some of the
debts of the other provinces, as they have
been doing ever since Confederation.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Whisky and water.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: My honourable
friend to my right (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
asks how this dam compares with the Assouan dam. I may tell him that the Gouin
dam contains two-and-a-half times as much
water as the Assouan dam. There is only
one dam in the world, and that is not for
storage purposes, which contains more
water, and that is the Gatun dam of the
Panama canal, which holds back 180,000,
billion cubic feet of water.
The Gouin
dam holds back 160,000 billion cubic feet
of water, and the Assouan dam retains less
by two-and-a-half times than the Gouin
dam.
Colonel Hugh L. Cooper puts the price of
the dam near Cornwa'll at $300,000,000.
That would be some dam.
But, remember, honourable gentlemen, that that dam
would be 742 feet in height. So you see
that this enterprise will certainly cost as
much as two Panama Canals.
But, before going further as to the cost,
let me ask what would be the goo-d of it
in any event?
For instance, if a ship
were going up the canal light, and there
were a beam wind, she would have to tie
up; she could not go ahead.
It is difficult

MAY 10, 1922
enough te steer these great lakers, with
the large freeboard that they have when
they are light, in restricted waters. Last
summer, when the proponents of this
scheme who came from the United States
were with us on board the steamer Turbinia, we encountered trouble in ali the
canals, especially in the Lachine canal.
First we struck one side of the canal, and
then the other, until finally we were
jarmmed for four hours, with her bow on
one bank and her stern on the other, before
the tugs could pull her off.
Anyone who
knows anything about navigation knows
that wfhen ships have no headway they cannot be steered; and they have to stop in
approaching the gates of canals.
That is
why insurance rates jump up so tremendously in the canals. Why, going through
the Welland canal increases the insurance
1 per cent.
Every ýsummer you hear of
ships teing sunk in canaßs and navigation
being interrupted; you 'hear of ships having too much headway and bumping into the
gates of the locks, and so on, and in that
So, with a
way interrupting navigation.
beam wind-and I got this information
from a very practical man skilled in the
operation of boats in canal's-you cannot
safely navigate a boat in a canal when she
is light.
Besides that, in sha'llow, restricted waters a boat will net steer; she
will not steer unless she has plenty of
water under her.
Then there is the matter of the pilot. When
an ocean ship comes up the St. Lawrence,
at Father Point she takes on one pilot who
goes as far as Quebec; at Quebec she takes
on what they call a branch pilot, who
brings her from Quebec te Montreal. But
where are these ocean ships going te get
their pilot from Montreal on.
The river
and lake boats are manned by men who
have certificates as to their qualifications
te navigate the St. Lawrence and the Great
Lakes.
But it would be very difficult te
get pilots for these ocean ships.
If an
ocean ship came along ýshe would have to
whistle a long time before a pilot would
come.
Nobody would give up steady employment te pilot a ship once a month or se.
Then there is another feature.
How many
times would y-ou have te change pilots on
the trip?
From Father Point te Montreal you have two changes of pilots. As
these boats keep going day and night, two
pilots wouqd 'be necessary; and they say in
this report that sometimes three would be
required.
That would be another great
objection.
These men would have te be
paid sufficient wages te indemnify them for
S-121

the time they would have te wait for employment.
An ocean ship would take a very long
time to go through the new Weland Canal,
with its seven locks, with a lift of 46h feet
te each lock, making a total rise of isome
326 feet from Lake Ontario te Lake trie.
At Sault Ste. Marie we have an instance
of what would happen.
During the last
forty-eight years, off and on, I have pwssed
throeugh the Sault canal, and :I do not remember ever passing either up or down
when we were not about three hours at least
in getting through; either there were other
vessels in front of us, or there was seme
other cause of delay. The big lake ships
are.very hard te moor at the docks, and
it takes a very long time te get them
through the locks.
That being se, just
imagine how long it wouid take te raise
these ocean ships from one ýlevel te another.
On the way up, you come te 'the Detroit
river, the navigation of which is very precarious because of the tremendous traffic
passing Detroit. Then you 'have the St.
Clair flats. I remember when I was very
young hearing of a strange incident in regard te the St. Clair flats; perhaps the
ex-Minister of Trade and Commerce remembers it. There is now a very beautiful
wide channel, and on each side there is
sheet piling, like two dykes, overgrown with
beautiful trees. In the seventies the United
States Government proceeded te excavate
in the St. Clair flats and te build a channel,
but they built it in Canada. At that time
the honourable Hector Langevin was Minister of Public Works. He went up te
Windsor in great pomp, and in the name of
His Maiesty the King took possession of
the works of the United States, who were
then not as powerful as they are now, and
who gave up the works without any compensation. The difficulty of navigation in
the Suez Canal, the Kiel Canal, the Manchester Canal, and the Panama Canal, are
all much less than the difficulties of navigating the canals of the St. Lawrence, because they are nearly all at sea level, or,
like the Panama Canal, have only one
lift. Here we would have twenty lifts,
and the difficulties would be multiplied
twenty times.
In the case of the Panama Canal they
have heavy steam locomotives running on
four rails on each side of the canal. The
ships are attached te these locomotives by
steel hawsers, and proceed very slowly.
They are actually run from the shore.
This is dont to prevent them gaining head-

SENATE

180

way, as they might do if they were under
their own power, when, if a wrong bell
was given a ship might very easily go
through the gates and cause disaster.
These gates are 80 feet in height, and, if
they were injured, traffic would be stopped
for I do not know how many weeks or
months.
This dam that some people want to erect
near Cornwall would be 741 feet in height,
and would develop about 1,500,000 horsepower. But as conditions are at present,
without any dam at all, the river has been
known to rise from 20 to 30 feet during
ice jams, and there have been floods. If
you build a dam 741 feet high the ice jam
will not take place at the dam, because
there will be a body of water like a lake
above the dam. But the jam will take place
at the upper end of this lake, and the whole
country round will be flooded. Just imagine
what would happen, honourable gentlemen,
with a dam 74 feet high. The banks of the
St. Lawrence river keep going down with
the river. Imagine the floods that would
take place. It is admitted in this report
that the river would flood 29,000 acres of
land on the Canadian and the American
sides.
That would fiood many villages,
and, in addition, several burial grounds
which are more than one hundred years
old. According to this report Morrisburg,
Aultsville, and all such towns along the
river would have to be protected by dykes;
and the sewage of these towns would have
to be pumped over the dykes. You may
approve of such a project, honourable
gentlemen, but it seems to me that it is
not a very desirable one. It seems that
during the last two years some people have
lost all idea of what money means; but
I should think that the statement that this
work would cost as much as two Panama
Canals ought to appeal to their imagination.
And I ask in all sincerity, if these works
were carried out, would there be one more
bushel of wheat sent down the St. Lawrence river? What would we gain? Why,
there is not enough grain to keep the ships
that we now have busy during the season.
In the spring of the year there is a rush
until about the 20th of May, and during
that rush the ore boats turn in and compete
in the carrying of grain until the ore business is running smoothly. Those ore boats
come in and take whatever grain may be
offering; but by the 20th of May the rush
is over, and by the lst of June all the grain

ther need of those vessels at that time.

In the fall of the year there is another
rush, which .commences about the 15th
of September, and the same thing happens.
By that time the ore has been moved;
nearly all the big steel companies have
brought all their ore down during the
fine weather, before the bad weather sets in.
So the vessels return to the grain trade, and
by the lst of November, when freezing
sets in, there is no more moved.
I am asked by the honourable leader to
move the adjournment of this debate, so
that the House may proceed with the other
business. I therefore move that this debate
be adjourned until to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from April 26 the
debate on the motion for the second reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend the Judges
Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg(Hon.
Mr. McMeans), before taking the floor,
allow me to give to the Senate some infor-

181

mation which I obtained in order to auswer
the honourable gentleman from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner), who asked me some
questions as to the activities of the Court
of Appeals of Saskatchewan. The honourable gentleman, after perusing the law
reports of Saskatchewan, expressed the
opinion that the Court of Appeals of that
province had during the last few years
passed judgment in an average of 75 cases,
whereas the average number of judgments
rendered by the similar court in Alberta
was 149, in Nova Scotia 102, and in New
Brunswick, with three Appeal Court
judges, 70.
The statement of the Attorney General
of Saskatchewan is considerably at variance with the findings of my honourable
friend from Pictou; and :1 am not surprised that there should be a difference
in the figures, because the law reports
do not give all the legal decisions that are
rendered. I asked the Department of Justice, after the debate was adjourned, to
*ommunicate with the department of the
Attorney General in Saskatchewan on the
ciuestions that had been put in the Senate,
and the first telegram which came, dated
April 29th, runs as follows:
Regina, Sask., April 29th, 1922.
Sir Lomer Gouin,
Minister of Justice,
Ottawa, Ont.
Reference your wire of yesterday, Bill Increasing Court of Appeal In Saskatchewan from
four to five judges was introduced and passed
by the Legislature at the last session as the
result of a request received from Sir Frederick
flaultain, the Chief Justice of the Province. The
Chief Justice, In his letter, making request for
immediate action, stated that the work of the
court rendered the increase necessary.
Also
stated that an Appeal Court should consist of
an off number of judges in order to prevent
even division which 'sometimes occur, and drew
attention to the fact that all the Appeal Courts
in the Western Provinces consist of fOve judges.
British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, ail have
Courts of Appeal consisting of five judges, and
it is safe to say that the amount of work done
by the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan is as
great if not greater than that done In any
other Western Province. Saskatchewan bas a
population by far the greatest among Western
Provinces. British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba,
have each six Superior Court trial judges; Saskatchewan has seven, the additional one having
been created by the Legislature in 1920 as the
result of a request recelved from the Chief
Justice of the King's Bench and at that time
the request was for two additional trial judges,
but the Legislature provided for one only. The

Legislature of Alberta at its last session passed

an Act, to come into force by order of the
Lieutenant Governor In Council, providing for
an additional judge of the trial division of the
Supreme Court of that Province, thereby
placing Alberta In the same position as Saskatchewan In so far as Superlor Court trial
uurt
judges are concerned. The Saskatchewan

SENATE
of Appeal during the year 1921 heard 161
appeals, which number does not include a large
number of motions. The work has been continually congested, and I strongly urge that in
the interest of the public service provision be
made for an additional appointment to the
Court of Appeal and thereby carry out the
desire of the Legislature of the Province as
exipressed in the Act passed at the last session
creating the additional judgeship.

glad indeed that he has given this House
sufficient information to justify the ýappointment of an additional judge.
While I -am on my feet, might I indulge

the hope that when the Government of the
country nake the appointment of a judge,
they will not create the same scandalous
state of affairs as bas existed during the
last two weeks, when we find newspapers
and bar associations throughout Canada
protesting against the appointment of certain judges.
That sort of thing will only
bring the courts of justice in this country

into contempt, antd deprive the people of the
respect that they should have for the dignity of the judges, because of the appointments that have been made.
In making
appointments the Government should take
notice of the wishes and representations
made by the bench and bar of the different
provinces.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And create
jurisprudence, not being merely the repetition of a judgment on tax, or reversal of

tax, in a subordinate court.

I happened

to be in the Legislature when the Act was

passed creating the Court of Appeal in
Saskatchewan, and dividing the old
Supreme Court of the Northwest Territory
into two subordinate parts, the Court of
King's Bench and the Court of Appeal.
My recollection is, though I may be wrong,

MAY 10, 1922
that I took part in the discussion at the
time, and that we decided that the Courts
should be composed of three and four, not
four and five, judges respectively; I may
be wrong in that, for I have not refreshed
my memory; but the growth of population
in the province of Saskatchewan bas been
very rapid since the courts were established.
If five judges in the Court of Appeal are
not too many in Manitoba, and not too
many in British Columbia or in Albertaon which I pass no judgment-then the
province of Saskatchewan, with a population 200,000 larger than that of any one
of those provinces, may well find an equal
amount of work for the Appellate Court
to do. It is remarkable that in the newer
provinces there is rather more litigation
than the reverse. In my earlier life I
practised in the city of Toronto, and had
some knowledge of the current volume of
litigation in Ontario. My experience and
observation in the older parts of Ontario
is that the amount of litigation is rapidly
declining, and has been declining during
the last twenty years. I presume that is
within the observation of every practising
lawyer. In the newer portions of Canada,
where conditions are perhaps not so settled,
where there are a large number of new
comers who have not been altogether too
fortunate financially, the volume of litigation more than keeps pace with the growth
of population. In other words, I have no
doubt that the volume of litigation in the
province of Saskatchewan or the province
of Alberta or the province of Manitoba is
very much greater per capita than it is in
the province of Ontario, the province of
Quebec, or the Maritime provinces; because
we find that in the older portions of rural
Saskatchewan, the longest settled, where
the settlers are best off, there is the least
litigation. In other words, the farmer, who
constitutes the largest group of our population, is better able to meet his obligations,
and, with the growth of settlement and
increase of wealth of the country, litigation diminishes rather than increases. It
is quite true that in the great cities like
Montreal or Toronto, and the large cities
of the Maritime provinces, there may be
an increasing amount of litigation, for all
I know. That is due to those large cities
being the centres of population, and the
great loaning, insurance, and other companies have a tendency to congregate in
those cities. In the province of Saskatchewan we have no large cities. We have
three cities of moderate size, and several
smaller ones, but no place that is dominant,

183

such as Winnipeg in Manitoba, and litigation is perhaps as common at one end of
our province as at another. If public
opinion warrants the creation of an Appeal
Court of five in Alberta, Manitoba and
British Columbia, it warrants the creation
of a similar court in Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If the amount of
comment on the action of the present Minister of Justice is as great in the next year
or two as it has been in the past six
months, in connection with the selection of
judges, it will beconie a public scandal in
this country. Complaints have been made
that the Minister of Justice does not consider on their merits applicants for appointment, but weighs only political activity on the part of his political friends.
This particular case in Saskatchewan is
only an incident, and an illustration of
what is going on in the Dominion from
one end to the other. Personally I hope
that Mr. Martin will be appointed in this
case. His name might as well be mentioned,
because there is no use mincing matters.
For the first time we hear to-day that there
are 161 appeals in the province of Saskatchewan. Why cannot the judges who
are there now dispose of that trifling number?-161 appeals are not many. In the
province of Ontario, I ami bound to say,
the number would go well toward the thousands, as shown by the newspaper reports,
week by week, of cases that have been
dealt with there. Then there is complaint
of the inordinate haste of this Government
in making appointments. I see by the
newspaper that they made an appointment
in British Columbia to-day. I think, in
common decency, that the deceased judge
should at least have been buried-because
he could hardly have been buried before
the appointment was made. With the sarne
comment comes the fear, the doubt, the
trembling of the lawyers, as represented by
their Bar Associations, that the appointments will be political or otherwise improper. Honourable gentlemen can read
what the lawyers
in
British Colihave communicated to the
umbia
Minister of Justice-I am not going to
read it-that they want to be consulted as
to any appointment that will be made. This
article ends by saying that a Mr. McDonald bas been appointed to-day.
What is the trouble in the province of
Quebec? In the newspapers from day to
day what do we see? Not that a trifle like
161 cases are in appeal. I read a report
in a paper the other day, I think it was
La Patrie, that the Attorney General had

184

SENATE

been talking to the lawyers of the city of
Montreal.
The Attorney-General, who certainly knows
what he is talking about, expresses the opinion
that it is due to both causes, and whilst promising to give to the province ail the judges
it really needs, lie advised the advocates to
practise all the celerity they can to render
justice to their clients.

Then he said:
We have good judges, who are enlightened,
fair and upright; but our judicial organization
is often denounced because it is seemingly slow.
There are thousands of cases pending in the
civil courts, and some of the litigants must
wait months and sometimes years before their
case is tried.

That is one of the conditions that the

Attorney General adverted to the other
day. Now, why are these appointments not
made in the province of Quebec, if it is
necessary to make appointments?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not catch
the point as to the province of Quebec.
I do not know that there are any vacancies.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: That is just the
point-good judges in the provinces. I will
read another extract that will indicate the
condition; perhaps it will enlighten us
more. This is from Hon. J. L. Perron,
K.C., after his election by acclamation to
the position of Batonnier of the Montreal
Bar:
In this matter, he said he was in absolute
harmony with Premier Taschereau in idea and
ideal, and if it was that justice was delayed
through the inability-owing to ill-health-of
certain judges, and if they did not realize their
responsibilities and resign, then "it would be the
painful duty of the Bar to seek legislation that
would meet the contingency."

This is said by a 'person who must be
conversant with all the conditions in Mont-

real, and he states that there are thousands of cases standing there to-day, as
reported in the public press. The Minister
of Justice can move with great celerity in

British Columbia, making the appointment
before the man is buried.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yet he must
await the demise.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: No; there are
ways of proceeding against judges. If
they are so ill that they cannot do their
duty, surely there is power under the
constitution to deal with such cases. I
think there is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will allow me, there is only
one way of dealing with the extreme cases
of judges who, being too ill to perform
their duties, still cling to their positions.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT,

Representations may be made to them, but
direct action can be taken only by an address from both Chambers of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Well, even that
might do. Is not the condition in the province of Quebec as was stated by Mr.
Perron publicly in his address the other
day? It is said the trouble is that beardless youths are applicants for the positions
that those gentlemen occupy, and the Government will not interfere. Inthe next
place, it is said that there have been some
appointments made in Quebec by this Government-I suppose in certain districtsbut that under this Government and the
present Minister of Justice the condition
precedent is that a man must be a politician first and a lawyer afterwards; consequently those who might be fit for the
position are not acceptable politically to
the Government; and as the Government
has not, from time to time, enough gentlemen of their own political faith to fill those
positions, the congested condition of the
courts is the result. It is not fair to the
people of the province of Quebec, if what
La Patrie says is true, that affairs should
continue as they are to-day in that province. It is true, as everybody knows,
that the cost of the administration of justice in this country is very high.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: In the province
of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. "BENNETT: In all the provinces; that has been a matter of discussion in this House. I know that the late
Government tried to avoid, to a certain extent, over-expenditure in the province of
Ontario.
What was found there in the
matter of county courts? It was found
that in many counties appointments
had been made by both political parties,
but more by the honourable gentleman's party between 1906 and 1911,
and they simply satiated the country with county court judges.
They
had gone into counties where one judge
could quite well discharge
all the
duties, and had appointed their political
friends to junior judgeships. The late Government took the matter in hand, and said:
" Wherever we find a vacancy occurring
we will promote one of these junior judges
who

is

sitting at home doing nothing."

That plan was followed very largely;
but within the past six months what have
honourable gentlemen opposite done? AIthough in the province of Ontario there
were some thirteen or fourteen of these
junior judges, not one of them has been

Now, let me take some other cases. Here
is the county of Bruce, with two judges.
According to the information I have, only
eight County Court cases were tried in
that county in a year. In Algoma District,
adjoining Manitoulin, with two judges,
only five County Court cases were
tried. The island of Manitoulin couId
have been united with the district
of Algoma, and Judge Hewson could
have been brought down to Toronto.

who leads this House . knows, since
this Government has come into power
the appointment of judges has depended upon the political faith of the
appointees. Apparently the present Minister of Justice is not going to pay any
heed to public opinion, and is going to do
;ust as he did in the province of Quebec
while Premier of that province. He had
silenced opposition politically, and was
doing what he liked; and apparently he is
going to try to continue that policy in
the matter of the judiciary. Take this
case from Manitoba. I noticed in one of
the newspapers the other day that not only

Government appoint one of these fifteen
assistant or junior judges to one of these
three positions?
I took the trouble the other day of looking
up the returns of the cases disposed of in
the province of Ontario by some of the
County Court judges. I will mention one
instance. Honourable gentlemen, when in
power before-and when the appointment of
judges was a political matter just as much
as it is to-day, although they bid fair
now to work overtime-constituted a district called Manitoulin, and appointed a
judge to that district. The return shows,
although the salary of a junior judge is very
considerable, I think some $4,000 a year,
that there was not one case tried in the
County Court in that district, last year.

SENATE
On the one hand, we have the Benchers
opposing the man who was to be appointed,
and protesting against his appointment;
and on the other hand, although they say,
"We consider him utterly unfit for the
position," we have the Minister of Justice
saying that none of the reasons mentioned
inspired the selection made.
The Minister of Justice is not so innocent as he pretends to be. Where does he
get his inspiration in the appointment of
judges? Is it conceivable that judges are
appointed down here in the East Block
without their names ever coming before
Council. In the record of' the Liberal
party
from
1896
to
1911
as to
judges, this Government has a hard
record to beat.
Some of the appointments made when this party was in
power before were such screaming farces
that they were openly laughed at by the
leading papers of the country. One gentleman was appointed who had practically
never been a lawyer in his life, except for
the fact that he had passed an examination. Yet he was placed in one of the
highest courts in -the Dominion. One of the
leading law journals at the time said: "Hon.
Mr. So-and-so has been appointed to suchand-such a position. Apropos of his appointment, we relate the following story of
a man who had not the best reputation."
They were not insinuating that the appointee
had a bad reputation. This bad man had
died, and was to be buried, and the neighbours called around to do him what respect they could. No person could think
of a kind word until one man said: "Well,
we must admit that he had one redeeming
quality."
Someone bolder than the rest
then said: "What was it?"
The answer
was: "Oh, he was an excellent smoker."
So a High Court Judge was appointed
by honourable gentlemen opposite when
they were in power before, and the only
comment that a leading paper would make
about him was that inferentially he was
an excellent smoker.
Let me make a suggestion. I would suggest that in every case the name of the
appointee should be made known to Parliament before the appointment is made.
Personally I have no opposition to Mr.
Martin; and, if someone will second it, I
will move that it be stated in the Bill that
Mr. Martin is to be appointed; because,
after all the discussion which bas taken
place, there may be a slip, and it would be
rather too bad if he did not get the position.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

I do not know whether the old principle
prevails. The leader of the House smiles.
Ie 'has in recollection the case of a gentleman who was going around with a pledge
promising him a judgeship because of his
services in the past. The case became
notorious. That agreement was a very
good thing, because if this gentleman did
not get the judgeship he was assured of
getting another position in the province.
The Minister of Justice must understand
-at least, I should think he must-that he
is responsible for every judge appointed in
this country; and that when he pleads
ignorance and says that he has no knowledge of the facts, he will be disbelieved
by the people of the country. They will
not credit him with being so innocent that
he pays no attention to the names handed
to him. I hope that such appointments
will not be made in future as will shake
the faith of the public in the judiciary, as
some of these appointments are doing today. Can a judge go on a Bench in any
court in this country and try cases involving hundreds of thousands of dollars when
his name bas been paraded from one end
of the country to the other as that of a
man who is thoroughly unfit for the position to which he has been appointed? If
men who are utterly unfit for the positions
are appointed, what then? If they are trial
judges, they must decide cases; when they
decide cases, they must give decisions; and
if they are unfit for their positions their
decisions will necessitate appeals, and the
cost of those appeals will fall on the litigants. Let the leader of the House say:
"We will not be pharisaical or canting
about it at all; we have been in the business
of making appointments of judges politi-

cally; but I will have a heart-to-heart talk
with the Minister, and we will, God helping
us, try to do better in the future."
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should like to
ask my honourable friend if the statement
he read a few moments ago comes from the
Registrar of the Court?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. Tie
Registrar of the Court is mentioned in it
by the Attorney General as having furnished him with the number of cases decided by the Court of Appeal during the
years 1919, 1920, and 1921.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I wanted to ask
if the statement contained any information as te the number of days upon which
the Appeal Court sat during the year.
How much time did those appeal cases

MAY 10, 1922
occupy? Can my honourable friend give
us any information on that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no information. I know how these things were
managed in the city of Montreal when I
was practising at the Bar some fifteen
years ago. There have been some changes,
but at that time, there were four terms
in Montreal. The roll was called and
cases were heard; then an adjournment
was taken for the purpose of deliberating
upon those cases, and at a certain later
date judgment was given. In the city of
Quebec, where a smaller number of cases
were inscribed on the list, there were also
four terms. Yet the judges, although they
had those eight terms, were fully occupied,
and there were some years when in the
city of Montreal there was quite a waiting
list. I have no information as to the time
given to the hearing of those cases and to
their study preparatory to judgment.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I only wish to
point out, in reference to the figures in
this memorandum, which are larger than
the figures I gave the other day, that I took
the Law Reports of Saskatchewan, Alberta,
Nova Scotia, Alberta and New Brunswick.
I understand from this statement that the
number of . cases actually heard in Saskatchewan is larger than the number reported; that is, that a number of cases
were heard which were not reported.
That, to my mind, proves nothing whatever, because I take it that the same circumstances exist in respect to the province
of Alberta and the other provinces. I
made a comparison, and I think it stands,
because what happens in one province
happens in another.
Not necesHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sarily. According to the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughiby), the reporting of the cases in the
province of Saskatchewan bas been altered
lately in order to restrict the reports to
cases which constitute decisions on points
of law.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is the case
in the other provinces also.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to say a
few words, not particularly upon the appointment in Saskatchewan, but upon the
administration of justice generally. I do
not have to depend upon newspaper reports, although I think in this case they
are quite trustworthy. I have it on very
high authority that in the city of Mont-

187

real the present condition of administration of justice is scandalous; and that it
arises from the fact that there are on the
Bench a number of dld men who are utterly
incompetent to perform their duties. The
Government is blamed for not having retired those gentlemen. I have been informed by more than one Minister of Justice that the view of the successive Governments of this country has been that
they have no power under the British
North America Act to retire a judge so
long as he can crawl on to the Bench
and pretend to perform his duties.
The last Government, in my humble opinion, did a great deal to encourage incompetent judges to remain on the bench.
Before the Judges Act was amended tg
increase the salary the law provided that
when a judge attained a certain age and
retired he should be entitled to a retiring
allowance equivalent to the salary that attached to his office at the time of his retirement. The amendment to the Act increased the salary, but said that thereafter the judge who retired should not receive the increased emolument as a retiring allowance. That Act should have been
styled "An Act to encourage incompetent
judges to remain on the bench."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not so much
incompetent as invalid, my honourable
friend means.
It is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the same thing. They are incompetent
when they become invalid, I should imagine.
At all events the result is that judges who
would otherwise retire and who perhaps
have very slim resources are tempted to
stay on the bench, and the temptation
overcomes their sense of what is right and
what is wrong. I think it is the duty of
the Government of Canada to remedy this
wrong to the people of this country. To
have the bar of Montreal, the commercia.
capital of Canada, protesting against the
condition of affairs is something which
should make any Government stop, look and
listen. This situation bas existed more or
less acutely in Canada as long as I have
been practising at the bar, and we have
had occasion after occasion to complain
of men remaining on the bench when their
usefulness was gone. I cannot understand
the listlessness of any Government in not
taking action on these cases. If they will
not take the trouble to apply for an amendment to the British North America Act
to give them the powers which they think
they require, I will tell them a short course:

1;8

SENATE

they should declare that a judge when he
attains a certain age must retire, or thereafter his salary shall be one dollar per
year. That would bring conviction, I think,
to the dullest intellect. It is not too drastic
a course, because the personal interest of
a judge is not to be placed above the interest of this country, and it seems to me
it is only a proper course that a judge
be compelled to retire when the whole world
knows that he ought to retire, or else that
he cease to be paid for malpractice on the
bench.
I think also that, in justice to the judges,
that Act of which I have already spoken
should be amended so as to give a judge
the retiring allowance which was promised
to him when he went on the bench. I
think that this country has a statutory contract with every man who was appointed
to the bench before the amendment of the
Act, to give to him a retiring allowance
equal to the salary which was attached to
his office at the time of his appointment;
and if that were done, I think you would
find that there would soon be a number
of appointments to be made in the city of
Montreal.
The Minister of Justice has ibeen accused
here to-day of being responsible for the
appointment of judges in the Dominion of
Canada.
I know nothing at all about the
ability of any of the western judges.
I
have heard it said here that they were incompetent.
I do not know whether they
are or whether they are not.
But if I
am rightly informed-and I have been told
many times-the Minister of Justice has
not the appointment of the judges of this
country; the members of the government
fron the different provinces arrogate to
themselves the power of nominating judges,
although among the Ministers from one
province there may not be a lawyer at
all.
I have been told by Ministers of Justice that, contrary to the time-honoured
practice in the Dominion of Canada, and
to what is the case in any other department, they have not full power or controlthey have not the last word in the appointment of the judges of this country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, there is only one remedy
that can be applied to abuses of the kind
pointed out. The late government was
very deeply impressed with the necessity
of exercising such authority as would warrant a proper administration of justice
throughout Canada, by preventing men who
had become incompetent or helpless 'by
reason of old age, from remaining on the
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

Bench.
The Minister of Justice about
three years ago brought up in the House
of .Commons, if I remember rightly, the
desirability of the House approving of an
address for an amendment to the British
North America Act.
Unfortunately, in
many matters we are prescrilbed by a written constitution.
That written constitution applies particularly as to the retention
of office by judges during life.
A judge,
no matter how incompetent he may be,
whether from old age or other cause, can
simpily defy the Government of Canada
and public opinion, and persist in retaining
his position.
That should not be the
case.
I remember that when the matter
was brought up by the then Minister of
Justice in the House of Commons, the official opposition of that day took very strong
ground against any such amendment being
made to the British North America Act
as would place authority in the hands of
the Government of Canada to terminate the
office of such a judge.
Apprehension was
felt that possibly the independence of the
judiciary might be interfered with by
reason of the exercise of that very proper
authority by the Government of the day.
Sure'ly if the people of this country have
any confidence in the Government of Canada they can safely place in the
hands of that Government the authority to terminate the office of any
judge who is unable to perform his duties.
The disability of certain judges and their
incompetence to discharge their duties became subjects of wide public discussion in
the province of Ontario for many years, and
the same is true of other provinces of
Canada.
It seems to me that, in view of
the present state of public opinion upon this
question, the Government of Canada should
at once take steps to have the Constitution
amended so that the Government at any
time may exercise its authority in the direction indicated.
They should recede from
the position which they took in this respect
two or three years ago.
They have prevented the realization of that condition
which 'is so idesirable, and they should be
frank enough to come out and say, "We
were mistaken, and we are now prepared to
assume the responsibility of asking the
Imperial Government to amend the Constitution."
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I had no intention of taking part
in this debate, but I must say that personally I would not be prepared to go as
far as the honourable gentlemen suggests. I
think it is a very serious niatter to put into

MAY 10, 1922
the hands of any Government the power
of interfering with the administration of
justice. It is true that the judges have
the right to hold office for life, but they
are subject to impeachment by the two
branches of Parliament, and I think that
is the remedy which should be exercised in
all cases where a remedy is required. I
should have much more faith in a remedy
of that kind for the future than in leaving
the remedy to either a Liberal or a Conservative Government. We know perfectly
well that mistakes may be made by governments, whether Liberal or Conservative.
Governments are sometimes carried too far;
too much political pressure may be brought
to bear upon them; and even if no mistakes
were made, they would be open to the suspicion that they were actuated by political
motives, and their action would be criticised.
I think we have the remedy in the right to
impeach judges who, being unable to discharge their functions, persist in remaining
on the Bench, and that right should be
exercised.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask my honourable friend a question? In
view of the fact that we have ilever invoked
the remedy which he has pointed out, notwithstanding the fact that since Confederation we have had that right, is my honourable friend prepared to allow matters
to continue as in the past?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The right has been
exercisedHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
unaware of it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: -in a couple of instances, but of course when the judges saw
that they were to be impeached they gave
up.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can
my honourable friend recall any case of a
Superior Court judge ever being impeached
on account of physical helplessness?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Oh, yes; but not on
on account of physical helplessness?

that the vacancy in Nova Scotia is being
reserved for the Solicitor General. Perhaps my honourable friend can tell me if
that is true, and if the appointment will be
made at an early date.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, many things that have been
said this afternoon, and that represent suggestions for constructive legislation, will
be welcomed, I am sure, by the Minister of
Justice. He bas been himself considerably
exercised over the difficulties that he has
had to face, and some of them are as
serious as stated by my honourable friend
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton).
The great problem is to find within the
terms of the Constitution a way to bring
to the attention of the judges the necessity
for their retiring without recourse being
had to the very solemn process of an address by both branches of this Parliament.
It has occurred to me in studying the
situation that possibly the Minister
of Justice might find a solution in
somewhat
which is
this procedure,
along the lines of the suggestion made
by the honourable gentleman from Hamilton: that when a judge has been away
from the bench for six months, whether
with or without the authority of the Minister of Justice, he be notified that if within
the next three months he is unable to return to his functions, and if he does not
ask for his pension, the Minister will advise as to what should be done. The situation in many cases has been this. Judges
have asked for a congé or have been absent through illness. After their leave expired they have not returned to the bench;
they have simply allowed the situation to
continue without their giving to the public
any service in return for the considerable
salary which they were drawing. I wonder
if the Department of Justice might not
find a remedy in notifying a judge who bas
been away practically twelve months-six
months on leave of absence and six months
without leave, or perhaps with a second
leave-that if he does not ask for his pension his salary will be suspended until he

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No; an
amendment to the Salaries Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: An
amendment to the Judges Act would do it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It might perhaps be done under the Salaries Act. I
have asked the Minister of Justice to examine the question and have it examined
by his Department, for the purpose of endeavouring to find some means of meeting
such cases as have been mentioned. I
know that in more than one place in the
country the situation is glaring, and something should be done to remedy it. My
honourable friend from Simcoe (Hon. Mr.
Bennett) bas spoken of political appointments and bas mentioned dates at which
such appointments have been made to the
Bench. The honourable gentleman means,
I suppose, members of the Bar who have
been active in politics. Well, the opinion
bas been given by prominent men that a
member of the Bar, of good standing, who
bas had some experience in political life,
is very often all the better equipped for
his functions on the Bench. My honourable friend bas spoken of a few years past.
I suppose be means the years that he bas
lived. But J can remember more than one
case in which the men appointed did not
seem to have had a very active practice
at the Bar, but they made very good judges.
I remember the case of a Solicitor General who was appointed to the Bench in
Montreal.
There was considerable feeling and criticism. It was in 1895, and the
Government was shaken to its base in the
province of Quebec over the appointment;
an election or two came on, and strong
protests were made against the appointnient, because the judge had not been an
active practitioner for the fifteen or twenty
yoars that he had been in the House of
Commons. Yet, ten, or fifteen years after
he died, the whole Bar of Montreal was
unanimous in expressing the opinion that
he had been one of the best judges we
had had on the Bench. We have had firstclass lawyers, with splendid reputations,
who have made very poor judges. This
does not affect the general rule-that appointees should possess the first quality
which should adorn anyone who is called
to the Bench.
I will close these rambling remarks by
stating that we had a Chief Justice in
Montreal, Sir Francis Johnstone, who, in
fis younger days on the Bench, used to
'all some of his colleagues, "My dear old
Necessity," and when someone asked hii
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

vhat he meant, he said, "Necessity knows
no law." Most of my honourable friends
have heard this story.
I will not pass judgment upon the Bench
,n other provinces, because I do not know
the conditions, but I might say that the
Bench of the province of Quebec bas the
full respect of the Bar, whose members
can best estimate the ability of the judiciary. The complaint is that some judges
have grown old, and do not realize what
they owe to themselves and to the public;
and this discussion, if they will deign to
read it, may perhaps prompt them to do
the right thing by the people of Canada,
who have to put up with the present condition of things.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My honourable
friend bas not given me any information
about Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say
that I know nothing about the conditions
n Nova Scotia, but I shall be very happy
to draw the attention of the Minister of
Justice to the grievance of the Bar in
that province.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes, we would like
to get the appointment made.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

IN COM-

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 27, an Act respecting the Department of National Defence.-Hon. Mr.
Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
leave of the House to bring -Colonel Orde,
Judge Advocate General of the Department, on the floor, of the House.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, for my own information I should like to ask just where we are
with this legislation. As a rule, I have to
wait until the day following, when the
proceedings are printed, to know what
has been done; consequently I may be
silently giving my adhesion to some things
which, after consideration, I might think
quite heretical.
The leader of the Government a few
days ago read us a salutary lesson about
speaking up. I am afraid he has not
profited by that instruction himself.
There are members in this Senate who are
no bigger than I am, and I hear them
because they stand up and speak to the
House; there are others who speak into
their papers, or directly to the Speaker,
who does not care a hang what they say,
because he is not particularly interested in
it, and turn away from those who do have
an interest in what they are saying. I
should like the leader of the Government
to tell us where we are at the present time
in regard to this Bill. And will the Chairman put his apparatus into working order
so that the breath behind will send his
voice so that we at this the farther end
of the Chamber, will know exactly what
is going on?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thank the
right honourable gentleman for the good
advice he has given to myself and my
colleagues. I will try to speak in such a
way that I may be heard at the four
corners of the ChamberRight Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I can hear you now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And whenever I am deficient in this respect, I want
to be called to order.

191

We had reached clause 5 of the Bill. We
had passed subsections 1, 2 and 3 of this
clause, and were discussing subsection 4.
I intend to ask permission to refer to
subsection 3 of section 5, because I have
an amendment to move to that subsection.
Before doing so, however, I desire to give
a few explanations which are called for
as a result of the preliminary discussion
of the Bill which we had the other evening.
I may say at the outset that the
Minister of Militia, when he introduced
this Bill, explained his intentions in
regard to the application and carrying
out of the Act. I echoed those intentions
in this House, but, as they were
not crystallized in black and white, I was
asked where I could find them in the Bill.
I intend to incorporate in the Bill, by a
few amendments, the intentions of the
Minister of Militia in order to satisfy
this Chamber that they will be carried out.
Before addressing myself to the section
of the Bill, I should like to make a brief
statement as to the savings that are expected from the amalgamation of the Departments. This amalgamation, as honourable gentlemen know, covers the Militia
Department, the Naval Service, and the
Air Board. The saving effected by the
joining of those Departments will be in
the Branch of Accounting and Pay; in the
Purchasing Branch, including both the buying and the inspection of supplies; in the
Central Registry, including the storage,
care, and distribution of official files and
papers; in the Printing and Stationery
Branch; in the Libraries; in the Transport
Services to the outer forts at Halifax;
and in the Records Branch. The amalgamation of these different branches will
mean a saving of at least 25 per cent of
the number of clerks at present employed,
without impairing the efficiency of the service. It is the hope of the Minister of Defence-to-be that by reason of the amalgamation he may be able to do away with
quite a number of temporary employees,
and to carry on with the permanent staff
of those branches; and he has expressed
the opinion that under that head alone a
saving of over $700,000 a year will be
made.
Hon. Mr. REID: May I ask whether the
saving of $700,000 is from temporary employees alone, or does it include all the
other items which the honourable gentleman has just mentioned?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will look up the statement of

SENATE
the Minister himself, at page 684 of the
Commons Hansard, he will find that the
economy will be in the reduction of the
staff itself, thereby effecting a saving of
over $700,000.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I ask the honourable gentleman if,
having arrived in the end at the conclusion
that there would be a saving of $700,000,
he has a record of the items of saving,
which, when totalled up, amount to $700,000,
or is it just an estimate? I do not see how
one can base the amalgamation of the
different Departments on the ground of
economy unless he puts before the House
the items on which he expects to make the
saving.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that on the lst of April some 400 employees
were dispensed with, and that a like number will be dispensed with in the very near
future when this amalgamation has taken
place.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think my honourable friend will see that,
if the saving of that many clerks was
made on April lst, it has not resulted from
the amalgamation, but is a saving which
would have taken place had there been no
amalgamation. If, therefore, that is put
in to make up the total amount of $700,000, I am afraid that it is not a fair
representation of the ground on which to
base the amalgamation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I feel on safe
ground in saying that there will be in the
amalgamation a saving of 25 per cent. Of
course, we shall be in a better position to
make the calculation next year; and even
if we fall short by a few points, anything
in that line, I suppose, will be welcomed
in this Chaniber and in the country.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is this
estimate of 25 per cent based on? Is it
based on the services which have been
mentioned: Accounts and Pay Branch,
Central
and
Inspection,
Purchasing
Registry of Files, Printing and Stationery,
Libraries and Transport Records? If the
saving of this 25 per cent amounts to
$700,000, then I take it that the total cost
of this service is $2,800,000. As a matter
of fact, is it? Who knows that it is?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The statement that a 25 per cent reduction will
on the fact that these
ensue is based
Departments, when amalgamated, will
mean a smaller number of men to do the
work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. REID: May I ask the leader
of the Government if it is not a fact that
the purchasing for all the departments is
being done by a Purchasing Commission,
and that therefore there is no Purchasing
Department in the Naval Branch? If that
is the case, how does he intend to abolish
it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Purchasing Commission onily
co-ordinates
the
purchases between the different departments, and passes on the work of each
department. I am under the impression
that there are departments which have
left this work to the Purchasing Commission; but I know a number of departments have not abandoned their purchasing
departments, and are simply using the
Purchasing Commission to obtain prices.
Hon. Mr. REID: Is it the intention that
the same accountant and the same staff
of the Militia Department shall do the
extra work in connection with the Naval
it,
the
Department? As I understand
accountant of the Militia Department and
his staff had sufficient work to keep them
occupied almost all the time. Is it the
intention to dispense with the services of
the staff of the accounts and pay branch?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was expected that the permanent staffs of both
branches would be able to keep up with
the work, and that most of the temporary
employees, who were numbered in
the
hundreds, would be dispensed with. There
will be services in the Militia section which
will need to be strengthened, but others
may be found to be sufficiently manned if
only one staff is retained. But the work
will have to be co-ordinated,
and
the
Minister and his Deputy will have to be
governed according to the needs of the
new department.
Hon. Mr. REID: I take it that many of
these temporary employees who will be
laid off have been in that employment for
a good many years. May I ask the leader
of the Government if those whom it is
necessary to let out will be given the first
opportunity in case a vacancy occurs in
the service afterwards? I think that was
the rule of the Civil Service Commission.
Government to
Is it the policy of the
follow that rule?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Government have no policy on this matter, because
it is outside their jurisdiction. If the Civil
Service Commission bas made such a rule

MAY 11, 1922
-and I commend it-I would be surprised
if it were not adhered to.
If honourable gentlemen are ready to
enter upon the discussion of the Bill section
by section, I will ask leave to revert to
subsection 3 of section 5.
On subsection 3 of section 5-appointment of officer to exercise powers of the
Deputy Minister under Naval Service Act:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Before the Minister proceeds. I would like to know if I
have a clear understanding of the statement he has made in so far as economies
in the staff are concerned. It seems to me
he has just gone this far-that under the
amalgamation only temporary employees
will be dispensed with, and the permanent
staff as it now exists will be retained.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman is mistaken if he has taken
that meaning. I have spoken of the expectation of the Minister of Militia that
he would be able to carry on with the
permanent staff, and dispense with the
temporary one, but I have seen nowhere
a statement from him to the effect that
he would bind himself to retain all the
permanent officials. He will have to prepare a classification, find out the needs of
the new Department, and then submit the
classification to the Civil Service Commission.

193

this amalgamation, and reduction is to be
made, we should look for such reduction
in the permanent staff as well as in the
temporary staff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No one looks
forward with more expectation than myself to reductions in the carrying on of
the affairs of this country. These reductions are necessary, and impose themselves
on all heads of departments in view of the
financial condition of the federal exchequer. I said, in explanation of subsection
3 of section 5, that it was intended simply
in order that the iDeputy Minister of
Naval Defence should continue on provisionally until the services were absorbed
or amalgamated. I was asked by the honourable leader of the Conservative party
in this Chamber, "But where is the word
'provisional' in the clause?" I think the
point is fairly well taken, though the Minister of Militia had made a similar statement in the House of Commons and it
had been accepted. But I have no objection to propose that the following words
be included in that clause, "for a period not exceeding six months," after the
word "appoint" in the second line. The
subsection will then read:
The Governor in Council, on the recornmendation of the Minister, may appoint, for
a period not exceeding six months, an officer
who shala, etc.

works for a couple of months I should
think it would be hardly fair to cut him
off without any such leave.
I may inform
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend that it is the intention
of the Minister of Militia to offer the Deputy
Minister of the Navy the position of Controller of Finance, which is dealt with by
the following section, so that this section
will be but a provisional one, and his office
will be maintained so long as necessary
for the harmonizing of the two departnents.
That really means.
Hon. Mr. REID:
then, that the intention is to keep the
present Deputy Minister on as a permanent
officer under the title of Controller and
Deputy Minister at the same salary that
he now bas under the Act.
The Office of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Deputy Minister of the Navy will be
abolished when the term mentioned expires. After the six months there will
be no deputy head of the Naval service.
Hon. Mr. REID: But might I ask the
honourable leader of the Government this
question? If the next subsection is adopted,
to appoint a Comptroller with the title of
Deputy Minister, is there not at present
an Act giving to any official who has the
title of Deputy Minister the salary of a
Deputy Minister?
No, there is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not. The question was raised the other
evening on this very point, and I have
obtained the opinion of the Department of
Justice-of Mr. Newcombe-on this question. This is running somewhat ahead of
the next section to be taken up, but I may
as well read the opinion of the Deputy
Minister of Justice:
Memorandum-

The Deputy Minister of Justice exipressed the
opinion that the granting to a member of the
civil service of the rank of a Deputy Minister
does net in effect give him "the salary of a
Deputy Minister," nor does it ipso facto make
him a Deputy Head of a Department.
The granting of the rank of a Deputy Minister merely relates to matters of precedence at
officiai functions, etc. Furthur, the salary of a
Deputy Minister is now governed by the Civil
Service Classification, and there will be found
on page 249 of the classification list a provision to the effect that the salary of a Deputy
Minister shal he such as may be granted by
-the Governor in Council, having regard to the
nature of the duties which the appointee is
called upon to perform, and will not be less
than $4.,200, or more than $8,000 per annum.
The classification was confirmed by Section 10
of Chapter 10 of the Statutes for the Second
Session of 1919.
Hon. Mr. REID.

Under the circumstances, therefore, the Deputy
Minister of Justice considers that the amendment to subsection 4 of section 5 as brought
dlown in the Senate does not purport to fix the
salary of the person appointed Comptroller.
May Tenth, 1922.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER: I
congratulate my honourable friend on the
move he has made in reference to this subsection 3. I have no objection in the worli
to.employing the services of an experienced
man such as Mr. Desbarats, who has had
under his supervision that branch of the
service in all its mechanical work, and
the oversight of the whole. I think 't
would be of great advantage to the new
Department to have the benefit of bis
experience for a time; but I was not
favourable to having another Deputy Head
created. I think two Deputy Heads in
one department would be a very prolific
source of trouble to the coming Minister,
whoever he may be. It would be like throwing half a hundred monkey wrenches into
the machinery, because there will be points
of difference between the two Deputy Ministers, and the temperaments of the two
may be such that it would be very much
to the disadvantage of the smooth working of the Department. Then, again, I
suppose Mr Desbarats is not a technical
naval officer; it was the civil part of the
business that he had under his charge, and
consequently it did not seem to me to be
necessary that a special Deputy Minister
for the Naval branch should be appointed
permanently. I am glad, therefore, to see
that, whilst the Minister will have the advantage of the experience of the present
Deputy Head of the Naval service, it is
not proposed to make that a permanent
appointment, and that the one Department
will have its one Deputy Head. The examples in re-arrangements that we have already had go to show that that is the
better method of procedure, and I am
glad it is being followed in this matter.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: With respect to the
last few words of this subsection, the Minister just now read a letter from the
Deputy Minister of Justice stating that
the salary of a Deputy was fixed at nit
more than $8,000. That letter was written
with reference to the paragraph now under
discussion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No, the next

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: What I have to say
is in reference to the paragraph now under
While the Act does limit

MAY 11, 1922
salaries of deputies to $8,000 there are wellknown means within the Civil Service administration of increasing this sum; and
this paragraph provides, according to the
practice of the Militia Department, that
this Deputy whom we are creating shall
receive a salary about fifty per cent in
excess of that which bas been mentioned
to the House. It seems to me that, while
we are so close as we are at present in the
expenditure upon the Militia, while we are
cutting off the pay of the private soldier
all over Canada, and almost abolishing him,
we should pay a little attention to these
extra-departmental gifts that have become
so lavish lately towards the higher officials of those services, and that when we
provide that this officer should be a member of the Militia Council we should at
least provide that there should be no extra salary attaching to that function. I
am fairly familiar with the work in the
departments at Ottawa, and I know there
are no duties cast upon a member of the
Militia Council that do not come within his
ordinary services in connection with the
Department, but that those gentlemen are
appointed exofficio.
Because they hold
certain offices in the Department they are
appointed members of the Militia Council,
but that involves no extra time or work. I
think it is time for some one to protest that if
we are to have economies in the Militia
they should start at the top, and should
not all be confined to the members of the
lower ranks.
W'hile on my feet I wouild like to refer
to something that has not been explained
at ali, so far as I have noticed, during this
discussion.
iWhile ire are amalgamating
the Naval service with the Militia service,
we are not really abolishing any department.
The Naval service has always been
administered simply as a branch of the
Marine and Fisher.ies Department.
We
are now transferring that branch to the
Militia Department, and it seems to me
that anything that we are adding to the
expense of the Militia Department by such
transfer should be taken away from the
Marine and Fisheries Department. These
savings we are told of are very iargely
mythical.
There is no intention to take
away from the ordinary management expenses of the Marine and Fisheries Department, whille we are adding to the expense of the Militia Department.
So far
as I can recoTlect, that has not been touched
upon at all, but I think it is a matter well
worthy of consideration.

Reverting to what I rose to say, I do
think we should put an end to these extraordinary grants to high officials of the
department which are made through various inter-departmental manoeuvres.

estimate of $3,700,000 last year has been

is an item in the morning paper to the

It ;might be well
to .inquire whether there is going to be any

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We may consider the opportunity of mak-ing our own
contribution to the world-wide desire for
disarmament.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to ask
whether the services of this official as a
member of the Defence Councill cease at
the end of six months, or is he made a
permanent member of that Council? It
appears to me the rparagraph is not very
distinct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
With the
adoption of this proposed amendment the
full powers and functions of the Deputy
Minister of Naval Service will come to
an end. He can be a member of the Defence Council, if he is appointed thereto,
only during the six months that are mentioned as the maximum time during which
the office of Deputy Minister of Naval
Service will be in existence.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Then he ceases to
be a member of the Defence Council?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes; because
if we are referring to the person to whom
it is intended to offer the Comptrollership
under that subsection 4, I do not see that
he is to be made a member of the Defence
Council.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I would like an
answer to the question I asked the honourable gentleman-whether this appointee is

Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) a few moments ago asked the honourable leader of
the Government, as the representative of
the Government, if it was the Government's
intention to put out of commission those
vessels which were presented to us by
Great Britain two or three years ago, in
order to effect a certain amount of economy.
The honourable gentleman did not ask the
question in the words which I have given,
but that is what I understood my honourable friend to mean. Great Britain presented Canada with a cruiser and, I think,
two torpedo-boat destroyers and two submarines. Is it the intention to put those
out of commission, to do away with their
services in Canada, and to return them to
Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not in a
position to answer rny honourable friend.
I do not know what decision, if any, has
been reached. Announcement vill be made
by the Minister of National Defence, who
will have the Naval Service under his
charge, when the naval estimates are before
the House of Commxons; but I can inquire,
and before the Commoners have been informed I may be able to give the information to my honourable friend.

in Council may appoint a Comptroller "who,
under the Deputy Minister of National Defence, shall be charged with all financial
matters pertaining to the Department of
National Defence," and he may have, under
the amendment which I suggest, "the rank
of Deputy Minister if deemed expedient."
This amendment is for the purpose of retaining to the Deputy Minister of Naval
Service his status as Deputy Minister if he
is offered and accepts the Comptrollership.
This would be the only case in which the
amendment would operate in favour of thci
ex-Deputy of Naval Service, who would
then not suffer a reduction in rank, with
all that it represents-may I say?-socially,
for I do not know in what other respect.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is equivalent to stating that it is

to make the present Deputy of the Naval
Service the Comptroller.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes, that is

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yesterday I pointed out the undesirability of
creating such an office as this of Comptroller. There are three objections that
nay be advanced, and, I think, advanced
with the soundest reasons, for desisting
from the passing of such a clause. In the
first place, there is a provision under subsection 2 of section 5 that "such officers
may be appointed as are necessary for
the carrying on of the business of the
Department, all of whom shall hold office.
during pleasure." This is manifestly an
evasion of the Civil Service Act, for it is
supposed that an officer shall be appointed
on the recommendation of the Minister. In
the second place, it is contrary to the policy
laid down by my honourable friend the
leader of the Government, as well as by
the Government itself in introducing the
Bill into the House, namely, that this is
being done in the interest of economy.
There is no economy in the appointment
of an officer who is, in my judgment,
entirely unnecessary. If this officer is ta

Defence", I would like my honourable
friend to tell us what the Deputy Minister
of National 'Defence is going to do? Is
he to be a cipher? Is he to be relieved of
all responsibility? in the third place, it
is not only an extravagance and an evasion
of the Civil Service Act, but it also means
the appointment of another Deputy Minister. We were very much impressed, when

SENATE

Minister thought of suggesting the amendment that I have -now proposed, in order
that Mr. Desbarats might retain the rank
he has had of Deputy Minister and enjoy
the advantage of that status. It is all very
vell for people to say that it matters little
that one person should be diminished in
rank. Of course, the reduction of a neighbour's rank does not affect oneself, but it
does affect the neighbour.
We have an
official who has rendered very good service
to the State, who is now just a little over
sixty years of age-I know that, because
I was at school with him-and who bas but
a few years more to devote to the State.
It seems to me that when a man, by his own
merits, his faithful service, his talent, and
his loyalty to the Government, bas ascended the ladder fron the simple position
of unattached engineer to the point to
which Mr. Desbarats bas reached, there is
something humane in the idea of offering
him now a position which will not lower
him in the rank be bas enjoyed. I leave
that to the honourable gentlemen of the
Senate. But that does not affect th menrits
of the question which bas been raised by
my honourable friend the leader of the
Conservative partyHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend pardon me? If this is
so sympathetic a case, may I ask the Government why they are decapitating Mr.
Desbarats-why they are wiping out his
position?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The answer
is self-evident: because there is an amalgamation of two or three departments, and
everyone bas approved of the principle that
there should be one head.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If that
is the case, why does not my honourable
friend stop there?
The next step is to
recreate him.
That is what it means.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I beg my
honourable friend's pardon. The Minister
of Militia and Defence has expressed the
opinion that, in the very intricate situation
of the finances of this departmnent, where
there are four different kinds of pay-sheets,
there should be a financial comptroller. He
said so although a newcomer in that Department, and he was at once backed by the
ex-Minister of Militia, Mr. Mewburn, who
commended
that declaration
in these
words:
The Minister is on absolutely sound lines.
I know from my short experience while I was
in charge of the Militia Department that there
was badly needed a capable business man to
oversee the finance organization.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

And he said that in the presence of
another Minister of Militia, who did not demur to the suggestion. It is true that this
Chamber may set its opinion against that
of the three Ministers of Militia, the present
Minister and his two predecessors, and
I do not begrudge it the right to decide.
We are here to revise, and we must apply
our own judgment to the questions that
coie before us. Yet there seems to be some
value in the opinion which I cite, of three
Minister of Militia, who feel that for the
intricate administration of the (finances
of the Department there should be a Comptroller. My hon. friend asked me two or
three nights ago if Mr. Desbarats was to
be appointed and whether or not be had
the proper qualifications. I think that he
has all the qualifications of a capable
watch-dog that will see that the money of
the country is not expended unduly and
that we get a dollar's worth for every
dollar that is spent.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, what seems to me to
be the question that we ought to decide first
is whether there is need for a Comptroller
or not. We have had before us for some
time the question whether there was need
for two deputy heads. The Government bas
-wisely, I think-come to the conclusion
that one deputy head is sufficient, and we
have so legislated as far as this measure
bas gone.
The question now is not that
of providing for any one; the question is
primarily whether or not it is necessary
to have a Comptroller with powers such as
are given to this Comptroller.
We must
exercise our own judgment, and I am going
to exercise mine, notwithstanding that a
former Minister of Militia said that in his
judgment it would be advantageous to
have a Comptroller. There is no definition
at all of the duties of this Comptroller.
The provision is as wide as the dome of
the sky. He is to be "charged with all
nancial'matters pertaining to the Department of National Defence."
Even if we
thought it best to have a Comptroller, I
do not feel inclined to favour having a
Comptroller whose duties are so undefined.
But for what will a Comptroller be useful
in that Department when it is amalgamated,
over and above what was necessary before,
in either one Department or the other?
It is not because the total expenditures
are so much greater, because, as my honourable friend bas said, other departments
that spend as much or more money get
along without comptrolers.
But just look

Defence himseilf in the other Chamber when
he asked that a Comptroller 'be appointed.
A man in the administration of this Department, who goes into it under the rule,
gets to be a man of rule and custom and
habit, and if a Comptroller were necessary
at al', it would be a .Comptroller ibrought in
from the fresh, breezy business world outside, a man who is up to modern business,
and' who, in himself, would be powerful
and strong and efficient enough to adopt
methods by which economies might be carried out and greater efficiency brought into
play.
However, at the present time I do not
think it is necessary to have the Comptroller; and, if it were, I do not think that
the Comptrollership should be established
merely to make a place for an old public
servant. We have had to dispense with old
and experienced public servants before. We
have made provision for them under the
law. It is not a good policy, nor is it one
which has been acted upon by the Governments of Canada, to make a position which
is not necessary-a position, the requirements of which, as expressed by the Minister, I do not think would be fulfilled by the
Deputy Minister of Naval Service.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I simply rise
to ask honourable gentlemen to mark that
the statement made by the right honourable gentleman from Toronto (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster) justifies to the letter my
statement that the decision to appoint a
Comptroller was not for the purpose of
giving a position to an old servant of the
State, because the Minister himself declared that he intended seeking a business
man, and would probably have to go outside of the public service to get him. It
was after the Bill had left the House of
Commons that it occurred to the Minister
that he could perhaps find within the Service one who could fill the position. The
members of this Chamber may or may not
agree with the new idea of the Minister
of appointing the late Deputy Minister
of the Naval Service to the position; and,
after reading the remarks of the members
of the Senate, the Minister may decide
to follow his first idea and go outside for a
business man.

SENATE
This section will only be adopted if the
Senate is convinced that there is need of
a Comptroller, and I will enumerate the
duties of the Comptroller so that the Senate may see what it is intended he shall
control. If it is deemed opportune to create that position, the Senate will vote for
the section; if it is not deemed opportune,
the Department cf Defence will go without that official. The duties of the Comptroller would be the co-ordinating of the
accounting of the Militia Service, the Air
Service, and the Naval Service, on the civil
side, and the pay of the civil staff of the
Department. The duties would include the
auditing of these various services, which
means a pre-audit as well as a post-audit.
They would include the co-ordinating of
the pay branches of the Militia, Air and
Naval services. There is a distinction in
all these services as between the civilian
and the military or naval.
There
are
technical points that the Comptroller will
have to solve, and he will have to see to
the rates of pay of the three services. The
duties of the Comptroller are so detailed
that the Deputy Minister of the Departnient cannot, in addition to his other duties,
supervise and administer the actual routine
of the branch. This is what has actuated
the Minister in suggesting the creation
of this new office.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is it not a fact
that there is already a financial member
of the Council who discharges all these
duties?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, there is
no such officer. There was one up to four
years ago.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I desire to
make a few observations regarding this
Bill from a point of view which as yet has
not been emphasized very strongly. The
leader of the Opposition referred to it
briefly yesterday, I think. The Civil Service Act of Canada is a piece of legislation that I think the people of the country
and the employees in the Civil Service
generally regard as fair, honest, and just.
I sec in this aid subsequent clauses of this
Bill what appears to me to bo an effort
on the part of the Government to curtail
the jurisdiction and control of the Civil
Service Commission over the appointment
and rating of Civil Servants, and to transfer
that authority to the hands of the Minister. It is because of that that I purpose
making these few remarks.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honourable gentleman intend to address himself wholly to the section under discussion?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.

to the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I desire to observe that subsection 2 of section 5, which
we are now discussing, specifically provides:
Such officers may be appointed as are neces-

sary for the carrying on of the business of the
department, all of whom shall hold office during
pleasure.
That subsection is sufficiently wide and
ample to meet all requirements, and any
officer necessary, be he Comptroller or
acting in any other capacity in carrying
on the work of the Department of National
Defence, can be appointed in the manner
now prescribed by law, namely, upon the
recommendation of the Civil Service Commission.
The reorganization of different
departments has been carried on during
the past two or three years, ard some
very substantial savings in the cost of
administration have been effected ; but in
every instance it was done after investigation and upon a recommendation submitted to the Government by the Civil
Service Commission, the body which has
been put in charge of that particular work
by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow me to ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That would not
apply to discharges and dismissals, because they would not fall under the jurisdiction of the Commission.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I beg my honourable friend's pardon. In the case of
the Printing Bureau, over 300 employees
were let out of the service.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not the
Minister have jurisdiction, exclusively of
the Commission, to dismiss any officer
whose services he did not think were any
longer necessary?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Governor
in Council might, but, so far as my recollection goes, the Government has always
relied upon that expert body of men appointed by Parliament for the purpose of
carrying on that work.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.

MAY 11, 1922
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Except in
cases of gross misconduct. The number
of employees required in that department
of the Government has been determined
upon the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My question is
whether the Minister would have the power
to do that independently of the Civil Service. Commission.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This legislation is obviously to give him that power.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is evident
that my honourable friend does not intend to answer the question.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that
is a fair answer to the question. If the
Minister of Defence or the Minister of
any other department has the power suggested, subsection 4 is wholly unnecessary,
because subsection 2 gives full authority.
In the subsequent subsections of this same
section, this tendency is much more clearly
indicated and will be referred to later on.
But I feel that there is no necessity for
retaining subsection 4 in this Bill. Subsection 2 gives ample opportunity for the
appointment through the legal and proper
channel as now arranged for under the

leave of the House, I would suggest that
my amendment be suspended, and that the
amendment moved by the honourable
gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) be moved first, because it addresses

itself to the whole section.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was accordingly withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
there is now any necessity for the amendment of the honourable gentleman from
Welland. It is simply negativing the main
motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the point
is well taken, then I ask that my amendment be revived and put.
The Hon. The CHAIRMAN: It has been
moved by Hon. Mr. Dandurand that sub-

section 4 of section 5 be amended by inserting after the word "Comptroller" the
words "with the rank of Deputy Minister
if deemed expedient."
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was negatived.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would suggest
that the leader leave the clause so that it
may be considered later on, after consultation with the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let it stand.
Subsection 4 of section 5 stands.
On subsection 5 of section 5-holder of
any position abolished may be appointed
to another position:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have an
amendment to propose:
Tha:t the words in this subsection be deleted,
from the words "Governor in Council" in the
third Une, to the end of said subsection, and
the following be substituted therefor: "to such
position in the Deipartment as shal: be prescribed, with the same rank, title and salary."

So that subsection 5 would then read:
Any person whose position is abolished on the
coming into force of this Act may on the recommendation of the Minister be appointed by the
Governor in Council, to such position in the
Department as shall be prescribed, with the
same rank, title and salary.

We must not lose sight of the fact that

the Militia Department, the Naval Department, and the Air Force are by this Act
out-and that those
abolished-wiped
officials must be reinstated into the new
department; so that the head of the department, under this section, would recommend to the Governor in Council the
reappointment of such officials as he needed
for the administration of that new department, "to such position in the department as shall be prescribed, with the same
rank, title and salary." When this classification, according to the needs of the new
department, is made and sanctioned by
Order in Council it will have to go to the
Civil Service Commission to be passed upon
and approved.
Hon. ,Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I may
not understand the honourable leader of
the Government, but it seems to me that
this amendment will force the Government
into the position of appointing in the new
department as many deputies and other
officers as now exist in all the departments
that are being consolidated; that it will
force the Government to appoint all the
officers of those three departments, with
the same rank, the same position, and the
same salary in the new department, so

202

SENATE

that we shall have treble the number that
are required in the new department. I
drafted an addition to the section which
I thought would meet the condition. My
amendment is that we add to the section
the words:
But such salary shall not exceed the salary
whidh such person received in the position
abolished.

The way the honourable leader proposes
to amend it is that the rank, title, and
position shall not be abolished. If the department is abolished it seems to me that
the rank, title and position are necessarily abolished, but with my proposed addition to the section, while a man may be
put into the new departasent with such
rank, title and position as the Government
may desire, his salary cannot exceed the
amount he now receives. If the amendment as proposed by the leader of the
Government is adopted, we shall have three
deputies in the new department if there
are now three deputies in the three departments, because his amendment says
each shall have the rank, title and position
which he now bas. I submit, with respect,
that this will be the result, but it is not
the one which the Government intends.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend may not have taken note of the
amendment to subsection 5, which begins
with the words:
Any person whose position is abolished on
the coming into force of this Act-

-that is, all the officials -of those departments. Then I would draw attention to
section 6, which reads:
The Governor in Council may make such
orders and regulations as arc deemed necessary or advisable for the pro.per and efficient
administration and organization of the Departient.

I take that to mean that under the law
the Civil Service Commission will have
passed on that classification. The safeguard
which is found in the amendment I am
making is that in the positions which will
be created by the reorganization the old
officials shall have the sane rank, title
and salary as they had in their previous
employmaent.
Hon. Mr. LYNCI-STAUNTON:
But
will the honourable leader explain why it
is necessary to prescribe that they must be
given the same rank, title and position? I
shouid think it would bc better to say,
"with such rank as now, but the salary
iay not be increased."
In addition to
msaking it mandatory that the sane rank,

title and position should be maintained,
the Government or the Minister should be
able to define the rank and title, and not
continue the sanse one if he does not so
desire. It seems to me that the section
is worded all right now, if we only provided
that the salaries should not be increased.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I take it that
those words are put there so that the
Minister may not give a higher rank or
higher salary to the officer.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
we should aniend it so that he could not
msake the salary higher.
lon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does not my honourable friend think that this section covers
that now?
lon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No; I
think the section is proper as it stands
if we provide that the salary shall iot be
increased.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think that is
the inevitable meaning of it as it stands.
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But suppose the office should not command the salary, what then? It should not be mandatory that the sane salary would be paid.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Let me give the
louse an illustration. I find on looking
over the Estimates that the Naval Service
Department bas a Departmental Accountant of Grade 6, which is the highest class
of accountant in the service, drawing a
salary of $4,500. The Militia Department
has an accountant of the sane class at
present. Now, this amalgamation is going
to take place, and vhereas in every other
Departient there is oniy ane accountant
of that class drawing a saiary aI $4,500, it
is now proposed that thaso twa gentlmn
shall be continued in tUe new dopartient
n the same position, vith the sane rank,
and the
salary.
oafne
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: Where does
msy honourable friend sec that it is proposed that that should be done?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: By the amendment, as I understand it. It reads in this
way:
Any person whose position is abolished on the
comirg into force of this Act may-

It is true it says "may"ma:son the recoensondation of the Minister
be appointed by the Governor in Council to
such position in the departnment as shall be
prescribed, with the same rank, etc.

Now, it seems to me that as soon as the
Act comes into force the positions of all

MAY 11, 1922
those officers are abolished; and then it is
proposed that every one of those officers
in the two departments should immediately
be appointed to the same position with the
saine rank and at the same salary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely it is
not ail those officiais. A certain number
will have to be retired.
Hoqp. Mr. CALDER: Yes, that goes to
the very heart of the section, and that is
why I think that in its present forrn it
should be amended. During the course
of the last three or four years we have
had very considerable reorganization in
several of our departments. Did the Government at any time step in and control
those reorganizations and decide who
should fill this position and that position,
and what rank they should have, and what
should be their salaries? Not at ail. We
neyer did it in any one case: that matter
was left entîrely to the Civil Service Commission, and I think that should be done
in this case. If there are going to be
changes in their positions, their salaries
and ranks, and everything of that kind,
I thînk the Government would be well advised not to take that responsibility on
itself. That matter should be left to be
very carefully reviewed by the Civil Service Commission before the Government's
or the minister's recoiimendations are put
in force. If the matter is left entirely in
the hands of the Government and the minister to make the report to the Governor
in Council, I dlaim that it is absolutely contrary to the sipirit of the Civil Service
Act. It seems to me the Government
would be well advised not to undertake
that authority at the present time, because,
whether rightly or wrongly, the Parliament of Canada has adopted a measure of
civil service reforni. We niay not al
agree with it, but it is there, and if we
are going to attàck it or abolish it or
amend it, let us do it directly, with our
eyes open, and know what we are doing,
and let us not select any one department
in the service and begin to get in the thin
edge of the wedge so far as that department is concerned. That is the stand I
take, and I think it is the proper stand.
If the Civil Service Act is to be amended,
if we are to go back to the old snethod of
patronage, if there is to be favouritismI arn not saying there is going to be
favouritism at all-but if there is to be
favouritism or patronage, let us know
exactly what we are dî>ing. That is my

view. and I doubt very much the advisability of allowing this section to go
through in its present form.
Hon. Mr. ýGRIESBACH: Might I ask
the leader of the Government how many
employes there are in the Naval Department at Ottawa?
I ar n lHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
formed there are about 135 civilians in
the naval branch.
Hon. Mr. REID: If this clause is passed
in its present form, I would ask the leader
of the Government if it would not be possible for the Governor in Council to make
an appointment of a Deputy Minister. For
instance, this section states:
Any person whose position is abolished on
the comning into force of this Act-

The present Deputy Minister's position
will be abolished-may on the recornrendation of the Minister
be appointed by the Governor in Council to such
poslition in the Department, and with such rank.
titie and salary as shall be prescribed.

Does that clause flot g-ive the Governor
in Council power to appoint any one of the
officers to the same position and rank as
he now has in the Naval Department? If
so, of course I object to it strongly. In
fact, it is simply taking out of the hands
of the Civil Service Commission ahl appointments in the Naval Service, because
those dismissed or whose positions are abolished can be told, "Now, in the very next
position there is we will appoint you; you
will not have to go to the Civil Service
Commission at ail." I object to any section which takes ar, appointment from the
Civil Service Commission unless, as bas
been stated by the honourable member, it
is shown that it is really intended to go
back to patronage.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In order that we
may keep our discussion to the point under
consideration, I would suggest this amendment:
That subsection 5 of section 5 be struck out
and the fol'iow'ing be substituted !In place
thereof:
Any person whose position is abolished after
the comning into force of this Act may be
transferred or appointed by the Governor in
Counci-1 to such position in the public service-

-either in this department or any other
department, because if there is to, be an
amalgamation and a reduction in staffs,
I think an opportunity should be given to
the officiais displaced to get into some other
department of the public service-

SENATE
-to such position in the public service and with
such classification and salary as may be recommended by the Civil Service Commission.
My experience during the last two or
three years, in the reorganization of departments, goes to show very clearly that
nothing need be feared, in so far as the
Civil Service Commission is concerned, in
that respect. They have a very difficult
task on their hands, and they approach it
with the greatest sympathy. They have a
desire to do the right thing by the staffs
and by the departments, and J think the
Government will act wisely if it follows
the course suggested by this amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would suggest, instead of the words "after the coming into
force," that it should read "on or after
the coming into force."
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Cannot they do
that now, without this amendment?
Hon. Mr. CALDER- I doubt very much
if they can do it in the case of an extensive reorganization.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to
the weakness of that amendment in the
fact that it does not purport to reorganize
or organize the Department of Defence
which is now being created by this Act.
My honourable friend speaks of appointnient under the Civil Service Commission.
I have no objection to that part of his
amendment which gives that power of appointment, but the amendment does not
clinch the question of organization of the
Department of Defence.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As a matter of fact
that organization raay not take place in a
day. The section as it now stands, without
the amendment, says that on the abolition
of those positions the Governor in Council
may reappoint all those people to certain
positions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Not all.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Well, we will say
the great majority. That is not reorganizing the department. You cannot reorganize a department such as this overnight.
The reorganization will take weeks unless
they have it ready; and, if they have it
ready, all they have to do is to walk over
to the Civil Service Commission, discuss
their plans, and have them approved.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
where is the authority to do it?
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Authority for what?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Unless
that section, or some modification of it, is
passed, where is the authority to constitute
the department and appoint the officials?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not only that,
but the amendment which is now proposed
does not add anything at all to the powers
of the Commission. All that is provided in
my honourable friend's amendment can
now be done, as has been pointed out by
the honourable gentleman opposite. There
is no need of that amendment at all; it
adds nothing to the law, for the Commission can transfer or appoint officers anywhere in the public service independently
of this amendent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
No;
they are put in motion by the action of the
Governor in Council or by the Minister.
The purpose which we have in view can
be accomplished by the Minister or the
Governor in Council requisitioning the
Commission to carry out the instructions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But why cannot the Governor in Council do that independently of anything we say in the
matter? The Civil Service Commission has
to-day the power to appoint at the request
of any Deputy Minister.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
But
the objectionable feature of subsection 5
is that the authority of the Civil Service
Commission is superseded by that of the
Ministerlon. Mr. BELCOURT:
derstand that.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIEED:--and it
was never intended that it should be.
lon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be. J

lon. Sir JAMES LOUGIEED: That is
whbat I understood my honourable friend to
refer to.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I am discussing the amendment inoved by the honourable gentleman (lon. Mr. Calder).
lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If that
will not fully meet the purpose of the Goverunment, that purpose can be fully met by
striking out the vord "Minister" and inserting the words "Civil Service Commission."

lon. Mr. BELCOURT:
But

I can quite understand that

the point raised by m

hionourable friend

205

MAY 11, 1922
is open to a good deal of discussion, but
the only point I am trying to make is that
does not add anything to the situation. The
Civil Service Commission has all those
powers to-day.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, no; the Civil
Service Commission has not to-day the
powerTo
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
organize a department.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: To undertake the
organization of any department.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I did not say
that it had; I said that the Civil Service
Commission, at the request of a Minister,
had power to consider the qualifications
of applicants for any position which the
Minister wishes to fill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But that is in the
case of new officers.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the case
-with either new or old. It does not necessarily apply only to applicants who are old
officers, or only to new applicants: it apnlies to all.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But let me give my
honourable friend an example in the case
of the amalgamation of two departments.
Take the Inland Revenue Department and
the Customs. When the Government decided to amalgamate those two departments,
they had to be dovetailed into each other,
and many officials had to go; others had to
have their positions changed; and in many
cases salaries were increased.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is the same
here.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The Civil Service
Commission has no power to undertake
that work unless it has first received instructions from the Government to do so.
In this case it is not proposed that the
Government give the Civil Service Commission authority to undertake the work.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not the
point at all.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is proposed to
leave the matter entirely in the hands of
the Minister, who is to report to the
Governor in Council, who will in turn
carry out whatever decision is made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not my
point at all. It is my own fault that I
cannot make myself understood. I quite
understand that the work of reorganization,
the abolition of a department or the crea-

tion of a new department, is not within the
jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commissiion., When Parliament authorizes the
amalgamation now proposed, the Minister,
if he does not need certain employees,
will discharge them without any reference
at all to the Commission. If he needs new
officials, or if he wants to transfer old
officials to new positions, he will submit
to the Civil Service Commission the question
of each applicant's qualifications, whether
the applicant is a new one or is already
in the service. What I mean to say is that
my honourable friend, by his amendment,
does not propose anything that does not now
exist.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Of course, I do not
agree with my honourable friend. I think
he is putting upon this clause a construction that is not correct. There is nothing
in subsection 5 as it stands, nor is there
anything in the present Civil Service Act,
as I understand it, that would require the
Minister to make any reference whatever
to the Civil Service Commission in connection with changes in the department, because in subsection 5 originally printed
it is stated very clearly and explicitly
that this matter is in the hands of the
Minister and the Governor in Council.
Hon. 'Mr. BELCOURT:
pute that for one moment.

I do not dis-

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Then we are talking at cross purposes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I would like to have the benefit of the legal
opinion in this House on a question that
puzzles me. It is said that in some cases
"may" means "shall" and in some cases
it does not. What does it mean in this
subsection:
Any person whose position is abolished on
the coming Into force of this Act may on the
recommendadion of the Minister be appointed.. .
But it does not say that he shall get
the place. Is the old saying right in this
case, that "may" means "shall"?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

No, no.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
-and must the Minister recommend every
one of the 135?Oh, no. In
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this case the word "may" means "may" and
not "shall".
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then I want to make that point clear.

SENATE
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
intended that he shall.

It

is

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I interrupt
my right honourable friend?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Order.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my right honourable friend is willing, I do not see why
other honourable gentlemen cry "Order".
The answer to my right honourable friend's
question is that when you are dealing with
the Crown you never use the word "shall";
you always use the word "may".
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It means the
same thing.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then I have to go behind that. I have in
point the answer made by the honourable
leader of the Government. In the case of
135 men or women now in the employ of
the Naval Service, their positions will all
be abolished. There is your Minister of
Defence up against 135 persons who have
been in steady employment for a number of
years, more or less, and are now absolutely
out of the serivce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And far more
than that number; the Militia Department
besides.
Right Hon Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It is within the option of that Minister to
look over those 135 persons and say, "I
will take twenty of you and recommend
your appointment, but I will not recommend the other 115". Is that what the effect
of this clause will be? If it is, it is most
unfair for the Government to take such a
position, and is most unjust to the 135
employees, or to the 115 who will not be
chosen. That is giving the patronage absolutely into the hands of the Minister.
He can say to Jones: "I do not want you
in there: I have my own reasons: I will
not recommend you for the title, place, and
salary that you have at present." He may
go through that whole staff of 135 and
eliminate all or most of them, and then he
may on his own recommendation appoint
135 others without reference to the Civil
Service Law or Commission.
I say that
that is not fair to the employees.
Surely
no Government, with the legislation which
is at present on the statute book-legislation which has been supported by themselves, in the other House and in this--will
make so serious a breach in the Civil Service regime.
Hon Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
the honourable leader should have these
sections revised.
Sir GEORGE

FOSTER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend is quite correct when ho says
that there will be 135 officials or employees
from whom the Minister will have to
choose. Indeed, there will be far more. That
number represents only the Naval service,
but the whole Militia service and the Air
service are also abolished by the abolition
of these departments. A certain number of
persons will have to be retired. The Bill
provides the means whereby they are to be
retired. When this Bill has been sanctioned
those services will form a single department, but it will have to be manned by a
staff ready to continue the work.
There
must be no gap; there must be continuity.
Those departments when formed into one
will be but an empty shell if some power is
not given to the Minister to prepare for
the coming into force of the Act by arranging for the manning of the new department
comprising these three services. How is it
to be done? The Minister will prepare a
list of members of the new staff, composed
of old employees, and will submit it for
approval to the Governor in Council.
I
surmise that there will have to be a reclassification made immediately by the
Civil Service Commission. But the machinery will be set in motion by the Minister
himself, who will state what are his needs
and will present his scheme of organization,
upon which the Civil Service Commission
will have to act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend answer me this question?
Wherein under clause 5 as at present
framed will the authority of the Civil Service Commission be invoked in any way?
Is the matter not absolutely under the
authority of the Minister and the Governor
in Council? Is it not intended to supersede
absolutely the Civil Service Commission?
I would point out to my honourable friend
that the Civil Service Act already makes
provision as to what shall be done upon the
abolition of an office.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it is a department.

In this case

(read-

An employee holding a permanent position

Now, may I ask, why should discrimination be exercised in favour of this reorganization or amalgamation?
It was

Inland Revenue and Customs Departments.
Why not follow the course that was pursued in the case of those reorganizations?

it entirely under the Minister?

understand this subsection aright, I agree
with the honourable gentleman from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid). It provides:
Any person whose position is abolished on the
coming into force of this Act may-

Though not a legal man, I may say to
the right honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
that I interpret the word "may" in this case
as meaning "shall"the recommendation of the Minister be
-on
appointed by the Governor In Council to such
position in the Department, and with such rank,
ti-tle and salary as shall be prescribed.

I take that to mean such as shall be prescribed by the Minister and the Governor
in Council.
It has been stated in the debate, as I
understand it, that we are going to do away
with the office of Deputy Minister of Naval
Service. On the other hand, if I read this
clause correctly, the Minister, through the
Governor in Council, may if he sees fit appoint the Deputy Minister whose office
has been abolished to a position with th?
same rank, the same title, and the same
salary that he had when be was Deputy
Minister of a department. I do not see
that this cannot be done.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHJSTAUNTON: Of
course it can. Will the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), while he
is answering the twenty questions that he
has already been asked, tell us what is
covered by this subsection that is not covered by subsections 1, 2 and 3?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: While the honourable leader of the Government is looking up the information to answer those
questions, I would like to make an observation which, it seems to me, is fundamental. I understand now, from remarks
made a while ago by the honourable leader
of the Government, that he regards the
coming into force of this new Act as automatically making vacant all the positions
now held by employees of those three
e

207

branches of the service. If that is to be
the situation, could it not be readily cured
by giving this Bill another title, calling it
the Department of Militia and Defence Act,
if you like, and letting that Department absorb the Naval Service, just as the Interiâr
Department has absorbed the Immigration
within the last few months without any
legislation and without upsetting and disorganizing the Civil Service and disturbing

zation could be carried out after investigation as to what changes could be made
Surely the
in the interest of economy.
Government, for the sake of calling the
new department the Department of National Defence, is not going to deprive of
their positions over a thousand employees
now engaged in those three branches of
the service. It seems to me that the sensible thing to do is to continue the name
of the Department of Militia and Defence
and to absorb the other services into it.
If the thousand employees now engaged
in those three branches of the public
service which it is proposed to amalgamate
are declared. to be automatically out of
the service when the Act comes into force,
and if the Governor in Council, on the
recommendation of the Minister, has the
only say as to who shall be the employees
engaged in the department, then I agree
absolutely with my right honourable friend
from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) that it is unjust to the employees;
indeed, it is an act to which I should not
have thought any Government, in the face
of the Civil Service law now on our statute
book, would resort.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would suggest,
now that the House has the amendment
of the honourable member from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Calder), that subsection 5
be allowed to stand.
Hon. Mr. REID: If the honourable leader
of the Government is going to alllow the

employ him without an Act specifying that
if his position were abolished and he were
re-emp'loyed, be would then come under the

SENATE
Superannuation Act in the same way that
he had been for so many years.
I do not
know whether there is anything in that,
but I think it is worthy of consideration
before letting the clause go through.
In
the Civil Service Act, which I have before
me, I see that the Civil Service Commission
have power, after consudting the Deputy
Head, to re-organize a department.
For
instance, subsections 2 and' 3 of section 9
read:
1. If, after such approval, the deputy head or
the Commission is of opinion 'that any such plan
or organization might with advantage be in any
way changeld, the Commission shall in a similar
manner prepare a report upon such proposed
change, and shall submit the same for the
approval of the Governor in Council. No change
shall be made in the organization of any department until it has been so reported upon by
the said Commission.
2. As soon as any plan of organization is confirmed by the Governor in Council, the deputy
head, shal:, subject to the approval of the
Commission, forthwith cause the officers, clerks
and employees affected thereby to be reclassifled for the purpose of placing each officer,
clerk and employee in a proper place under such
plan of organization.

I would suggest that this reorganization
be put through under the Civil Service Commission

in that way, and then no official

will be dismissed unless his services are
not further required.
He would be reolassified.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is that?

What section

Hon. Mr. REID: Subsection 2 of section
9 of the Civil Service Act of 1918.
In
that way you would not affect officers who
have been occupying permanent positions
for many years.
Amalgamations have
taken place before, as has been said by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster), and I see no
reason why this amalgamation should not
be put through in this way. I fear that
there may be something in what the honourable gentleman from Toronto has said,
that if we pass this Bill with the amendment, not only the Minister, but others,
will be in trouble because it would simply
be going back to the patronage system which
we have all been desirous of getting rid
of.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think it advisable that we shouild have a little more
time to consider this section.
But there is
one other point which as been raised by
the leader of the Opposition (Hon. Sir
James Lougheed).
The Bill as it stands
contemplates the Act being brought into
force immediately.
Immediatelly the Act
Hon. Mr. REID.

is brought into force, are all the positions
in both these Departments to cease te exist?
That is the difficulty, apparently, which this
clause is intended to overcome.
It seems
to me that time must be allowed so that
those in charge of carrying out the reorganization may be in a position to do so;
and, if the Civil Service Commission are to
take any part in it, they certainly should
be allowed sufficient time to make the necessary examination. There should be another section added to the effect that the
Act will come into force on a certain
date in the future in order to give time for
the making of the necessary examination. It
seems to me that the reorganization is going
to take some time, and should be subject to
the revisilon of the Civil Service Commission.
Subsection 5 of section 5 stands.
On subsection 6 of section 5-provision
for retirement, superannuation, etc.:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Why
should any person under this section be
treated better than any other official who
is retired?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why do
you not leave him to the law as it is now
on the statute book?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is the question that I raised the other day.
As I
understand the law-I may be mistaken
-this
provision is contrary to the provisions of the law, in so far as those provisions are applicable to civil servants in
every other department of the public service. If that is true, then I doubt very
much if we should make an exception of
these departments. What is proposed? It
is proposed that if, for reasons of necessity-because no work exists, or from some
other cause-an official is retired, the Governor in Council may add one or two years
to that man's service in order to secure for
him a higher gratuity or superannuation
or retiring allowance than other officials
would get.
There have been a number
of retirements during the course of the
last two or three years in practically every
department.
Some of those retirements
were made simply because positions were
abolished. But we never thought that we
should add one or two years to the periods
of service of the persons retiring, contrary to the provisions of the general law
applicable to all civil servants.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
setting a precedent.

It

is

MAY 11, 1922
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The same treatment
will immediately be demanded by every
civil servant in the employ of the Government-even by those who have previously
been retired.
There is one other word here of which
I do flot quite understand the purport, and
that is the word "pension." The section
says:
The Governor in Council may *grant him
a gratuity, retiring or superannuatâon aliowance or pension.

Surelv we are flot dealing with persons
who are being retired from the permanent
military force, because, if so, there is a
law governing their cases, and we should
flot undertake to add one or two years to
their service in order that they may get a
hîgher pension than they would under the
Military Pensions Act, because that would
be very unfair to those who have been
pensioned in the past. If any of these
officiais are on the permanent military
staff, they should get such pensions as are
provided for under the Military Pensions
Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This section
says: "If he had been retired under the
provisions of any Act applicable to him."
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But power is taken
in addition to that to add two years' service.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is another
point.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is what is proposed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will honourable gentlemen permit me to give the explanation whîch I should have given of
this subsection 6 of section 5:
iSubsection 6 of Section 5 of the National
Defence Act is intended to cover the following
situations. Owing to the reduction of the present
strength of the Permanent Force, as Is reflected in the Estimiates, it Will be necessary to
discharge or retire somýe 500 members thereof,
consîsting of officers, non-commilss.ioned officers
ani men, the majority cf whom have served
overseas, and who have had from 7 to 9 years'
service In the Permanent Active Milàtia which
can count for purposes of pension.
The
reorganization
under
the

the Act requires.
.Non-oommissioned Officers and men of the
Permanent Force are enlisted for a period of
3 years but, although the person so en-listed is
bound to serve for that period, if required, the
Crown can dispense with his services at any

time.

Nevertheless, however, It bas always

been regarded froin time immemorial that there
Is a moral obligation on the part cf the Crown
and a reasonable exipectation on the part of the
Non-commissioned officer or man that bis services wiUl not be dispensed with before the expiration of bis engagement, uniess on account cf
miscondutt on the part cf the man, or diminution cf the Vote under which such man can be

In the case cf officers, pier te the amendment cf the Militia Pension Act of 1919, the
minimum period of service required was 20
years, and officers cf the Permanent Ferce who
joined p)rier te thalt date had a reasonable expectation te believe that their services would

The intention, therefore, of subsection 6 of

of service o~f these officers, non-cemmissiened
oficers and men w'hose service in the Permanent

as set forth above, that their services would.be
retained for that Iength cf time.
It should be peinted out In this connection

that, se far as officers and warrant officers are
concerned, deductions tewards maklng gocd

of service in the Civil Service a number of

years as provided for in Subsection 6.
The provisions of Subsection 6 of Section 5
will, therefore, enable those persons who lack
not more than 2 years of the service which the
Calder Act requires for retirement on a retiring
allowance to have sufficient service up to 2
years added to their actual term of service
and be retired under the Calder Act before its
expiration.
It should be observed that provision somewhat similar to ,Subsection 6 of Section 5 of
the National Defence Act is contained in Section 15 of the Civil Service Superannuation and
Retirement Act, Chapter 17, of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906. In this latter section
provision is made whereby any person to whom
the Act applies and who is removed from office
in consequence of the abolition thereof, or is
retired to promote efficiency or economy in the
Service, can have 10 years added by the Governor in Council to his actual term of service,
whereas in the subsection referred to in the
National Defence Act the Governor in Council
can only add from 1 to 2 years.

The honourable gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Calder), who bas just been
criticising and asking explanations of this
subsection, will have time to examine the
situation which will be created under this
Act in regard to men who are a few
months short of being entitled to their
pensions, because I will ask that the subsection stand, and he will be able to decide
whether or not in his judigment some
leeway should be given to the Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before
we take up the reconsideration of this Bill,
will my honourable friend be good enough
to furnish us with some information touching the pension fund which will be drawn
upon in the event of these civil servants and
members of the Militia taking advantage
thereof. We have in Canada several pension funds; we have the Militia Pensi-n
Fund, the pension fund in connection with
the Mounted Police, the old Superannuation Fund, and possibly one or two others.
There seems to be a general impression
that there is a uniformity as to these funds
-that they are built upon practically the
same basis; there is also an impression
that the Militia Pension Fund is self-sustaining. If we are entering upon an obligation, as bas just been intimated by my
honourable friend, to pension 500 members
of the permanent force, we are imposing
a very large burden upon the people of
Canada.
There is another matter in this connection to which I should like to direct attention, and upon which I should like to
have full information when the subject
comes up again. The Militia Pension Fund
is not a self-sustaining fund. The Government of Canada is contributing every
year amazingly large sums to meet the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

deficits of that fund. We are pensioning
officers of the Militia who are in the prime
of life, and who contribute very little to
the fund in question. Honourable gentlemen should give some consideration to the
immense obligations assumed by the Government of Canada in connection with this
fund. In the year 1919-20 the contributions to the fund amounted to $47,979, and
the expenditures to $228,534, leaving $180,555 to be contributed by the Government
of Canada to make good the deficit. In
the year 1920-21 the revenue of the fund
was $139,385 and the expenditure $406,907,
leaving a deficit of $267,522. This means
that for the financial year of 1919-20 the
Government of Canada contributed to the
fund approximately $4 to every $1 contributed by the beneficiaries of the fund,
and that for the year 1920-21 the contributions of the Government, in making good
the deficit, exceeded the other contributions to the fund by more than 200 per cent.
If the fund is to be maintained on that
basis, and the Government of Canada is
to pension members of the Militia force
by the hundred, as my honourable friend
has intimated, a reconsideration of the
basis upon which this fund is built up will
be necessary. I venture to say that the
other pension funds of the Dominion are
based upon an entirely different system,
and it is desirable that there should be
uniformity in regard to these pensions.
There is no reason why the civil servants
should not have the same advantage in
their pensions as the members of the
Militia Department. How it happens that
there is this great discrepancy, and why
public attention has not been called to it,
may be difficult to understand; but it seems
to me the time is opportune for this Chamber to give some consideration to it, with
a view to recasting the whole question of
superannuation and pension funds. When
my honourable friend comes before us
again to-morrow, possibly with explanations and information touching this section, I am sure the House will be very
much interested to have some further particulars regarding pensions.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like the leader
of the Government to bring down a little
further information. First, as I understand the section, the object of adding the
two years is to bring those members of the
permanent force up to the ten years, in
order that they may get the ten years'
I understood my honsuperannuation.
ourable friend to say that a number of

MAY 11, 1922
men overseas had served within one or two
years of the total service, and that this
clau se was added in order to provide for
them. I would lilce to ask the honourable
leader of the Government to, let the House
know the position of a man who has served
overseas for seven years and eleven
months. In other words, would a nman who,
had served eight years have two years
added to his service and get a superannuation for if e, while another man who
had gone overseas a month or two months
later and had served seven years and
eleven months would have no provision
made for him? If so, there might be a
large number of men who, had served overseas and were within a month or two of
the eight years, but who would get
nothing, while the other men would get
two years added to their pensions. Thus
there might be injustice done, as many of
our good young nmen who served overseas
were .perhaps entitled to more consideration for their services over there, on account of being wounded, or something of
that kind, than those who served the full
eight years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I fully realize
that th-is is but an ar<bitrary figure.
The
Minister had first proposed three years, in
hie BiH whith was despatched to us, but it
lost one year on the way, and we have no~w
two years.
Hon. Mr. REID: Even if it were three
years there might be an injustice done to
some men. 1 would like to know also if a
man who had neyer served overseas at all,
but who had been appointedl here and spent
e'ight years in the service, would have two
years added, and could receive a pension
for life, while another man who had served
overseas for seven years and eleven month8
wouid get notliing at ail.
I would also
like to ask whether, even were this section
flot passed at ail, ail these men wouad flot
corne under the Calder Act, in which case
every man-, whether he had served one year
or eight or ten years, would receive the same
treatment as has been given those who
have been retired since the Calder Act was
passed, within the Iast two or three years?
That Act will not empire until the middle
of July.
0f course, ail those men who
corne under the Calder Act cou¶d be pensioneýd or receive a gratuity, and be provided for in the way that Parliament has
deided would be .fair and just to ail concerned.
It is a1together likely that Parliai

S-141

211

as under that Att; but in case Parliament
should not have risen by the tume the Calder Act expires, might I ask the honourable
leader of the Governnient te let us know if
it is the intention of the Governqment to extend the Calder Act fo-r another year or untii a proper Superannuation Act could be
brought into force?
'If so, and il these
officiais would corne under the Cailder Act,
there should be no anxiety as to ail of tihem
receiving at ileast the -sanie fair consideration as was given to those who have been
retired during the last few ye.ars.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I understand this
is to stand over, there are two points I
wouLld like to, have consiidered. - In the
first place, this section niakes an exception of officiaIs in the Militia Departmient
who retire under what is called the Calder
Act, or the Retirement Act.
I think that
is bad. It will cause trouble in every
department of the public service.
if
it is thought advisable to reduce the nuniber of years a mian should bu in the service
in order to get a retiring allowance, let
us (pass a general act, but not make special
provision for offiéials in a certain deipartment.
My second point is this. I think
honourable gentlemen of the Senate should
consider very carefully before this section
is passedHon. Mr. TANNER: In that connection
niy honourable friend might be able to
tell the House whether it is not a fact that
a number of officiaIs in the Customis and
Inland Revenue Departments who were
retired under the Calder Act needed relatively only a few nionths of the maximum
in order to go out at maturity?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Undoubtedly.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Then tho-se officials
who corne in under this proposed iaw, and
have a year or two added to their terni,
would have a distinct advantage over the
people who have been retired.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Undoubtedly there
have been cases of that kind', where perrons
have ýbeen retired fromn the public service
who had not put in the year-s required by
the Act, and consequently they received no
retiring allowance at all.
Now, if you
make special provision for civil servants in
the Militia Department and the Naval Service Department, and add years of service
to their actual tume of service in order that
they niay draw the allowance, every
one of those civil servants who have
retired without such allo'wance wiii lie immed'iately upon the backs of the Go'vernment.

DANISH EXPEDITION IN CANADIAN
TERRITORY
Hon. Mr. BRADEBURY inquired:
1. Is the Government aware that, according
to the Danish press, a Danish expedition under Knud Rasmussam is wîntering at Lyon
Iniet, Melville Penînsula, in Canadian territory?
2. Wiil the Government take steps to ascertain from the Danish Government, through the
proper channeis, the object of the proposed
expedition?
3. Is the Covernment aware that the leader
of this expedition Is giving Danish names to
points within Canadian territory?
4. Will the Government make representations,
through the usual official channeàs, that the
naming of points within Canadian territory is
solely the prerogative of the Geographie Board
of Canada as representing the Dominion Government?

Hon. Mr. DAN4DURAND: I may state
that 1 was promised a document which,
appare -ntly, was forwarded to this Chamiber some two or three weeks ago, but basý
not yet reached me. I have not therefore
the text of the answer; but the Minister
of the Interior has infornmed me that the
Danish Government, with the authorization
of the Canadian Government, has sent an
expedition to the North for sci.entîfic purposes solely, and that the Canadian Government is organizing an expedition for
this summer for the purpose of establishing
posts. The Canadian Government is not
informed that the scientific expedition is
giving namnes to any of our islands in the
North.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In this connection I -should like to read a short letter
which appeared in yesterday morning's

everything necessary (they have thus seventy

The purpose is principally the study of the
dittle known Eskimos in that region, botch living
and extinct ; and also a tracing of the route
followed by the Eskimos migrating from Baffin
Land and the islands west and north of it, to
Greenland. The last of these migrations took
place in the 19th century, and a scientific investigation over the route followed should throw
considerable light upon the much debated question : where did the Greenland Eskimos come
from originally, and when did they come? Investigations have shown that besides the Eskimos living at present along the west side and
at Augmasalik on the east side, the whole north
-and
east--coast of Greenland bas once been
populated by Eskimos.
Incidentally the expedition will survey the
unknown west coast and interior of Baffin

CANCELLATION OF LEASES
DOMINION LANDS BILL

OF

FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND presented Bill
Y2, an Act respecting notices of cancellation of leases of Dominion Lands.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, for a
number of years the Department of the
Interior has been governed by regulations of
the Department in cancelling leases when
the conditions had not been complied with.
A recent judgment of the Privy Council has
declared that the form used is teohnically
erroneous, and this Bill is for the purpose
of curing that defect, and to place the stamp
of orthodoxy on the procedure followed.
The Bill was read the first time.
JUDGES BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 19, an
Act to amend the Judges Act.
Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Hon. G. H. BARNARD: Honourable gentlemen, before the preamble passes I wish
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY.

to move as an amendment the addition of a
section.
This amendment arises out of the
unanimity of opinion which was expressed
by three prominent members of the Bar
from three different provinces the other day
when the Bill was up forr second reading,
the opinion expressed being that some control should be exercised over judges who
have become incapacitated through infirmity
or iil health and who still persist in retaining their position and drawing a salary.
The section that I propose as an amendment reads as follows:
2. The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice that any
judge bas by reason of his age or infirmities
become unable to properly perform his duties
and upon three months' notice does not retire,
may order that the sadary of such judge shall
be reduced to one dollar a year from a date to
be named, and thereafter such judge shall until
be retires be paid no more than that amount,
but on his so retiring, he shall be entitled to the
retiring allowance which would have been paid
to him had he retired immediately before such
order was made.

That, I may say, is along the line suggested
by the honourable leader of the Government, and I think it is a very salutary provision.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I object to the adoption of this at the present time, without
hearing what it is, or knowing what it is;
and I doubt that there are ten persons in
this Chamber who know what it is. How
can we vote upon anything in this manner?
I think that any legislation or amendment
affectin-g the judges is very important.
There are two sides to the question.
On
the one hand, we must keep our Bench as
independent as possible from political influence.
On the other hand, there should be
if possible some method which would prevent incapacitated judges from remaining
upon the Bench to the detriment of the publie interest.
I think it wouid be better
if the Government looks upon this amendment favourably, to let it be printed in
order that we may all have a chance to
digest it before voting upon it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that
my first impression was that this proposed
legislation should rather be embodied in a
separate Bill to amend the Judges Act, because it would then be taken up with more
solemnity and would attract the attention
of all members of this Chamber and would
receive due consideration.
The right honourable gentleman's (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster's) point is well taken, that some

Now, I can prove to this honourable
House that, far from having cheaper rates
if the transportation were dop'e by ocean
vessels, even without breaking bulk, it
would be much dearer than it is to-day.

Now, how could an ocean vessel compete
with one on the lakes when the cost of an
ocean vessel, according to experts, is three
tumes as great per ton 'as that of lake carriers of the saine dispiacement?
But that
is flot all; for, with the saine dispiacement,
an ocean-going vessel would f ake only sixty
per cent of the cargo that a lake carrier
would carry.
Displacement means, of
course, the number of tons of water that
are displaced by the weight of the ship, and
the difference between when the ship is
light and when she is loaded is the dead
tons weight.
This is deoeiving, as there
are so rnany different tonnages. There is
the tonnage of the war vessel, for instance,
whi'ch Vakes no consideration of the quanttity of coal that may be in the bunkers or
the quantity of fresh water that may be
carried on long voyages, etc. So when you
speak of the tonnage of a war vessel, and
it looks very large, it is the displacement,
because it is the weight of 'the vessel itself
in.cluded with aIl that is in it, 'whilst thse
dead-weight of the tonnage is simply 'what
the vessel will carry: it is the different displacement of a vessel when she is light as
compared with when she is loaded. But we
have al'ways considered the tonnage not
as a question of weight, but have always
figured on gross and net tonnage.
That is
the ineasure of capacity, not of weight, and
it means that forty cubic feet per ton
gives the gross tonnage of a ship; s0 that
ufter you have taken the rneasurement
of the ship, you can, by using the necessary
ca-efficient, get its gross tonnage. The net
tonnage is what ýshe will carry in paying
cargo after taking off the space occupied by
the bunkers the boilers and engines, etc.
0f late years we have heard very much,
e'specially since we have had our Canadian
Mliirchant Marine, in which we have aIl been
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

interested, about a ship having so many
tons dead weight.
The difference in construction is s0 great that when a lake
carrier would make, say, five per cent, an
ocean-carrier working with the.sanie displacement, under the same rules and conditions, wýould make only one per cent.
In
order that 1 miay not 'be.mistaken, here is
another document issued by the Legisiature of the State of New York, Document
No. 40, froni which I would read just six
lines:
The cost off the construction off ocean-going
vessels is three-ffold the cost off the construction
off lake carriers off like dispiacement, and their
carrying capacity is about sixty per cent off the
carrying capacity off lake vessels, so that the
ratio of earnings per dollar invested in ocean
vessels is only about one-flffth off the earnings off
each dollar invested in lake vessels.
This is
exclusive off higher insurance on ocean vossels and other larger nperating oxpenses. which
would still ffurther reduce the returns from
cargnes off ocean ve:ssels while attempting to
compete with lake carriers in Great Lakes commerce.

This means that a lake company buying
vessels could get three vessels of a certain
tonnage for what an ocean company would
have to pay for one ocean vessel of the
sane tonnage, and the ocean vessel would
only carry two-thirds of the cargo
of any oneO of the three lake vessels. How
long would the competition between lake and
ocean vessels last? It would not last any
tume, as I will show you, as 1 have taken
the trouble to consuit gentlemen who operate ships and to obtain froni thein the
exact facts and figures.
If we are wise
in our generation, we wilI le-ave ocean vessels on the ocean and lake vessels on the
lakes, and canal boats.in the canais, and
we will then have the c'heapest way of
h'andling our transportation.
At the present day you can ciharter a
ship in Liverpool for five shillings per ton
per nionth. Out of that five shillings the
owner of the ship has to pay the wages of
the crew, their feed, and ahl incidentai
expenses. The lessee must pay for the coal
which the shilp will use, and for ail terminal
charges. With that data a very ordinary
shipping man could tell you how much that
ship would cost per day to operate; but,
in order to have it made plain, I went to
the president of a very large ocean-going
concern and asked hini, and these figures
that I have now the honour of giving to
this House I defy contradiction of, because
1 verified theni froni different sources, not
merely froni one nman. This president of a
large ocean-shîpping company said that to
operate a ten thousand ton tramp steamer
tD-day would cost $800 a day. He addod

MAY 16, 1922
that the round trip from Liverpool to
Duluth and back would t.ake fifty days. I
argued with him that I thought a tramp
steamer would make the trip from Liverpool
to Duluth in twenty-two days from and returning with the advantage of the current
ail the way down, especially from Port Colborne, it would be possible to save one day,
making twenty-one days returning, or a
total of forty-three days. He said to me:
"Senator, it could not possibly be done,
there are so many things that crop up in
an ocean voyage, and on the lake voyage,
and on the canal trip, that it would certainly take fifty days"-and he wanted
to add more. Well, I said I would not
have the face to tell the Senate that it
would take more than fifty days. Se, taking it at fifty days, at $800 a day, there
will be $40,000 paid ont, and to break even.
What would this ocean ship carry? She
would carry 200,000 busheis of grain, and
the ruling price to-day, as for years, is
eleven cents. 0f course, during the wan,
as ail honourable gentlemen know, pnices
went np enormously; but the war is over,
thank God, and a ship canrying 200,000 bushels at eleven cents wonld earn $22,000. To
break even she would have to get $40,000;
consequently there would be a loss of $18,How many trips would she make
000.
under those conditions?
Honourable gentlemen may be surprised
at the immense difference in the price -if
ocean-going vessels and of lake carriers,
but that is due to, the different construction of the ocean vessels and that of the
lakers. TIiose lake eeighters would not
ride in an Atlantic storm. In riding an
those long waves they wouid, te use a
maritime expression, break their backs.
In the great lakes they ride on a succession of short waves; but in the ocean,
with those big waves, the lake vessels have
teo small a draught; that is to say, the
perpendicular distance is not great enough.
Ocean vessels are buit very differently fnom
lake vessels: they are stontly built, and
the drau-ght is in proportion to the tonnage;
and, as I said a moment ago, when the
ocean vessel is empty it has a big displacement in comparison with the lake freighter,
and it is that difference in displacementail that extra useless dispiacement of se
many tens, that at any rate will be nseless
on the lakes-that makes such a great difference in the cargo-carrying capacities of
lakers and ocean vessels.
0f course, I may be told that the average
tramp steamer draws only twenty feet
of water; but the tonnage of the average

1

tramp steamer is 14,000 tons, like Our
great lakers, and it is only at great expense
that you can build the average ocean
is
vessel of shallow draught, and it
piecessary for tramp steamers to have
shallow draught so as te be able te enter
the varions ports of shallow depth. For
instance, if you wanted te send a ship into
the Black Sea, up the Danube, either ta
Galatz or Ibraila, yen could not go there
with more than twenty feet draught. If
yen want te go to Buenos Ayres or
Montevideo, you must have a ship of only
twenty*feet draught, or it could net enter
either cf those ports, unless they have
been greatly deepened only recently. These
vessels must have access to almost every
port.
The construction of these great lakers
is familiar to ail 'who travel on the lakes.
,They are great long steel boxes, 600,625, 630
or 635 feet in length, with a littie less than
60 feet width, so that they can go through
the Canadian Sanît Canal cf 20 foot
draught with 1,400 tons. They carry a
cargo cf grain cf nearly 500,000 bushels,
which means that if that grain was put
on cars the train would be much over thnee
miles long. In those lakers there are in
the bow the living quarters for the crew,
the wheel-house £rom which the ship is
steered, ail these quarters and cabins
where the captain has his place and the
pilots have their rooms, and so on. In the
af t are the boilens and engines and the
living quarters for the langer part of the
crew, the dining room, the kitchen, and
even coid storage quarters where ice is
made with the fumes cf ammonia, and
where fruit and vegetables, etc., are kept.
It wouid really surprise honourable gentlemen te go on one cf those lakers and observe the comfort with which the people
on those boats live.
Hon. Mvr. FOWLER: Is it not a fact
thnt ocean-going vessels go to the lakes
new?
Hon. Mn. CASGRAIN:- I will come te
that-the whaiebacks. They did net prove
a success.
Hon. Mn. FOWLER: But is it net a fact
that last summer they went?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly, ocean
vessels; since the hononnable gentleman
wants an immediate answer, I will tell
him. When 1 was a boy, that is a good
many years age, as soon as the canais
were deepened to 14 feet this idea cf
having ocean vessels go te the great lakes
from the ocean was taken up, and quite

SENATE
a fleet of ships called whalebacks were
built and operated. Those whalebacks
were so called because the-deck was almost
awash; there were hardly any works standing out of them. The decks were very
narrow, and were almost absolutely submerged. Those whalebacks were built
exactly the full canal length, that is,
175 feet by 45 feet in width, and 14 feet
draught. They started carrying grain
without breaking bulk from the great
lakes, and many a time when I was yachting on the lower St. Lawrence I would see
them; they would look like torpedo boats
coming down the river. I see the honourable member from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Chapais) assenting; I think he has seen
those whalebacks himself. But the whalebacks did not operate as a paying proposition, because all they could take of grain
was 85,000 bushels; that would be the
maximum. They did not carry that much
because, being built strongly enough to
stand the storms of the Atlantic, the
weight of the ship itself would still further
reduce the amount of cargo; they must
therefore have taken only 60 per cent of
the possible 85,000 bushels, according to
the information which I have received.
But if they took 75,000 bushels of wheat
at Il cents, I leave it to the honourable
gentleman from New Brunswick (Hon.
Mr. Fowler) to say if that would pay an
ocean steamer. It did not pay them, and
they all went out of business, and there
are no whalebacks now.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable
gentleman has not answered my question.
He need not answer it unless he likes, but
I asked if it is not the fact that last
summer ocean vessels were going up the
St. Lawrence.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly; and
not only that, but the company of which I
have been a director for the last 20 years
took our vessels, with a 14 foot draught,
and sent them out on the ocean. It would
not have been a paying proposition except
in time of war.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There was no war
last summer.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Well, those
vessels that went there, if any went to
get grain, could not have made a commercial success of it. And I defy any one
to say that any ocean vessel went last
summer to get grain at any port, whether
it was- Chicago, Duluth, Port Arthur or
wherever you like, and make money in
taking that. In the first place, that vessel
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

would have to go up light. Where will
you get a cargo lot from any one foreign
port to any port in the Great Lakes? You
will not get a cargo lot.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I myself saw them
going.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They may have
gone, but they lost money.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Perhaps so.
not know much about that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That
matter we are looking after.

I do
is the

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I did not examine
their financial statement.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: When I was
kindly interrupted by the honourable gentleman I was trying to describe one of
those lakers. I have told you about the
living quarters in the bow and the living
quarters in the stern. Betveen those
quarters there is a space of some 500 feet,
and I may say that all the orders, etc.,
given to the engineer aft are sent by
telephone, because the distance is so great.
Moreover, as those ships when fully loaded
have very little freeboard, that space between those two living quarters, which on
an ocean vessel ought to be a deck, but
on a lake carrier is nothing but a succession of hatches-that space is awash the
minute there is a little sea, especially when
there is a beam sea-and very often in a
storm the crew is marooned in bow quarters for many hours until the vessel comes
to some harbour or other sheltered place,
because the sea washes freely over this
open space between the living quarters at
the front and the living quarters aft.
Communication is carried on, as I have
said, by telephone, and by means of a
cable suspended from the top of one of the
living quarters to the other, a box containing the food is hauled from the kitchen, which is aft, to the people who are
marooned in front. There is no other
means of communication, and in a bad
storm, although there are guy ropes, and
although all the protection possiblè is
given, the waves dashing across would
wash off any man on those decks. The
hatches are very numerous. I have myself counted as many as thirty-six in one
ship, and I am told there are some with
more than that number: I am told there
are some ships that have forty hatches.
So that the whole deck of the laker is
open wýhen the hatches are taken off, and
grain or ore or coal can be poured into all

MAY 16, 1922
the ship, the expense of trimming being
saved-and it is in trimming that the
delay occurs. Now, if it were a ship with
'tween-decks there would be only a few
hatches, and as the grain, or coal, or ore
was poured down the hatches it would
have to be carried and spread throughout
the ship, That involves a great deal of
very. hard labour and takes time. It is
very difficult on a bot summer day to get
men to shovel grain or coal into the 'tweendecks of a ship; whereas in the other kind
of vessel the space is all open and it is
easy for an ordinary elevator to drop in
90,000 bushels per hour. As for the place
where the iron ore is loaded, it is still
easier to load. At Mesaba Range a whole
earload of ore is taken with a derrick and
simply dumped into the ship-the whole
-carload. So you can realize how rapidly
an ore boat is loaded. That is a thing
which would be impossible for an ocean
vessel.
I spoke a few moments ago of return
cargoes. Now, I must say that there is
a very remote possibility of an ocean
vessel, going to the Great Lakes, getting a
cargo lot from one foreign port to one lake
port. And an ocean vessel cannot go distributing here, there and somewhere else;
it must unload where it makes its terminal. You have an instance of that in
the city of Quebec. Vessels with considerable trade for Quebec pass right by that
city and go right up to Montreal and unload there, and that freight has to be
hauled down by rail to Quebec when it
does not come down by water. It is difficult to get foreign products in cargo lots
for such ports as Montreal, Portland, Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Newport News, New Orleans
and Galveston. These are all great distributing centres. It is especially difficult
to get cargo lots for those ports from the
continent of Europe.
Remember, honourable gentlemen, that in
ordinary shipping ten tons go from America
to Europe for every ton received in return.
Of course, that one ton in return is more
valuable freight; but I am stating the proportions in quantity, and those who have
been directors of steamship lines will bear
me out in that statement. I think the
senior member for Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Roche), who has had a great deal to do
with shipping, will bear me out. If he
does not, then I will bow to his decision,
for I admit that he would know more about
the matter than I do. However, that is the
information I have. Therefore ocean-going

221

vessels must rely entirely on outgoing cargoes. As to that loss which I mentioned
a while ago, of $18,000 for a 10,000-ton
ship, you may say, "You do not allow anything for the cargo coming from Europe."
I have inquired, but I do not see what cargoes could be got. There may be some, but
1 do not know of any, and the people of
whom I have inquired, and who are in
business, have told me they did not know
of any.
What a difference with lake carriers!
Lake carriers come down with ore, which
is the main thing. They come down with
grain. That is a very small proportion of
their trade. But, going West, they load
with coal. A lake carrier, for instance,
of 14,000 tons-and there are quite a few
of such-will corne down to Port Colborne
with grain for 50 cents a ton, which is
equal to 1l cents a bushel. At 50 cents a
ton, 14,000 tons will amount to $7,000,
which she will make coming down. Returning she will take coal. You see how cheap
the transportation is? I would point out
to the ex-Minister of Railways how cheap
the transportation is. I am afraid he is
asleep. Will somebody kindly wake him
up?
Hon. Mr. REID: I am listening to every
word, and I shall be prepared to give the
honourable gentleman an answer.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The coal is taken
a distance of 900 miles for 30 cents a ton.
Still, 30 cents a ton on 14,000 tons amounts
to $4,200, making a total of $11,200 for the
round trip by the lake carrier, and that
trip is accomplished in ten days. If in ten
days it makes that amount of money, you
see where the ocean vessel would be.
We hear much about the great tonnage
of the Sault. The proponents of this
enterprise in the Middle States and in some
of the Northwestern States talk about the
immense tonnage. Well, we know how immense the tonnage is that passes Sault
Ste. Marie: we know it is two and a half
times as great as that of the Suez Canal
In an ordinary year the minimum is about
90,000,000 tons. That is enormous. To
give you an idea, honourable gentlemen,
of what 90,000,000 tons means, if that
quantity were put in gondola carsHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In what?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In freight cars.
If that quantity were put in gondola cars
it would make a solid train reaching from
the south pole to the north pole, and
there would be 600 miles to spare. That is

SENATE
the length of the train that would be required to carry 90,000,000 tons. But of
this quantity of 90,000,000 tons, only one
ton in ten ever goes east of Lake Erie, and
that one ton we must divide with the Erie
Canal. The St. Lawrence route received
last year, for instance, four and one-fifth
million tons of freight-of grain, and the
Erie Canal received about the same. The
Erie Canal would always be a strong competitor. That Canal has only a ten-foot
draught at present. It should be twelvefoot. The shallow places govern the
draught of a canal. The Erie Canal will
always get its fair share, because the
liners out of New York need this grain for
balast, in order to stabilize the ship. They
oarry it at very cheap rates. They would
carry it for nothing in a pinch, because
they need it for ballast. I very well remember ships coming to America with
stone ballast, and on the other side money
had to be spent in putting it on. In the
harbour of Quebec there was a place provided on purpose, where ships had t3 go
to drop that ballast. It may be surprising
to some honourable gentlenmen to hear that
vessels of the Allan line have often taken
on grain at Montreal, gone to Liverpool with
it, come back to Montreal with it, and taken
it back to Liverpool again, because they
needed it for ballast.
As I mentioned a little while ago, an
ocean vessel, to be economically built, must
have a draught in proportion to its tonnage, in order to have sufficient rigidity,
and it is only at enormous cost that you
can make a good ocean vessel with a shallow draught. It may be interesting to
point out that lake carriers cost only one
dollar per bushel that they' can carry, and
one dollar per bushel capacity is about the
price of an elevator. In the olden days
an elevator could be built for about fifty
cents a bushel; but the price of everything
has risen, and to-day the cost of an elevator is, for so many bushels, as many
dollars. The Port Colborne elevatorwhich I may say en passant is probably
the best and quickest elevator in the
world-was built some years ago, under
the Administration that preceded that of
Sir Robert Borden, for sixty cents per
bushel capacity. It is a two million bushel
elevator and it cost $1,200,000. It is in
my opinion the best elevator that has ever
been built, and the man who built it, Mr.
J. A. Jamieson, has built elevators also in
St. John, New Brunswick, in Haliafx, Quebec, Montreal, Prescott, Kingston, Owen
Sound, Port Arthur and Fort William.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN,

I find on page 55 of the report submitted by the International Joint Commission that Mr. Cornelius, of Buffalo, says
that the cost of ocean vessels is $150 and
of lake carriers $35 per ton; and also that
ocean vessels carry only 60 per cent of the
lakers for the same displacement.
An
ocean vessel spends a great deal of time
in port loading and unloading, because it
has not the facilities of a lake carrier: it
is not open like a laker, and it will spend
seven or eight days. Honourable gentlemen must know that time is the essence of
successful business in transportation, on
water especially, because the overhead
charges run on just the same whether the
ship is moored at the dock or is in motion.
The wages of the crew, the interest on the
ship, the port charges, etc., run on just the
same. The only difference between a ship
at the dock and a ship in motion is in
the price of coal; and a ship moving slowly
uses a relatively small quantity. A 10,000 ton boat, I suppose, would use not
more than a ton an hour of coal going at
the rate of eight or nine knots. I may say
that on the lakes the term " statute miles "
is used instead of " knots." The proponents
of this scheme had, oh, a bright idea; they
were to have a composite ship, a ship that
would go equally well in the ocean, in the
canal and in the Great Lakes. The idea
of such a ship was simply laughed at by
shipbuilders. Such a vessel could not possibly be a commercial success.
I had intended dealing with the whalebacks in any event, but I have already
spoken about those.
The cheapest of all means of transportation is the canal by barges. On the Erie
Canal it is possible to transport 3,900 tonsthe equivalent of 128,000 bushels of grainin one steamer and three consorts, on a
9-foot draft, mind you. With our draft of
14 feet we could easily carry three times
that quantity-well, certainly twice that
anyway. And the total cost of that fleet
is only $28,500, or $7.31 per ton.
When we have the Welland Canal in
operation, our Great Lakers will come
straight through to Kingston, and in Kingston, with one elevator, not exactly similar
to that of Port Colborne, except in speed
of loading and unloading, but an elevator
of 3,000,000 bushels-the other has 2,000,000-all the grain could be transhipped at
Kingston, and from Kingston down to the
ocean port at Montreal you would have a
purely river and canal navigation, reducing
the cost enormously. You could have some
of those cheaper barges, and even if you
paid twice the price of these, that would

MAY 16, 1922
cost you only $15 a ton. That would be the
cheapest possible* way of carrying grain
from Kingston to Montreal hy a fleet, that
is to say, one steamer and consorts. Now,
if the honourable ex-Minister of Railways
(Hon. Mr. Reid) will lend me his ear, I
will tell him what would happen: we would
take wheat from Port Arthur and Fort William, through the Welland Canal, and unIoad it at Kingston for two and a-half
cents. I think the honourable gentleman
will agree with me in that. The cost is
now one-and-a-half cents to Port Coîborne.
It would not be more than one cent additional to Kingston. At Kingston the wheat
would bie tr.ansferred into a purely river
and canal system of boats, that is, cheap
barges, and it would be taken from Kingston down to Montreal for one-and-a-half
cents. That makes 4 cents. Adding 1 cent
for the elevator charges, you would have the
wheat delivered f.o.b. ocean steamers for
5 cents per bushel. I wish I could speak
loud enough for those people in the Middle
States to hear that statement, so that
they might go and consult experts.
The proponents of the St. Lawrence Ship
Canal project are people who live inland.
How the International Commission could
have unanimously approved of the project
is beyond my comprehiension.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They are not al
inland men either.
Before my
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
honourable friend leaves that point, dealing
with transportation through the St. Lawrence canaIs, may 1 say that the question
occurred to me, would it be possible to lock
through the St. Lawrence canais a steamer
with three consorts, carrying grain in the
manner which hie suggests? Would the
locks accommodate boats transporting grain
in that way?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Put the consorts
on the deck.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN-: As they approach
the canal the barges pass in front of the tug
-these barges, as you know, are very
easily got into the canal-and-one is locked
through, then another is locked through,
until they are ail through; then the steamer
comes through, and they go on their way
rejoicing. In canals they can only go five
miles an heur at best; so.it takes practically no power to haul these consorts.
I thought my honourable friend was born
near Lake Erie. He ought to know about

Hon. Mr. CASGRAJN: Go to the Erie
canal and you will see them. I speak by
the book. I have nothing to say for myself about this. What I have to say I
have learned through weeks of study of
these books; and I would be very happy
if any honourable gentlemen would do me
the honour of reading them. I will show
them. where I got the information. It was
put before the Commission by men who
were supposed to be the very best experts
that the United States and Canada could
produce.
Before going into this huge project,
would it not be right for someone to demonstrate to the country that we would
be better off f or it, that the thing would
be a commercial success, and finally that
it would be a necessity for the future?
You have ahl heard of James J. Hill. In
my humble opinion hie was better versed
in transportation problems, especially the
transportation of grain, than any other
man in America; hie built railways; he
was a steamboat operator. What did hie
say fifteen years ago? He said: "In twentyfive years ahl the elevators at the seaboard
will be empty"-he was talking of the
United States, not of Canadian prairies"because the population of the United
States will increase, and the people will
consume ahi the wheat they will grow."'
Now, what do we find to-day? Mr. Herbert
Hoover, who seems to be a great authority
on feeding people, not only in America but
also on the continent of Europe, says that
in less than ten years there wlll be no grain
for export from the United States-that
the United States will consume it ahl. He
bears out Mr. Hill's statement. He makes
the reservation that the three Canadian
prairie provinces will keep on increasing
their grain production, and that some will
come from there; and hie adds that a
great proportion of that grain, duty or no
duty, will go to the United States anyway, because they need our hard wheat to
mix with their soft wheat, and are bound
to have it at any price.
Then there is another question. There

Gazette of to-day in which they say that
this project has been started, and that the
wheat and ore and other commodities that
we are supposed to get in Montreal are
to-day going down to New Orleans on the
Mississippi and its tributaries in barges.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And going across
to Europe?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And going across
to Europe, certainly.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is it not a fact
that the heat would injure the grain?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I amrn ot an expert in temperature. 0f course, the grain
is transferred at New Orleans. We ail
know that in front of Chicago, in Lake
Michigan, the water hesitates before going
to New Orleans or to Quebec; it is in suspension. The old pioneers and merchants of
Montreal, away back in the days immediately after the taking of Canada by the
English, because they were flot allowed to
trade with anybody but the English people,
used to carry their furs up the Ottawa
river, up the Mattawa river, up through
lake Talon, Trout lake and lake Nippissing,
and down the French river, through Georgian bay and the strait of Mackinac, and
down to Chicago, and through Chicago
creek. People of my own family have made
that trip. The Chicago creek has been reversed. It is supposed to have been turned
into a sewage canal, but it is 200 feet wide
and 20 feet deep, falling into the river
des Plaines, which flows into the Illinois
river, which runs into the Mississippi, and
so on; and shipments could be made just
as well that way for twelve months in the
year as they can for seven months down
the St. Lawrence, and in Chicago the people
of the Middle Western States would have
an ocean port in their own territory. We
have the St. Lawrence to ourselves, and I
think we would like to keep it to ourselves;
at any rate, the part of the country £rom
which I corne wants to keep it to ourselves.
It is said that there is need for more tonnage and so on. Any one who owns ships
knows that in front of Port Arthur and
Fort William ships have been kept standing
for weeks at a time waiting for grain cargoes. There was grain in the elevators, it
is true, but the speculators would not allow
it to be shipped. They wanted to keep it

evidence that was given derogatary to or

to have had much stress laid on it, as
they did not seem to have much use for

in Montreal, said, as reported in the Montreai Star, that hie praised Mr. Jamieson
for having given the most scientific, the

asked him ta give his notes to the Commission; and Mr. Jamieson was against
the projeet. Now, I defy any one ta find

My deaîr Sir,-I note from press reports that
it is your intention to address the Senate on
the important subject of the proposed St.
Lawrence iDeelp Waterways.
At the sitting of the International Waterwa,ys Commission in montreal Oct. 8'th. 1920,
the writer, who has given much intimate study
to the question of transportation and transfer
of grain between our western wheat fields and
the seaports, gave testîmony and quoted from
authentic data which clearly tended to shew
that our present Lake and River S/S navigating
via the Welland Ship Canal-now under construction-and
our
present
St. Lawrence
Canais, plus high-c]ass transfer elevators for
the rapid and
economic transfer of grain
cargoes located at Kilngston or Prescott and
Montreal, could transport grain fromn Lake
Superior ports to the hold of Ocean S/S montreal at as low a cost as could be accomplished
by the ocean Tramip îS1S navlgatlng the proposed Deep Waterways without transfer of
cargo; that thîs waterway would not therefore
prove to be an economlc project for the transportation of our grain, whlch would constItute
much the greater part of available cairgo.
Commissioner H. A. Powell, Acting Chairman
at the sitting, In thanking me for the testlmony
given, described it as the most scientific and
valuable testmnmcy they had heard, yet I do
flot find it referred to in the Report which, has
been recently issued by the Commission.
Yours respectfully,

Now, there were some more cases to
show that the report inciined one way.
There was the marine insurance question,
referred to on page 63, which they dlaim
was not a factor at ail. But what are
the facts? In New York during tweive
months of the year marine insurance is
12à cents per hundred. In Montreal the
cheapest you ever get it, to Montreal oniy,
is 27à cents, and that is oniy until the
l5th of Octdber, when it gaes up to 32à
cents, and on November l5th it goes up to
55 cents. Still, the report says thàt 12à
cents as against 55 cents is not a factor.
The inclination towards the project is too
strong; anybady reading that report wii]
get that impression.
Then there is Mr. R. M. Wilson, who said
that horse-power, developed by the Commissioner's scheme at $800 or $825 was
much too dear ta bie economicaily successfui; that water-power caming froni St.
Maurice was being deveioped at $80 ta
$100 a horse-power; and that you could
get cheaper power with coal than with
horse-power at $300 and $825. That is
ai] ieft out of the Commissioner*s report.
An article in La Presse, commenting an
my speech, quotes a witness who gave evidence in the coal industry here, and stated
that power could be produced froni coal
and steam cheaper than horse-power at
that price.
Now I suppose I had better finish. I

freighter on the Atlantic wili be a 25,000ton boat, and it wiil run like a ferry bietween the samne two ports. It wiii have a
draught of 35 feet; here we speak of 25.
That boat would sail, say, fromn New York
or Newport News, or Pertiand, to Liverpool, or f rom Quebec ta Liverpool with a
35-foot draught, and both the American
and European terminiais would be equipped
Just like aur lake ports are equipped with
praper terminai facilities, sa that those
boats could be laaded and unloaded at
bath ends of their jaurney, and flot have
ta carry hundreda of tons of equipment
such es derricks, swing booms, winches,
and steam dummy engines, which waste a
great deai of steani on account of long
pipes leading fram the boilers ta where the
steam engine is warking, especialiy in cold
weather, and oblige the skippers ta keep
steam Up ifl port.. Ail these appliences

SENATE
will be installed at both ends, and their
weight of hundreds and hundreds of tons
will be replaced by good paying cargo. Thus
the 8,000 and 10,000-ton freighter could
not compete at a]l with this 25,000-ton
freighter, which would only use 67 men,
whilst the 8,000 or 10,000-ton boat uses
45 men; and the hundreds of tons of machinery now carried for nothing from one
side to the other would be replaced by a
paying cargo.
Before this St. Lawrence River Ship
Canal could ever be built, opened to, navigation and used, proper facilities would
have been installed, with stationary electrical plants on the wharves, as I have said,
and loading and unloading would be done
by the quickest methods. At Port Colborne the other day 85,000 bushels of grain
were put in one vessel in 34 minutes from
the time she moored at the dock till she
cast her lines and ail trimmed, at a cost
of only 3/8 of a cent per bushel, including
ail charges. The trimming was done automatically on account of the great velocity
with which the grain came out of the nozzle
of the spout, the velocity being 5,000 feet
per minute, or 60 miles an hour, and the
grain could be driven 40 feet before there
was any depression in it, so that the whole
vessel is loaded without any trimming. This
loading was done to see how fast it could
be accomplished. I do not pretend that it
is done ail the time at that rate, but 8
vessels have often been loaded in one day
at the Port Colborne elevator.
On the Atlantic ports, and ail the Gulf
ports like Galveston and New Orleans, ail
tramp steamships of ordinary size have
been superseded by large liners with deeper
draught and greater capacity. A 25,000ton ocean ship would only take, after ail,
825,000 bushels, whilst we have boats on
the lakes which carry 500,000 bushels, more
than half the ocean cargo.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I am just
coming to the end, and I thank you very
much for your very kind attention, and
I would just like to say this in conclusion: that the enlargement of the St. Lawrence canais for the establishment of ocean
lines from Great Lakes ports, thereby eliminating the port of Montreal, is not at ail
serious. The season on the Great Lakes
is short, with difficulties from ice both at
the opening and the closing, which would
permit arrivals from Europe at ports on
the Great Lakes about May 5th of each
year, and would mean that the first scheduled sailings would probably be May 15th.
The latest sailings that vessels of this type
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

could safely plan from Great Lake ports
would be November 12th to 15th, so that
there is practically six months in which
service could be maintained, but which
would occasion the expense of yearly terminalg for six months' service.
Undoubtedly there would be established
lines from the cities of Chicago, Duluth,
and Cleveland, with possibly others as the
country further developed; but the vessels
on such service would not be as large as
those on the Atlantic, and would carry only
sufficient steel and grain to give them
dead weight, as in that particular service
they would need the merchandise that paid
the higher rate, and which occasions expensive transfer at seaboard, as against
the expense accruing to bulk freight.
In the spring, the grain moves out with
a rush, and ordinarily a great many lake
vessels, which are otherwise engaged in
coal and ore trade, get into this grain
trade, while the very large ore trade of
the lakes is getting settled down to a
smooth running basis, and, on account of
the delays incident to the opening of this
business, these boats can readily be spared.
Usually the rush of wheat is over by the
20th May, and by the lst of June the
larger portion of the grain left over from
the previous fall is at seaboard.
The
grain rush in the fall commences about
September 15th, and a great number of
vessels are freed from their regular ore
and coal trades, due to a little higher
freight earnings, and always fit into this
particular rush of getting the grain out
late in the fall. These boats to a large
extent need the grain trade at that time,
as ordinarily the ore shippers try to get
the bulk of the ore moved before the bad
weather sets in in the fall and, from the
lst of November on, freezing weather is
quite often experienced, which absolutely
stops the loading of ore, and, during those
few days, always throws a large number
of boats into the grain trade.
The lake vessels are much cheaper to
build, have smaller crews, are specially
adapted for the lake and river trade, and
carry a larger cargo on the same draft
than ocean vessels of the same size. They
are built for special trades. This permits
them to carry return cargoes of coal on
the lakes, thus helping to cheapen the
freight rate and, in my judgment, they
would be able to move grain from the
head of the lakes to Montreal so much
cheaper than ocean vessels that the difference would cover the cost of transferring
the grain at Montreal. At times tramp

MAY 16, 1922
vessels would go into the lake country for
bulk cargoes of grain; but ordinarily
these charters have to be made so far
ahead that the buyer and seller of the
grain would take a great many more risks
in the fulfilment of their contracts. It is
a great advantage to a shipper, when grain
is moving to fil a certain sale, to have
that grain where he can divert it to take
advantage of new sales, or to other ocean
ports than those intended, so as to take
advantage of reduced freights and to some
extent it appeals to a shipper to have his
grain en route from Port Arthur to
Montreal.
If we assume that grain is being moved
to Montreal from the head of the lakes in
cargoes of say 500,000 bushels, the grain
received at Montreal on that one cargo can
be shipped in various directions on the
various lines operating out of Montreal.
It also permits one extra handling of grain,
which sometimes is advantageous in keeping
it from heating, which particularly applies
to corn in the summer time.
In my judgment, unless conditions change
very much in the grain trade, not less than
80 per cent of the grain f rom the Great
Lakes via the St. Lawrence route would be
transferred at Montreal, though the merchandise from that district might be loaded
at Great Lakes ports in larger proportion.
The people and established industry at
the present time that would be benefited by
the larger canal are probably nine times
as great on the American side as on the
Canadian side, and the benefits would probably accrue in about the"same proportion.
That means that the Americans would have
to pay $9 to our $1 if we went into that
scheme. Therefore, it is a serious matter
for the Canadian Government to consider
unless the original expense of construction
were borne very largely by the United
States. Probably there is some way in
which it could be worked out whereby the
operating cost could be distributed on the
tonnage moved, so that there would be no
charges against the vessels, which I think
would be necessary. Canada at present is
in such a bad way financially that I do not
believe that this undertaking could be seriously considered at the present time, and I
anticipate much inquiry would have to be
made before the Province of Quebec would
be persuaded that it was in their best interests Vo permit the exportation of power
to be developed in their province through
this proposed route.
I thank the honourable gentlemen very
much-

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Is the honourable gentleman concluding his remarks?
I have listened te him with very great interest. I arn interested in the matter of
getting our grain from the West to the
seaboard in the cheapest way, and 1 should
like to ask why the Western American
States that do not border on the Great
Lakes have apparently approved unanimously of the scheme. I desire only to
ask for information.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: That information is asked by everybody, and nobody
seems to know what it means, unless it is
a Trojan horse scheme for coming into
Canada. Some dlaim that it is a power
scheme. That means that very wealthy interests in the United States would like to
develop the power. I can hardly believe
that, since they have plenty of power undeveloped. But it appears, and the rumor
is current, that some very big concerns
-I will not naine them, but you can guess
at them-would like to obtain this power.
They have too much comsnonsense to believe that there is any navigation in this
seheme; but there would be an immense
amount of power development, and that is
supposed to be the objeot. Those same
Middle States, as I had the honour of saying a littie while ago, are on the Mississippi river. Why not use their own river?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: One reason,
I suppose, would be the very much greater
distance. I have gone on the Mississippi
from St. Paul te the Gulf of Mexico. That
takes five or six days. It is four days
from St. Louis only.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But my honourable friend knows that the rate on the
ocean as compared with on land is ten to
one so distance on the ocean is not a very
great factor.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What effect would
the wi.nter have on that power?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: I arn trespassing upon the kindness, of the House, but I
amn very glad indeed to have the honourable gentleman ask the question. That is
a point that I absolutely forgot to mention. In the winter time there is what is
cadled frazil ;" that is the sort of ice that
freezes under the water. It is like a buneh
of darning needies, if you like, and it will
clog almost any turbine wheel and will interfere 'with the flow of water until it stops
it completely. I de not know what is the
English term for frazil.

230

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is called anchor
ice.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That frazil is
formed only in water that is very much
agitated and contains a large proportion of
oxygen. It clogs the turbine wheels, as I
have said. Therefore there are in this
report many schemes for doing away with
the frazil.
I had plenty more to say about the matter, but, while taking so much time, I did
not mention that there is a Colonel Hugh
L. Cooper who seems to have a scheme for
skimming this frazil and preventing it from
forming. He is one of those who has much
to say in this report. However, I am sorry
that I cannot give more information to my
honourable friend about this frazil, but apparently it is not known how it can be
prevented.
Another important factor is the flooding
that would occur in the winter time when
the ice forms. As you all know, the various
rivers rise. However, I think I spoke of
that the other day.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The water bas to
be absolutely still.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As the honourable gentleman from Portage la Prairie
says, there bas to be absolutely still water.
I hold in my hand a pamphlet which is
very interesting. I think every Senator
must have received a copy. The pamphlet
has recently been issued by the General
Manager and Secretary of the Montreal
Harbour Commission, Mr. M. P. Fennell.
This honourable House does not change,
like another Chamber, but it goes on. It
would be advantageous if the honourable
members of the other House, especially the
new members fron the Northwest, would
go down to Montreal, and see how easily
their grain is being handled there. I may
say that we in Montreal have been fortunate in having always a good Commission, whether appointed by the Conservatives or by the Liberals. A very pleasant
event took place in Montreal the other day:
the present Commissioners invited their six
predecessors. The three who had been appointed by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and still
full of life, were present, as were the three
appointed by Sir Robert Borden. The nine
of them yesterday had a very nice lunch,
and I am told that the President, Dr. W.
L. McDougald, presented them with a very
fine little loving cup on which were inscribed the names of the nine Commissioners. These men have done great work.
I am not now digressing, for I am still
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

speaking of navigation. The work was inaugurated by Joseph Israel Tarte. All
honour to him! His constant advice was:
"Let us equip our ports; let us equip our
harbours." I am glad to pay this tribute
to his memory. We have in the present
Commissioners and in the manager very
able men. I do not want to take up further
time. But I may say, en passant, that
the present General Manager, Mr. M. P.
Fennell, had the honour of being elected
some years ago as President of the American Association of Port Authorities, and I
think he still holds the position.
This little book gives the quantity of
grain that is being shipped from every
port. You will observe from it that the
port of Montreal heads the list, with 138,000,000 bushels; Galveston comes next, with
94,000,000; then New York with 84,000,000, New Orleans with 73,000,000, and so
on. I want to say here that the harbour
of Montreal bas cost in development only
$31,000,000, and it has never failed to pay
the interest on its bonds, and bas never
been a charge of one dollar on the public
Treasury.
Now, honourable gentlemen, once more I
thank you most sincerely for your very
kind attention. This is a very dry subject, although we are on water all the
time, and I do not expect to speak as long
again unless you ask me.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Fowler, the debate was adjourned.

flepartment, and shall be a member of the Defence Council.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Explain.
Hon Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr.
Calder) has submitted to me an amendment which would juin subsection 3 and 4
in another form. 1 think hie holds ia his
hand that amendment.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, since our last meeting we have been
considering various points which. were
under discussion when the Bill was last
Lcefore the Committee, and it is now suggested that suibsection 3 be further amended
by inserting after the word " who " in the
third line the words " while holding such
office." The latter part of the clause would
then read:
-who shall.
.
administer, exercise and
perform ail the vowers, dues and functions
vested in or exercisable by the Deputy Minister
of the Naval Service by or under the Naval
Service Act, and who whiiIe holding such office
shall have the rank and salary of a Deputy
Head of a Department, and shall be a member
of the Defence Council.

It is further suggested that subsection
4 be struck out and another subsectioýn
substituted. I understand it has been decided to add to the Bill a section which
would bring the Act into force by proclamation. The suggestion is that this subsecý
tion should be substituted for the present
subsection 4:
Upon the coming loto force of this Act by
proclamation, as provided by section 11, the
officer appointed under subsection 3 of this section shall be known as Cornotroller.

That is, hie is simply continued in office,
and shaîl, under the Deputy Minister of
National Defence, be charged with aIl
financial matters pertaining to the Depart-ment. The Comptroller shaîl be paid an
annual salary of $6,000.
In effect that isimply means this. As I
understand it, Mr. Desharats bas been acting as Deputy Minister of Naval Service
for a long period of years and has given
very good service, and the suggestion is
that hie should continue to act in the capacity referred to in subsection 3 until such
time as the complete change in the Department is ready to be made, and that, as
soon as the Act is brought into force by
proclamation and everything is ready for
the reorganization of the Department, Mr.
Desharats should become 'Comptroller of
the Department at the salary which hie
is now getting, $6,000 per year, and that
he should flot continue to act as Deputy
Minister of the Department.
The Hon. the ('HAIRMAN

Hon. Mr. REID): I have no objection
at ail to $6,000 being paid Mr. Desbarats,
but I was wondering if it would not be
hetter to make the amendment read, "Shaîl
be paid a salary flot exceeding $6,0002"
You are fixing the salary of the Comp-troller at $6,000 permnently, whereas, if
anything should happen to Mr. Desbarats
and you appointed a new man, you might
posýsibly want to start him at a little less.
As I understand that aniendment, it really
fixes the salary of the Comptroller at
$6',000. There are other Comptrollers in
ltber departments who are, I think, doing
as important work and who are receiving
a much less salary than $6,000. 1 am not
mnaking this suggestion with a view of interfering with the salary to be paid to Mr.
Desbarats while hie is in that position; I
amn nnly suggesting that perhaps some
words might be inserted which would provide that, in the event of anything happening to Mr. Desbarats at any time, it would
not be necessary to appoint a new Comptroller at a salary higher than that re-,
ceived by those who are filling positions of
the samne standing and whose duties are,
in my judigment, quite as responsible as
those of the Comptroller in the Departaient
of National Defence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There should
be no objection to modifying the proposed
amendment by making it read, "not ex-,
ceeding $6,000."
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, "not exceeding $6,000."1
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It seems to mie
that it is not necessary to appoint a Comptroller for this departmnent. If it is desired
to provide for Mr. Desbarats, well and good.
I have no objection whatever to that. But,
if so, make the provision such that when
Mr. IDesbarats is retired it will not be
necessary to continue for all time to corne
the office of Comptroller. There are other
Departments that have no Cornptroller and
do not require one. If you appoint a Comptroaler for this particular Department, an
agitation will start within those other
Departments to have one of their officials
appointed a Comptroller, and the result
will be that you will go on increasing the
cost to the country when it is absolutely
urinecessary to do so. I understand from
what was said the other day that Mr. Desbarats is now over sixty years of age. In
two or three years hie will be due for retirement. Why not give him a pension as
Deputy Minister of the Naval Service fit
the time of his retirement, and continue

MAY 17, 1922
with the present officers looking after financial matters? So far as we can judge
now, from the proposal of the Government
to reduce the expenditure in connection
with the army, the navy, and the air force,
the total expenditure of the three combined departments bids fair to be considerably less in the future than that of the
Department of Militia and Defence in the
past. If the Department of Militia and
Defence in the past did not find it necessary
to have a Comptroller, why have a Comptroller for the combined Departments, when
the total amount of business transacted will
be considerably less? My suggestion is to
arrange for Mr. Desbarats' salary until the
time comes for his retirement, then give.
him his pension and cut off that expenditure absolutely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I must repeat
to my honourable friend that that position was not created in order to make a
berth for Mr. Desbarats. It is clear that
the Minister of Militia did not at first
intend Mr. Desbarats for that position. He
did not have his eye upon Mr. Desbarats.
I maintain that the new Department,
formed by the amalgamation of the three
will need a reclassification, and in that
reclassification there will be need for a position such as is now being given the title
of Comptroller.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why will it be
needed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With that
title or another. There was in the Militia
Department a Comptroller-a Paymaster
General and finance member of the Council, who was superannuated two or three
years ago. So in the reorganization this
position will be a necessary part of the
system.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: There was a Paymaster General required during the war,
but since that time we have got along without one, have we not?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: With reference
to the point raised by the honourable member for Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff),
that under the proposed amendment the
position of Comptroller is established, all
it does is to state that this man who bas
a position in the Department, shall become the Comptroller. It does not mean
that when he disappears another Comptroller need be appointed.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: But my honourable friend has had enough expeiience in,
his lifetime to know that when we estab-

Ess

lish a position in connection with this Government or any other there is going to be
some one ready to step into that position
when one man drops out.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I might call
my honourable friend's attention to tbhe
fact that that has not been the history
of the past. Although there was an official
known as the King's Printer, receiving a
salary of $6,000 a year, that position has
been continued but bas not been filled, and
the salary is not being paid at present;
so that the establishment of the position
of Comptroller to meet an emergency in
order that an old official of the Department may be fairly treated need not be
taken as an intention to continue indefinitely the position.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That exception
only proves. the rule.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I draw the attention of the honourable ledder of the Government and the honourable gentleman
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Calder) to the fact
that if the words "during the period of
six months" which were inserted last week
as an amendment in the beginning of
section 3 remain, the whole clause will be
but temporary, and only for six months.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why do they
not give Mr. Desbarats his pension right
away, at the same salary, and be done
with it?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: May I ask why
the phrase "six months" is introduced?
Is the man only going to work six months,
or for six months out of the year? I am
not finding any fault, or objecting, but I
want to know.
The six
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
months were included because it was felt
that that was the outside limit within
which the Department would be reorganized. It was not to declare expressly that
there would be a second Deputy Minister
appointed in the Department, but it provided simply for the transitory period
Since we are
during reorganization.
amending subsection 4 it may be better
to drop completely the amendment we
made, and the words "for a period not
exceeding six months," and provide in subsection 4 that when the Department is reorganized the Deputy Minister named in
subsection 3 shall become the Comptroller.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Has the House
been informed what amount of saving is
to be effected by this amalgamation of the

234

SENATE

offices? If you are going to have the same
number of Deputy Ministers and officials,
the only saving I can see is in relation to
some Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps my
honourable friend was not here when I
gave a statement of the economies that
were expected under this reorganization,
which amount to hundreds of thousands of
dollars. It is estimated that there will be
a saving, from the reorganization, of
twenty-five per cent in the civil staff only.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The difficulty
seems to be that we have assumed in one
part of this section that the amalgamation
will be in force in six months, and then my
honourable friend proposes an amendment
by which the amalgamation will happen
upon a proclamation.
That is what has
created the difficulty.
I suggest to my
honourable friend that he could solve it,
and remove any confusion or ambiguity,
by incorporating the effect of subsection 3
into his amendment, something like this:
In the meantime the present Deputy shall
continue to perform the duties of Deputy Minister until the proclamation, etc.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: My understanding
of the situation is that the Department is
practically ready to put its reorganization
into effect, and that there is no likelihood
of six months elapsing 'before that is done.
I am taking that for granted, having been
informed to that effeet; consequently there
is no harm in saying that this person
shall hold this office for a period not exceeding six months.
If the Act be proclaimed within six months, that will then
be true, so it is immaterial Whether it is
changed or not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The amendment
would still have to be altered.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But all you are providing here will come into force only by
proclamation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The difficulty of
my honourable friend is that he does not
realize that his action makes the appointment for six months definitely and speci-

fically; it is not for a period not exceeding
six months, but it is for six months.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, it for a
period not exceeding six months.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does the minister
really think that, in view of the fact that
all our navy is going to be put out of
commission, there is any need of a comptroller at all?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is quite
a large question, which would draw us
pretty far away from the text of these
amendments.
My honouralble friend, I
suppose, has all the information he needs
in reading the Debates of the Commons on
that point.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Have yo'u no Paymaster General now?
Hon. MT. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Who has since been
performing the duties that he performed
during tihe war?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There ýis only
the Chief Accountant and the Director of
Pay Services.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Will they still be retained?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Then what is the
need for this Comptroller?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The Comp-

troller will see to the whole expenditure of
those three departments 'united, each of
which has separate pay-sheets for the civil
side and the military side, so that there are
six systems of payments in those three
various Departments.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Where will your
economy come in if you bring the officer
from each of those Departments who are
at present charged with the service in
connection with the disbursements, and
then you have a man to overlook those
three?
That will be a fourth officer, an
extra officer, so that instead of reducing
you are increasing the expenditure-practising unthrift, in fact.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have stated
that the duties of the Comptroller would
be, under the Deputy Minister of National
Defence, to co-ordinate and administer the
different branches of accounting and pay
services of the Department of National
Defence, to see to the administration of
pay regulations, to audit the various services, including pre-audit, and post-audit
of all expenditure, to prepare annual estimates, to record and recon*nend all services in positions in all branches of the
service, involving expenditure.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But you have officers discharging those duties now, and in

MAY 17, 1922
addition te themn you are going to have a
third official who la going to oversee them.
That is nlot decreasing the cost; that is
increasing it.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: We ought to have
a real Comptroller who would be perfectly
independent, as the Comptroller of a bank
is, and not under a Deputy Minister. I
think that clause is very badly worded.
There has been so much rnoney expended ini
that Department for a long time that I
think it is a good thing to appoint a Convptroller, if hie la to have the liberty ta control the expenses in an independent manner. He should be in a position to controe
the expenses made by the Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 arn not at all
satisfied with this clause. Subsection 3
says that the Governor in Coundil "on the
recommnendation of the Minister rnay appoint for a period not exceeding six months
an officer who shahl," etc. Then my honcurable friend goes on and substitutes
for sections 4 and 5 the words: "Upon the
coming into force of this Act by proclamation." Now, the six rnonths mentioned in
iubsection 3 are going to date fromn the
time that the Act cornes into force, which
may be upon a proclamation; so that you
have the difllculty, that in the meantime
the officer cannot be appointed, or if appointed, he will be appointed only for a
time ta commence with the proclamation.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: To me this is a busin.ess matter. If three corporations were
amalgamating into one they would cail in
a chartered accountant, or some man capable of going through ail their accounts
and putting them into the ainalgamated
state, regardless of their own staff. As I
understand it, the proposed Comptroller
would performn that function here. It seems
to me necessary to have somebody to do
that, and if the Comptroller did not do it,
and they want it done properly, they might
have to cali in a chartered accountant froin
outside.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: What would the
Deputy be doing?
Hon. Mr. REID: It does seem to me that
the appointing of a Comptroller rnay do an
injustice to the man who is now in charge
of the financial matters in connection with
the Militia Department, under the titie of
Under this' Bill another
Accountant.
gentleman would be placed over hlm, and
probably the operation would not be as
satisfactory as if ail the financial matters

235

were under one accountant. There is no
doubt at al that this clause is intended
to provide for Mr. Desbarats, and as far
as hie is concerned I really would nlot like
to see any injustice done hlm, if hie could
be provided for without establishing a precedent of this kind, which znight not only
do an injustice but interfere with other
departments in the future.
But I cannot understand the necessity
for passing this Act at ail, for honourable
gentlemen will remember that in 1918 Parliaimnent passed a special Act containing
only two clauses, for the purpose of allowing the amalgamation of any departmnents.
The particular amalgamation at that time
concerned the Custorns and Inland Revenue
Departmnents, but the provisions of that Act
applied to any future amalgamation that
was desired. I will read the clauses:
7. (1) The Governor in1 Council shail have
powerduties or func( a) to transfer any powers,
tions or- the control or supervision of any part
one Minister of the
of the public service from
Crown to any other Minister of the Crown, or
froma one Department or portion of the public
service to any other Department or portion of
the pubIc service; or,
(b) to anialgamate and combine any two or
more Deiartrnente under one Minister of the
Crown and under one Deputy Minister.
(2) Ail orders made by the Governor in
Council under the provisions of this Act shall
be laid before both Houses of F'arliament within
flfteen days after they are made If Parliament
is then sltting, and if not, then within flfteeil
days from the commencement of the next ensulng session of Parliament.

As 1 read that, we could amalgamate
two departments under that Act, and then
the ýGovernment and the Civil Service
Commission would have power, if they
agreed, to appoint a iComptroller and fix
his salary at whatever the Commission
agreed was fair and reasonable for that
position. Mr. Desbarats could thus be provided in the regular way under that Act,
which was assented to by Parliarnent on
the l2th of April, 1918. This Act gives
power to the Governrnent by Order in
Council te arnalgarnate any two or more
departmnents under one Minister and one
Deputy Minister, with alI the powers that
any department at present possesses. As
the honourable leader of the Government
knows, if it is desired to create a new
position in any department the Minister
applies to the Civil Service Commission to
have such a position as that of Cornptroller
created, and he asks the Commission to
fix the salary. The Commission must assume the responsibility of fixing the
salary. If the Governrnent vwere to amalgamate these two or three departments

SENATE
under that Act and the Minister of the new
Department or the combined Department
then applied for a Comptroller, giving his
reasons, I think the Civil Service Commission would consider the matter, and it is
altogether likely they would agree to the
new position of Comptroller being created if
the reasons offered were in their judgment
suflicient. In my judgment the whole machinery is now on the statute book, and
the amalgamation could go through without the present Bill. However, I am not
objecting to the Bill going through, but
only giving the reason why the Bill must,
in my opinion, be justified.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
J should like to know exactly where we are.
Have we passed subsection 3?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
are on subsection 3.

Not yet; we

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
We are discussing something else that is
to come on afterwards. Is that it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. The
whole economy of these clauses will indicate that clause 3, which provides for a
Deputy Minister, will end when this Act is
proclaimed, and that clause 4 will be substituted for clause 3, inasmuch as under
clause 4 the Comptroller who will be appointed will be the gentleman who occupies
the position of Deputy Minister, and whose
position will be abolished when the Act is
proclaimed.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
As has been stated by my honourable friend
sitting just behind me (Hon. Mr. Reid),
the legislation we already have would bring
about everything that this Bill brings about,
with one exception. It would not affect
the name of the Department, and I suppose the Government bring in this Bill in
this way because they want to give a new
name to the Department taking in all three
services, and the present legislation would
not allow a change of name. That could
be easily cured, however, by a special Act
for that purpose. But I am not quarrelling with the Government because they wish
to proceed in this way. The main thing
is to know what the Government proposes
to do, and then to determine whether that
is the wisest thing to be done. At the
last session of this louse when we discussed this question, I understood that
clause 4 was struck out; there was a vote
taken in the Chamber, ind I understod
that the majority was against the clause.
Hon. Mr. REID.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND. My honourable friend is in error. It was an amendment which I had proposed to the clause
which was rejected, and we were still
on the motion to adopt chen clause vhen the
Committee rose.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That brings us back to the clause as we
have it before us now. The main point,
to my mind, is whether or not a Comptroller is necessary. I have not had that made
clear to me. I fail to see what a fourth
man or a third man put into the new Department to control the financial portion of
it would have to do. The honourable
leader of the Government has said that
there are different cheques, different
methods of payment. But, surely, if we
have not a uniform method, it is quite
necessary that we should have it; and it
is quite easy for us to get it. What is
done in the Naval Department? An ofcer performs his duty, and at the end of
the month he gets his pay cheque. An
officer in the Air Department does the
same; an officer in the Militia Department
does the same. There is no difference at
all in the matter. You simply have to find
out whether the service bas been performed
and what pay is attached to it, and to
issue the cheque. No Comptroller on earth,
nor a thousand of them brought in, could
alter that state of things. If you have a
different kind of cheque in one department
from what you have in another, and a
different method of payment, which I doubt
very much, then all that is necessary is to
make uniform, as it should be, the method
of payment in all departments. I think
we have that at the present time.
Then, what is the new Comptroller to do?
Is he to stand over three other men in the
three departments who certify and check
out the payments to the men who have performed the services, and see that they do
their work with the proper kind of ink
and the proper kind of flourish to the signatures? What can he do in that? He has
no power at all. The duties are there,
and the way in which they are performed is
plain to be seen. If the Comptroller cannot do that, what else can he do? You may
say, and I have heard it said, that he
would have charge of the purchasing department. But, if T understand aright, we have
a Purchasing Department for all departments, and the purchases are made according to the methods prescribed, and with the
co-operation of the Purchasing Department.
What happens when a purchase is to be
made? The Minister of the Department

MAY 17, 1922
decides that sornething should be purchased;
hie goes through the regular form, and an
application or requisition is put in; that
goes before the proper officer of the Department; hie co-operates with the Purchasing Department, and the purchase is made
by tender or in sorne other way. In what
way can the Comptroller operate to change
or make better the process that we have at
the present tirne? I cannot for the life of
me see what hie is to do.
If, however, it is in the mind of the
Governrnent ta take the Militia Department, the Naval Service, and the Air Service and to go into an investigation as to
whether they are over-lapping each other
in their duties; whether there are more
clerks that are necessary; whether there are
obsolete rnethads of business employed
which should be done away with and replaced by modern methods; I could understand that a Comptroller might be of very
great benefit in that respect.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Could not that be
done by the Deputy Minister?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It could be, one would think; but sornetimes
At requires a f resh breeze, an outside breeze,
te clear the air; and rnay be if an up-todate, efficient business man were brought
into that Departrnent, hie could go through
it and find out just what was being done
and whether obsolete methods were being
used. There are departments in the Government to-day which, in spite of ail the
printing presses that have been devised, are
stili following the old rnethod of writing
cheques by hand, and duplicating thern by
hand-writing thern over again, one, two, or
three times. At least, they were doing that
nat very long aga, and I doubt if conditions
have changed very xnuch since. There are
rnethads of accounting used in some of the
departments which would not be allowed in
any other business establishmnent; methods
trammelled by long custom and which
give employrnent to rnany people whose
services might be dispensed with if tabulating machines and new methods were introduced. New methods have been introduced
in some departmnents. They could be introduced here. 1 can see how an up-to-date,
outaide business head brought in and with
that work set before hirn could do great
things in the way of improvement.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is the same oid
breeze that is carning in here.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is what 1 say. Even Senators, bright

237

and brisk as they are, do f ail into the habit
that old custom has wrapped around them.
Deputy heads and officers in branches are
no exception to the rule: what they find
being done when they corne, they continue
doing.
I arn ail for a Comptroller or a controiling agency, if you put hirn or it at that
sort of business; but I doubt whether haisting in a man who has been in this Department for a good many years, who probably
is not acquainted with up-to-date business
methods, and putting hirn at the work of
overseeing the accountants who are now
there would be of very great assistance.
That is why I have difficulty in seeing the
necessity of a Cornptroller; and I do not
think it has been rnade quite clear yet just
what the Cornptroiler isi suppased to do, and
just why that business is not now or may nlot
be thoroughly well done by the accountants
already in the Service.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think it would
be much better if the Government would
just corne forward and say they want to
inake a place for a valuable officer who has
been a long time in the service. Let them
take the public into their confidence. There
is not one of us in this House, 1 think, who
would abject to proper provision being mnade
for Mr. Desbarats, who has been a good
officer, and who bas -done rnost excellently
well. But why not be square with the
public, and say: "This man should not
be turned out on the street; ýhe joined the
Service a long time ago, and his service,
in years, bas stili sorne tirne to run." I
do not think services of that kind should
be discarded as you would throw off an aid
shoe; 'but do not think you should go on
multiplying these positions when they are
not necessary by adding a fourth man to
the three who are now performing the
services.
As the honourable -gentleman from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
bas already said, it rnight be a good thing
if a new man were to corne in and make
changes along the line of efficiency. I arn
nlot an efficiency crank; 1 think you can
have too much efflciency; yau may have
efficiency until you destroy your departBut there are some things in
ment.
modern methods thýat are of advantage,
and which should be introduced; and if
I were a Minister of the Crown I should
have my Deputy attend to his department,
and make it efficient, or, if hie could not,
hie would have to find another place. 1
say that ail this work should be done by

238

SENATE

the Deputy Ministers; they are the men
who are responsible; and if they have not
the ability to organize their departments
they have no business occupying the positions which they do.
I am sure the Deputy of this Department is a very efficient man, if he is the
man whom I have in my eye just now.
Therefore, I say to the Government: "Take
care of Mr. Desbarats, who has been a faithful servant of the Crown; but do it in
another way; do it honestly and squarely,
and let the country know that you are
doing it."
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: To some extent I
agree with the remarks of the honourable
gentleman who has just taken his seat.
He says: "Let us do this quite frankly and
openly, and say that we are looking after
Mr. Desbarats." J take it that the Government is doing that very thing. But the
point I should like to make is this. If
they say, "We are taking care of Mr. Desbarats," is there any reason why they
should not? Has anyone in this House or
in the other House got anything to say
against his efficiency? If he is efficient, and
if at the present time there is a reorganization going on, why should Le not be placed
in the position of Comptroller?
The honourable gentleman says that the
Deputy Minister should do this work. To
my mind it would be an utter impossibility
for the Deputy Minister to take care from
time to time of all the finances of his Department. One houourable gentleman said,
and his argument appealed to me most
strongly; "Suppose you were amalgamating
large concerns, would you not, if different
heads were being brought in, bring in a
man who would have charge of the finances
alone?" That, it seems to me, is a most
reasonable proposition; and that, if I understand it aright, is what is being done
here to-day. Three separate departments,
the Air Force, the Naval Force, and the
Land Force, are being brought together in
an amalgamation. I take it that there
have been officers of these various departments connected with the finances of each
separate unit. To-day, as I understand it,
it is the wish that from a common purse
shall come the money to pay each of the
officers of these separate departments, so
that all the moneys may go out under one
head. Could anything be more reasonable
than to say that a man who bas served
the Government for many years, and who,
as I understand, has performed very valuable services, and who, as I have been told,
perhaps privately, bas reorganized some of
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

the departments and put them in working
order, is the very man to put in to reorganize these departments?
The honourable gentleman from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) says that we have
the Act of 1918, under which this might
alil be done by Order in Council. Very
true, it might.
But, as be expressly
pointed out, after the Order in Council is
passed a special Act has practically to be
passed to enable the legislation to be carried out.
Hon. Mr. REID: I said that the Act was
passed after the War Measures Act. Of
course, when the War Measures Act ceased
to be operative, we had to pass a special
Act giving power to carry out the amalgamation; but it did not apply only to the
Customs and Inland Revenue Department.
It was a general Act, so that future amalgamations could be carried out under its
provisions if the Government saw fit.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: And by analogy,
therefore, it should be done by Order in
Council. I take exception to that. Here
is an Act expressly setting out what it is
going to do, and not making two bites of
a cherry. This particular appointment is
not being referred to the Civil Service
Commission, and one Act is doing holus
bolus what two Acts were necessary to do
before. Here is an Act which amalgamates these three Departments and appoints a Comptroller without any reference
whatever to the Civil Service Commission,
and which, as my honourable friend has
said, clearly and fairly states what is
going to be done, and asks the approval of
the House.
So far as I can see, the amalgamation
is a proper thing. The honourable leader
of the Government has explained that
there will be a saving of 25 per cent. If
we can save 25 of our enormous military expenditure, what a great thing we
are doing for the people of this country.
If We are going to help in that by the
appointment of a man against whom, so
far as I have beard, there is not the
slightest breath of suspicion, either as to
his honesty or his capabilities, and are
going to pay him a salary of $6,000, then
I say, in spite of all the arguments I have
heard, that to my mind this action is absolutely in keeping with a policy of retrenchment, and the Bill ought to be carried
through to a conclusion.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I regret very much
that I have not been able to make myself
understood by the honourable gentleman
from Sarnia (Hon. Mr. Pardee).
I do

MAY 17, 1922
flot know whether the fault lies in Mny
jack of power of expression, or in the honourabie gentlemnan's jack of power of assimilation. I have made no attack upon
Mr. Desharats.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: I did nat say you
did.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I spoke in the
highest ternis of his capacity.
Hon. 'Mr. PARDEE: May I say ta the
honourable gentleman that I stated he did
not niake any attack. That is exactly niy
argument, that no attack has been nmade.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But then it does
not f oliow that an unnecessary officer shahl
be appointed sirnpiy because the nian ta be
appointed is a very efficient persan. If the
position is unnecessary, then it is not in
the interest af econoniy, and what I pointed
out was this, that there were three officiais
perforrning that task of looking alter the
financial end of the Departnient; that this
proposai was sirnpiy adding a fourth when
three were sureiy enough, and that it wouid
have been rnuch better if they had been
reduced ta one. I said that if the Government wanted ta provide for Mr. Desharats
-and 1 wouldhold up bath hands in f avaur
of their doing so-then they ought ta do
it squarely and openiy, and not by any
subterfuge such as this. Tehe Minîster
stated that the proposed change wouid reduce the cost by twenty-five per cent, and
yet the only evidence the Government
brings forward is ta put in another officiai,
a $6,000 one, who is flot required. That is
ail the evidence that has been adduced this
afternaon. Therefore I do not see much
econorny in the proposai. This is a tume
when we need econoniy. An amalgamiation
af services that wiil elîiinate unnecessary
persans is very essentiai at this. very tume,
when not only are we paying in indirect
taxation, but we are-each of us who 'is
fortunate enough ta have an incarne beyond a certain point-paying directiy tawards the support of Federai institutions.
It behooves us ta see that that nioney is
expended properly and not wastefuliy.
Therefore anything the Governnient does
along economical lines, without at the sane
time dropping services unnecessariiy or ta
the point of extinction, I shahl be prepared ta support. I should be prepared ta
support the Governrnent in any measure
it brought forward for putting Mr. Desbarats in such a position that he shouid
not lose by this amalgamnation. At the
sanie tume let us not add 'unnecessary
officiais.

239

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of niy honourable friend to
the fact that by the same Bill we are dispensing with the Deputy Minister. The
honourable gentleman rnay answer that he
fiuids the same party under another titie,
that of Comptroller; but the opinion was
expressed by the Minister of iMilitia that
the Cornptroller would very often have opportunities to save nioney; that he would
save the amount of his salary perhaps in
a nionth, and certainly in a year. The
duties of the Comptroller wiil not be siRniply
to see that cheques are directed to the proper parties. My right honourable friend
froni Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) was wondering what would be the
function of the Coniptroiler when cheques
of settied amounts were to be issued
rnonthly or bi-nionthly to different parties.
He stated that this was simply clericai
work. 1 amn informed that in the three
services, Militia, Air Force and Navy, there
are allowances, miade ta various parties;
which are not alile froni nonth to nionth;
that they vary accordîng to the character
of the service perfornied, and a close check
rnust be kept upon these allowances; that
every month there are discussions between
the Accountant and the clairnant, and that
these disputes very often reaeh the Deputy
Minister. The Comptroller will have occasion to study those various systenis. Mr.
Desharats already knows the difficulties in
his own departnient. He will bring to his
new office the experience acquired in that
department and will try to co-ordinate those
varions services, at the sanie time keeping
close watch on the ailowances, which represent thousands and thousands of dollars,
and which vary rnonthly at each paynient.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: As 1 stated the
other day, I amn very niuch in favour of
the generai principie of this Bill to aniaiganiate three departments in one. My
idea then was tbat this was to be done
altogether for the purpose of efficiency and
economy, and on that basis I arn supporting the nieasure. But if you anialgarnate
three departmnents it is reasonabie ta suppose that fewer mien wili be able ta do the
work. We have at the present time three
mien who, as niy honourable friend frani
Kings and Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowier) says,
are Iooking after the financial, end, and
now it is proposed ta bring in a third man
ta do the work that those three have been
doing in the past, aithough the work wiii
be a great deai iess alter the amialgamation than it has been hitherta. It daes
not seeni to nie that the proposition is at

240

SENATE

all reasonable. If the expenditure rested
with the payments to be made from now
on to Mr. Desbarats, I should not think
much about the matter, but there is not a
man of us who does not know differently.
We know that if that comptrollership is
authorized, there will be a Comptroller in
that department longer than any one here
will live. There is no question about that
at all. We have all seen that sort of
thing happen time and time again.
Mr. Desbarats, as I said a moment ago,
is sixty years of age: why not provide for
him by superannuation? Let me point out
to the honourable leader of the Government the statement made in the other
House that already 400 temporary clerks
had been dismissed.
Those temporary
clerks were probably all getting less than
$1,000 per year. Has there been any
great care taken in looking after them,
such as there is now for this one man?
And this man is in such a position that
the Government can look after him along
proper lines and do it thoroughly well. It
is stated that 300 more temporary clerks
or officials in the combined departments
are to be let out. They will not get any
special consideration. And for one particular official, whom we are able properly
to look after, a position is being made.
You cannot get away from that fact: a
position is bein1g made for him. I do not
think that is a good thing to do, and I am
sure the Government, on second thought,
would not feel at all hurt if that proposal
were not adopted in this Senate. Give Mr.
Desbarats all that is due him. Do not
treat him shabbily in any way. Any man,
who bas devoted as many years as he bas
to the service of his country, and rendered
such efficient service, is deserving of full
consideration. Give him that consideration, but do not saddle upon the country
for the next fifty or one hundred years a
new position that is absolutely unnecessary, by putting four men to do the work
that three men have been doing and by
paying the fourth man far more than is
being paid any of the three.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, this is the third sitting
within which we have given consideration to this Bill. It might not be out of
place to review for a few moments what
we have already accomplished. When this
Bill came down from the House of Commons, it came, I suppose necessarily, in
the form in which we find it before us.
The Government bas already conceded, I
think, most of the contentions which have
Hon.

Mr. TURRIFF.

been advanced from this side of the House
by way of objection to the Bill. It was
proposed, practically, that we should have
three Deputy Ministers. Under subsection
1 of section 5 there was to be a Deputy
Minister of National Defence; under subsection 3 of section 5 the present Deputy
Minister of the Naval Service was to continue filling that position; and under subsection 4 my honourable friend the leader
of the Government proposed that the
Comptroller should also be a Deputy Minister. So the Government had in contemplation three Deputy Ministers. After
the discussion in this Chamber the Government, apparently, bas been fully convinced that three Deputy Ministers are
entirely unnecessary, and we have the
number of deputies practically reduced to
one. That in itself is a concession to which
we may attach a great deal of value, and
it means a considerable reformation of the
Bill.
In the next place, my honourable friend
the leader of the Government bas intimated
to the House that the Government is prepa-red to withdraw subsections 5 and 6
of section 5. Those subsections practi'cally
made provision for the appointment of the
officers of the amalgamateid departments
by the Ministers themselves.
The withdrawal of those subsections is a valuable
concession, inasmuch as they would clearly
be an evasion of the Civil Service Act.
These subsections being withdrawn, we are
falling back upon the Civil Service Commission, leaving them to exercise their own
discretion in the appointment of officers;
we are putting into operation the general
machinery under the Civil Service statute.
So up to the present time we have accomplished considerable in dealing with this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Subsection 6
also I intend to withdraw.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsection 6, as honourable gentlemen will see,
proposed that a considerable period of time
should be added in calculating the retiring
allowance of the different officers who
should be superannuated or whose offices
were to bhe abolished.
I venture to say
that what the Senate has accomplished in
dealing with subsection 6 of section 5
means a saving of several hundred thousand
dollars annually.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: We are ýalways saving money to the country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
why we aire here. So the Senate has been

MAY 17, 1922
functioning very successfully, it seems to
me, since this Bill was presented to us for
consideration.
We have discussed the retention of the
services of Mr. Desbarats, the present
Deputy Minister of Naval Service, in the
office of Comptroller.
It seems to me that
if we gave effect to what was proposed the
situation we shkuld have to face would be
this, that Mr. Desbarats would be superannuated and would doubtless draw a
superannuation allowance from the exchequer of Canada approximating $4,500
or $5,000 annually, and, in addition to that,
the Department would appoint a Comptroller who would receive another $5,000 or
$6,000 a year.
If we do not give authority to the Government to appoint a Comptroller, and if the suggestion of my honourable friend from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr.
Calder) is carried out, the Government can
go about the matter in another way.
Through the Civil Service Commission or
by some other means, they can -appoint an
official who will be charged w'ith the financial duties incident to the administration of
the department, and ýwho will be paid a
salary under the sanction of either an
Order in Council or an order of the Civil
Service Commission.
Consequently we
shall save that amount of money: we shall
prevent the superannuation of the present
Deputy Minister of Naval' Affairs, and we
shall have the advantage of his services as
Comptroller, paying him only one salary.
Under these circumstances, honourable gentlemen, I think we should be justified in
accepting the amendment of my honourable friend from Moosejaw, and reframing
the clause in the way suggested.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Let the amendment
be read.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN (reading):
The Governor in Council, on the recommendatien of the Minister, may appoint for a period
not exceeding six months an officer who shall,
in relation to the Naval Service, administer,
exercise and perform ail the powers, duties and
functions vested in or exercisable by the Deputy
Minister of the Naval Service by or under The
Naval Service Act, and who while holding such
office shall have the rank and salary of a
Deputy Head of a Department, and shall be a
member of the Defence Council.

The amendment of Hon. Mr. Calder was
agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Now the
other amendment.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN (reading):
That subsection 4 be struck out and the following be substituted instead thereof:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Subsection-s 4
and 5.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Subsections
4, 5 and 6.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: And 6.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ter say subsection 4.

We had bet-

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
section 4 substitute:

For sub-

At the expiration of sixty days from the
coming into force cf this Act by proclamation
as provided by section 11, the officer appointed
under subsection (3) of this section shaîl become and be known as Comptroller and shah,
under the fDeputy Minister of National Defence,
be charged with al financial matters pertaining
to the Department. The Comptroller shall be
paid an annual salary of $6,000.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: No; "not exceeding
$6,000."
Hon. Mr. REID: May I ask the Chairman if the words, "not exceeding $6,000,"
have been added?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Yes, "an
annual salary neot exceeding $6,000."
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Calder was
agreed to.
On subsection 5 of section 5-holder of
any position abolished may be appointed to
another position:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that
subsection 5 be struck out.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was agreed to.
On subsection 6-provision for Retirement, Superannuation or Pension for Employees:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that
subsection 6 also be struck out.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was agreed to.
Sections 6 and 7 were agreed to.
On section 8-Defence Council:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: In line 3, page 3, the
words should be "subsections three and
four."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why not say,
"under the provisions of this Act," without referring to any section?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am inclined to
think the section should stand just as it is.
Subsection 3 of section 5 provides for the
appointment of an officer who will look after
naval affairs. If you simply say, "an officer under this Act," who is it? What officer

S-16
REvIsED EDITION

SENATE
is it? Subsection 3 of section 5 specifically
names the officer to carry out certain duties,
and there should be specific reference to
that officer in this section.
Hon. Mr. REID: I think the question
raised by the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa is very important, because section
8 reads, at line 25,
In the event of no ofTicer being appointed under the provisions of the said subsection three
of section five of this Act. . .

Subsection 3, as we have passed it, states
that he will be a member of the Defence
Council during the six months, but if you
leave this in it conflicts with the subsection
as we have passed it. I suggest that those
words "subsection three" be struck out.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Subsection 3 of section 5 provides for an officer who shall hold
office for a period not exceeding six months.
Then subsection 4 provides that the saine
officer shall, at the expiration of 60 days
after the Act cornes into force, be appointed Comptroller. Now, this section
merely provides that while this officer is
holding the position of looking after naval
affairsDuring six
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
months as a maximum.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As a maximum, that
then he shall exercise the duties of Deputy
Minister as defined in the Naval Service

Act; so I think the section. should stand
just as it is.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Might I inquire from the Government, along the line
of the inquiry made a few days ago, as to
whether or not the members of this Defence Council are to receive compensation
in addition to their regular salary for this
service?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: None whatever.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then I assume
there would be no objection to making that
clear in the section. I would therefore
move that section 8, line 1, be amended to
read, after the word "Council":
The members of whom shall not be paid any
additional salary or remuneration therefor.

Then there can be no question as to the

intent of the section.
Would the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman put his question
again, because there is one official who,
as Vice-President of the Council, receives
an emolument, but that is the only one in
the service.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I rather fail
to see the necessity of putting the question the second time, now that it has been
answered, unless you want to amend the
answer.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have to
qualify the answer. I said none whatever,
but I did not know just what the honourable gentleman was covering by his question.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the occasion for an amendment of that kind?
The money will not be paid out to anybody
unless it is voted by Parliament. Then
would be the time to discuss it. We are
anticipating the action of Parliament in
voting on that. I do not think this is
the time to deal with that at all.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does the Defence
Council take the place of the Militia Council?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My recollection of the remuneration paid to members of the Militia Council is this, that up
to a comparatively recent period the members

of the

Militia

Council

received

a

salary; but within a recent period that
allowance was merged into their regular
salary, thus giving them a salary consid-

erably in excess of the amount which they
had been previously receiving. I fail to
understand why there should be a Council
within the Department, the members receiving compensation for what normally
constitutes the work of the Department.
It is essential that the work that is done by
this so-called Defence Council, or the Militia
Council in the past, should be performed
by way of administering the Militia
of the Dominion. It seems to me that
unless the clause is amended, as now
proposed by my honourable friend who
has moved the amendment, there is nothing
to prevent our reverting to the old practice
of allowing the different members of that
Council a special remuneration for the
services which they are performing as
members thereof.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT. But that would
be by vote of Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
might be, but we are here to restrain
Parliament by general legislation, if necessary, and it seems to me we are in a better

position to give consideration to a subject
of this kind now in dealing with this Act
than to leave

the

question open

as to

MAY 17, 1922
whether or flot an amount should be carrîed
into the Estimates for that purpose. 0f
course, Parliament could override this
proposed amendment at any tinie by voting
an honorariuni if they chose to do so; but
I feel satisfied that the practice is pernicious of allowing the officers of any department to draw salary separate from
their main salary because of performing
duties which are essential to the office which.
they hold.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: One of the
reasons that prompted me to suggest this
amendment was the fact that to my knowledge certain officers in the Militia Department were receiving compensation over and
above their stated salaries for rendering

243

service to the Department. I knew that this
was the cause of dissatisfaction among
Deputy Ministers and other officers in
other departments of the Government. I
do not think we ought to establish such a
precedent, and that when we have a chance
of preventing such an abuse froni going
further, by putting in a plug in this way,
we should take advantage of such a situation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am going to
give the House a practical table of salaries
paid to military officers in Canada, Great
Britain, and the United States. It will
provide a fair point of departure for
further discussion of this niatter:

(a) Plus allowances as fixed by President.

The point 1 want to make in reading
this table is that in Canada the corresponding ranks are paid less than they are
in Great Britain and the United States,
comparing Canada with the United States,
we are about two grades behind, that is
to say, a lieutenant in the United States
draws more than a Canadian captain; the
Arnerican captain draws almost as much
as a Canadian lieutenant-colonel, and s0
on throughout. I think it important for
the House to know that, having regard
to pay in those three English-speaking
countries, both in the field and in peace
time, the Canadian officer perfornis precisely similar service, equally efficient, for
a good deal less money than is paid in
those other countries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is only
one meinber of the Militia Council who receives an additional remuneration at present; that is the Vice-president, who is
also the Deputy Minister of Milîtia. As
a member of the Militia Council, as Vicepresident, as an officer of the permanent
force, and as the officer second in duty, he
receives, outside of bis salary as Deputy
Minister, $4,500 a year over and above
his civil salary. Now, I take for granted
S-16J

that this amendmnent vwill cut off from the
Vice-president of the Defence Council his
salary as such, -which he bas received for
the last few years. It is for the Senate
to decide that it will, with a clear knowledge of the situation, -eliminate that salary
henceforth. If it does, of course it nmeans
in the present instance the immediate
withdrawal of the present Deputy Minister of Militia from the service of the
country. His salary to-day is $10),500, and
this amendment would reduce it by $4,500.
Former governments decided that it was
opportune and judicious thus to remunerate that officer.
The proposed amendment, if adopted, will inaugurate a new
policy, and of course with the consequence
that I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: What is the
salary of the Deputy Minister?

Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

$6,000 as

Deputy Minister, and $4,500 as Vicechairman of the Defence Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn afraid,
from what has been said now :by the
leader, that we cannot entertain the amendment proposed, because it is in the nature
of a money vote.,

* SENATE
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; we
are saving money.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This House has
no authority to entertain an amendment of
that kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I want to call
my honourable friend to order. He himself, being a member of this Chamber,
joined unanimously in voting a resolution
affirming our right to amend Money Bills.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that he was
most insistent a few moments ago in suggesting that these allowances should be
placed in the Estimates.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; I merely
said that Parliament would have to vote
them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is nothing to prevent the Government from
placing in the Estimates any additional
compensation for the Deputy Minister of
Militia as a member of the Militia Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was absolutely
consistent. I said we could not deal with
it because it was a matter for the House
of Commons to vote on-a matter for the
Estimates. My position a moment ago was
the position I am taking now. You have
no authority to deal with this, because it
is dealing with money provisions.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen will recollect that before proposing the amendment I asked the honourable leader of the Government whether or
not any members of the Defence Council
would receive compensation in addition to
the pay they received in the service, and
the answer was that they would not. Now
it appears that the answer was incorrect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was because I did not understand the question,
and when I realized that it covered all of
the members I made the qualification.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Quite unintentionally on the part of my honourable
friend, I might say, but nevertheless it
does seem to me to have brought out the
very difficulty that caused me to introduce
the matter. It has brough.t out vividly
the fact that that disparity does exist. The
honourable leader of the Government has
indicated that the Deputy Minister of
Militia, by reason of his military rank, has
been considered as entitled to receive some
extra compensation. If the Government so
Hon. -Mr. BEUCIOURT

desire, there certainly ought to be nothing
to prevent them continuing that; but it
does seem to me that it is entirely within
the jurisdiction of this House to determine
whether or not it wishes to put a preventive clause in this Bill that will, if
adopted, prevent half a dozen different gentlemen of the Civil Service, employed in
the Department of National Defence, from
receiving additional compensation as menbers of the Defence Council. This House,
if I understand the procedure, bas a perfect
right to refuse to pass an estimate or a
money Bill sent over by the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, we have no
such power as that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
the right to reject any Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But we cannot
reject an item.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I submit that
this is not an item. It is a general statement that there shall be no remuneration
for this additional service, if it is regarded
as an additional service, which I think it
should not be. If I am correct in assuming that this amendment does not prevent
the Government from continuing to deal
with the Deputy Minister as generously as
it bas done in the past, then I desire that
it may carry.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
this Bill first came up for consideration
I asked the leader of the Government what
salaries were paid to members of the
Militia Council. I understood at that time
that no additional amounts were being paid
to members of that Council; but I ventured
to say that from the time this legislation
creating the Militia Council was placed
upon the statute book, the Exchequer of
Canada had paid no less than a couple
of hundred thousand dollars to members
of the Council who were simply performing
their duties as officials of the Militia Department. Before we finally pass this
Bill, I should like to ask my honourable
friend to furnish the House with information as to the total amount paid to members of the Militia Council, as members of
that Council, since its creation.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: In addition to
their regular salaries.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have taken the
position that we in this House can deal
with Money Bills. We have claimed the

MAY 17, 1922
right to deal with them the moment they
come to this House from the House of
Commons, and our claim was unanimously
upheld in this House a few years ago, and
was sùpported by opinions of eminent lawyers after a study of the question. But,
under the Constitution, all Money Bills
have to be introduced in the House of Commons, and I am inclined to think that the
point raised by the honourable gentleman
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) is well
taken, and for this reason: that this is
not a Money Bill, and that the amendment
of the honourable gentleman would tend to
make it a Money Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Quite
the contrary: it was a Money Bill before.
It is a question
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
whether money shall or shall not be paid,
and it is in the nature of a Money Bill
and therefore cannot come within the jurisdiction of this House before being introduced in the House of Commons by way
of resolution or otherwise.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Is it correct that
the Deputy Minister of Justice receives

$10,000 per annum? If so, do any other

Deputy Ministers receive an amount exceeding $6,000?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I have
already had occasion to state that the Deputy Minister of Justice, and also the Deputy Minister of Finance, get $10,000. I
may say that $10,000 is a very small remuneration indeed for a Deputy Minister
of Justice who can perform his duties to
the satisfaction of the Minister in charge.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: I quite agree.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ten thousand
dollars for the Deputy Minister of Finance is also, to my mind, in view of the
amounts paid to managers of financial institutions, a very moderate salary to be
paid to a man who is fit to discharge the
duties of Deputy Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That only indicates that there is ample precedent to enable the Government to adjust the salary
cf the Deputy Minister of Militia if in their
opinion it should be done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Senate
will bear in mind the importance of the
position of the Deputy Minister of Militia
and the responsibility which was upon his
shoulders during the years from 1914.
Here is a Department which before the war
was spending, I suppose, $10,000,000 or $12,000,000 a year, and whcse budget during

q
the war went beyond $500,000,000 in the
various services that had to be created,
I thi'nk hondeveloped and mainta.ined.
ourable gentlemen will recognize that if
the Deputy Minister was equal to his task,
the amount voted to him and gradually increased was a very modest one, and quite
justifiable.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend say whether there is any
objection to that salary being increased
in precisely the same way as were those
of the Detputy Minister of Justice and the
I am sure
Deputy Minister of Finance?
that Parliament is only too glad to give
every recognition to the valuable services
of any official, and to pay a salary commensurate with the services rendered. But
that salary should be paid in the open light
of day; it should not be done by means of
The public should know
any subterfuge.
that it is being paid; it 'should not be hidden
by some obscure provision in a statute
I
about which the public know nothing.
may say to my honourable friend that this
is the first opportunity I have had of ascertaining that information.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It has been in
the Estimates every year, has it not?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. This
is the first information I have had that
the Deputy Minister of Mil-itia was paid
$4,500 by reason of being a member of
the Militia Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How is it voted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE.D: In the
departmental salaries, I fancy. , This is
the first occasion on which I have known
that the other memJbers of the Militia
Council have not rece'ntly been paid a
special allowance as members of that CounThe public, particularly members of
cil.
Parliament, should be in possession of that
information.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What are the
amounts?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
informed to-day that the Deputy Minister
of Militia is drawing a salary of $4,500
as Deputy Chairman of the Militie Council.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And what is it
for the others?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I always
understood, until my honourable friend
answered my question the other day, that
the other members of the Militia Coundil
drew a special allowance as members of
that Council.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What does the
leader of the Government say now? Do
they or do they not draw allowances, and,
if so, how much?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arm informed
that between 1916 and 1920 $1,000 was paid
to each member of the Council over and
above 'his salary.
They were all permanent officers, and as such were entitled to a
-salary. That additional pay'ment was cancelled, and thereafter the officers received
only the salaries of their offices.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: When was it cancelled?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In 1920. Now,
with the exception of the Deputy Minister,
Who acts as vice-president, they receive
nothing as members of the Militia Couneil.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: By what
authority were those allowances paid?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Under sections 6, 8, and 9 of the Militia Pensions
Act, and section 4 of the Militia Act.
My honourable friend says that if the
Government feel that the Deputy Minister of Militia should receive an amount
equal to that received by the Deputy Minister of Justice or the Deputy Minister of
Finance, or more, they can pay him
separately, but in a bulk sum, so that there
will be nothing hidden and it will all be
aboveboard. I may say that if anyone in
this Chamber has failed to notice the
amount this Deputy Minister bas received,
it is because these figures are generally
contained in the Appropriation Act, which
is never examined in detail in this House.
I am informed, however, that these figures
have been given yearly to the House of
Commons, and have been voted regularly
and separately and in detail. It is natural that we should not be au fait unless
by a special inquiry answered by the Department concerned. I think it would be
an error for the Government to fix the salary
of the Deputy Minister of Militia at $10,000,
similar to that of the Deputy Minister of
Justice, because the Deputy Minister of
Militia may to-morrow be a civilian and
not entitled to pay as a permanent officer.
When the present Deputy Minister of
Militia was appointed he was a member
of the permanent force, and received, and
continued to receive, his salary, in addition
to that of Deputy Minister. The amount
he received as a member of the permanent
force performing duties on the Militia
Council, and performing them as practically the head of the Department-because
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

everyone knows the Minister himself would

confide the heavy duties to his representative-had

gradually

increased

according

to the services he was rendering. My impression is that in the present instance it
would be wise not to try to increase the
salary of the Deputy Minister of Militia,
because the one who may follow may not
be in the same position, and perhaps would
not be entitled to the increased amount.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend say why section 8 of
the Bill should be retained? There is no
more necessity for a Defence Council than
there is for a fifth wheel to a coach.
There are other departments

having

in-

ternal committees, operating along the same
lines as this Council, the members of which
never dream of asking additional compensation. Take, for instance, the Department
of the Interior. There is a Power Board
in that Department, charged with equally
important duties, made up of officers of
the Department, who are only too glad
to contribute their services in the administration of their duties. May I ask this
Chamber what would become of this new
Department if we were to strike out this
clause? Would it not be administered in
the same way that it is administered today? My disposition would be te strike
out the clause and thus dispense with the
necessity of discussing a subject which has
always excited more or less unpleasant
discussion, namely, that of whether the
salaries of officers of the Department should
be diminished. I venture to say with confidence that the Militia Council was brought
into existence for the purpose of giving
additional remuneration to the officers who
constitute it. It was never brought into
existence by reason of any absolute necessity for it, because it never performed duties
outside of the duties of the Department
itself. I venture to say that if to-day this
clause were stricken out, the work of national defence would go on just the same.

It is the duty of the executive officers of
this Department to perform in the ordinary

course all the duties that may appertain to
a Defence Council; and I think, honourable gentlemen, that we should seriously
consider whether there is any necessity
for a Council of this kind. If there is a
necessity for it in the Militia Department,
there is an equal necessity for a council
in every one of the twenty odd departments of the Government. We should amend
the section in the way suggested, or strike
it out entirely.

MAY 17, 1922
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It seems to
me that the remarks of the leader of the
Opposition are very much to the point.
I agree with the leader of the Government
when he says that the Deputy Minister
of Finance should receive a good salary,
perhaps more than the $10,000 he is
getting now. The Deputy Minister of
Finance must be a man of ability, a man
who could command a large salary outside of the Government; and the same remark applies to the Deputy Minister of
Justice. Now, I desire to ask for information. How long have we been adding
$4,500 to the salary of the Deputy Minister of Militia-or about how long?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Deputy
Minister has been in receipt of the $4,500
as vice-chairman of the Militia Council
since the year 1917.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is what
I thought. I have no doubt that during
the war the Deputy Minister of Militia had
a great many extra services to perform,
and it was right that he should receive a
larger salary. We have been told over
and over again, and we hope it is true,
that the war is over, and if I understand
correctly the remarks of the honourable
leader of the Opposition, it is no longer
necessary for it to perform the duties that
had to be performed during the war. In
my opinion, if I have the right information, there is no good reason why the
Deputy Minister of Militia should any
longer receive an extra salary of $4,500.
He should not receive that extra remuneration any more than the Deputy Minister of the Interior, as has been pointed
out by the honourable leader of the Opposition. It seems to me that if we continue these additional salaries in connection with the Department of Militia and
and the Naval Service, when they are
amalgamated, it will not be very long
before we shall be asked to give additional
salaries to the Deputy Minister of the Interior and other Deputies. I agree absolutely with the remarks which the honourable leader of the Opposition made the last
time he spoke.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should'like to
reply to the observations of the honourable
-leader of the Opposition on the two points
that he has raised: firstly, whether there
ought to be a Militia Council, and secondly,
whether the members of it ought to be
paid for their services anything in addition to their salaries.

247

There is no analogy between the Department of Militia and any other Department
with respect to this particular matter; at
least, I can think of none. In administering the Department of the Interior or
the Department of Publie Works you are
not dealing with the same sort of proposition, or the same sort of people. It
is an entirely different proposition. Our
Militia Council is based primarily on the
Military Council in England for the government of the army. There is also a
Military Council in India, and a Military
Council in each of the other British Dominions, for the government of the army,
and the reasons why we have a Militia
Council are the same reasons as exist in
those other countries.
The Defence Council, according to this
section of the Bill, will consist of the Minister, the Deputy Minister, the accountant
officer, whoever he may be, and four other
persons. Now, those four other persons
will represent four different ideas in the
government of our army-four distinct
branches of the service, which must be coThose
ordinated under 'one leadership.
branches are the General Staff, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster General,
and the Master General of the Ordnance.
These men cannot function alone or independently. None of these men can arrive
at a decision, which is worth anything, by
himself: he must arrive at a decision with
the advice and assistance of the other
members. The Chief of the General Staff
cannot move a man without first ascertaining whether the discipline in connection
with that movement is proper-whether
arrangements have been made for transportation-whether the man is properly
Conversely, the
clothed and equipped.
Master General of the Ordnance can
come to no decision until he knows what
the Chief of the General Staff proposes.
These four branches are linked together for
the government of the army. They cannot
be separated. This is the method which
prevails all over the civilized world. There
is not now an army anywhere that has not
its General Staff and its Council; that is
to say, the heads of the departments meeting together for the purpose of co-ordinating their efforts. That is the purpose of
a military council. It exists everywhere.
It has been found by experience to be
the only method for the government of an
army since the days when the position of
Commander-in-Chief was abolished. Therefore I think we cannot get away from the
Militia Council, and I for one should be

years before I became aware of the fact
that there were in the service Deputy Ministers who were getting something in -addition te their ordinary salaries as Deputies.

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
no. Mr. Fielding, at this Session, brought
up the question as to his deputy.
,.Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think I am
right in stating that there is no Act outside the Civil Service Act that fixes the
salary of any officer in the Department.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Except the Supply
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is all done
by supply; it is all a matter of Estimates
and votes in Parliament. The salaries of
Civil Servants are not fixed by statute. I
do not see why the salary should be fixed
here at all. I do not see any occasion for
referring at all in this Bill to the question
of salary.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My honourable
friend will agree to this. In the first
place, the Supply Bill is a statute. In so
far as ordinary Civil Servants are concerned, their salaries are specifically stated
in that Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I am not
statingHon. Mr. CALDER: Pardon me just for
a moment. I say that in so far as all ordinary Civil Servants are concerned, their
salaries are set forth specifically, and
Parliament knows exactly what it is doing
in the case of every civil servant. In this
particular instance what is done is to have
a bulk vote of, say, $300,000 passed by
Parliament, and then the Governor in
Council, out of that bulk vote, without the
knowledge of Parliament, decides what
shall be paid. That is an entirely different thing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not advocating at all that the salaries of members of the Council, or any salary, should
be paid out of a bulk sum; I am quite in
accord with my honourable friend's statement that salaries, whatever they are and
to whomsoever they are to be paid, should
be specifically stated in the Estimates, but
I do not see why we are worrying over
that here in one way or another, trying
to affirm that the salary shall be so and
so, or to deny that there should be any
salary at all. I do not think it is our
business.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I can
inform my honourable friend why we are
doing it. We learned to-day for the first
time that by reason of there being a Militia
Council and there being no prohibition as
to the payment of salaries to the members
lon. Mr. BELCOURT

of that Council, salaries are being paid
them. We now propose providing that no
salary shall be paid them as members of
that Council.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is not that a
money Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it
is quite the contrary.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is a Money
Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
will take our chances on that.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Now that the Government have made it quite plain that
they want to reduce the cost of national
defence, and they have reduced the size
of the Navy and the Air Force and have
cut down very materially the amount
necessary for the annual drill, I am quite
sure that our small national defence force
can be very well administered without this
Defence Council. I therefore move that
clause 8 be struck out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I raise the point
of order-the question of jurisdiction of
this House, and I am not prepared to let
it go. I am not at all convinced by anything that has been said. However much
respect I have for the legal and constitutional opinion of my honourable friend
opposite, I am not prepared to accept his
view. I still cling to the opinion that we
have no business dealing with this question
at all-that this is a Money Bill; and I
want a decision on that point.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: We are here to save
money.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not the

point at all.
If we are going to save
mioney, we can do it in a proper way: we
have to do it in a legal and constitutional
way, or not at all.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: The proper way is
to apply safeguards.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not the
point at all.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Perhaps I can

help my honourable friend to arrive at the
point he desires to reach.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think I have
made it pretty plain where I desire to
arrive.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I presume he
refers to my amendrnent as being outside

MAY 17, 1922
the jurisdiction of this House. I have no
objection to withdraw that amendment if
my honourable friend from Amherst (Hon.
Mr. Curry) desires to move a section as
the original one; then there can be no
question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There can be no
objection, but I have won my point.
The amendment was accordingly withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. CURRY then moved that section 8 be struck out.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: I think it
might be wise for us to go somewhat
slowly on section 8. In every large concern there is a board which meets regularly to go through the work that bas
been done during the week, the fortnight,
or the month previous, and pass on that
work. The Militia Council is in the same
way functioning, each individual in his
own department, and meeting once a week
or once a fortnight as the case may be, to
go through the work that bas been done,
and find out if everything is correct. I
think I am right in saying that one officer
commanding a district is drawing $7,500
a year, in the most expensive district in
Canada. In the other districts the general
officers commanding are drawing $6,000 a
year. If we are to have the most efficient
members to deal with matters for the Government at the Militia Headquarters at
Ottawa, they must be paid for their efficient work, and I think you will agree with
me in saying that those who have been
selected for their special work in connection with the Militia Council should have.
far higher rates of pay than those who are
out in the country doing the work.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I wish to have this
one further word. I agree with the position taken by the honourable member for
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), but at the
same time there is one way in which this
can be cured. In my judgment the Government should bring down a section, setting forth the remuneration that is to be
paid to the members of this Council, and
they should proceed by resolution in the
other Chamber.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As a Money Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As a Money Bill.
The section as it stands in this Bill does
not intimate what amount is to be paid to
the members of that Council. On the other
hand, the only proposition that could be
before us would be an estimate in the
Supply Bill, which is a bulk estimate, and
does not indicate in the slightest degree

251

what amount is to be paid the members
I think the situation
of this Council.
should be met squarely. If the section is
struck out of this Bill, then it is up to
the other Chamber or to the Government
to re-introduce it in such form that we can
deal with it in the proper way.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: On the merits
of the amendment now proposed I want to
say just two words. To the public and to
every member of Parliament it will create
the impression-well it will be a reflection
on the present incumbent of the office.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am sure a
great many will take that view of it. I
want to say this, and this only, that if
ever there was a time when a reflection of
that kind should not be cast upon any
officer of the Government, it is surely in
this particular instance, because there is
no man in the Civil Service of Canada,
without a single exception, who has given
as much of his life and his time and
his brain to perform the duties that have
been confided to him, as the present incumbent of that office. I know personally
that he has spent night after night in his
office when he should have been at home
looking after a serious physical infirmity.
I think some other means ought to be found
than that which is being debated, which
I am very much afraid is going to have
the effect suggested. Let us see if we cannot devise some other means of meeting
the case. I thoroughly agree with the
honourable member from Regina (Hon.
Mr. Calder). I do not think it is proper
for a salary to be voted out of a bulk sum.
Let us endeavour to find some other means
of meeting the 'present case.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The leader of the
Government bas told us that the members of
the Defence Council will not get any extra
remuneration, other than one gentleman
who bas been a member of that Council for
a number of years past.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Vicepresident.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The Vice-president
-the present Deputy Minister, I understand. Now, it appears to be the consensus
of opinion in this Chamber that the Deputy
Minister performed excellent service to this
country during the war. In view of that,
and of the fact that he will be the only
one on that Council who will be remunerated
for his services, I think the Council should
be continued, and I am not prepared to

252

SENATE

vote for the elimination of this section.
If the leader of the Government would bring
in an amendment specifying what he has said
-that no remuneration will be paid to any
other members of the Council-I am prepared to vote with him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am quite
disposed to insert in the clause what I have
stated, that no member of this Defence
Council shall receive remuneration except
the present Vice-president; but the Senate
will first have to dispose of the motion to
strike out the section, and will have to
take the responsibility of declaring that
there is no reason to maintain the Defence
Council because that is all that there is
at present before us. If the Senate is not
disposed to do away with the Defence Council, then I intend to move that amendment
to the section, as suggested by the honourable member.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I remind
my honourable friend that when I moved
to drop clause 4 of this Bill a few days
ago I was informed that the motion was
not necessary because a vote against its
acceptance was equivalent to its rejection.
The motion now before the House is of
exactly the same nature, and if the same
ruling applies there is nothing now before
the House. So my honourable friend can
move his amendment if he desires.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I do so.
I move to amend section 8 at line 24 by
adding the words: " No members of the
Defence Council, with the exception "
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask my honourable friend how he is going
to move an amendment of that character
in view of the objection taken by my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)? My honourable friend is changing
this into a direct Money Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend has forgotten that I differed
from my honourable friend from Ottawa.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But I
have to learn that that will make it constitutional.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps this
might be said: if you do not fix any amount
at all, you are not infringing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
my honourable friend from Ottawa has
ruined the situation in such a way that he
cannot restore it.
Hon. Mr.

O(IRDON

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The addition
I desire to make would run as follows:
The members of whom shall not be paid any
additional salary or remuneration therefor except the salary already provided for the VicePresident of the Militia Council.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I take
exception to that. That is clearly a money
provision. Whereas the Bill makes no provision now, and is absolutely silent on the
question of salary, my honourable friend
intervenes and moves expressly that a salary of $4,500 be paid to the Deputy Minister. That is certainly in advance of any
legislation that I have seen introduced into
this House. We have always been very
careful. We have in a circumlocutory way
insidiously introduced into Bills clauses
that might eventually become money
clauses

; but we have never come out in

the open and said there shall be paid a salary of $4,500 to a certain official.
While I am on my feet I want to take
exception to what my honourable friend
from Ottawa has said in regard to this
being a reflection upon the Deputy Minister
of Militia. What my honourable friend has
saidHon. Mr. BELCOURT: I said it would be
taken as such; I did not say it was.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend intimated that it was a reflection on the Deputy Minister. Now, that
means that this House will never intervene
to cure objectionable legislation lest we
should reflect upon some official of the Government who is in receipt of a salary. If
that principle is to be laid down I cannot
conceive of any more dangerous principle
introduced into legislation; and I take no
secondary place to my honourable friend
from Ottawa in the esteem which I have
for the Deputy Minister of Militia-and I
fancy that what I have said will apply
almost equally to many members of this
House. We have had, at one time or another, the most pleasant and friendly relations with that officer, and I must say that
1 retain for him at the present time, notwithstanding the criticism which I have
made of this Bill, the same friendly feelings which I have always entertained. But
if the Deputy Minister of Militia or any
other official of the Government is to receive remuneration

at the hands of the

Government, let it be done openly.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I agree with my
honourable friend; I said so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let us
inot resort to evasive means for the purpose

MAY 17, 1922
of increasing the saiary of any officiai.
Furthermore, I arn of the opinion that there
is no necessity at ail for sections 8 and 9
in this Bill, nameiy, the Defence Council.
It wili be the duty of the Minister, if he
is going to administer his Department properly, to summon the different officiais of
bis Department at whatever time may appeal to hlmi as best, and to consuit with
them as to how the duties of the Miiitia or
the Naval Service should be administered.
a u why should this Department, any more
than any other Department, have a special
Council for which remuneration should be
had? We are now administering the railways of this Dominion, and the Deputy
Minister of Railways represents, I suppose,
a property worth a billion dollars in value.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Two billions.
My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend, whose opinion I always
accept as that of an expert, says two billions. Well, here is the Deputy Minister

this Dominion representing two >illion
dollars, and yet we say there is no necessityHon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: The Government
bas nothing to do with the railways.
Oh,
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
yes, it bas. The same argument would
apply to the other departmnents. 1. think
it is in the interest of the Militia and of
ail good legislation, and of this Bill in
particular, that aIl reference to the Defence
Council should be striken out of the Bill,
and I arn prepared to vote for that.
The amendHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment which I have the honour to move to
this section 8 reads as follows, after the
proviso:
Members of the Defence Couneil shaIl not be
paid as such any salary or remuneration except the salary already provlded for the VicePresident of the Militla Couneil.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is not fair
to ask this House to vote on that question
after the present discussion, and in the
present state of mind of almost every
member of this House, I dare say. Speaking for myself personally, while I think a
great deal of what my honourable friend
bas said, I arn very much embarrassed as
to voting on it. I think the consideration
of this matter ought to be left over. Personally I arn not prepared to give an intelligent vote on the question.

253

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I rather object to
the wording of that amendment. It speaks
of the salary already provided. Well, there
is no one that I know of who is able to
tell us where and how that salary is provided. I do not know of any statute or
clause or regulation which provides the
salary spoken of. Perhaps the Minister
can inform the Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: .1 join with the honourable member for Ottawa. I think the honourable leader of the Government should
consent to suspend this section until tomorrow.
I thought
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
we were all agreed upon that amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. no;
I raised the question of order as to the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thought my
honourable friend was simply chaffing
some of our colleagues who raised the
question of our rîght to amend thîs Act,
inasmuch as the amendment gave it, as
it were, the colour of a Money Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
have clearly made it a Money Bill now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend is serious I will answer the
point, for I recognize it as serious. I suppose we shaîl sit this evening.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why not?
Hon. Mr. CAS-GRAIN: Sleep over it.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: We neyer sit on

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest to niy honourable friends that they
make no engagements for to-morrow evening, because we should make some headway. Next week contains two holidays,
and we may consider adjourning at the
end of the week over the whole of next

THE RETURNED SOLDIER ON THE
FARM
DISCUSSION AND INQUIRY

Hon. RUFUS H. POPE rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the position of the returned man on the

MAY 18, 1922
farm and will inquire if the Government has
decided upon a policy of relief or amelioration
of the condition of the returned soldier on the
farm? Has the Government communicated to
the returned man its intention of doing so? If
not, why not?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I desire
to call the attention of this honourable
body to the returned man on the farm.
I mentioned this matter some three or four
weeks ago in the hope of observing immediate and direct and satisfactory action
on the part of the Government of the day
in reassuring these men. I have observed
in the newspapers, let the report be what
it may, that some action has been contemplated, and that to a certain extent
promises have been made. But, in my humble opinion, anything that I have observed is
not a sufficient recognition of the services
rendered to Canada and to the world at
large by these men, who have made their
homes upon the farm after serving us in
battle.
I may be disposed to view these men with
too much ýconsideration; II may be too
lenient in my disposition towards them; but
I have observed within the last two or
three weeks criticisms and actions in
another place with regard to military service and the military organizations of this
country. We have all seen also an effort
made by certain people to satisfy their
consciences that in remaining at home and
growing wheat and potatoes and other
things, they did as much for the war and
the liberty of the people of the world as
those men who fought on the battle fields
of Flanders. I do not agree with what
has been said in that direction. I believe
that the only men wh.o really deserve anything at the hands of the people of Canada
are the men who were fortunate enough to
return from the war; and I believe that,
if we can extend any consideration to these
men, they are entitled to it from the Government of Canada and from all good citizens
of Canada.
We must realize that in placing these
men upon the farm we are probably putting
there men who have not had the experience
of farmers, who have learned the lesson, as
I have learned it, by a lifetime of experience, that agricultural conditions are changing. The science now involved in farming,
compared with what it was when I first became acquainted with it, born upon the
farm as I was, is very great; and these
men, who have just been introduced to agriculture, must receive from us every possible
consideration and every assistance if they
are to meet with any success whatever. The

255

time when they were placed upon the farms
was a time of high values: the value of the
farm itself was high, the value of implements was high, and the cattle which were
bought to place there were purchased at
three or four times ordinary prices. When
we realize that a farmer and his wife and
his son and a couple of other children who
have always lived upon the farm, and
know how to do things, and are economical
in their dress and way of living, are looked
upon as very successful if at the end of the
year they have been able to lay away $800
or $1,000, we must realize that these returned men, inexperienced as they are, and
placed upon the farms under such conditions as existed, are worthy of some consideration in the way of a revaluation of
everything associated¡ with the business
which they have undertaken.
We Were all very pleased the other day
to listen to the speech of the honourable
member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) with regard to the League of
Nations. He gave us much information
which was new to us. And while we all
hope that that organization, which is really
an international tribunal, will work its way
in the direction of everlasting peace; unfortunately we cannot seriously believe that
the gentlemen engaged in that undertaking
We have read of what
will succeed.
occurred at Genoa, and of what has occurred
within the last ten days. We have heard of
the efforts of Lloyd George, one of the
greatest figures in the world, in bringing
about the meeting at Genoa; we have read
of his work at Genoa, and of the obstacles
which he has had to surmount. He went
there with the hope of establishing peace,
and what did he discover? He discovered
a secret treaty between Germany and Russia. I say that if nothing else had happened
in Genoa than the discovery of that secret
treaty, the meeting was worth while.
But all these things point to one conclusion, and that is that conditions for the
future are serious and uncertain. For
this reason I look upon these returned men,
who are scattered throughout Canada on
farms, as a most valuable asset. They
know the whole story of war by bitter experience, and if the time comes-and I am
afraid that it will, come at too early a
date, notwithstanding the criticism that
has been offered in other places-when their
services will be required again, these men
will be invaluable in the training of the
army that we have. They know what a
real battle is, and how to fight it, and can
train young recruits; if they are disabled

SENATE
and cannot go forward to battle themselves, their services will be available in
the training of other men. So, apart from
the agricultural point of view, if not from
the point of view of what these men deserve,
I say that from the military point of view
alorie, when one looks at the gathering
clouds, these men are worthy of our consideration. Therefore I say that the Government would be justified not only in revaluing their land, not only in remitting
payments-because they must be remitted
or they cannot be met-but in doing more.
It is but slight encouragement. May I give
you an instance? A labouring man, an
economical chap, and his wife, an economical person who had been a servant girl,
had managed to save $1,700; they bought
a farm in our community for about $4,500;
they put in their $1,700, and borrowed the
balance necessary to pay for the farm, the
cattle, and the machinery from the Government of Canada. In our part of the country we had as severe a failure in the hay
crop as there ever was of the wheat crop
in the West. Those people have had to buy
hay for the cattle all winter at $30 a ton,
and could not pay for it, as the cattle were
the property of the Government. You can
imagine the position those people are in.
If they do not get some relief or consideration from the Government of Canada this
autumn, they must hand that property
back to the Government and leave the farm,
losing their $1,700 and their two years'
time, and they must be forgotten as people
who fought our fight for us some years
ago. I could go on and quote dozens of
instances of that kind, but one is sufficient
for the honourable gentleman who leads
the Government. If he wants further
evidence along the same line, all he has to
do is to ask the Government representatives
in the various sections of Canada, their
superintendents who have oversight of this
work, and, whether they are in Quebec,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or the Western Provinces, he will learn of hundreds of
instances of the same character.
I have heard criticism as to whether it
was right to put those men on the farmswhether that policy was a sound one; but
criticism is cheap, very cheap-I wish I
could use the right adjective, but parliamentary usage does not allow it. You can
get criticism for less money than any other
service in the world, and you can get less
out of criticism than out of anything else.
But while we have those criticisms with
reference to the policy of placing those men
upon farms, we did not have it when the
men were being so placed, when there was
Hon. Mr. POPE.

a great outcry for men to return to agriculture, to cultivate the soil, to produce,
to keep away from cities and large centres.
The Government of the day did not have
that responsibility, but they have a very
much more serious one; they have the
responsibility of making it possible for
those men to remain upon the farms. It is
for that reason that I draw attention to
this matter; and I say to you, Mr. Leader
of the Government in this House, in all
sincerity, and with considerable knowledge
of the situation, that if you do not give aid
and assistance and encouragement to those
men, you will not only lose your investment in the lands, which you will have to
sell for fifty cents on the dollar, but also
lose on the cattle, which will have to be
sold for less, than fifty cents on the dollar,
and on the machinery, that will not be
worth twenty-five cents on the dollar. You
will in addition lose all the effort of having
put those men back on the farm, and you
will lose the reputation that should be
yours, of being generous to those people
who served us in that great war, when we
required the service of men who would face
death at the front for the civilization of
this world. I ask you, Sir, the question
that is on the Order Paper in my name.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I am sure we are all of one accord
in our appreciation of the invaluable services rendered by the returned men, who
went to the front and offered their brawn
and their lives for the salvation of civilizaLion. We are all of one mind as to our
duty towards them. I am quite sure that
no 'one will claim that the Canadian Government has failed in appreciating their
merits. A great question has arisen from
the efforts of the Government to place on
the land men who were willing to go upon
it. A number of those men have succeeded,
and I hope that the vast majority will succeed. The question to-day is, what is their
actual situation? How many are holding
their own? What can be done to strengthen
the position of those who are weak? Those
questions are being attended to, and the
answer which I make to my honourable
friend is that, on motion of the Prime Minister, a special Re-establishment Committee
of the House of Commons was created to
enquire into matters relating to pensions,
insurance, and re-establishment of returned
soldiers, and to make recommendations to
Parliament in connection therewith. This
Committee is now holding its sessions, and
among other things is enquiring into matters relating to soldier land settlement.

MAY 18, 1922
The Governinent's policy with respect to
the relief, if any, which may be requ.ired by
the returned soldiers located on fars, will
be formulated with due regard to the findings and recommendatione of the Parliamentary Committee on Re-establishment.
The scope and purposes of the Re-establiahment Committee have been made known
through the mnediumn of the publie press,
and the various returaied soldiers' organizations are aware of the sanie.

the only way we have of knowing the sort
of people with whom we are dealring is by
being in a position to study the history of
those people through several generations,
and satisfy ourselves that they are going to
make good citizens. Therefore, if we permit a man to caîl hiinaelf a Canadian as
goon as hie is naturalized, or as soon as hie

or 200 or 300 at the outside, and in the life
of a nation that is a very short time. In
order properly to appraise the value of
immigration we have to watch it for several hundred years; and, in order to know
what sort of people we are dealing with,
it is useful to know how those people behaved over a long period of years. So one
turns to such statistics as may be had, we
will say, in regard to the penitentiary population of this country, showing the various
elements that compose it. I find, from
figures which I got from the Dominion Statistician last year, that the British, foreign,
and French populations of this country
worked out as follows. Persons of British
and French descent number 89 per cent
of our total population, and they are responsible for 74.5 per cent of the crime in
this country. Persons of foreign descent
in Canada constitute 11 per cent, and are
responsible for 25.5 per cent of the crime.
Taking the sarne figures again, the French
and English people in Canada, representing 89 per cent, supply 82 per cent of the
inmates of the penitentiaries. Persons of
foreign descent, who constitute 11 per cent,
supply 18 per cent of inmates in the penitentiaries. So it goes, in poorhouses, lunatic asylums, and so on; by our census
method we follow those people from one
generation to another, and from the statistics so acquired we know what sort of
people we are getting and how they are behaving.
Turning to the American statistics, we
find pretty much the saune thing, except
this, that up to forty years ago the Americans adopted the plan which is proposed to
our Government, and in which one member
of the Government has today acquiesced:
that is to say, that the moment an immigrant arrives in the United States and becomes naturalized, he is to all intents and
purposes an American, and se registers
himself.
The result was that up to forty
years ago they had no intelligent notion of
how their immigrants were behaving.
I will not weary the House by going into
the matter any further.
It must be obvious that the only way to know how our
immigrants behave is to follow them
through generations.
If we allow a man
who comes to this country to become naturalized, to become a Canadian in law, to be
permitted to describe himself in the census
as a Canadian, we -lose aH track of him: we

gration policy. Certain sentimental people
take the view that a man should become a
Canadian immediately, and it is urged that
the French Canadian people who have been
here a couple of hundred years, and the
British people of United Empire Loyalist
stock, and so on, who 'have ibeen here 150
years or so, should 'be allowed to call thenselves "Canadians in the census.
Well,
that is a sentimental objection.
I suggest-indeed, I urge-that the present
practice is in the interest of those very
people, because if ve allow too great an
influx of undesirable immigration, those
are the people who would suffer.
So that,
on behalf of those people, the real
old - timers, the real original settlers
of this
country,
I
say
the law
should remain as it is.
I sincerely hope
that, when the Government gives the matter that sober second thought which will
probably come to them after consultation
with the offlièials of the 'Statistical Bureau,
they will leave the law as it is, and will not
yield to this sentimental request.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not sure,
honouraible gentlemen, that my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) bas correctly reproduced the
general complaint that bas been heard as to
the form of the late census.
I have
nowhere heard a complaint as to the questions put or the report made regarding the
origin of each Canadian.
Hon. Mr. GRIEISBACH: That was in
the other House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I notice a
question of a member of the House, but
that does not imply a complaint against
registering the origin of the person enumerated. I think it is quite proper that
among these questions should be included
the question as to origin. However, I see
no objection to a column registering the
declaration of the person enumerated as
to his present status. I would retain the
various columns.
I would ask the date
of naturalization of the person not born
in Canada.
The census should indicate
when he came to Canada and when be was
naturalized, if he is naturalized. I would
be in favour of a column indicating
whether or not the person wanted to affirm

his Canadian citizenship and declare himself a Canadian. I hope that, outside of
those who have not yet taken out their
naturalization papers, none will be found
in Canada who do not wish to declare
themselves 'Canadians. For a number of

years we have had on our statute book a
definition of Canadian citizenship, and I

MAY 18, 1922
may say that whenever I cross the line,
or wherever I go, I take good care to
register myself purely and simply as a Canadiaxi. Il my view is shared by the present
Cabinet, I arn quite sure that in the next
census my honourable friend 'will find
that column, because this Government 'which
will stili be in power ten years hence, wil
see to it.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, no.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They will see
to it that the census is taken in that form.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: I had flot intended
contributing any comment on the question
whîch the honourable member has placed
on the Order Paper, but to the views
which he has expressed, -I cannot help saying, I take the most decided opposition. If
there is one thing that should be preached
in the Dominion of Canada, if there is one
thing we want more than any other, it is
a sturdy Canadianism. My people have
lived in this country for three or four
generations, and to say to me that I must
describe myself as English, Irish, Scotch
or of some other race or descent, does not
appear to me to be conducive of the
building up of that national spirit which
should be striven for in this country. To
my mind, if there is one thing of which
we ought to, be proud, if there is one thing
of which 1 am proud, it is the fact that I
am a Canadian. I am proud that my people
have so identified themselves with this
country that they are almost indigenous
to the soul. Will anybody tell me that I
must look to any country but Canada
for my nationality, or that I should devote
to any other country my loyalty? 'It is
the Canadian spirit that ought to be imbued in the youth of this country, and even
perhaps in some persons who are more advanced in years. My honourable friend
says that about forty years ago the United
States lost the identity of the immigrants
to that country.
They described themselves as Americans. To my mind, that
was a most fit and proper thing to do.,
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACHI: May I correct
the honourable gentleman? I should have
added that up to forty years ago that was
the practice. About forty years ago, however, it was found that in the interest of
scientific immigration it was necessary to
know something about the people who were
coming in; consequently the law and the
method of taking the census were changed.
The United States now requires, and for
the past forty years has required, infor-

259

mation as to the racial origin of every man
enumerated.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: But,' although his
racial origin may be stated,' the man
describes himself as an American. To-day
we are not permitted, forsooth, to describe
ourselves, as Canadians. Arriving at the
port of New York, I described myself as a
Canadian. "Oh, no," said the immigration officer, "1that will not do. 0f what race
are you?" I was quite frank with him and
said: "To tell you the honest truth, I know
flot of what race 1 arn; ail I know is that
I am a Canadian."1
The American people to-day may well be
admired in this respect. If there is one
country in the world that more than any .
other, from. the beginning to the end of
the year-ay, from the beginning to the
end of the month, or the week, constantly
instils, in its youth the idea of patriotism,
that country is the United States.
The
opinion is, encou-raged that the United
States of America is the only country, and
I ask honourable members of this House if
they know of any other nation-for I do
not-whose citizens are more consistently
loyal to the institutions of their country
than those of the*United States of America.
They think their institutions are the only
institutions in the world.
Hon. M.r. CASGRAIN: 0f course they
do.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: That is what makes
the country what it is--strong, progessive,
with individuality and with absolute confidence in itself.
Not long ago in this country we were
told-and I well remember the date-that
we could flot build ships-why? Because
we did not have the brawn or the brain,
and did not know how: we would have to
employ others to build our ships. Far be
it from me to raise any controversial question on this, but I may say that at the time
I as a Canadian was indignant to think
that we were told that what any other
nation on God's earth could do Canada
could not do. I believe we can. Our record
shows that we can. We need look askance
at no man or no nation. We stand to-day
as we neyer stood before, on our own nationality, on our own individuality, knowing that we have a great country; and if
there is one thing of which the Government
census should take heed it is to see that
Canadians are enumerated irrespective of
the country from which they or their ancestors have corne. We should inculcate
in the people of this country the spirit of
Canadianism, and in any census of the

SENATE
people of this country we should be de-,
s-cribed as Canadians. We should stand
for Canadianism.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This seems to be
a very strange discussion. When I was
a boyHon. Mr. WATSON: When?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN :-many years ago,
"Canadian" meant a person of the French
tongue. Others were Irish, Scotch, etc. If
you are going to be Canadians you must
be French Canadians.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, I certainly agree with the position
taken by the honourable member from De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain). The
people from whom I have sprung came to
this country nearly 150 years ago; so we
ought to be as good Canadians as those
referred to by my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.: Oh, no. We have
been here three centuries.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: A century and haif
is a long time.
I agree largely with what has been said
by the honourable member for Lambton
(Hon. Mr. Pardee). I do not go quite to
the extent that hie goes in his admiration
for the United States and their methods
in proclaiming themselves the only people
upon earth. I think we ought ail to remember that there are other people besides Canadians. I believe in the strength
of the Canadian race; I believe in the
ability and the genius of the Canadian
people, just as much as does my honourable friend; but I do flot think that, because we possess genius and ability, we
should consider that no other nation in
the world possesses them. The line that
our friends to the south of us take is that
they are the only people. The war bas
proved the superiority of the Canadians
to the Americans, in certain respects at
least. In the building of ships we have
shown the su'periority of the Canadians to
the Americans. The Americans built some
ships. They were supposed to have made
a record for speed in shipbuilding, and
the papers were full of that wonderful
record: thirty-seven days from the time
the keel was laid the ship was off the
stocks. She managed to get across the
Atlantic ocean. By the grace of Providence she was flot torpedoed, and by the
labour of the men at the puinp she did not
sink; but she was 105 days in drydock
Hon. Mr. PAaDDEF

hefore she could put to sea again. That
was the result of shipbuilding in the United
States. That was not the result with any
of the ships that we in Canada built. and
there were a good many ships built in
Canada, flot only by the Government itself,
but also by private individuals. -So we
have no reason to hide our diminished
heads when we are compared with any
other nation on earth. But there are other
nations who possess genius and ability. I
do not think it is to, the credit of the Amaenican people that they regard themselves
as the favoured people upon earth. They
have had the least success of any reople
on earth in doing great things. Their
record in the war was the poorest r ýcord
of any nation that took part in the war.
It seexas to me that if a man is born
in Canada he ought to be described in the
census as a Canadian, no matter what bis
race is-whether hie is of the African race
or whether his forebears were born in
China. There is nb objection to recording the races of men who have become
Canadians by adoption, but a man who
is a Canadian by birth should be recorded
in the census as a Canadian. I for one,
as a Canadian of niany generations back,
resent being described as anything but a
Canadian, and when I am at the port of
New York or any other foreign port and
give my natîonalîty as Canadian, and it
is flot accepted, I feel very much inclined
to use very strong language-a thing I
ama not in the habit of doing.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Why would your
statement be refused in New York?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: My honourable
friend from Laxabton (Hon. Mr. Pardee)
said that the authorities refused to accept
bis nationality as Canadian and asked him
about bis race.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: My honourable
friend must look very suspicious. I have
stated that I was a Canadian, and I was
let in. Something depends upon the appearance, I suppose.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I can understand
how my bonourabie friend could get anywhere on bis face; but unhappily we are
flot ail in possession of such a personality
as that of my honourable friend.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
gentlemen, I have not the slightest objection to our calling upon the census
authorities fo have people described as
Canadians, provided there is a safeguard
which will ensure that the person so
described is a real Canadian. But what I

MAY 18, 1922
do desire to put before the House in the
strongest possible terms is that we can
never have an intelligent immigration
pâlicy, nor shall we ever know whither
we are tending as a nation, if we do not
keep trac< of the racial origins of our
people. I think this is a most important
matter, and I do not believe that any
statistician, or any man who has had any
experience in dealing with immigration,
will differ from me.
CAPE TORMENTINE SHIPPING
ACCOMMODATION
DISCUSSION AND

INQUIRY

Hon. F. B. BLACK rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he wil E th~e attention of the Senate
to the ýdesjrabdlity of the restoration of proper
wharfage and loading faciiities at Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, and Inquire whether
it is t!he intention of the Government to retWtore
shipping and export fadilities at Cape Tornientine, N.B., and when.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, 1.
desire very briefly 'to caîl the attention of
this honourable body and of the Goverflment of the day, through their representative in this Chamber, to a very serîous
condition relating to the shipping interests
in that historic and important section of
Canada lying between the head of the
Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait.
Prior to, 1913 that section of the country
was fairly well provided with facilities
~for export and import by water. In the
,vear 1918 the Government began the construction of a car ferry terminal at Cape
Tormentine. Previous to that time there
had been very good wharfage accommodation at that point. Two or three steamers
of ordinary draught, with a capacity of
perhaps 2,000,000 feet of lumber, and with
3 or 4 sailors, could lie in the roads at
the same time. As soon as the work on
the car ferry terminal began, the facilities
for loading vessels with lumber and other
products were no longer available.
A little earlier, during the year 19101911, there was begun at Sackville, New
Brunswick, the construction of a new
wharf. The property for the building of
that wharf and the right of way for both
the highway and the rails, were purchased
by the Government of the day. The right
of way was constructed, but the rails were
neot laid, and the wharf was therefore not
available for commerce. The old wharf at
Sackville was u.sed considerably, but during
the war the rails leading fromn the C. N. R.
station to that wharf were taken up.
The condition which exists in that
territory to-day is, therefore, that there

261

is no opportunity for export or import by
water, either on the Bay of Fundy or
Northumberland Strait.
In order that the House may have some
idea of the quantity of exports that go
fromn that section, I may say that prior
to 1913 there was an annual export o!
lumber from Cape Tormentine alone
amounting to about 18,000,000 feet. The
quantity varied, of course; it ran as high
as 30,000,000 feet, and as low as 12,000,000 or 13,000,000; but the average was
about 18,000,000. That lumber went to the
United Kingdom, France, and the United
States. In addition, there were of course
small shipments by rail, and small shipments by schooners from Sackville. At the
present time there is, no opportunity whatever for getting out that lumber except
by paying the rail-freight on it to Halifax,
St. John, or some other port. This amounts
to approximately $2.50 per thousand, which
is a direct handicap upon the lumber
producers of that whole section.
The port o! Sackville was also a considerable importing centre. The foundries at
Sackville, and at the town of Amherst,
brought in by that port their pig iron,
their coal, and their moulding sand. The
territory served by that port brought in
their lime, plaster, coal, etc. The woodworking. factories and car works at Amherst also brought in a -considerable quantity of foreign timber. There was also a
considerable import trade carried on with
the West Indies. West Indian goods were
brought in at Sackville, and from there distributed by the wholesale merchants to the
surrounding country. All of that trade
is now closed, and the result is that to-day
that large and important district between
,Sackville and -Cape Tormentine, with its
very considerable population, has no facilities whatever for import or export, although
it is a very important distributing centre.
We have to go 150 miles away to get our
lumber exported. We have to bring our
West Indian produets to St. John and
have them shipped 'by rail from St. John
to Sackville, Amherst and Port Elgin, in
order to supply the demand of the population residing in that section. That means,
honourable gentlemen, that since the year
1913 there has been placed upon the community lying between those two harbours
an annual tax of over $100,000, because the
facilities with which they had been in
former years equipped have been t4ken
away by the action o! the Government.
I quite agree that the Government's action was quite right at the time, because it
was necessary to construct that car ferry.

262

SENATE

At the time the car ferry terminal was
constructed the war was in progress, and
it would prohably have been unfair for
that community to request any expenditure
during war-time. It is also quite true
that the Governrnent were justified in taking up the rails leading from the IC. N. R.
station at Sackville to the old wharf. They
were taken up for war purposes. But the
war is over, and it certainly is time that
those facilities should be restored to that
section of the country. There are two
counties, one in New Brunswick and one
in Nova Scotia, served very largely by
those two ports, both for export and for
import. Those two counties are the two
leading agricultural counties of the Maritime Provinces. Moreover, a very large
lunmber nianufacturing centre is absolutely
deprived of rights which they had enjoyed, so far as the tport of Sackville is
concerned, for 150 years, and, so far as
the port of Cape Tormentine is concerned,
for about 28 or 30 years. -1 suýbmit that
it is now the duty of the Government to
restore to the people of these communities the facilities. which they formerly enjoyed, facilities which were taken away
from them. because of extraordinary conditions, and to which they are legally,
justly and honestly entitled.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I hope the
honourable gentlemen will leave his question on the Order Paper. I have not; the
information which he seeks, but I will convey to the Minister the remarks of my
honourable friend, which may help the Minister to answer in a more satisfactory way.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to say a few words in
regard to this inatter. I have made use
of these ports probably as imuch or more
than the people of Sackville. Prior to the
war, fourteen or fifteen years ago, I used
to bring into the ports of Sackville, Dorchester, and later Amherst, as much as
50,000 or 60,000 tons of car-building material in a year; and I used also to ship away
large quantities of fruit from thein. During
the war, of course, vessels were s0 scarce
and water freights so high that we could
handle stuif as cheaply by rail as by water,
and there was no agitation to keep these
ports in commission. But now that water
freights are down, and rail freights are up,
these ports would be a -very great convenience to the people throughout that section of the country.
The notice stands.

Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 8-Defence Council:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When the
Committee rose hast evening we were considering an amendment which I had suggested to this section. Would the Chairman
read the amendment?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN (reading):
Members of the Defence Council shaUq not be
paid as such any sailary or remuneration except the sala.ry already provIded for the Vicepresident of the Militia Couneil.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: In my opinion that
amendment would be niuch better if the
honourable gentleman would leave out the
words, "except the salary already provided
for." Just put it that no one shaîl be
paid except the Vice-president.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
fly leave of
the Senate I will withdraw the amendment
in order to suggest one which will not; be
open to the objection that we are making a
charge upon the public Treasury.
The proposed amendment was withdrawn.

MAY 18, 1922
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would now
suggest amending section 8 by adding the
following as subsection 2:
No emolunent ehall be payable to the members of the Defence Counnail as such that la
flot, prior to the cnxning into force of this Act,
pai'd to members of the Militia Counell who
subgequently inay become inembers ot the
Defence Oounbdi.

I bave stated tbat there is but one member of that Council wbo is receiving a
salary, namely, the Vice-president of the
Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
means, bonourable gentlemen, tbat we
perpetuate what is not only a viciuus practice, but one whicb in my judgment bas
always been unwarranted. The Militia
Council was created in 1904, and a perusal
of the section passed by Parliament at
that time must necessarily convince anyone
who looks at it that it waýs neyer intended
that any remuneration or compensation
should be pa-id to members of that Council.
The language of that Act is as follows:
The Governor in Council znay acpolnt a

Militia Couneli to advlse the Min4sgter on aIl
matters relatlng to the Militia whlch are referred to the Counil by the Minister. TIhe composition, procedure and powera of the Oountil
ghall be as preecrlbed.

If bonourable gentlemen will f ollow
those three words, " composition, procedure,
and powers," they will observe that it
was neyer intended that there should be
read into tbem compensation or remuneration. It cannot be said that under "composition" compensation was intended, or
that under "procedure and powers of tbe
Coundil" compensation was intended, because that would mean that the Council
might pass any resolution to pay itself,
and no bunourable gentleman will say that
it was ever intended by implication or
otherwise that the members of the Council
should have the power to pay themselves
and to order compensation within their
own discretion. If it bad been intended
by Parliament at that time that remuneration sbould be paid to the members of tbe
Council, it would bave been s0 expressed.
From that time up to the present I capnot find that there has been any change
in this Act; and yet, notWçithstanding this,
we -find that there has insidiously crept
intu the Militia Couneil the practice df
paying compensation for the Chairmanship
of tbe Cuuneil of an amount within $500
of the amount tbat ha received as Deputy
Minister up tu the end of 1916. The
Deputy Minister of Militia to-day is the

b

same Deputy Minister that we had then,
as far as I can recall; and until the end
of the financial year 1915-16 he received
only $5,000 as Deputy MinIster; and yet
he was a member of the Militia Council
during the whole of that period. I
ask by what means bas the Department
incorporated, into this section of the statute,
by implication or otherwise, the power to
pay this $4,500 a year? Will bonourable
gentlemen say there is anything logical or
reasonable in so doing? Therefore to say
now that niy honourable friend should appeal to this Chamber to engraft upon the
section that has stood for su many years
upon the statute book a power by which
we would sanctiion the drawing of $4,500
a year by the Deputy Minister in addition
to bis salary of $6,000, wh.ich he receives
as Deputy Minister, is not only unreasonable, but really does violence to one's sense
of economy and the intention of the
statute. I object to any amendment of
that kind.

closely as they otherwise would the regularity and legality of many of the Orders in

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not only with
regard to the Mi.litia.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Cabinet had to rely uîpon the Minister of Militia
when he brought down his reports froûn
time to time for the sanction of the expenditures embodied in those reports, and the
Minister-if honourable gentlemen will folloiw me now-had to rely upon his Deputy
for the regularity and the legality of the
Act which he asked the ýCabinet to sanction.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STANTON:
That
was no new departure, was it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. I
may say that that has been the practice
since iConfederation.
A Minister, 1 will
not say necessarily, but in the ordinary
practice of administration, accepts the report of his Deputy. He assumes that the
permanent military officers of the Department are familiar with the su'bjects with
which they were called upon to deal. Those
reports are prepared by the Deputy and
handed to the Minister, who cannot analyse
them with that critical acumen which a
lawyer might possibly apply to a contract.
He submits a report to Council, relying
largely upon the Deputy, and Council,
relying upon the Minister, will naturally
pass it.

all the actions of the Governor in Council.
He will claim that I am jointly responsible
with all my colleagues, and he will claim
rightly, because there is such solidarity.
Now, my honourable friend has shown considerable modesty when he has for fifteen
minutes lashed himself and his colleagues
for what they did when they were in the
Cabinet; for all that he has said as throwing some discredit on someone could only
strike himself and his colleaguesHon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, he said the
Deputy Ministers.
Hon. Mr.
DANDURAND: - because
those were thoir acts. The Deputy Ministers may have prompted the Minister,
indeed, but the Minister takes responsibility when he brings the matter to the
Council, and then the joint responsibility
is that of the members of the Council.
Now, nothing irregular has been done: it
has been done under the law; and here I
am standing defending my honourable
friend himself for what he did-for what
ho is responsible for. It is not my act;
it is that of himself and his colleagues,
and I will give him my authority.
From the date of the creation of the
Militia Council, 1904, to the 22nd June,
1918, the members of the Militia Council
received no extra emoluments by reason of
membership on such body. By an Order in
Council of the 22nd June, 1918 (P.C. 1569),
authority was granted for the payment to
the members of the Militia Council of the
following emoluments over and above
those which they received by virtue of the
positions which they held in the Department of Militia and Defense: $3,000 per
annum to the Vice-president of the Militia
Council; $1,000 to each other member there-

Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Might I ask,

lst March, 1922, am-ount approximately
to $23,000. That is quite a shrinkage froni
the figure wvhich iny honourable, friend
nientioned 'last evening.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend pardon nme just at this
point? I did labour under an error as to
the compensation of the members of the
Militia Council, and it was based to a very
large extent upon the fact that in August,
1920, as my honourable friend pointed out
yesterday, those who were niembers of the
Militia Council had merged into their salaries what was then represented to he the
compensation which they drew from the
Mîliti-a Councîl
We find an Order in
Councîl passed at that time upon the recommendation of the Minister of Militia
giving to the Quartermaster General, the
Adjutant General, and the Master of Ordnance $7,500.
Anterior to the war the
officers who then held those positions would
have drawn about $4,000; they were on a
parity with the heads of branches of other
Departments, and drew an amount substantially less than the Deputy Ministers of
those other Departments. Hence, may 1
ask my honourable friend-possibly he will
be able to tell us-why those s;alaries were
so largely increased from the salaries
which were paid immediately anterior to
the war.
Now we have this anomalous condition
prevailing in the Department of Militiawhile I arn on niy feet I may be pardoned
for pointing it out. We have one officer
drawing $8,000 a year as Chief of Staff,
and we have the three officers whom I have
enumerated drawing $7,500 a year; we
have the Deputy Minister of, that Department who is over the entire Department,
according to the statute, drawing $6,000 a
year; and yesterday we deliberately and
after very considerable discussion, practically appointed a Comptroller flot only of
this Department but of the amalgamated
departments, who will have practically
supreme authority over the whole financial
administration of the amalgamated departments, drawing $6,000 a year, while four
of his officers, will be drawing $7,500-one
of them drawing $8,000.
Honourable gentlemen, this will demonstrate most clearly the confused condition
into which the Department of Milîtia has
fallen on account of this peculiarity, that
Parliament has neyer been able to exercise
proper supervision over the Department
of Militia. We have legîslated in regard
Hon. Mr. D~DRN

to ail the other departments: they are
civil departments; but immediately you approach the Department of Militia you are
told that this is practically a professional
departmnent. Immediately you attempt to
segregate the civil branch froni the military branch you are told that you must
not place your hands upon the military
branch of the Departmnent of Militia. It
is very much like placing your hand upon
the Ark of the Covenant, which, as honourable gentlemen know, under the Mosaic
ispensation, was punishable by death. We
have always been surrounded with a kind
of mystic fear of interfering with the miiitary features of the Mîlitia Department,
and the consequence is that we have handed
over to theni the ad¶ministration, and Parliament has been superseded; we have abdicated our function, and lef t the legisiative administration to the officers of that
Department, and particularly to the Deputy
Minister. That has worked out very satisfactorily so far as those gentlemen themselves are concerned, I must say. 27hey
are not suffering by reason of their exercising that superior authority which I have
already indicated. The consequence is the
anomalies that face us to-day, namely, that
we have four officers, occupying positions
inferior to the Deputy, drawing substantially larger salaries.
Now, how does that corne about? We
have this very interesting condition facing
us, that'the four gentlemen whom I have
named-in fact, the five gentlemen I have
named, including the Deputy Ministerconstitute the Militia Council, and those
gentlemien get together around a table and
consider the destiny of the Militia Department. Their own destinies apparently receive no indifferent consideration either.
They naturally support one another, and
the consequence is that we find theni supporting each other to the extent of maintaining a uniform standard of salary substantially ahead of that received by the
most important officers of aIl other departments.
Are we going to perpetuate that? Are
we going to continue that? Are we going
to permit the officers of one department
to create a feeling of rivalry and jealousy,
and thus impair the efficiency of service so
far as the other 18 or 20 departments are
concerned? It is not a pleasant duty, on
account of the personal equation which has
been imported into this subject, for one Vo
discuss it at any length and to dwell upon
the invidious distinctions that I have
already pointed out. That is a very un-

MAY 18, 1922
pleasant subject; one cannot deal with
personaI considerations cf this character
without some diffidence, some hesitation.
At the sarne time *we should net for one
moment stand i the way of .placing upen
the statute book a salutary piece of legislation dealing with the Deputy Minister cf
Militia.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: I would net like
te have it go abroad that we are not welL
wersed in Hcly Writ. My honourable friend
fthe leader cf the Opposition has preached
heresy in sta:ting that those who touched
the Ark were condemned to death. That is
not what took place at ail. One of thema was
bold enough to touch it when he thought
it was going te faîl upon hlm, but even
then he was killed. We must niake that
~reference te the Bible right.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The discussion
,bas turned largely upon the question of
pay. For the moment I arn net going te
discuss the amendment, but shaîl address
niyself te the question of pay. I would
like te ask the honeurable leader of the
officer hiniseif or in the hands of a
opposition whether he would lay it down
las a principle of gevernment of our
mulitary forces that ne efficer of the service
should be paid any more than the Deputy
Minister is paid. That i. the point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No;
but the statute should s0 provide. It should
be settled by Parliament. The increase of
salary should net be in the hands cf the
officer himself or in the hands of a
group of officers. It should not be for any
officer te say that he shall receive more
than others.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do net understand that 'that is the case. I understand
that ail the salaries were fixed by the late
Government, cf which the honourable
leader was himself a member.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, on
the recommendation cf these same gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Do I understand
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) te say that those payments
were unauthorized by any etatute?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Of course he said
that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand the
pesition taken by the honourable gentleman
te be that those paynients were made
without any autherity.

267

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Which
payments does the honourable gentlema-i
mean ?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The payment of
,$4,500 and other payments to members of
the Militia Ceuncil.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I
venture to say that the Militia Act does
not give authority for the payment of
$4,500 to anyone as Vice-chairman cf the
Militia Council.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Nor for the other
amounts that were paid to other members
of the Militia Council? That is what I
understand te be 'the position taken by th,_
honourable gentleman. If that is his
position-and I ar n ot disposed to quarrel
with him-the situation is that those payiments were made by niistake, withnu3
authority.
By the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
authority of the Governor in'Council.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
,Governor in Council may not have had
r.uthority.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I take it that the
honourable gentleman would go so far as
Ito say that the Governor in Council had no
authority 'to authorize those paymentsthat they were made without any authority.
-If that is so, what objection would there
be to passing clause 8 as it is? Clause 3
.does not authorize any payment at ail. If
there is ne authority under the Militia
*Act to make this payment of $4,500, or
.whatever the amount may be, the payment
.will flot be made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
purpose is to remove, ail doubt touchin,,
the payment of salaries for services rendered on the Militia Council.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The henourable
gentleman, I think, is going rather toc
f ar. The honourable gentleman Westerday, in the presence of the Deputy Minister of Militia, said that this Bill was
discussed without any reflection on the
Deputy Minister. 1 think he rather complimented the Deputy, and I think that
every honourable inember cf this House i.
convinced that the Deputy Minister has
been a very efficient officiai cf the Department. He rendered valuable services durinÈ the war, and, se far as I arn concerned, I arn not surprised that during the
war it was decided, not by the members
of the Council, but by the Miniaters cf
the Crown, that he was deserving cf a

268

SENATE

special emolument on account of the special services that he was rendering. Now
that, in view of his services during the
war, and on account of the dual position
he occupies, his salary is $10,500, I think
it would be rather cruel to reduce it by
the action of this honourable House to
$6,000. For my part I should be disposed not to interfere at all, but to let
the House of Commons deal with that
matter and decide whether the ýDeputy
Minister of Militia, for any reason, is entitled to continue to receive the special
additional salary of $4,500. When the Bill
comes from the House of Commons, in
whatever form it may come, it will be time
for this honourable House to deal with the
question.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: This discussion
has thrown considerable light on the
affairs of the Militia Department. We
were told the other day that the members
of the Council, other than the Deputy
Minister of Militia, did not receive any
emolument. Now we find that when their
emolument as members of the Council was
stopped, their salaries were jumped up
$2,000, $3,000 or $4,000. So the statement that they are not now receiving any
emolument as members of the Council is
not exactly in accordance with the facts,
for their salaries were increased altogether
out of proportion to the salaries of officials of other Departments who occupy
equally important positions.
My idea of the way to deal with this
matter would be this: Wipe out the Militia
Council altogether. Why is a Council
needed in that Department? As some honourable gentlemen have pointed out, other
Departments, spending a great deal more
money, call their officers together for discussion without having any council or without paying any extra salaries. I would
ask the honourable leader of the House,
what objection is there to granting the
Deputy Minister of Militia an additional
salary in exactly the same manner as the
Deputy Minister of Finance was dealt
with at this present Session? Last year
the Deputy Minister of Finance, if my information is correct, received a salary of
$6,000, the usual salary paid to a Deputy
Minister. The Minister of Finance and
the Government apparently came to the
conclusion that the Deputy Minister of
Finance was worth more money, and tbey
very properly-if that is the case-came
before Parliament with an item of $4,000
extra in the Estimates, and he is now paid
$10,000. That procedure is all square and
Hon. Mr. BEIQIIE

aboveboard; it is open to the public, and
every one can understand it. I am free
to admit that, although I have been in
the House of Commons or in the Senate
almost twenty years, and have always
tried, as well as the average member, I
hope, to keep track of what is going on,
I did not know that officials of the Militia
Department were paid extra salaries.
There is plenty of excuse for my not knowing when my honourable friend the leader
of the Opposition, one of the Ministers, did
not really know what was going on. The
members of this Militia Council have given
themselves very good salaries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman is in error.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: When their salaries have risen since 1916 or thereabouts
from about $4,000 to $6,000, $7,000 and
$8,000, I say they have been mighty good
to themselves.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Government has been good to them.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They recommended
it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The honourable
gentleman says that the Government has
done it. That was done during the war.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: But are you going
to continue that? Here are these members,
not as high as Deputy Ministers, but some
of them getting $2,000 and others $1,000
or $1,500 more than a Deputy Minister;
and you have here the anomaly of the
Deputy Minister of Militia getting more
salary than his Minister, and getting more
salary than any other Deputy Ministe
in the Service. I am not objecting to that
if the position is worth it, and I have no
doubt that the present incumbent is as good
a Deputy as you could get. But, I say,
put it on a fair and square basis and let
Parliament vote the money every year, as
the salaries for the Deputy Minister of
Justice and the Deputy Minister of Finance are voted.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: With regard to
certain statements made in this debate I
have taken the position that we are discussing something over which we really
have no jurisdiction.
I think it is important that we bear this in mind, and at
the risk of repeating myself I am going
to call attention to this point once more.
The hast honourable gentleman who spoke,

MAY 18, 1922
fol-iuwing others, discussed the amount of
salary to be paid to a Deputy Minister.
That is absoiutely none of our business.
We cannot exercise any kind of jurisdiction over that. We cannot say tltat the
salary shail be increased or that, it shail
be reduced. That is a matter -for the
House of Commons alone, and they can
deai 'with it when they are deaiing with
Estimates. The autb.ority of Orders in
Council, under which these payments are
assurned to have been made, is no authority
at all. The authority that decides the
question is the vote by Parliament. 1 repeat 'what I have aiready ýsaid, that if
you look up the statutes constituting the
different Departrnents, you will flot, I
think, flnd three, perhaps one, in which
the salary of the Deputy Minuster or any
other officer is stated. It is the House of
Communs who, in dealing with the Estimates, decide, on the recommendation of
the Minister whose Departrnent is concerned, what is to, be voted in the way of
salaries. We might talk from now tili the
end of the year and we should accompiish
absolutely nothing, su long as we discussed
the matter on these lines. Why should
this House be discussing sornething which
it cannot remedy or prevent?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
House wouhd assume the responsibility, I
venture to say.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I doubt it very
much. I arn quite sure that if the Deputy
Minister uf Militia is voted $4,500 at this
Session there will be no such dire resuit
as my honourable friend predicts. At al
events, I arn putting a proposition that is
absolutely unanswerable. You cannot deal
with that question here at ail. We are
wasting time, unless the purpuse is to, have
the House of Communs hear our opinion
on the question. That rnight have a salutary effect, especially when the opinion
cornes fruai such men as my honourable
friend, who bas had so rnany years of experience and is such a great authority, and
it may influence thern; but that is ail that
you can uhtirnately accomplish. You canflot change it. Why not simply leave the
matter where it is? What have we to do
with the salary of the members uf the
Council? Absoluteiy nothing. It seerns to
me we are wasting tirne, and we have been
wasting tirne for nearly twenty-four hours.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is a difference of opinion about that.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Can the honourable
leader of the Guvernaient tell us how frequenthy this rnuch-discussed Militia Council
meets, and how many formai meetings

whereas the Council is charged with the
official responsibility of advising the Minister and the Government upon the whole
working of the present Department, or the
Department to be formed, regarding the
defence of Canada. The Defence Council
is patterned upon the 'Military Council in
England. The whole defence of Canada
is examined and studied by men who have
given all their lives to these problems, and
whose decisions are recorded in the minutes
of the Council. There are the traditions
which have gradually been formed, and
which constitute a body of regulations and
of orders upon which the whole Militia
system of Canada has been founded and is
developing. The Militia Council has had
the whole. responsibility for the administration of the Militia of Canada. At the
declaration of war it was found that there
were, surrounding the Minister, men who
had had long experience in military affairs
and were able to advise him in the process
of raising troops, forming regiments and
sending them overseas. There was that
whole responsibility resting upon the
shoulders of those few men, who were competent men, and it seems to me, considering
their performance and the pride with which
we speak of the achievements of the Canadian Army, that we should rather commend
their action than depreciate it as we are doing to-day.

vice given would be individual advice, but
it woud not carry the weight of the advice
of an organized body that deliberates, and
whose conclusions are recorded in the minutes of the Council, and can be looked to
as traditions for the guidance of the Ministers of the successive Governments.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: If possible, I
should like to see the salary of the Deputy Minister reduced, now that the war
is over and we are cutting down our Militia
and our Navy. The leader of the Opposition has said that the members of this
Council made their own salaries during his
career as a Minister in the late Government. I think it is time that there was
something in the statutes making the
Government responsible, instead of the
Militia running matters as they have been
doing.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In my opinion
the amendment proposed does not meet
the need. During the later years of the
war the gentlemen who occupied seats on
the Militia Council were, with the knowledge and approval of the Government of
that day, paid additional amounts, and,
in my opinion, justly and properly so.
Nobody knew better probably than the
Government of that day the responsibilities
which those men assumed and the long
hours that they put in, and that, in view
of those responsibilities and the additional

That would

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to that. That is the meaning.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The keeping -in
the Bill of section 8 seems to me a matter
of smaîl importance. The leader of the
Opposition pointed eut yesterday that subsection 2 of section 5 gives the Government ample scope te create any advisory
councils and any such officers as are in the
opinion of the Minister necessary to carry
on the work of the Department. In view
of this it does seem to me that the specific
mention of the Defence Council rather gives
parliamentary sanction te the continuation
of an arrangement which was necessary
during the war, but which should not now
be continued.
It
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON:
seems te me that we are under a fmisapprehension. I see that by the amendment to
the Militia Act passed in 1919, chapter 23,
10 George V, certain sections of the Militia
.Act were repealed and a new section substituted. That section is as follows:
The pay and aflowances of the offIcers of the
generai staff, headgýuarters staff andI district
staff, Including officers aeeonded for duty In
the public service of Canada, shall be fixed
by the Governor In Council.
I am not familiar enough with the provisions of the Militia Act te know whether
I am quite correct; but my impression is
that the Order in Council granting the
$4,500 te the Deputy Minister as Chairman
of the Militia Council is justified under the
subsection which I have just read. If that
is se, then the amendment of the honourable the leader of the House appears to me
te go no further than toecut down te somne
extent the power given te the Governor in
Council under this section. I cannot see
how the amendment gives any further authority than already exista, but I can see
where it cuts down the authority given by
this section. What this House is cemplaining about, and properly complaining
about, in my humble judgment, is that Parliament passed a law giving to the Governor in Ceuncil power to fix salaries without
reference te Parliament. But that power
has been given, and, until this section of
the Militia Act is repealed, I cannot see
that anything is, te be attained by discussing this question.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Dees net section 10
of the Bill repeal that?

271

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
supposed to repeal the whole of the old
Militia Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, not the
whole of it. Section 10 says: "The Militia
Act (Revised Statutes,.1906, chapter 41)
subsection 1 of section 5 and sections 6
and 7.I
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: This
section I have read is substikuted for the
several sections mentioned in it, and, s0
far as I can make out, it is flot interfered
with by the Bill before the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My opinion is
that it is flot interfered with.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Then,
so long as this section continues te be the
law of Canada, the Governor in Council
may grant any pay he chooses to the,
Deputy Minister acting as Chairman of the
Militia Council, and the amendment of my
honourable friend cuts down rather than
increases the power granted the Governor
in Council by this section.
Hon. Mr. REID: Supposing an Order in
Couneil should be passed giving any officiai
a certain salary, could the Government pay
it until Parliament had voted the salary?
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: As I
read the law, if the section proposed by
the leader of the House is not passed, the
Governor in Council could to-morrow grant
to every member of the Militia Council a
salary in addition to the salary which hie is
now enjoying.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Where would they
get the money to pay it?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH.STAUNTON: I do
net know about that.
.Hon. Mr. CALDER: -If I understand the
situation, the practice has been for the
Militia Gouncil te sit down and, fgure out
wvhat salaries should'be paid to its officers;
it would make a recommendation te, the
Minister, who would take it to Council; and
the Ceu-ncil would appreve it. Parliament,
as 1 understand, has neiier in the past
voted individu'ally the salaries of officers
in thi&Department, as is done in the case
of ahi the other departments.
As 1 presume that we are very shertly
geing to 'have a vote on this question, I
sbould lilte to know whether or not the
Governor in Couneil wourdd have power te
-appoint a Militia Council or any other kind
of council or (board, under section 6 of the
Bill, whieh reads:

SENATE
The Governor in Counoil may make such
orders anld regulations as are deemed necesaary
or adVisable for the proper and efficient administration and organization of the department.

It seenis to me that under that section t<he
Governor in Council is given po'wer to do
anything he likes in the way of establishing 'such organizations or boards or bodies
as may be thought necessary and proper to
the efficient administration of the Department.
If tbat is sO, I think we mig¶ht as
well leave it at that.
I ami indclined to
agree with the honourable gentleman froin
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that Vhis whole
question of salaries is flot one for us to
deal -with. If the Governor in Council has
power under that section to create a Miilitary Council or a board of any kind, then I
presume that under this -section ýhe has
power to pay its members any salaries he
inay éhoose.
If that is so, I arn opposed
to section 8 of the Bill.
The proposed a'mendment -of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand was negatived.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 spoke on this
question yesterday, and I 'have just a few
words to add.
It has already been determined, by voting down this amendment, and
by the statement of the leader of the Government, that there will ýbe no emoluments
paid for service on this Council.
That
'being so, what objection is there to the -appointinent of the Council?
In any case
a Council wiill 'be created.
Everybody
knows that that while it may not exist de
jure, a Council will exist de facto.
Yesterday I pointed out what this Council did
and the purpose of it.
I pointed out tbat
it is a uniform and standard method for
the government of the army affairs of the
country.
The: ad&vice of most military
people may !be described as expert advice,
but here is a body to give advice which is
not onqy expert but is responsible, and is
s0 -declared by law, and which enables the
Minister to go into Ceuncil or before Parliament with advice that is not only expert,
but responsible, and determined by law, and
to the knowledge of everybody.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is not the way
the Minister gets bis; advice now; he gets
it in the caucus.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: So much the
worse for the Minister.
One thing which
has struýck me very -forcibly in parli-amentary life is that not only in this House but
in the other House men get up and preface
their remnarks hby saying: "I -don't know
anything about military matters; I amn not
lion. Mr. CALDER.

a nuilitary man;" and

immediately proceed to lay down in no uncertain manner
what ought to be -done.
I was dwelling upon the responýsibility of
these people as fixed by law.
They are not
casual people; they are persons by law
required to advise the Government and the
Minister; so their advice is responsible.
There is another point. We shaîl probably be having another Imperial Conference in a few years, and before that Conference will corne questions of military
moment; and representatives of other
Dominions will ibe there to speak wîth the
advice of their military councils. If you
reject this section, you are puttîng out of
legal existence the Military Council which
is to advise our Minister; you are putting
yourself out of step and out of joint with
the rest of the Empire; and you are requiring your Minister to go to that Conference
with advice which 7may be expert, but
which is unknown to the public and is
irresponsible.
For that reason I shail
support the adoption of this section.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Before
I vote on this, I shoulId like to ask if by it
the Senate is laying down the policy that
we in Canada should not have a legal Military Council, or is merely quarreliing with
the question of payment? For my part,
the military matters of Canada have
always been guided by a Military Couneil,
and without more information than I have
although I might be quite willing to commit niyself .to a policy of paying nothing
extra to its émembers when it is composed
of permanent officers of the Government, I
should not like to commit myself to the
endorsement of the policy of abolishing it.
If we are only objecting to the payment, I
think we should not wipe out the section
altogether, but should put such safeguards
about it as will embody our wishes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like
to say just a word for the information of
the House. It is the intention of the Minister of Finance, when the House meets
again next autumn, to try to indicate in the
Estimates the total amount that each servant of the Crown receives from the Dominion of Canada. At present payments are
made to certain officials of the Department
under two or perhaps three heads. It is
the intention of the Minister of Finance
to arrange
to. indicate
those
payments in such a way that the total
will appear in the next year's Estimates.

MAY 18, 1922
Now we are about to decide as to the
necessity of a Miiitary or Defence Council.
*When this vote has been taken, if this
clause is struck out, I know that it will
,be impossible to say, that this ie the

on account of the Government having the

,another clause. Weil, here is an officiai
.authority for the creation and maintenance

.need for that advisory council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: For my part,
J cannot foliow that at ail, and 1 arn
jiot bound by the words that have just
Xallen from my honourabie friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 am speaking
for myseif.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I do not
take -the responsibility at ail of pronouncing upon the question whether there should
or should not be a Miiitary Council. We
have nothing to do with that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This clause
oays there shall be.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What I mean
is that if I feit like voting, and if my vote,
though perhaps the oniy one on this side,
would result in striking out section 8, it
shouid not be assumed that I am opposed
to the existence of a Militia Council, for
I amrn ot so opposed; but nlot being a
militiry man, I do nlot know the first thing
about it, and I want to leave the Minister
of Militia free to have a Militia -Council if
he wants it. Under section 6 he has that
power. 1 arn satisfied that section 8, in
view of section 6, is whoily unnecessary.
I do nlot express any opinion on the merits

BILL
OONSIDERED I-N COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 14,
An Act to amend the Salaries Act and the
Senate and House of Commons, Act.
Hon. Mr. McLennan in the Chair.
On section 1--uýMinister of National
Defence" substituted for "Minister of
Militia and Defence".
The section was agreed to.
On section 2-"-ýMinister of National
Defence" substituted! for "Ministeri of
Militia and Defence".
The section was, agreed to.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I beg to move that
section 3 be added, as follows:
Subseiction 2. of section 35 of the said Act is
hereby smenAled by striking out of the word
"exceipt"' In the seventh Une and aU~ the words
after "seion" In the twelfth Une.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: How will it read
then?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman explain the purport of
that amendment?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have three objections I want to make to that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Perhaps you
will have haîf a dozen more by the tisse
you get through reading it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.- It appears that
section 35 of the original Act is not clear;
it is difficuit of interpretation, and the
officers of both the Hou se of Commons and
the Senate have found it so. This is to
clarify it.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What will be the
resuit of the amendment?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I understand that
this, amendment deals wîth the question of
the indemnity. Now, we may as weil be
plain about this matter. It proposes to
remove some restrictions contained in the
Act respecting the indemnity of members
of this House and members of the House
of Commons. My objections to this amendnient are threefold. My first objection je
that honourable members who attend this
House are entitled to their indemnity, of
course, but honourable members who, do
not attend are not so entitled. This amendment je intended te enable hon ourabie mernbers who do not attend to receive their
indemnities.

savxsso EDITION

SENATE

274

Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Then there is no
need of the amendment at all, if that is
not the object of it. My second objection
is that no such amendment can be made, as
it is not relevant to the subject-matter of
the Bill, which simply and solely deals with
the name of the Minister. As I read the
authorities on parliamentary procedure,
An
any amendment must be relevant.
amendment dealing with the indemnity of
members has no relevancy whatever, and
therefore cannot be moved upon this occasion. My third objection is that the amendment deals with the revenue, and if it only
,put fifty cents more into the pockets of
honourable members, it is absolutely certain
that under the B.N.A. Act this House cannot initiate any legislation that deals with
the revenue, or that touches the revenue.
The House of Commons itself cannot initiate such legislation without a resolution
approved of by the Governor General; much
less can this House originate such a Bill.
Bourinot and May point out that the
amendment is equivalent to a Bill in this
case; that is to say, that this House, under
the B.N.A. Act, cannot introduce, either
by way of a Bill or an amendment, anything that could ipossibly be a charge
against the revenue of the country. These
are the three objections which I have. I
certainly must insist most strenuously on
.the point that the amendment is not regular, on the ground of irrelevancy, and I
think it is absolutely clear under the authorities that such an amendment cannot
be introduced in this House.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Perhaps I may be
dense, but I do not know what an amendment of this kind may mean. If I knew, I
might be inclined to vote for it. The gentleman who introduced it has not given any
explanation. I think it is only right that
every honourable gentleman should vote
against any measure when he does not know
what it means.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Perhaps I may be
permitted to add that I have consulted
authorities who ought to know, and who
I am sure do know, and they state that this
House cannot deal with this matter as
proposed.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN (Hon. Mr.
McLennan) : I will refer this question of
order, as I am entitled to do, to the Speaker,
and report at our next sitting.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The Chairman of the Committee of the Whole reports
that the Committee have considered Bill
Hon. Mr.

TANNER.

14, and have referred to me for decision
the amendment that has been proposed to
the Bill. I am not in a position to decide
this matter at the present time, as it involves a question that I have not had an
opportunity of considering. I therefore
propose that the matter be allowed to stand
until I can look into it and give a decision.
Say the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
matter stands on the order paper for
further reference to the Committee.
Progress was reported.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.

The Hon. The SPEAKER: Honourable

a later date.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that

Senate and House of Commons Act, be put

FURTHER

CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 19, an Act to amend the Judges
Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
The Hon. The CHAIRMAN: The Committee were considering the proposed amendmend which honourable gentlemen will find
on page 198 of the Minutes, as follows:
2. The Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice that any
judge has by reason of his age or infirmities
becorne unable to properly perform his duties
and upon three months' notice does not retire,
order that the salary of such judge shall be
reduced to one dollar a year from a date to be,
named, and thereafter such judge shall until
he retires be paid no more than that amount,
but on his so retiring, he shall be entitled to
the retiring allowance which would have been,
paid to him had he retired immediately before
such order was made.

Honourable
Hon.
Mr.
BARNARD:
gentlemen, before the question of this
His Honour the

SPEAKER.

MAY 18, 1922
amendnient is put, I should like to say
that, after a great deal of consideration
and consultation on the subject-matter of
it, I have decided to ask leave of the House
to withdraw the amendment and substitute
another one. I suggest that this new
amendment be printed, and that, in order
that members may have time to consider
it, the Bill be held over until the next sitting of the House. This amendment, I may
say, is more elaborate and gives perhaps
more protection to the judges than the
original amendment, which. was somewhat
hastily drawn.
The amendment was withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I now beg to
iove the following amendnient:
2. The said Act la fur.ther amended by In.serting the foiiowlng section ITnmediately after
section 26 thereof:
General
26a. Âny judge of the Supresne Court of
Canada or of the Exchequer Court of Canada,
or of any iSuperdor Court In Canada, or any

in Councl. upon report of the Minioter of

appointed for -the enquiry and is afforded an
opportunity by himsei'f or 'hie counsel of belng
heard thereat and of cross-examinatdon of witnessee anid 0f adducing evidence on his own
behaif.
2. The Governor in Council xnay for the purpose of making enqulry into the facto respecting the incaipacity or disabilty of any such
judge issue a Commission of enquiry to one
or more judges of -the Suipreme Court of Canada,
or cf the Exehequer Court of Canada, or -to
one or more judgesetc any Superler Court In
Canada, empowering hlm or them to make such
enqulry and report, and may by such Commaissien conifer uvon the person or Versons appointedl full power te suanmon before hlm or
them any person or witness and te require hlm
te give evidence on oath orally or -in wrltIng,

and things as the Commissioner or Cbmmissioners deem requisite to the fuil Investigation

the attendance of such person.or witnew and.
te oompei hlm te give evidence as ls vested

4. Nothing In thie Act contained shalh prevent the Governor-n-Councl froin granting

perlod as the Governor-in-Counoli, In vlew 0f
aIl the circumatances of the rase, may conelder
mest or appropriate, and -if leave of absence be
granted the saflary of the Judge shall continue
te be paid during the period cf leave of absence
so granted.

Hon. G. G. FOSTER: I should like to
suggest to my honourable friend and to
the House that we should postpone consideration of this amendment until the next
sitting after to-morrow, which I understand will be a week from Tuesday.
There are in this amendment many changes
which may remove the objection there was
to the original amendment.
Hon. Ms-. MeMEANS: May I suggest
that the amendmnent be printed and distributed, so that we may read it and have
an opportunity of undeoestanding it clearly?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It will be in the
Minutes.
Progress was reported.
CANCELLATION 0F LEASES 0F
DOMINION LANDS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill Y2, an Act respecting cancellation of leases of Dominion
Lands.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I stated
on untroducing this Bill that the necessity
of it arose from a judgment of the Privy
Council ini the case of the King vs. Paulson
et al, which declared that the form of
notices given by the Interior Department
regarding the cancellation of licenses,
leases and permits was faulty, and that
in that particular case the service of notice
upon the attorney or agent was also of
questionable legality.
This decision has
raised the question whether the form of
cancellation in thousands of cases is not
hiable to attack. Honourable gentlemen
will have an approximate idea of the number of cancellations that have been made
by the prînted forms of the Department
when I state that there have been during
the last ten or fifteen years 17,000 cancellations of mining lands and Yukon
licenses, 2,200 cancellations of timber and
gs-azing permits, and 1,470 cancellations
of school land divisions. The pus-pose of

SENATE

i76

the Bill is to deciare that the cancellations of lea.ses, licenses and permits, that
have been made in the past by the Minister of
éie Interior on behaif of the Government
of Canada have been valid and are ratified. This applies retroactively, but the
principle has been quite often accepted by
Parliament. When it is only the question
of a technicality Parliament has deemed it
proper to ratify the instrument which
otherwise might be deemed invalid.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I have acquainted
myseif to some extent with the contents of
this Bill, and arn quite in accord with its
policy. It becomes a serious matter for
the Government of Canada when the Privy
Council declares invalid the form of notice
which the Department has been using for
the past ten or fifteen years, and which
has to do with practically the whole of the
minerai resources vested in the Crown
through the Federal Government. As has
been pointed out, this would affect operatiens of the Department extending back
for alniost fifteen years and would be applicable to no less than approxiniately
20,000 cases. Honourable gentlemen can
very well appreciate that when a cancellation takes place and a transfer is made
to other parties, when development work
proceeds on a very large scale, and when
the capital invested represents thousands,
sometimes hundreds of thousands, sanietimes millions of dollars, it is a matter of
grave concera to the Government of Canada to invalidate the notice and thus to
disturb the proceedings that have been
relied upon and the investmexits which
have been made over a long period of
years. It seenis to me, therefore, very
proper that legisiation of this kind should
be introduced.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second tinie.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn sorry I
was not here, honourable gentlemen, at the
beginning, but I must at this stage take
serîous objection to this BilI-not to the
principle of the Bill, but te power being
taken in this Bill whereby its effect is to
be retroactive. I will not bother the
House at this stage with an argument, but
I think I should take this exception now,
on the second reading of the Bill. When
we are discussing it in Committee 1 shahl
oppose the provision regarding retroactivity. I do not think there is anything to
justify such a provision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn sorry
that my honourable friend has nlot chailenged the principle of the Bill, because
that is ail there is in it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
can reserve that for Committee.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do flot agree
with my honourable friend. I think there
is something else in the Bill and that reasonable objection can properly be taken
to it. I do want to object to its retroactivity.
When I say
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that is ail there is, I ar n ft forgetting the
future. But the important part of the Bill
is to cover the operations of the Department
for the past fifteen years, because, as has
been very aptly stated by the honourable
leader of the Conservative party in thisChamber, the cancellation of mining and
other leases has been followed by other
operations. Properties have passed from
hand te hand, and in hundreds of cases
the present owners, feeling that their titie
was good, have invested large amounts of
capital; yet, they could be threatened with
the loas of their licenses of some preceding
holder awakened to the fact that now
through a technicality, after the mine, for
instance, had been proved and hundreds of
thousands of dollars have been invested in
it, he could ask for the annulment of the
present license and obtain a re-entry to it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

on Bill 19, an Act to amend the Judges

Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Hon. Mr.
Barnard nioves to insert as section 2 an
amendment to be found on page 224 of the
Minutes of Proceedinga.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The lionourable gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr.
Barnard) apparently has moved .it as an
amendment to the Bill. It is a very 'important one. I do not see the honourable
gentleman in his place. I have no doubt
that niy honouraible friend the leader of the
Governent bas given full consideration to
this amendment. 'In fact, I think my honourable friend very largely inspired it by
somne observations which he made in introducing the Bill, and which. evidently operated as sufficient encouragement for the
honourable gentleman fromn Victoria te
have an amendment prepared. I should
like to know what are the views of my
honourahle friend (Hon. Mvr. Dandurand>
on the subjeet.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I expected to
hear somne discussion of this proposed
amendmnent. It is in the hands of the
Senate. However, as my honourable friend
puts a direct question to me, I will answer
hi*m. I have given some tbought to the
amendment as proposed by the honourable
gentleman from. Victoria, and until I receive more light, if any is to be shed in
this Chamber, 1 arn disposed to agree with
the forni of the amendment. 'I do not suppose the Minister of Justice will ever find
it necessary to take any action under the
proposed legisîstion, altbough it will be in
bis. power to do so. The honourable leader

SENATE
of the Conservative party said that within
his own experience Ministers of Justice had
asked themselves if the State was powerless to meet certain situations which seemed
to indicate considerable contempt for authority. There will be in this legislation
power which may be utilized, but I express
the hope that no occasion will ever arise
for the exercise of it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I should like to
ask the mover of the amendment whether
he has found any precedents in the English constitution for legislation of the kind
proposed. Certainly our own constitution
gives a guarantee to every man who becomes a judge that be shall not be removed from his position except by impeachment. That guarantee, which bas been
taken from the British Constitution, bas
certainly operated very well in this country.
After all, the men cômposing the judiciary
are human, and at times there may have
been some abuses. An honourable member
of this House has complained that there
is 4t present a congestion of judicial business in the District of Montreal. That is
a fact, and a similar condition exists elsewhere. But that is only transitory, whereas this amendment proposes permanent
legislation. The judges in Montreal have
now agreed to clear up the arrears and
they will disappear. Time and again, there
as elsewhere, there bas been an accumulation. The country cannot always be free
of that difficulty. That is especially true
of large centres, where of course litigation
gathers in great volume. That condition
will, however, disappear. The effect of the
proposed legislation, it seems to me, would
be to lessen considerably the independence
of our judiciary. No man is free from
liability to illness. No judge, after the
passage of such legislation as this, would
be free from the possibility of an inquiry
ordered by the Minister of Justice, whoever
he might be. We know very well that
after a certain time of life a man may
suffer from illness, sometimes for months,
and may completely recover. I know of
examples in this House. Some of our
colleagues have left us, not without anxiety
on our part, and we have all observed with
pleasure how they have come back restored
to health and vigour, and able to render to
the country their valuable services. It is
the same with the judges. If the proposed
amendment is carried, every time they are
visited iby illness they are liable to receive
Hon. Wr. DAJNDURAND

an order from the Minister of Justice, who,
after all, is a man-who, after all, is a
party man. I leave it to you honourable
gentlemen: is it desirable that the hand of
political influence, whatever it may be,
should be laid upon the independence of the
judiciary? I do not think so. I think that
we ought to be very proud of our judiciary
in this country, and, I am glad to say, I
make no exception of the judiciary of the
province of Quebec. It bas been and still.
is composed of many able, conscientious,
hard-working men. Of course, they were
well chosen, well tried men; but, honourable
gentlemen, do you think they would have
accepted the position if they had known
that on being elevated to the Bench they
would not be free from political interference. Would the judiciary of our country
have commanded the same respect? Judges
have sometimes to intervene in the contestation of elections or in matters which are
sometimes of a nature to require their full
independence. The British constitution bas
created a class of judges than whom there
are no better to be found the world over.
No country in the world bas more respect
for its judges than bas Great Britain.
Is there in the British statutes any legislation of the sort now proposed? If not,
why not? I submit that it is not wise,
because of any passing difficulty, to disturb
the absolute independence and freedom
from political influence of the judiciary in
this country, and this is a skilful way of
doing it, because, although you cannot impeach a judge, you can deprive him practically of his means of livelihood. What does
that mean? Starving him into obedience if
you so desire, or forcing his resignation.
I do not think that is either fair or wise.
I do not think it is fair to the judges or
wise in the interest of the country.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the bonourable gentleman sits down I should like
to ask him a question. Perhaps I did not
hear it correctly. Did I understand the
honourable gentleman to say you cannot
impeach a judge?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, I did not say
that, surely.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: All right. It
shows how bad the acoustics are.
Hon.
Mr.
BARNARD:
Honourable
gentlemen, I think t)hat the honourable
member who bas just taken his seat (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) is perhaps unduly alarmed
as to the effect of this proposed amendment. He asks me if I can quote him a

JUNE 6, 1922
precedent in Great Britain for legisiation
of this kind. In reply, it is necessary
only to point out that the Parliament of
Great Britain has power to pass any
legislàtion it sees fit respecting its judges,
whereas the Parliament of Canada, owing
to its constitution being a written one, the
British Northi America Act, cannot do so
as regards the dismissal or removal of
But if thc
judges of superior courts.
honourable gentleman wants a precedent,
I think he can find it in section 28 of our
own Judges Act, which. is practically the
same as this amendment, but refers to
county court judges, and which has been
in force for a great number of years.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What is that?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Section 28 of the
Judges Act, whjch provides for the removal
of county court judges for misconduct.
The person who drafted this amendment
has apparently used that clause as a precedent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Has my honourable friend a copy of the section?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps he might
read it.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD (reading):
Every judge of a county court In any of the
provinces of Canada shall. subject to the provisions of this Act, hold office during good
behaviour and his residence wlthln the county
or union of counties for which the court is
established.
2. A Judge of a county court may 'be removed
from office by the Governor in Council for
misbehaviour, or for lncapaclty or inability to
perform his duties properly, on account oif old
age, ill-health or any other cause; if,
<a) the circumstances respecting the misbeýhavIour, lncaipacity or InabUlity are firet inquired lnto; and,
(b) such judge is given reasonable notice of
the tinie and place appointed for the inquiry,
and is afforded an opportunlty. by himiself or
bis counsel, of being heard thereat, ana of

4. The Governor General in Counil may, for
the purpose of maklng lnqulry into the circumstances respecting the miisbehavour, inabllity or incapacity of such judge, Issue a cornmission to one or more judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada or any one or more judges of
any superlas, court Iu any province of Canada,

and te report, and may, by such commission,

person or witnesses, and to require theru te

give evidenas on oath, orally or in writing or
on solernn affirmation, if they are persona entitled to affIrm in civil matters, and to Vroduce
such documents and things as the comniissioner
or commnissioners deemi requisite to the full
investigation of the matters into which they
are appointed to inquire.
6. The commissioner or commissioners, shall
have tihe same power to enforce the attendance
of such person or wltness, and to compel hlm. to
give evidence, as is vested In any superior court
of the province in which the inquiry is being
conducted.

That has been in force since, at any
rate, the last revision of the statutes, and
I do not think there has been any great
abuse of the privileges of the judges, nor
will anyone say that the independence of
the county court judges has been affected
thereby.
Now, I would like to say, with regard
to this amendment, that, s0 far as my own
province is concerned, we have no grievance of the kind; but I was very much
struck when I heard three honourable senators, members of the Bar from three different provinces, say that legisiation of
this kind was necessary owing to certain
conditions, some of which, existed in their
own provinces. As 1 say, I would flot look
to England for a precedent governing a
case of this kind, owing to the difference
between the British constitution and ours;
but I do think that, if this amendment is
inserted in the Judges Act, my honourable
friend will find that there will neyer be
any necessity for enforcement of its provisions, for the simple reason that when
judges are no longer able to do their work
they wiIl take their superannuation, and
resign.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I asked my honourable friend to read the section regardinging the ýCounty Court judges because
I had some recollection that there were
safe guards given the judges with respect
to the conclusion regarding incapacity, and
otherwîse. i would ask the House to consider whether it might not be proper to
add to the section proposed by my honourable friend such safeguards and provisions as have been found proper to apply to County Court judges.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Would my honourable friend pardon me? I think he is in
error. Ras my honourable friend the last
amendment, as printed on page 224?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no; I was
reading f£rom page 198.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: That is the
original amendnient. The amendment was
redrawn.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Has my honourable friend embodied in this all those provisions?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: All those provisions are embodied in this amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then I have
nothing to say except this. I think the
amendment as originally drafted is objectionable, for two reasons: first of all,
because it would impose upon the Minister
of Justice the doing of something which
would be very distasteful to him, and which
he would long hesitate to do; and because,
manifestly, -it might not be considered just
to apply the section against a particular
judge.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is the first amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the
first amendment. But that is all remedied?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
that is all dropped.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE 'FOSTER:
When the honourable Senator from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) brought in his
first amendment, I asked that its consideration might be deferred until the
amendment could be printed and we could
have an opportunity of examining its purport. ýSince then my honourable friend
has withdrawn his first amendment and
substituted this other one, which to my
mind is a great improvement. The ground
of objection was, in my mind, that we
ought to guard ourselves very carefully
against bringing the courts of justice
under the surveillance of any political
party. An administration which governs
by party ought not to hold over the heads
of the judges the possibility of an investigation or of an Order in Council interfering with their term of office on account
of alleged incapacity. The freer you can
keep the minds of the judges from that,
the better; and, as a general rule, you
may trust judges who have had the honour of working through the different
grades of solicitors' and lawyers' work,
and then being appointed to high office on
the Bench, to guard the honour of that
Bench; and in cases of absolute incapacity
the judges themselves would feel inclined
to relieve the Bench by retiring. There is
the other side to the question, however:
the respect of the common people- to say
nothing of the lawyers-for the Bench
is broken down if upon that Bench there
does appear from time to time a judge
who through
physical
disability
or
Hon. Mr. BARNARD.

from any other cause is notably incapacitated for the transaction of business.
That does not add to the dignity of the
Bench nor the respect for justice. The
sooner a case like that is eliminated from
any Bench the better, I think, for the wide
respect which must be very largely the
foundation of the successful working of
our judicature. From a reading of the
amendment, it seems that this case is pretty
well guarded. The Minister of Justice, on
information coming to him, may start an
inquiry, but neither he nor the Council can
take definite action without going through
a certain process: that process is the appointment of a commission of superior
court judges. From among superior court
judges an excellent, impartial, and just
tribunal ought easily to be found. The
judge has notide, and, if he has a defence
to make, he can make it before a commission of his own peers, his equals, and the
matter will ultimately be decided on the
report of that commission.
I have listened for a statement from the
legal men in the House as to the raison
d'etre for this amendment. Have there
been cases which have suggested the necessity for such legislation? In my own experience in the councils of the Government
of the country, I have known of cases in
which the normal course of justice has
been interfered with by the incapacity of
judges; but worse than that is the fact that
such cases have not added to the respect
of the common people for the Bench. The
sooner you get a case like that out of the
public eye the better for the administration of justice.
It may be said that you can impeach a
judge. So you can; but that is a process
that nobody likes to undertake, and one
which, if my memory serves me rightly,
has been practically unapplied in the history of Canada-not that there have not
been cases in which it ought to have been
applied, but because of the many difficulties connected with it. If there are fair
safeguards so that a judge who is incapacitated, and against whom there is complaint
to the Minister of Justice, may be guaranteed a fair and impartial and just tribunal,
I think it is not unwise for us to put such
legislation on the statute book.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Honourable
gentlemen, a change in the law is certainly
desirable. In the province of Ontario we
have had some cases in which the administration of justice has suffered very considerably by reason of the fact that some
of our judges who became incapacitated

JUNE 6, 1922
stili retained their seats on the Bench and
did flot resign long after the members of
the Bar thought they should have done so.
1 amrn ot going to, mention the naines of any
of those judges; some of them are now
dead; but 1 think that, in the interest of
the administration cf justice, and in the
interest of the judge%themselves, we should
have an amendment somewhat similar to
the one in question.
1 do not think, however, that the last
aniendment which we miade to the Judges
Adt is fair to a number of judges who have
been on the Bench for a great many years.
A judge who was on the Bench for a
number of years prior to the time of the
recent change would be entitled only to a
retiring allowanee based on ithe ealary
that he received prior to the time the
change was made; while another judge appointed sinceé that time, if lie became incapacitated, and it were necessary for him
to retire, would retire on an allowane
based on the salary that is now paid to the
judges. I think that in fairneas to judges
who have occupied seats on the Bench for
as long a time as some of them have, particularly in the province of Ontario, the
istatute should be amended so that ail our
judges woulid be put on the sanie basis.
Under the County Court Act judges retire

judges in the County Courts and District
Courts are quite as capable men as those
appoin-ted to the Hiigh Court, and at the
age of 75 many of thern are quite capable
to carry on as they have been doing for
years.
One way of getting over many of the
diffieulties that now present themselves
would be to pass an amendment stating
that judges of the High Court must retbire
on arriving at the age of 75 years. I know
that at the present time, ln the province of
Ontario, we have sitting on the Bench, men
who are considerably over 75 years of age,
and who are quite capable of carrying on:Some are quite bright: others are not.
Where you have one bright and capable man
carrying on after 75 years of age, you
have niany others who are not. The change
made in the statute puts a premnium on
judges who are over age remaining on the
Bench and carrying on as long as they
possibly can.
1 would suggest that in addition to the
amendment now proposed we would urge
on the House of Commons the advisaCbility

of changing the superannuation allowances
and placing ail the judges on the same

footing.
House is concerned, according to what 1
understand to lie the rule, we are not in
position to move an amendment increasing
the superannuation aliowance in the manner I 'have suggested.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 'Is niy

gentleman has suggested would doubtless
have been -done at the tîme the Act
was amended as to, the County Court iudges
but for the ladt that it was felt that constitutionally we had not the authority as to
the Superior Court judges.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: My answer to
that is that we would ibe able to Wet
around the constitutional difficulty by providing ln the amendinent that When a
judge of the Superior Court arrives at the
age of 75 years his salary will lie reduced to

amendments shouid not lie made piecemeal.
This ainenérnent is ail riglit as far as it
goes, but, as I said 'before, it is wholly unfair to judges who have been on the bench
for a great many years, and who cannot lie
superannuated on the ¶basis of their present
salaries.
Hon. Mr. BMIQUE: The honourable
gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr.,
Beaubien) referred to, the judges of Montreal. I do not understand that this legislation has been prompted at ahl by the
condition now obtaining or which has ohtained in the past in the province of Quebec. I have beau practicing at the Bar
for over 54 years, and I arn proud and
glad to say thst in iny experience I have
not known of a judge who would corne under the proposed law. That would induce
men to hesitate and to lean towards the
opinion expressed by the honourable gentleman from Montarville. But I have heard
very often iu this Houfe of judges in
different provinces -who were referred to
in a very disparaging way; and, although
I was not familiar with the facts and'
was unable to determine to what ex-

284

SENATE

tent the charges made were well founded,
I was left with the impression that the
honourable members who spoke were expressing the opinion of their own communities, and that there were grievances against
some particular judges. For that reason
I am very strongly inclined to share the
opinion expressed by the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
Foster) a few moments ago. I think he
bas given conclusive reasons in support of
the amendment. It is in the interest of justice that the door should be closed to all
abuse; and if there is a recourse for people
who have grievances, they will not be expected to express any grievances against
the judges in their own locality unless these
are well founded, in which case it will be
their duty to approach the Minister of
Justice and ask him to put in motion the
machinery which is provided for in the
amendment
now
under consideration.
These grievances, or supposed grievances,
as the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
very well says, are destructive of the good
reputation of the judges. I think the
amendment is in the right direction.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I shoùld
like to point out to my honourable friend
the leader of the House that in my judgment this is a Bill for which the Government should assume full responsibility.
The Explosives Act is a public Act. It
involves, one might say, not only the lives
of persons within a considerable radius
of those establishments, but likewise the
security of property, and I think that no
private member of this Chamber, or of
the other Chamber, should assume the responsibility of introducing an amendment
of so important a statute as the Explosives
Act. I would therefore suggest to my
honourable friend that the Government
give special consideration to this legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend that I had referred
to the mover to postpone for a few days
the consideration of this Bill, in order that
the Department which is particularly concerned with it might give an opinion.
I move that the Order be discharged and

Honourable
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:

which an amendment was moved in -Coin-

286

SENATE

mittee a few days ago, I should like to
speak to the point of order raised on that
amendment, before His Honour the
Speaker gives his decision. I do not know
whether this is the proper stage to do so,
or whether I should wait until the House
goes into Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
to what extent the point of order was
debated. The question was taken en
déliberé, as we say in my province, by his
Honour, the Speaker. However, if, with
the leave of the Senate, some honourable
gentlemen desire to express their views on
the point of order, I should personnally
have no objection+to the suggestion to His
Honour that they be allowed to do so.
Of course, the matter is just now rather
more in the hands of the Speaker than in
ours.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
gentlemen, as I am appealed to in this
matter, I may say that now, before I give
my decision, will be the right time for
any honourable member desiring to do
so to discuss the questions raised on the
point of order taken by the honourable
member from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner).
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
occurs to me, honourable gentlemen, is
this, that the subject should be discussed
in Committee. I think the House should
resolve itself into Committee of the
Whole and then discuss the question, which
was raised, if I recollect correctly, while
we were in Committee of the Whole. I fail
to see how the matter can revert to the
House.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the question
bas been referred to His Honour the
Speaker.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, by
the Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the question has
been referred to His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Precisely, but if the matter is to be thrown
open for discussion it should be discussed
in Committee of the Whole, because that is
where the Bill was and is to-day.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But it is a question
which bas to be decided by the Speaker.
The Speaker is not supposed to be necessarily present when the Committee of the
Whole sits.
Now that the Speaker bas
been seized of the question, I think it
should be discussed in the full House.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I doubt
very much the correctness of the procedure
outlined by my honourable friend from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), for this
reason. The question of order should have
been discussed before the Chairman of the
Committee submitted the question to the
Speaker. When the Chairman of the Committee submitted the question to the
Speaker the question had practically been
exhausted so far as the Committee was concerned. I understand that the consent of
the House is asked, and there is no reason
why the Committe of the Whole should not
give to the mover of the amendment, or to
any other honourable gentleman in the
House, the opportunity to discuss it at
length. I fail to understand, however,
how the question reverts back to the House,
because it was never raised before the
House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not
examined any precedent. But suppose that
the question is reported to His Honour the
Speaker, who may not have been in the
Committee and may not be cognizant of
the discussion which took place. He could
of course inforni himself of it through
Hansard.
If His Honour the Speaker,
having to decide the question, asks for further information or discussion on it before
rendering his decision, would it not be to
the House that he would properly address
himself? I take for granted that this is
practically the situation. His Honour the
Speaker bas not yet reached a final decision, and leave is asked to give him more
light on the matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should
say that if the request for assistance from
the House originates with His Honour the
Speaker, the House would at once give
him that assistance; but unless the Speaker
makes that request, I fail to see how the
House itself can take the question into consideration.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Possibly my
honourable friend would change his opinion if he would consider for one moment
that the Speaker's ruling may not be to
the taste of the House, and that the honourable gentleman who raised the question
may wish to appeal to the House.
For
that reason I think it ought to be discussed
here.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then it
should be given to the Committee, because
it is only the Committee that can appeal
from the Speaker's ruling.

JUNE 7, 1922
Hon. Mr. BELCOUIRT: Oh, no.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
so. It would be the Committee that wouhd
appeal frorn the ruling of the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, no.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The honourable
member who raised the point, if he is not
satisfied with the decision of the Speaker,
can appeal to, the House.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But we
should be then in Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
gentlemen, the Bill in question is entitled
"An Act to Amend the Salaries Act and
the Senate and House of Gommons Act."
There are only two sections in the Bill,
which are very short, and the effect of the
Bill is to substitute the words "Minister
of National Defence" for the words
"Minister of Militia and Defence"l, and to
make subsequent amendments of the sarne
kind. To this Bihl an amendment was
proposed by the honourable gentleman
from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff), which
reads as follows:
That subsection 2 of section 35 of the said
Act-

-that is, the Salaries Act and the Senate
and House of Commons Act--houId

be amnended by strikIng out the word

"except" in the seventh Une, and ail the words
after "session" in the twelfth line.
The amendment deals with the rnethod
of payment of indemnities to members, of
the House of Gommons and of the Senate.
Wîthout going into the merits of the
question, I want to explain that the effect
of the amendment, if carried, would be to
place the law concerning attendance at
the sessions of the two Houses in practically the same position as it was in
before the recent increase of the arnount of
indernnity. That is to say, if a member
were entitled to absent himsehf for fifteen
days, alter that he would be penalized to
the extent of $25 a day for each day that
he was absent, and if he were absent during any day of the hast two weeks of
the Session he would be penalized to the
sarne extent in respect of each day,
whether or not he had exhausted the fliteen
days to which he was entithed.
The reason for bringing in this arnendment is that the law as it exists to-day
works a very severe discrimination against
those members who, like rnysehf, corne froni
distant parts of the country. As a matter

287

of fact, the practice of this House. for
Sessions past has been to meet at the
opening of Parliament, to pass the Address,
generally at the end of the third week, and
then to adjourn for two or three weeks,
until sufficient business cornes up from the
House of Commons for the Senate to attend
to. Owing to the necessity of a -Supply
Bill being passed before the expiration of
the fiscal year, and owing to, the lengthy
debate upon that Bill in the House of
Commons, the members, of the Senate met
every day for practically three weeks, said
prayers, and went away; at the end of
that time the Senate adjourned for over
three weeks until after Easter. Under
the old 'law a member from British
Columbia or the Prairie Provinces coul-1
have salely remained at home and not
corne down until after the end of the first
adjournrnent, without any serious loss to,
hirnself. Under the present conditions he
cannot do so. At the end of about two
weeks more this House again adjourned,
and it met only yesterday alter an adjournment of seventeen days. The resuit was
that members from rny province had still
to stay here with nothing to, do, because
there is no advantage in spending five days
on the train for the purpose of being at
ho-me two or three days, and then having to
spend another five days on the train
corning back.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not object,
but I would cali the attention of the
honourable rnember, to the f act that he is
flot dealing with the question of order at
ail: he is dealing with the merits of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Will the honourable gentleman pardon me for a moment?
I arn not going to deal at length with this
phase of the matter. 1 arn just trying to
make it clear to members of the House
bcfore I discusa the point of order. 1
desire to say in passing-and then 1 shahl
have finished with that topic-that at ail
times members frorn the distant provinces
have been found ready to meet the convenience of other honourable gentlemen in
regard to the House adjourning each
week end until Tues day, or coming here on
Tuesday night, although we do not usually
sit at night, in order to enable those
honourable members to have a longer, time
at their homes.
One thing more I want to, mention is a
very pointed instance which occurred this
Session of the extreme bardship of this
A.et on a member who cornes fromn a dis-

288

SENATE

tance. One member from British Columbia suffered a bereavement in his family
just before the Easter adjournment. It
was absolutely necessary for him to go
home. Had that occurred during the time
the House was in session he would have
been penalized to the extent of about three
thousand dollars of his indemnity, because
he could not possibly have gone home and
come back and put in three-quarters of
the sittings. That shows exactly how the
Act works as at presnt constituted.
Two points of order have been raised
against the amendment; the first, that
it is a Money Bill; and the second, that
it is not relevant to the Bill as originally
introduced. Dealing with the first point,
I just wish to call the attention of the
Senate to the report of the special committee of 1918, known as the Ross report.
This was the report of a special committee appointed to consider and deal with
the question of the power of the Senate to
amend money bills, and it was concurred
in by the Senate. Paragraph 1 is as
follows:
1. That the Senate of Canada has and alw'ays
had since it was oreated the power to amend
Bills originating lin the Commons appropriating
any part of the revenue or imposing a tax
by reducing the amounts therein, but bas not
the right to increase the same without the consent of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
part of the Confederation contract.
3. That the practice of the Imperial Houses
of Parliament in respect of Money Bils is no
part of the Constitution of the Dominion of
Canada.
4. That the Senate in the past bas repeaitedly
amended so-called Money Bills, In some cases
without protest from the Commons, while In
other cases the Billas were allowed to pass, the
Commons protest'ing or claiming that the Senate
could not amend a Money Bill.
5. That Rule 78 of the House of Commons of
Canada claiming for that body powers and
privileges in connection with Money Bills identical with those of the Impenial House of Commons is unwarranted un-der the provisions of
The British North America Act, 1867.

Now, rule 78 of the House of Commons
is as follows:
All aids and su.pplies granted to His Majesty
by the Parliament of Canada, are the sole gift
of the House of Commons, and all Bills for
granting such aids and supplies ought to begin
with the House, as it is the u.ndoubted right of
the House to direct, limit, and appoint in al.
such Bills, the ends, purposes, considerations,
conditions, limitations and qualifications of such
grants, which are nodt alterabile by the Senate.

The Senate has declared that rule unwarranted under the terms of the British
North America Act. Now, the question
is whether or not this is a Bill which the
Senate has a right to amend.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Will the honourable gentleman allow me to call his attention to the fact that the report to which
he has referred acknowledged as existing
in the Constitution the section stating that
all Money Bills must originate in the
House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Precisely.
I
admit that. The point I make is that this
is not a Bill appropriating any part of
the revenue, nor imposing a tax; neither
is the amendment one appropriating any
part of the revenue. The second point I
make is that, even if it were so, we do
not increase the expenditure in any way
without the consent of the Crown. For
instance, suppose the House of Commons
sent a Bill to this House providing that
the hours of the Civil Service should be
from eight o'clock in the morning until
six o'clock at night, and suppose that this
House was of the opinion that from nine
o'clock in the morning until five o'clock
in the evening were sufficiently long hours,
the effect of such an amendment would be
to provide for the payment of the same
amount of money for fewer hours of work.
That, I submit, is precisely what this
amendmnent does, and I venture to say
that very few honourable gentlemen in
this House would urge that we have not
the power to make such an amendment
to the Civil Service Act.
The next point that was taken was that
the amendment was not relevant to the
Bill before the House.
Any amendment
which is within the scope of the Bill is
relevant: there can be no question of that.
The only way in which you can tell what
is within the scope of the Bill is by reading the title of the Bill; and the title of
this Bill is: "An Act to amend the Salaries
Act and the Senate and House of Commons
Act."
It is not to amend' any particular
part of it. Why, honourable gentlemen, it
seems to me that if this point of order is
sustained the Senate might almost as well
go out of business.
What did we do yesterday with the Judges Act, a precisely
similar case?
It was a Bill to appoint an
additional judge to the Court of Appeal in
Saskatchewan, and we added a clause providing for the reduction of salariesý of
judges under certain conditions.
Could
anybody say that that amendmient was any
more relevant to the Bill as introduced than
this amendment is to this Bill as introduced?
Yet in the other case there was
no question raised, and it was never
doubted that the Senate had power to do
what it did.
If this House is going to re-

JUNE 7, 1922
strict its legisiative funetiosis as suggested

by these two peints of order, I submit te
honourable gentlemen that we had better
shut up and go home, and there will net be
any indeniity wan.ted for anybody.

which is peat relevant te, the su-bject-matter
of the Bill.
If the subjet-matter of the
Bill refeýrs te a particular section of an
Act, ne matter what that Act may be, we
niay net amend it except ta make clear the
intention of the draftsnian in drawing the
section.
For example, if the Banl<ruptcy
Act were sent ta this House it might be
that the most glaring omission was made,
perhaps by the clerk in copying it, an omission of one clause referring ta a particular
class of commercial transaction which is
ciearly distinct from any ethers.
The
Senate would have ne right ta insert a
section if it governed something which was
not already in the Bill, because it would net
be relevant. .Such an argument, in my
humble jndgment, is ad absurdum.
In
aur own legisiation we have plenty of examples of what relevancy means. Fer instance, amendments are brought dewn Session after Session ta the Shipping Act,
which is divided into four or five parts, each
cf which is a separate aind distinct Act, and
ail of whîch are combined for convenience
under one hea ding. As an instance, the Shipping Act was amended in 1921, and the
amending act was called "An Act ta amend
the Canadian Shipping Act,",and in brackets in the titie were the wards, "-Public Harbours: " another Act was, "An Act ta Amend
the Canadian Shipping Act," and in brackets the words, "Sick and Disabled Mariners."
I think it is quite plain that if in an
Act ta amen-d the Canadian Shipping Act
(Public Haribaurs) one were ta seek te add
a aection rela'ting ta sidk and disabled
mariners, he might quite reasonably be said
to 'be introducing a section which was not
relevant ta the Bill before the Hause; and
if he wiere ta add a section Xelatinýg ta public
hýarbours ta a Bill ta amend that part cf the
Act reiating to aick and disabled mariners,
he might quite reasonabl'y ibe said to ibe
adding something which was net -relevant.
But I submit that it is a dfis.tortion of the

to declare thàt this amendinent is irrelevant,
we (are siinpiy here as revising officers for
the House of Commons, te see that the
cruditiesaf their legislation are amended so
that the legislation will clearly express their
intentions.
Another suggestion that I have to. make
ta this honourable body is that this is not
a Money Bill in any sense of the word. It
is universally conceded that the Enghieli
language nmust be înterpreted as ordinary,
every-day people understand it. That is to
say, we must give to it the xneaning that
people who understand the English ianguage would take from it. Now, in this
Act which we have before us it is proposed
to amend Chapter 69, 10 and il George V,
as fohlows:
For every session of Parliament wvhidh extends beyon-d fifty days there shall be payable
to each member of the Senate and flouse of
Comirnons attend-ing at such session a sessional
allowance of $4,000 and no more.

that money which has been given to
him by the Act, and are thus in derogation,
of his rights. If it was intended not ta
give him $4000 in the first place, the Act
would have been drawn in this way:.
For every session of Parliament which extends beyond flfty days there shal be p>ald
to each memnber of the Senate and flouse of
Commrons attending at three-quarters of the
sittings of the Elouse of which he le a mnember

1 leave it ta any honourable gentleman
ta judge if that is not an entirely different

section; if it hap not an entirely different

the other gives a member who attends

Session the sum of $4,000. They do not
EDITION

SENATE
mean the same thing at all. But what was
the intention of the drafter of the subsequent sections? The intention was to fine
the members for non-attendance. I am not
arguing this point merely to see whether
it will stick; I am arguing it because in
my opinion it is a fair and reasonable
and proper interpretation of the section.
If that is a fact, it is also a fact that,
in considering the practice of the House
of Lords as applicable to the Senate of
Canada, we must look to the precedents
before what is called the Parliament Act,
which was passed, I believe, before 1910.
Before that time, and after the House
of Commons had in the seventeenth
century made the declaration upon which
the House of Commons rule is founded,
and of which, in fact, it is nearly a verbatim copy, the House of Lords undertook to deal with penalties, and the
House of Commons, by a long series of
cases, acquiesced in this action by the
House of Lords until it grew to be a
practice-a practice that became lavr.
Therefore I say that now, if I am correct
in my view of these penal clauses, we are
not infringing upon the powers of the
House of Commons regarding Money Bills,
but we are only undertaking to change
sections of the Act which relate to penal
clauses.
One way I suggest, honourable gentlemen, to test the reasonableness of this
construction is this. Imagine that, when
the Bill of 1920 was before the Committee of
this House, we had passed section 5 of
chapter 69 down to and including that
part which I have read to you, declaring that each member of either House is
entitled to the sum of $4,000; and that we
had then struck out all the other clauses,
what would we have been said to have
been doing? We would have been expressing our disapproval of the penalties. We
would not have been amending the
penalties; we would not have been adding
to them; we would have simply been striking them out. The penalty is quite distinct
from the salary or indemnity. We passed
the indemnity, with all the conditions,
in that section; and it has been held by
the Privy Council that each section of an
Act of Parliament is to be read by itself
where it has a full and complete sense
within its own ambit. There is nothing
to explain or qualify in that section; it is
full and complete in itself; and I think
that, if you follow the argument of the
honourable gentleman who introduced this
point of order, you will see that if the Bill
Hon.

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON.

were put before us with nothing but the
granting clause, and we had sought to add
what I am calling the penalty sections,
it would have been quite open to his
idea of irrelevancy, though in no way
affecting the granting of that money.
So I submit, honourable gentlemen, that
if we had passed the section allowing
the $4,000 a year, and had refused to pass
all the other sections of the Act, no person
could have claimed that we were amending
a Money Bill.
I therefore submit that on both grounds
the objection to this amendment is ill taken.
I confess
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
that at first blush I had thought that the
objections taken by the honourable member
for Pictou in raising the point of order
were well founded and had great cogency.
The honourable member for Victoria (Hon.
Mr. Barnard) has referred to a rule, and
I wish to re-emphasize what Le has said
by re-stating that I see nothing in the rules
of the Senate that is infringed by the
proposed amendment. Rule 70 provides:
not proceed upon a Di1
money, that shall not, withthe Senate, have been reKing's representative.
These salaries are provided for every
year. We have nothing to do with the provision of them. That provision is already
made-by statute too: it is part of the
Civil List at the present time. Rule 71 says:
To annex any clause to a Bill of Aid or Supply, the matter of which is foreign to, and
different from the matter of the Bill, is unparliamentary.
The Senate will

Is this the plea, that it is a "Bill of Aid

ordinary parliamentary language, what we
understand a "Bill of Aid or Supply" to
mean. If that were true, you might con-

sider the question conversely, by the wellYou have

excluded a certain thing, namely, the annexing to a Bill of Aid or Supply of a
matter foreign to it. You have particularized these two sorts of Bills. If this is not
a Bill of Aid or Supply, then there is no
prohibition under our rules of an amendment which may be otherwise foreign to

the subject matter. The prohibition could
be only under parliamentary practice; it is
not under the rules of this House.
The 'honourable member for Victoria has
also referred to the well-known Ross re-

port. I have been interested in that, and
read it with a great deal of attention at
the time. It is quite true that the findings
of the report have been more or less obso-

JUNE 7, 1922
lete in this House; that we have flot carried
theni ail into effect; but thèy were concurred in by this House and are binding
on us. They have neyer been abrogated
or 'set aside by this House. The Committee which presented the report was one of
the ablest constitutional cominittees that
this House could appoint, and its researches
were supplemented iby those of very distinguished lawyers outside. This report
absolutely dissents £romi rule 78 of the
House of Gommons. We do reserve to ourselves certain rights in respect of Money
Bis-not merely the right of rejecting
such Bills, but the right to lessen the
a-mount provided for. And, as to the matter
of precedents, if my memory is quite correct-and 1 thmi< -it is in this regard-the
English House of Lords hAs neyer acceded
to the dlaims of the English House of Gommons. There is a great distinction between
the British Parliament and our own, for
ours is a true bicameral parliament, whereas the British parliament is flot such
in a true sense, because the legislative
powers of the House of Lords may be
absolutely superseded by the right of appointment in the Crown. Our rights are
absolutely distinctive, and legisiation properly originating in this Parliament, or
Bis properly amended in this Parliarnent,
cannot be made ineffective by the fiooding
or swamping of this Chamber from tirne
to time by the Government in power. ýSa
I say that the British House of Lords has
neyer acceded to the dlaims of the British
House of Conimons in reference to Money
Bis, and we mn thia House are bound by
aur own action net ta accede to the dlaims
of the House of Gommons under its rule 78.
The question of expediency-whether this
House, being an appointed body, is wise in
exercisîng ail its powers in dealing with
Money Bilis-is an entirely different proposition; but I feel that the House of Commens is not goihg te cavil or take objection ta the passing by this House, if it
sees fit, of an amendment such as that
proposed by the honourable 'memnber for
Victoria.
Now, a word or two as ta thé real substance of the matter. Personally I do not
care whether the exact arnendnient as introduced by my honaurable Iriend frorn
Victoria is passed by this'House or not. I
arn one cf those who live in the West.
It is a burden an me every year ta corne
down ta the first short sitting of the bouse,
at which, as everybody knows, littie is done.
Under the penalty clause of the Act we
are obligated ta attend or we forfeit a parS-19à

29'

tion of aur indemnity. We come down here
and are ready to sta> the whole Session and
take aur share of the work. It is a peculiar
hardship ta honourable members froni British Columbia. It is likewise a hardship
on the members froni Alberta and Saskatchewan, and in iess though very considerable degrée, on the members efrorn
Manitoba or from the extreme eastern
cities.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: 1 do not think

Chair gave ta the meniher for Victoria.
I
quite agree with your ruling, Mr. 'Speaker,
that this is not important ta the discussion
of the point of order, and therefore I have
nothing further to add.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, withqut examining into the question
rai.sed, I had formed a pretty strong opinion
on the point of order, and it was te the
efYect that the point of arder was well taken.
I must con'fess that, after hearing the argument of the henourable gentleman f£rom
Hamidton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), I
have changed my view in one respect as ta
whether this is in the nature of a 'Money
Bill or noit. W-hat weighs in my mind in
the argument of the honourabie membér,
is that the amount of $4,000 is voted upon
in ail cases.
It is proviýded for in the
statute.
In practice it is the ameunt
wh-ich is authorîzed ýby the Governor in
Gouncil, irrespective of any action we may
now take on this Bill.
This consideratien
leads me ta change my opinion on this
point.
I do not now consider that this
would ibe in the nature of a Money Bill.
I must confess, however, that I have net
heard anything tbat satislies me that the
'amendment Is relevant ta the Bill.
I need
flot refer ta Bourinot or ta May.
It is a
common rule, adepted in ail parl'iamentary

At page 525 of Boui4 inot I find it stated:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The title of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does not that give
wthat we might call the jurisdiction of the

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Oh, no, that contains
merely the title of the Act with which the
Bill is dealling. We must look to the body
of the Bill to see what is its purpose, and
personally I am under the impression that
the whole amendment is irrelevant.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: May I

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: More or less.
Hon. Mr. DANDU\RAND: As to the
question of relevancy, it bears on the right
of this Chamber to asmend a certain
clause of an Act which is before us.
It bears on our right to go beyond that
clause and to modify the Act in other particulars. I do not know whether it has
been bad practice on the part of the
Senate or not, but I think I may make this
general statement without risk of being
contradicted, that within the last twentyfive years we have always taken advantage
of the opportunity, when a public Act was
before us to be amended in a certain particular, to review it and amend it in other
particulars. This has been the uniform
practice of the Senate. I am inclined to
believe that it goes counter to the pracHon. Mr. BEIQUE

tice which prevails in the British House.
I have not followed exactly what the Commons have done with Bills originating in
the Senate when they have reached the
other House, and I could not give an opinion on that point; but our practice has
been uniform, and I have no recollection
of a point of order ever having been
raised, and I am quite sure that no objection has been taken in the other House
or we would have had an echo of it by
way of the Bill being returned here with
their objections.
The other point raised by my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), namely, the question of the right
of the Senate to amend this Act and by it
risking an increased charge on the Treasury, bothers me somewhat more.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Would my
honourable friend allow a question? If
this amendment is either passed or rejected, how will it affect the appropriation of public moneys or the imposition
of any tax upon the public? The point I
make is that the moneys are already appropriated by statute; the passing or nonpassing of this Bill does not affect them
in the least.
The only
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
point is that we are perhaps reducing
some of the penalties imposed by the Act.
But that is the only point upon which I
am not absolutely clear. On the other
point, if we are to be governed by the
practice of the Senate, I would think the
honourable gentleman from Pictou is
wrong.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Speaking not
as a lawyer, as most of my colleagues who
have spoken have done, but from the standpoint of the true intent and meaning of the
word, it seems to me that relevancy must
refer to the subjectmatter of the question
with which one is dealing. If my knowledge
of constitutional development is correct
the obvious purpose of making such a rule
as that is that no irrelevant matters may
be introduced into a Bill by amendment.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: Would
the honourable gentleman tell us where
the rule is?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: It is in May.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It may
be in May.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: At all events,
it will be admitted that it has been referred to here as something that exists

JUNE 7, 1922
somewhere, even if I cannot name the
place. The purpose of such a rule or order
or practice, or whatever it may be, it seems
to me, is to prevent a different matter
being brought in, se te speak, by surprise. Take this particular Bill, for example. If you look at it you will find
that it is te change two names, ene under
the Salaries Act and the other under the
Senate and House of Commons Act.
Therefore it seems to me that the amendment is clearly irrelevant. If the matter
of attendance and similar things were to
be taken up and readjusted, it seems te
me that it would be better to do that in
another way so as net to lay ourselves
open te the cri.ticism which many people
are ready tO make.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I had no intimation that this matter was coming up this
afternoon. I presumed that it was closed
except for the decision of the Speaker on
the question raised the other day. I think,
however, it is of very considerable advantage to have the subject discussed as it has
been discussed this afternoon, and whatever happens, I think the House will be
under some obligation to me for bringing
the matter to a debate and, I hope, enabling
the House to arrive at a decision on both
points which will be regarded as somewhat permanent.
I had not looked up the authorities very
thoroughly at the time I made the sugges:tion, nor have I consulted them since.
My honourable friends, who are very much
interested, apparently, in the promotion of
this amendment, I judge, have been exceedingly diligent in the meantime, and believe that they have amassed sufficient constitutional authorities to convince Mr.
Speaker that no one of the points has any
force in it.
Without going into the merits, as they
are net under consideration, although they
have been discussed more or less, I may be
allowed to say that my information, which
I believe to be reliable, is that the enactment of the proposed amendment would
simply mean that honourable members Of
this House and honourable members of theother Chamber would receive very much
larger sums of money out of the Treasury
for their attendance during the Parliamentary Session than they receive under the
law as it now exists. I am told by persans
who ought to know that, among others,
there are honourable niembers of this House
who attend on an average only a few days
each Session, and who usually receive $500
or $600 as sessional indemnity

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Mr. Speaker: I submit that the honourable
gentleman is out of order in making the
statement-that this is not a matter that is
before the House.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In answer to the
point of order, Mr. Speaker, I want to
make this very brief statement.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: I ask
a ruling on my point of order.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Could net the argument be used for the purpose of showing
that it is a Money Bill?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My answer to my
honourable friend is that I want to state
what the effect of this amendment will be
in order to show that the amendment is a
Money Bill and will affect the revenue. I
think I am in perfect order in saying that.
I can say all I want to say on that aspect
of the matter in one sentenée, namely, that
the effect of this amendment will be to
enable, among others, honourable members
who draw only $500 or $600 a Session, to
draw $500 or $600 plus $3,000 more out of
the Treasury. That is the object of this
amendment, and I say that has relation
to the question of whether or not it is ta be
regarded as a Money Bill.
Now, for just a moment I want to deal
with the question of relevancy. To my
mind there is a very clear principle underlying a question of relevancy, and notwithstanding the learned argument of my
honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), in which he would
intimate that the word relevancy has no
meaning at all, I want to say that if it has
no meaning at all it is a most remarkable
fact that all the authorities upon parliamentary procedure discuss it. Bourinot
and May and other authorities discuss the
question of relevancy, and it has called for
discussion by men who are learned in parliamentary practice, nothwithstanding the
authority of the honourable member from
Hamilton, and I am bound to presume that
there is such a question.

294

SENATE

As I say, the principle seems clear
enough to me. It would not exclude the
consideration of an amendment affecting
the Shipping Law; nor would it prevent
this Chamber considering such an amendment to the Ju.dges Act as was mentioned
by my honourable friend from Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Barnard). The latter case is
not on all fours with this proposition, because the amendment to the Judges Act is
absolutely relevant to the subject-matter
of the Bill before this Chamber, and there
would 'be no reason in the world why this
Chamber, if a Bill respecting shipping came
down, should be excluded from making an
amendment in reference to that general
subject-matter. As I understand it, the
principle is simply this: that an entirely
different matter should not be introduced,
and that it is not good parliamentary practice to introduce such a matter by way of
amendment.
The answer to the remarks of my honourable friend in regard to this Chamber
becoming useless is simply that the honourable members of this Chamber can introduce Bills. If we have the power to deal
with the indemnity, it is open to any honourable member to introduce a Bill.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Will the honourable gentleman tell us what happens them
when they leave us and go to the other
House?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That has nothing
to do with the constitutional power of this
Chamber; what happens .to .a Bill in another place does not affect its constitutionality.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: But it has to do
with the practicability.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Let my honourable
friend adhere to the ground which he takes.
He says we cannot do it. I say we can
introduce Bills if we can introduce amendments. It is no answer at all to say they
will fall by the wayside in the other Chamber, and if my honourable friend is depending upon arguments like that, I can
only come to the conclusion that he considers that he has a very weak case. It is
open to any honourable member in this
Chamber to introduce a Bill in regard to
shipping, in regard to the judges, or any
subject within the competence of the Dominion Parliament; and it is more proper
parliamentary procedure to come to this
Chamber with a Bill than to introduce by
a side wind, in a covert way, an amendment which cannot by any pressure of arguHon. Mr. TANNER.

ment be considered relevant to the subjectmatter of Bill 14.
Now, for just a moment let me look at
this Bill. It is said that the amendment
is relevant to the title. So far as my
knowledge of parliamentary matters goes,
I understand that a distinction bas been
drawn by the authorities between relevancy
to the title and relevancy to the subjectmatter. This Bill comes down to us as an
Act to amend the Salaries Act and the
Senate and House of Commons Act; and,
so far as that is concerned, it might be said
with some force that the amendment refers
to the Bill. But when we look at the substance of the Bill we find that the matter
supposed to be legislated upon bas no reference whatever to the question of the indemnity of the members of this House or the
members of the House of Commons. This is
a mere formal piece of legislation by which
it is intended to change the name of the
Minister of Militia and Defence to the
Minister of National Defence. It is merely
a verbal change in the statute.
What is the reason that it is not considered good parliamentary practice to
make such amendmerts as that proposed?
I take this Bill; I look at it and read it;
I observe what it deals with. There is no
notice to me in that Bill that the indemnity
of members wiil be dealt with; there is no
advice to honourable members of this House
that the question of how much an honourable member 's to be paid is to be dealt
with.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Will the honourable gentleman explain what notice be got
in the case of the Judges Bill, which was
to appoint a judge in Sas'katchewan, that
we were going to deal with the question of
the infirmities of judges in Montreal?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not see that
the honourable gentleman's question is any
more relevant than the remark be made a
little while ago. There is no notice to any
honourable gentleman here that the indemnity question is to be dealt with. It may
be that this House has the power to deal
with it; but my reading in days past convinces me that it is at least very bad practice to attempt to do such a thing as is proposed here by way of an amendment, a
thing which gets away from the sound
and general principle that when a substantive matter is to be dealt with a Bill shall
be introduced, which shall receive its first,
second, and third readings, which is fundamentally the correct way to proceed in regard to such a matter.

JUNE 7, 192229
I will not attempt to elaborate that point
further. Whether it is decided we have thé
power or not, I want to say that in my
judginient it is not good parliamentary practice to perpetuate such a system. May I
say here, in order to illustrate, before I
leave that point, that before the amendment was inoved no notice of it was given.
There were perhaps some honourable mernbers who knew it was, going Vo be moved,
but it was not on the Order Paper and it
might have passed this Chamber ini five
minutes without ten per cent of the honourable members of this Chamber knowing
what was being passed-why? Because this
Bill gave them no information and no
notice; it did not put them on guard so that
they might be prepared to object to the
proposed legisiation if they so desired.
Now, I say that is not good parliamentary
practice.' If it could be done in regard to
this subject, an amendment entirely foreign
to a Bill might ha slipped through without
notice and without the members of this
Chamber being aware of it until it had
advanced several stages.
Let me say just a f ew words in regard
to the other point, the question whether or
not the proposed amendment infringes the
constitutional law with regard to Money
Bis. I have not lately, per.used the report
of the Ross Committee, 'but I was fair-ly
fami'iar with it when it was presented to
this House; but my impression, which I
state subject to correction, is that the
whole question before that Committee was
whether or not this Chainber could amend
a Money Bill sent down froni the other
my recollèction goes, it was
House. 'As
around that point that the conflict was
waged. The honourable Senator from Middieton (Hon. W. B. Ross) was a strong advocate of the dlaim that this Chamber
could not only reject a Money Bill, but
could also amend a Money Bill. Now, that
is not this case. To put this matter on al
fours with this Ross report, we should have
to be dealing with a Bill sent down from
the other Chamber in regard to the indeninity of members. But we are initiating
the subi ect-matter; we in this Chamber are
ourselves proposing to put upon the statute
book a Money Bill; we are making the
Money Bill and are bringlng it in here
without the consent of the Crown. Snch a
Bill cannot be introduced. into the Bouse
of Commons without the consent of the
Crown, and in my judgment-I amn not
going to elaborate it, because I am satisfied to leave the question with Mr. Speaker
my judgment the proposed arnend-in

ment is clearly an in-fringement of the
principle that this Senate flot only is without authority to originate, but cannot enact
or cause to be enacted, a Money Bill which
will entail a charge u'pon the revenue of
the country.
The argument of my honourable friend
from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-jStauntosi)
that -the indemnity of members is fixed at
$4,000 does not appeal to me as conclusive.
It is fixed at $4,000, but it is fixed at that
anxount sujbject to conditions. In other
words, the law says to me and to other
memnbers of this House: "If you do certain
It
things you will be ent.itled Vo $4,000.
does not say: "You are absolutely entitled
to $4,00V." It says: "If you attend the
sessions of the Senate you will be entitled
to $4.000. If you miss so niany days you
will be entitled to so much less." Now, what
is proposed by this amendment? It is, proposed that we shall get the $4,000 without
attending the Senate. That is to say, we
may stay at home; or we may come one,
two or three days, or a week, and if we do
not draw the $4,000 we shall draw very
nearly the whole of that amount. If that
is not a Money Bill, honourable gentlemen,
in a sense that it is an appropriation by
this Chamber from the Treasury of this
country, then I must conf essa that I do not
know what is to 'be considered as a Money
Bill.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, 1 would niot have spoken on this
matter but for the somewhat unkind insinuation of the honourable gentleman who
has just taken bis seat, that those who were
against bis contention as to the proper
ruling in this case were actuated by unworthy motives-were seeking to get something for nothing. As a matter of tact,
my attitude in this matter is apart altogether f rom the question of the penalties
attached to the Indemnity Act. 1 am not
in favour of a change in the Act itself,
but I am in favour of niaintainibg the
rights and ýprivileges of this House intact;
and in my humble view and judgment this
Bouse bas the right to amend, as it bas
done in the past, Bis coniing from the
lower Bouse, whether or not the subi ect
matter is contemplated iby the text of the
original Bill as initiated in the other House.
We have here the testimony of an honourable gentleman who bas long been a
member of this Bouse; who for years
occupied, and most worthily occupied, the
position which Your Honour now occupies
as Speaker of the Senate. That honourable

296

SENATE

gentleman says that. since he became a
member of this honourable body it has
been the 'practice to amend in the way in
which this amendment proposes, Bills coming frorn the other House.
In my humble opinion again, the title
does set out the scope within which amendments may be made. It was not necessarily the amendment that was made in the
other House. This Bill is entitled, "An
Act to amend the Salaries Act and the
Senate and House of Commons Act." It
does not say that the amendment shall be
confined to one particular thing, and when
the Bil.1 comes before us, if we see fit, we
have, in my humble judgment a perfect
right to amend it.
It is a matter of some importance to this
House that we be not deprived of our rights
and privileges, and that we do not circumscribe ourselves in the duties that we
have to perform here. We are not a mere
revising body: we are a legislative body,
and I do not think that we should say
by our rules or orders that we have not
the right to make amendments such as this.
The amendment is clearly not a money
clause. It seems to me that the argument
of the honourable member for Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) was incontrovertible in that respect. The Act itself
states that there shall be paid to each
member a salary of $4,000. Then there are
penalties attached. It is only for the purpose of remedying these penalties that this
amendment has to be made. I am perfectly satisfied with the Indemnity Act as
it is, although I recognize-the hardship that
it may impose on some members. However, I do not intend to speak of the Act
itself; but I do recognize the 'hardship upon
Western members-a hardship that does
not apply to me. But, so far as I am
concerned, I am perfectly satisfied with the
Act as it is, and therefore I hurl back the
insinuation made Iby my honourable friend
in his speech.
My honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) has asked me
to read from May's Parliamentary Practice
"cases when instructions were ruled out of
order because they were foreign to the subject-matter of the Bill":
(1) Arms (Ireland) Continuance Bill, 1886.To insert clauses dealing with the law relating
to poor law guardians, 1abourers' dweilings, ani
the franchise in corporate towns in Ireland.

Anybody would know that that was irrelevant.
(2) East India (Purchase and Construction
of Railways) Bill 1 8 87.-To insert provisions
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

imposing harbour dues and charges on her
Majesty's ships conveying material for government railways in India.
(3) Criminal Law Amendment (Ireland)
Bill, 1887.-To insert provision to prevent the
exaction of unfair and excessive rents.
Ail civil matters in connection with
criminal law.
Clearly anything in connection with the salaries or indemnities
of members, such as the title of this Bill
indicates, is relevant to the Bill, and it is
in the power of this branch of the legislature to make an enactment regarding it.

My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
says: "Oh, we had no notice." No notice?
Why, in the progress of a Bill through the
House, amendments are made as the result of the discussion at the time, without any previous notice whatever being
given. My honourable friend would perhaps go so far as to say that a personal
notice should be served upon every member of this House, for fear some might
not know about the amendment that was
proposed. A member is supposed to attend this House. It is the duty of a member, for which he is paid, to be in this
House to attend to its business, and to
know when amendments

are offered and

what amendments are being made. I fail
to see anything whatever in the argument
of my honourable friend on that point.
I claim, honourable gentlemen, that Mr.
Speaker's ruling should be in accordance
with what is right, as I anticipate it will
be, should declare that this amendment is
perfectly relevant, that it is not a money
clause, and that this House bas the power
to make it.

As to the ameniment itself, that is another matter, and I reserve to myself the
right to vote as I please on it, though I am
strongly of the view that this House has
the power to make it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, I was rather surprised that the
honourable gentleman for Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) did not answer what is to my
mind the most serious objection on this
point of order. Rules 70 and 71 of this
House are clear, and it seems to me that
they do not apply at all to this case.
Rule 70, which has been read, deals with
a Bill appropriating public money. Can
it be contended that the Bill now under
discussion appropriates public money?
Certainly not. Rule 71 deals with bills
of aid and supply. This is certainly not
a Bill of aid or supply. Those are the only
two written rules of this House which can
be applied to this case. I really expected

JUNE '7, 1922
that some answer would be given to this
very real objection from. the legal point
of view. Whatever may be the effeet of
this Bill as regards the indemnity paid
to the members, its result must be serlous
as to the powers of this House. To my
mind there is in the amendment no violation of these rules.
Very well. Let us go beyond that. There

out dissent.
That thîs House could intervene in money
matters proivided it did not increase
amounts tbereby appropriated.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Tbat is tbe wbole
point.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is the whole
point, as my bonourable friend says. But
when the appropriation is made, when the
amount of $4,000 is voted in the Appropriation Bill, in accordance with the
statute, can we take it for granted that
that amount of $4,000 will not be drawn
by eacb member? I should like to know
that. If the Appropriation Bill was before
this House at the present time, would any'
member rise in his place and say that the
total amount of $4,000 could not be considered in its entîrety, ibut that some allowance should be made for probable deductions? What deduction? ýCan we proceed
upon the assumption that a portion of thet
total will notlibe paid'? It seems to me that
that is drawing a fine distinction not provided for at ahl. By parhiamentary customi,
and particuharly by tbe written rules of
Parliament, tbe Appropriation Bill is one
thing: it la voted in toto. This bas absolutely no effect on the Appropriation Bill.
It ia quite possible, tbougb, that the
restrictions imposed by the Act under
the entire
discussion might resuit ii
amount voted by the Appropriation Bill
not being required. But the rule provides
only that we shahl not interfere witb
Appropriation Bills in such a manner as to
increase their amounts. Do we increase the
amnount of $4,000 for members that is
voted? To my mind that is. the question.
Obviously we do no>t, and thait is what is
prohibitive;. tbat is the limitation on this
House.
I bave, I think, disposed of the first
point. I may be wrong, but I ami stating

297

my opinion. The second point has reference
to the sub-paragraph beîng gerinane or not.
It has been the rule of this House that
whenever legisiation has been brought before us and we are considering amendments on certain points, the whole Bill
is before us, and we have jurisdiction
over the Act in its entirety. We could in
the past, and we can flow if we so desire
amend other clauses of the Act than those
that have been submitted to us by the other
House for amendment. Are we going to
renounce that power? Why should we?
Why should we limit ourselves? An amendment to one clause of an Act often requires a consequent amendment of other
clauses, and it may be found quite proper
to amend them. Il the rule laid down by
my honourable friend ftrm Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) is adopted and is strictly
interpreted-that is to say, if the particular subject of the aniended Bill submitted to the House is the only matter
before the House-then we tie our hands
for the future as regards the advisability
of amending other clauses. I do not think
that is desirable. The House bas not considered it desirable in the past. Why should
we curtail our own power?
One objection that at first seemed to
me a serious one was that no notice had
been given. At first sight it appears that
an Act is submitted for our consideration
in order that we may amend one clause
only, and some honourable members say,
"We have had no notice that other portions
of the Act which interest us were to be
called into question." It «is quite true;
but between the two evils it seems to me
that the members of this Chamber ought
to guard against any restriction of our
powers, and that after ail, when legisiation
is before us in total for the purpose of
being amended, no honourable member
can be taken by surprise. When a Bill
comes down everybody bas notice that any
clause 'whatsoever in the Act can be
amended.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I would like
to ask the indulgence of the House to reply
to the query of the honourable gentleman
from. Hamilton, and to refer hirn to May,
12th edition, page 370, where it says:
Âxnendiments are out of order If Vhey are

It is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant to the question on which
the amendment has been proposed, and this
ruile has been invariably insisted upon by
Canadian Speakers. The law on the relevancy
of amendments is that if they are on the same
subject matter with the original motion, they
are admissible, but not when foreign thereto.
The exceptions to this rule are amendments on
the question of going into Supply or Ways and
Means.

CANCELLATION OF LEASES OF
DOMINION LANDS BILL
CON'SIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill Y2, an
Act respecting notices of cancellation of
leases of Dominion lands.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I explained the purport of this
Bill when it came before us for its second
reading. It is for the purpose of legalizing
notices of cancellation, and their service,

by the Department of the Interior, which
have been made and given during the last
fifteen or twenty years, and have been
questioned by a recent decision of the Privy
Council. The department intends to comply
with the advice of the Privy Council and
to make its notices conform to the opinion
of that body. When I presented the Bill
I took it for granted that it had for its
object the curing of some technical defect
which had been found by the tribunals
and the Privy Council; but, upon reading
the Bill more closely, I find that it covers
not only the defects of the past, but the
procedure for the future. I suggested that
all that concerns the future be expunged,
inasmuch as the department intends to
comply with the opinion of the Privy
Council and to apply new procedure and
new forms in the cancellation of leases
and the mode of serving the notices of cancellation upon the lesees. The department
has complied with my request, and in order
that the members of this House may have

the Bill before them to-morrow in the form
Hon. MCr. DAVID

in which I intend to move it, I will read the
Bill with the modifications I intend to
make, and will put it in the hands of the
Chairman of the Committee.
The first amendment is to insert in subsection 1, of section 1, after the word
"granted" in the second line, the words
"before the date of the passing of this Act."
The second amendment is in the same subsection, and is to strike out all the words
after the word "authority" in the nine-

teenth line, down to the word "consisting"
in

the thirtieth

line,

and to

insert the

following in lieu thereof:
If, at any time after the default occurred,

and the power of cancellation became exercisable, any written or printed notice was heretofore gven before the date of the passing of
this Act by or on behalf of and with the authority of the Minister to the lessee, l'icensee or
grantee, or to his assignee, agents, executor,
administrator, or representative, whereby It
was in terms or In effect stated that for or in
respect of such default the said lease, dicense,
term or other authority was cancelled or had
been cancelled, or would be cancelled, or whereby the intention of the Minister was expressed
or imylied to treat the said lease, license, or
permit or other
authority as no longer
subsisting.

The third amendment is to strike out all
the words in subsection 1, after the word
"notice" in line two on page two.
Subsection 2 of section 1 is amended in
one particular only, namely, by striking
out in line seventeen the words "and when."

Section 2 is left intact, and I will move
a third clause to the Bill as follows:
This Act shall not affect any rights under any
judgment rendered before the date of the passing of this Act, or under any action, suit or
other proceeding lnstituted before the first day
of May, 1922.

This will cover the judgment which one
Paul A. Paulson obtained in the Privy
Council, and which gives rise to the present
amendment.
Hon. Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

the honourable gentleman give the reference to the Privy Council's decision?

clause making it obligatory upon the Government to submit to Parliament within
fifteen days of the opening of the Session
a list of ail the cancellations, and the
reasons therefor.
I arn not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
aware whether that lias been the practice
or not, but if not I will draw the attention
of the Minister of the Interior to the proprlety of laying before the House yearly
the cancellations that have taken place
during tlhe preceding twelve nionths.
In my
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
view it is entirely outside the jurisdiction
of the Dominion ParJ.iaauent to pass any
Act of this nature. The Crown in the right
of the Dominion has undoubtedly the right
to contract with a subject in the provinces;
but the Dominion Governinent has no right
to make or amend the law of contract in
the provinces. For example, the Dominion
Government makes a contract for the digging of a canal. It enVers into a contract
with a contractor to dig a canal in the Province of Ontario. There is a breach by one
party te, that contract.
Why could
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not the honourable gentleman appîy his
illustration to the Act?
I arn
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
going to give you that too. There is a
breach of the contract. The question is
tried out in the Ecdhequer Court, and Vhe
contract is construed according to the law
of the Province, just as if it was between
two subjects. The Dominion may find that
the law presses hardly upon it, but it cartaialy could not corne to Parliament to have
the law changed regarding civil rights because it piregsed hardly.
Now, take this case. The Dominion owns
certain property in the Province. The

example, to seli that land.

They make a contract to seli it to me for
a payment of $5,000 in annual instalments.
After I have paid the fourth instalment the
Drâminion rues its bargain and says, "We
will cancel the contract." Now, they have
made the contract, and I submit that they
cannot cancel it unless there is some law
passed by the Province entitling them to
do so. Then, take the case of a lease.
The Dominion makes a lease to me of mining claims, and if I make default
in performing certain conditions, the

matter before the Minister of Justice and
get an opinion as to whether or not this
Bill is intra or ultra vires of this Parliament.
If when the matter is considered
the provislions of this Bill are found to be
legal it will be another matter for us to
consider; but it would be a great wrong
to force some man to test this Act out again
and go before the Privy Council to fight
his claim against the Dominion Government.

that he would be dènied justice.
I am not
saying that that would be done, but when
we are passing legislation we must consider not only certain but possible consequences.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to inform my honourable friend, on the
ground of equity, that during the last
fifteen years and more the Department of
the Interior has been leasing mining rights,
grazing lands and other properties to the
public on certain conditions, the non-fulfilment of which entails cancellation. This
Act has been applied, this power has been
used, by the Department for that length of
time.
People have taken leases-mining
leases, for instance; they may have spent
money on the land or they may not; they
may have paid a few instalments and may
have stopped paying. They were to begin
their work within a certain time. They did
not do so. Seventeen thousand of such
leases have been cancelled. Properties or
rights were leased to A, B and C, who in
turn defaulted. D took his lease and spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars in developing his claim. The cancellation of the
leases to A, B, C was accepted without protest. Surely those people who signed
leases under certain conditions and who
recognized they had failed in the execution
of those conditions have no grievance. They
did abide by the judgment of the Department of the Interior. But one day Paulson
et al obtained mining rights on a certain
section of land; they paid their dues from
year to year for a number of years; no
government inspector went to see whether
or not they fulfilled their obligations. They
were notified once or twice that they were
late in payment, and perhaps it might be
found that they were notified that they
were not fulfilling their obligations. I remember seeing in the record that they even
admitted they were not doing anything,
that they were. waiting for their neighbours, to reach their section through their
galleries. It is admitted that their coal

deposit was 2,000 feet below the surface.
It was practically impossible, except by
spending a very large sum of money, for
them to reach down to 2,000 feet. As
compared with their neighbours they were
the drones. They thought that when the
neighbours reached the line of their section they could tell them: "You have made
our property valuable; you need it; you
must buy it at our price." The Department was made aware of that situation,
probably when the neighbours saw they
were reaching the dividing line, and the
Department notified the Paulson's that their
lease was cancelled. The Paulson's took
out a writ and succeeded in having the
Supreme Court and Privy Council declare
that since the Department of Interior had
allowed them a delayHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
They
had waived their right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, had
waived their right to cancel, and that the
condition was no longer effective.
The
Supreme Court, as well as the Privy Council, decided in examining the procedure that
the Department was using a form of cancellation which was not justified, was not
regular.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Not according to the contract.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It may be
interesting to this Chamber to hear the
clause read under which the Department
of the Interior operated. Clause 17 is the
one which covers the subject-matter of the
contract. Clause 17 of the contract said:
17. That in case of default in payment of the

said rent or royalty for six months after the
same should have been paid or in case of the
breach or non-observance or non-performance
on the part of the lessee of any proviso, condition, term, restriction or stipulation herein
conta'ined and which ought to be observed or performed by the said lessee and which has not
been waived by the said Minister, the Minister
may cancel these presents by written notice to
the said lessee, and, thereupon, the same and
everything therein contained shall become and
be absolutelly null and void. . . .

The Department proceeded to cancel under its printed forms, and it did so by this

letter of the 13th of September, 1909:
Department of the Interior.
Ottawa, 13th September, 1909.
Sir,-I am directed to inform you that as

within the time required by the said section of
the lease, the Department has been obliged to

flonourable gentlemen will observe that
the expression used is: "Tho Department
bas beon obliged to cancel your lease."

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It is no
notice at ail.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the Chiof
Justice, in reviewing- this notice, said:
As to the first reason, if wouild be necOs&ry,
In order to hodd the notice of any validity, tihat
the condition should be construed te nxean that
the Minister niay cancel the lease, but must
then ýgive notice to the lessee that he bas done
iso. This is in terme what the letter of the
13th SeVtemnber, 1909, does. There can be no
doubt that this Is not such a notice as is called
for. The notice mnust be to the effect tbat It la
the intention of the Minister to cancel the lease
for breach of the conditions of the lease, thus
glving the ilesseea an opportunlty of remedylng
the breach, or at any rate cf being bearKd before
bis lease is forfelted. There can be no obJeet
In a notice étbat the -lase has been already

most extreme view, the notice sbould state tbat
tbe Minister cancels tbe lase for breach of
condition and -not that he 'bad aIready done so
without notice, which be hadt no power te do.

As honourable niembers of the House
will notice, this is a very technical question.
The Department says: " We have been
obliged to cancel your bease, and it will,
thorefore, now make sucb other disposition
of the land as may seeni advisable." This
was the f orm eniployed. After having
discussed. the waiver and declared that it
was sucb as to proclude the Department
froni foreclosing, the judgment of the
Privy Council on this point proceedsý:
Having corne to this conclusion, It I. unnecessary for thelr LordshIslp te deal with the
point of the sufflclency of the steps taken te
effectcancei-lation otf the defandant'a lease. The
words of clause 17 are: "The Minister may
cancel týheise presents by wrtttea notice to the
sald dessee, and tbereupon"1 everythlng tlheredn
shail become vold, etc. *Under thl. clause the
notice ls the ciperatilve Instrument. The cancallation l. effected by IL. Inatead of servlng a,

canceuled at any time during the six raontha
betweaa, March il and Se~Ptember 13.

That ia, instead of notifying the lessee
that bis lease has been concelled, the notice

should, according to the Privy Council,
state: "Your lease i*s 'hereby cancelled."
This fine distiniction will appeal to the
legal acumený of somxe honourable menibers
of this Chambrer, but I arn quite sure that
the ordinary business man will hardly see
any difference between the two modes oif
procedure, and, as a niatter of fact, in
17,000 or 20,000 cases the lessee took for
granted that the cancellation was clear
enough, and he accepted the cancellation
as it was miade. Paulson et ai, I believe,
would hardly have thought it worth their
while to raise that point alone, if there
had nlot been the question of the waiver,
the right of the Department to cancel, because of the fact that it had on very many
occasions previously waived its right to
do so.
Then there is the question of the sufficiency of the service of the notice:
Again, there ls no satlsfactory evidence, that

Messrs. Lewis and Sinelllie were ever clothed
with authorlty by Mr. Paulson to receive such a
notice on bis bebalif. One has bittie moral doubt
that the recetpt cd this letter camne to the
reepondent's knowledge, but tihe service of such
documents as this should be fully proved by
legal evidence. The Inclination of their opinion
ls that the &ppeitant,loses on both these points.

It is because of this inclination ecpressed
by the Privy Coundil, after having declared that the lessees, were right in their
contention that the :foreclosure had been
waived, that the Department has f oit that
it should take cognizance of the opinion
of the Privy Council and try by this Bill
now before the Sonate to covor the multiplicity of transactions that have taken
place after the cancellations. If we were
facing only one or two cancellations the
matter would be of very little importance,
but we can have no conception of the extent of the damage whidh would ensue to
present holders of properties which have
been developed at the cost of -millions and
tens of millions of dollars if we lef t them
with an uncertain title whon the procedure
has been carried on in good faith and
acceded to by ail the lessees up to the
present time.
My honourable friend bas raised the
constitutional question. He asks me to
considor the question of the right of the
Federal authorities to legisiato on the form
of a civil contract.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, on
the changing of a civil contract already
entered into.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On the changing of a civil contract already ontered into.

SENATE

My honourable friend seems to admit that
the legislature could interfere in the present instance, and could alter, modify, or
amend the contract of the Crown represented by the Federal authorities, while the
Federal power would not have that right.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Between subjects they could, and certainly
with the consent of the Crown they could.
I do not know whether the legislature
could alter the right of the Crown as
represented by the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is where
we stand at present. Section 91 of the
British North America Act, without restricting the Federal powers, but in order
to illustrate those powers and define them
somewhat more closely, says that His
Majesty the King, through the Dominion
Parliament, has the exclusive right to deal
with the public Federal debt and property.
Now, we are dealing with property vested
in the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
No,
pardon me: you are dealing with a contract
regarding property vested in the Federal
Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A contract
which was made under a direction of the
Federal parliament giving authority to the
Governor in Council. The Federal authorities have done certain things under the
power of this Parliament. Is there another
legislative power that can deal with certain rights which were granted by the Federal authority to private individuals? The
Federal power has the exclusive right to
lease properties belonging to it. If you
allow the legislature power to review such
contracts madr, by the Federal authority,
then you allow the Provincial authority,
under subsection 13 of section 92, to invade
the jurisdiction of the Federal authority,
and possibly to restiict and confiscate the
property which it holds for the Crown.
If the legislature could intervene to affect
a contract entered into by the Federal
authority concerning the lease of property
vested in the Dominion Government, then
the legislative power of the Province would
supereede that of the Federal power in the
disposition and administration of the Federal domain; and, although I recognize that
the Privy Council has not been seized of
this question up to this date, I doubt that
my honourable friend will find any judicial
authority which would throw any light on
this matter. I believe that, after examining the whole situation, he will realize that
the Canadian Parliament will justly claim
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND

the sole authority upon contracts which are
made for the disposition of property that
belongs to the Dominion. The powers we
are thus exercising are, I believe, but a
natural consequence of the fact that we
have complete authority over the Federal
domain.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The argument of the honourable gentleman would
lead to the conclusion that a contract concerning its own lands is not binding upon
the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is, until
the Federal Parliament deems it necessary
to intervene.
Progress was reported.

BUFFALO AND FORT ERIE BRIDGE
COMPANY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr'. BELCOURT rnoved the second
reading of Bill 21, an Act to incorporate
Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Comnpany.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, before this Bill is adopted by
the House, 1 would like to make a few
observations. I regret exceedingly that I
arn not as well qualified as I would like to
be to deal with the subi ect, because of the
fact that I did not know that the legisiation was before the House until I saw it on
the Order Paper to-day. However, I do
know something of the situation at Buffalo
and Fort Erie, and of the necessity of
having a bridge constructed, because Fort
Erie is located in the county from which I
come. There is at the present time a ferry
service between Fort Erie and the city of
Buffalo exactly at the point where Lake
Erie empties into the Niagara River. A
short distance below that spot there is a
railway bridge owned by the Grand Trunk
Railway Comnpany, now the property of the
State; and further down the river, at
Niagara Falls, there are several bridges
for both railway and pedestrian traffic.
For sorne years it has been urged and
advocated that a bridge for pedestrians and

303

vehicular *traffic, (and to carry street cars,
should be constructed at the head of *the
river, connecting Buffalo with. Fort Erie.
With that project I arn in full accord, but
with the method by which it is proposed te
carry it out I arn not in agreemnent, and I
purpose to lay a few of the facts before
the House.
Two years ago representations were made
to the Government respecting the desirability of the construction of a bridge at this
point. The facts as they existed, and the
needs as they were presented, were carefully considered by the Minister of Railwàys of that day, who is now a member of
this House, and who I regret is flot present
this afternoon, and I acconipanied hirn upon
We did not have an
an investigation.
opportunity of discussing the matter with
many local people; but we did corne to the
distinct conclusion that the proper solution of the situation was to doubletrack
the railway bridge at present existing and
to add thereto, facilities. for vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, and to charge the samne
tolls as now prevail for the vehicular and
foot bridges at Niagara Falls. The large
arnount of traffic which would cross the
river at that point is now diverted to the
bridges at Niagara Falls because of the
ferry not offering sufficient facilities to
meet the requirements; and there was no
doubt in our minds that the undertaking
would be a profitable one and would pay
the interest on the rnoney invested in
the reconstruction and improvement of the
railway property, which belongs to the
people.

I amn therefore against the principle of
this Bill, not because of the desire of any
private gentlemen te construct the bridge,
but because I believe that as an international project it should be undertaken by
the state rather than by a private concern;
and, furtherrnore, because the prornoters
of the Bill and the provisional direotors are
al local men, apparently with no connections or interests on the Americani side of
the line. In addition to that, in section 9
of the Bill it is proposed to give a private
corporation the right to expropriate property under the Railway Act, and I do net
think it is in the best interests of the community and the property owners there that
the power of expropriation exercised by a
railway should be given to a private undertaking of this kind.
I therefore respectfully suggest, that this
inatter ought to be lather carefully looked
into and that more information should be
obtained upon it before the Bill is approved. My personal view is that improved

THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from April 27, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster:
That he will call attention to the aims and
work of the League of Nations and will inquire :-1. If the Government has received any
report from the representatives of Canada as to
the second Assembly of the League of Nations
held in Geneva in September and October, 1921,
and if so, will this report be laid on the table
for the information of members?
2. If the Government has received the printed
reports of the Council of the League of Nations
made to the first and second Assembly, and if
so, will copies of these reports be laid on the
table for the information of members?
3. If the Government bas rece;ived the printed
monthly summary and supplementary reports of
the League of Nations, and will copies of these
reports be brought down?

Hon. L. O. DAVID: I rise less to speak
than to give an opportunity to other honourable gentlemen to ask for the adjournment of this debate. On account of the
condition of my throat I will say only a
few words.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

The motion of the right honourable member for Ottawa raises two questions-the
question of the League, which he discussed
with the talent which characterizes him,
and the other question which was raised
by the honourable member for Welland
(Hon. G. D. Robertson), the honourable
ex-Minister of Labour-the labour question-although that question is indirectly
connected with the motion made by the
right honourable mover of the motion. I
had intended to speak at some length of
these two questions, and had even prepared copious notes, but I will make only
very few remarks, and I will try to make
them not only short but as cold as possible
on account of the heat. That does not
mean that my speech will be refreshing.
The honourable ex-Minister of Labour
was anxious to know why one of the most
eminent and popular of the chiefs of the
Radical party and representative of the
Labour people in France had been assassiI suppose the honourable

member forgot at that moment that the
man in question, the celebrated Jaurès,
was assassinated because he had protested
against war at the time when all the
nations of Europe were mobilizing, and
when they were really at war; in fact, he
was assassinated on the eve of the declaration of war. To oppose war at such a
moment was considered an act of treason,
and that was the view taken by the jury
before whon the assassin was brought,
which declared hin not guilty. Naturally
I do not approve of that verdict, but at
that time, as in many other circumstances,
sentiment and patriotic feeling prevailed
over law and justice. The fact is that if
the views of Mr. Jaurès and all the other
chiefs of the Labour party had been adopted
in France that country would have been
left powerless, and the Germans would
have been in Paris two or three months
after the declaration of war. Even now,
if the theories and the position of some
of the chiefs of the Radical and Labour
party had been adoptéd in France, that
country would now be unable to meet the
obligations which have been produced by
the alliance of Germany and Russia, or to
overcome the machinations of those two
countries.
There is a striking example which shows
that the triumph of socialistic ideas is not
sufficient to prevent war. That example
is Russia. What is the most Radical government in Europe, and I might say perhaps in the world, established in great
part and supported by the Labour people?

Russia offers a striking example of the
evils caused by the application of those extraordinary and extreme doctrines. Borrowing the expressions used by the Ottawa
Journal, I would say:
Communism brought no happiness, but
unspeakable misery, terror, crime, bloodshed,
pestilence, famiie and death, to such an
extent that Lenin, who was to replace the
curse of capitalism by the heavens of Comnunism, now cries for capital.

Nobody can dispute the truth of the assertion made by the Journal. Experience
shows that capital and individual initiative
are necessary to the welfare of a country.
But capitalists must realize that the time
is past when they could build colossal fortunes, enjoy all the luxuries of life, and
leave those who helped them to acquire
their fortunes in poverty and misery. If
they do not understand that, the Labour
people will make them understand it, and
will perhaps go too far in that direction.
But I said I would not make a speech,
so I must finish. As to the main question
raised by the right honourable member for
Ottawa (Right Lon. Sir George E. Foster),
as I think it will ceme before this House
later in another form, I will content myself
with making a few remarks upon our participation in international affairs. I think
we shall be better able to discuss this question when the documents asked for in the
motion of the right honourable member are
produced, and we can see what our status
is in the League of Nations. The question
of our status is a big one, and it has lately
been discussed by some very eminent men,
like Sir Clifford Sifton and Mr. Ewart.
So I think that the question will come again
before this House, and when it does I will
try to say more upon this question, which
is so interesting and so deeply concerns
the destinies of this country. But before
taking my seat I want to say this, that,
although I voted for Canada's participation in the work of the League, I had some
misgivings in doing so. I felt that that
participation raised very important questions and might cause very dangerous complications in our relations with England
and the United States. It is impossible
that in those conterences there shall never
be a clash ibetween the interests of Canada
and those of England or of the United
States. What will be the result of those
complications, of those clashes? They may
be very serious and may cause us a great
deal of trouble. I hope that our representatives in those international conferences
will do what is necessary to reconcile our
interests with those of England and of all
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

the Dominions, I hope they will be wise
enough to do that. It requires a good deal
of tact and wisdom to produce such a result. But I hope, honourable gentlemen,
that above all they will consider the interests of Canada. Canada is our home. Our
country is great, rich enough in its history,
brilliant enough in its destiny, to be the
main object of our love, our care, and our
aspirations. Our ancestors opened this
country to civilization by dint of courage
and heroism, and we are bound to transmit
this glorious inheritance to future generations by adopting a true Canadian policybut, as least as long as possible, without
injuring our relations with England. Honourable members from Ontario especially
must remember wher "Canada First" was
the motto of some of their most eminent
political men, like the Blakes and the
Mosses and several others. Well, honourable gentlemen, I think that should also be
the motto of our public men of the present
day, and that they should do everything
necessary in order that Canada may continue to grow and develop its resources
under the protection of the British flag,
under the guidance of British institutions,
until---well, until its destiny requires a
radical change in its political status.
Hon. THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable
gentlemen, I am sure that every member
of this House was deeply interested in listening to the exhaustive and illuminating
speech delivered some time ago b.y the
right honourable Senator for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster). His
expounding of the question of the League
of Nations has been complete. He has
made us better understand the importance,
the organization, the aims, and the funetions of that great international institution.
Now, honourable gentlemen, during the
short remarks that I intend to make on this
subject I would like to call the attention
of this House to the fact that from the
remotest historical periods to our day the
need of such a society of nations or states

Nations is not really a new thing. It is an
old idea embodied in machinery adapted to
modern necessities and existing problems.
When we read the ancient annals of Greece,
we see that a number of Grecian cities had
found it advisable to form a kind of league

When that Order in

idea that His Majesty the King may have

temperament of the right honourable gentleman; but it adided that if it represented,
for a time, some danger, yet, before long,
as a matter of course, the Dominions beyond the Seas would cease corresponding
with the Imperial Government or with His
Majesty the King through the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, because surely
the Dominions beyond the Seas had ceased
being under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why, then, was
it that the Order in Council was sent to
him and submitted to him?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may tell my
honourable friend that I inquired, and I
found that it was done in that way because
such has been the tradition.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not a
convincing reason.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is not a
reason satisfactory to myself, but T hope
the time will soon come when we shall find
another channel for the Dominions overseas to reach His Majesty the King.
Honourable gentlemen, we heard the
statement a moment ago from the honourable gentleman from Granville (Hon. Mr.
Chapais) that the idea of the League of
Nations or Society of Nations for the
maintenance of peace was not a new idea.
We all realize that it is a very old dream,
cherished from century to century as far
back as history is written.
In modern
times the nearest approach made before
1914 to the formation of a League of
Nations was the calling of the official Peace
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Conferences of 1898 and of 1907 at the
Hague. The late Czar Nicholas of Russia
called the first one, and the late President
Roosevelt put in motion the machinery for
calling the second in 1907. In 1898 there
were 27 nations congregated at the Hague
through 100 representatives. In 1907 there
were 44 nations there, represented by 256
delegates.
I want to pa.y homage to one of the
best men that 1 have had the advantage
of meeting in my life, as the initiator of
those conferenes, and I am happy to find
him in the ranks of Labour. He was a
very modest English carpenter. His name
was William Randall Cremer. Ie founded,
about 1880, the first Workmen's Peace
Society in London, and he was elected, by
a Labour riding in one of the divisions of
London, to the House of Commons in 1885.
In 1887 he obtained the signatures of 234
members of the British House of Commons
to an address to His Majesty the King
and to the President of the United States
in favour of international arbitration. He
himself crossed to Washington with some
colleagues of his, and presented that petition to the President of the United States.
In 1888 he ha the idea that something
should be done to bring the ýparliamentarians together, to have them commingle
and know each other better, and thus help
to maintain peace, and he crossed over to
Paris in that year with a dozen members
of the British Parliament to meet as many
members of the French Assembly. There
the lnterparliamentary Union for Peace
was founded. The object of that association was to create P universal sentiment
in favour of international arbitration and
a limitation of armaments.
In 1888 there were those two groupE
which met in Paris. In 1913 there were 27
parliaments represented by over 700 legislators, and coming from all quarters of
the world, at the Hague Temple of Peace
that had just been opened through the munificence of Andrew Carnegie. I had the
advantage of attending some of those meetings, as representing the Canadian group.
I realize that, although all the questions
that are being debated by the League of
Nations were being studied by men of
standing at those congresses, yet the great
stumbling-block was the fact that huge armaments existed around the world, while
German Imperialism sternly strove to maintain its supremacy on the continent of
Europe. There seemed to be needed a
cataclysm which would shake the world to
its base so as to alter the minds and hearts

of the people; a new gospel had to be

of which the principie of self -determination should be heralded and recognized.
The questions wbich we are -ail asking
ourseives are: will the League of Nations
maintain peac-e and order? will it succeed
in doing its Nvork? As the bonourable
gentleman from Grarville states, it bas no
army, no power, to enforce its decisions.
No, it bas no physical force, apparently.
But it has considerable moral f orce, and I
should say material force as well, by the
economic pressure that could be directed
against a recaicitrant nation. 1 would say
that eeonomic pressure would be sufficient,
anmply sufficier.t, if-and unfortunately
there is an "if"ý-the United States belonged

SENATE

Because the people of a democratic country
were dependent entirely upon the press for their
information and opinions on world events, no
organization, could undertake a more valuable
work than to insist that proof of malicious
articles should be produced or that writers discredited.
This is only too true, and in view of this
situation and what daily reaches us from

London and Paris, I urge the League of
Nations to hasten the establishment of a
publicity bureau which will give us weekly,
or, if necessary, daily, the real situation
in regard to matters which a certain press
is trying to distort. People with only one
source of information are handicapped in

this respect.
They cannot realize to what
an extent they are imposed upon. There is
a certain advantage in knowing two languages. It is most amusing at times to
compare papers received by the same mail
from London and Paris. When one is able
to read the papers from both capitals, he
realizes more and more the necessity for
an international press bureau under the
direction and guardianship of the League of
Nations, to strike the true, honest note,
which will be a note of peace and amity.
It is *a truism to affirm that the League of
Nations needs the support of public opin-

ion. If it needs that support, it must reach
it.
I am only re-echoing the statement
honourable gentleman from Granville
Mr. Chapais) when I say that the
Treaty has shown some weaknesses
sanctions, or lack of sanctions to

of the
(Hon.

force

Germany to carry out its obligations.
If
it was not advisable to include in the Treaty
sterner sanctions in order to exact conpliance by the nation which had wrecked
ten departments of France and a large area

in Belgium-if it was not opportune to
provide those necessary sanctions, then some
inducement

should have been included in

the Treaty to cause the Germans to realize
that it was to their interest to repair at
least a small part of the damage they had
done. We all know that under the Treaty
they are obliged only to repair material
damage and to pay the pensions. From the
whole cost of the war they are free. It
has struck me that there might have been
inserted in the treaty a sanction which
would have warned the Germans that if
within three years they had not repaired
the damage in the devastated regions, the
five or six hundred thousand people who
had been driven from their homes and returned only to sleep ;in the cellars, would
then require temporary possession of as
many homes on the left bank of the Rhine,
or German soil, in order that after six or
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

seven years they might have a chance
to sleep in decent beds, and that they would
remain in that German territory until the
Germans had repaired the damage. That
has not been ,done.
And, if the sanctions were not sufficient,
it seems to me a further inducement to
make reparation could have been offered
the Germans: it would not be too late to
tell them that when they had repaired the
damage, and perhaps gone further than is
provided for by the Treaty, the colonies
which they held, and which are now under
mandate, would be handed back to them.
They have a population of sixty-five millicns and are a prolific people, and it is
to be expected that within fifty years they
will overflow their present borders, which
offer no natural frontier protection to Poland on one side or to France on the other.
They will, some day, need part of the
outside territories which are open to colonization. I think the offer might have
been made to the Germans that when they

had made sufficient reparation their former
colonies would be handed back to them.
These are, honourable gentlemen, the few
remarks that I desired to make after hearing my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster) describe the
work, the good work, that was being done
by the League of Nations. I repeat, the
principal idea which I desire to convey to

my right honourable friend and to the
League of Nations is that of the paramount
importance of creating a publicity bureau
in order that the people throughout the
world may hear daily a note of peace and
not distorted opinion from interested quarters.
I have much pleasure in depositing on
the Table of the House the documents
which my right honourable friend called
for, and I invite honourable members to
read the report which the right honourable
gentleman himself has made on the Second
Conference, which he attended-a report
which is most interesting.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I should like to
ask my honourable friend a question, which
I refrained from asking earlier in order
not to disturb the sequence of his address.
I understood the honourable gentleman, in
referring to the appointment of the Right
Honourable Sir Robert Borden, to say that
he was appointed by Order in Council
passed by the Canadian Cabinet.
Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And that the Order
in Council appointing Sir Robert Borden

JUNE 8, 1922
to represent the Canadian Government at
Washington was transmnitted to His Majesty through the Secretary of State for
the Colonies. I doubt that the fact of
the services of the Secretary of ýState for
the Colonies being used for that purpose
implied that he had the right to override
the Order in Council. I should rather think
that constitutionally it would not have
been permitted-that 'he was used merely
as a channel for the purpose of reaching
His Majesty. I would like to be enlightened
on this question, which I thinlc involves a
very important constitutional point.
I can only
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
state the facts. The Order in Council
was passed and it reached IIis Majesty
through the channel of the Secretary of
State f or the Colonies. My honourable
friend asks me if in my opinion the ýSecretary of State for the Colonies could have
ignored the mandate which was being
given him to convey that document to His
Majesty the King. I do not know what the
Secretary of State for the Colonies would
deem to ibe his duty. I should surmise that
in most instances he would comply with
the request conveyed to him; yet it must be
remembered that he owes allegiance to
the Cabinet of which he is a member and
that in certain cases he may deemn it proper
to exercise his own judgment as to executing a mandate which comes to him from the
outside Dominions. I said Vhat in reality
the Hon. Mr. Pearce was right in declaring
that the representatives of the Dominions
were appointed by Orders in Council of
their respective executives, but that, as
to the form, it would still appear that we
were dependents and not equals, since we
were using the Department of the Secretary of State for the Colonies instead of
reaching His Majesty through his representative the Governor General.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will iny hiynourable friend permit me to ask him a
question?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable friend has not told us whether or not
the Order in Couneil appointing the Right
Hon. Sir Ro'bert Borden to go to Washington was signed (by gHis Excellency the
Governor General Ibefore being sent over.
I should like to know that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Order in

ency the Governor General.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite so. Then
that leads me to the very question which
is the meat of the matter: why was it necessary to have it signed by His Majesty?
For the

outside world.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, 1 see.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Very important.
My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend overlooks one very important tact, to whkch he has made no
allusion and which it seems to me is fundamental to the proper appreciation of
this subject and a proper conclusion regarding it: the invitation to that conference was issued by the United States to
the Imperial Government.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hlear, hear.
Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not to
Canada, not to the other Dominions overseas. Consequently it became necessary
that the representatives of the Dominions
overseas should pass through the channels
connected with the state invited to attend
that conference. Assuming that we were
a sovereign state and h.ad one sovereign,
King George, will my honourable friend
suggest how the representatives of the
Dominions beyond the seas would attend
that conference when they were nlot specifieally invited as representatives of those
particular dominions?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But that is
not the question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
treated that question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend should make himself
acquainted with it.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
all about it.

Oh, I know

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But if
my honourable friend attacks the method
of appointment he should keep in view the
tact that the invitation was extended to
only one Government.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And
that Government simply said: " We are a
commonwealth of nations; we have one
sovereign, and the invitation must come
through that sovereign "ý-

316

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Certainly.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:-"to the
representatives of those nations constituting the commonwealth."
Consequently
they attended only as the representatives
of one state.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Surely.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Representatives of the Empire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend is absolutely in errorHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let us
know the facts, then.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:-and he will
not be supported by the right honourable
gentleman who has put this inquiry (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster). The invitation went from the United States to London, and it was there decided that the
Empire should be represented by those
nominated from London, constituting a
British Imperial delegaton. That was the
decision, and it was acted upon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
not stated to the contrary: that is precisely what I have said.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ah, yes, but
there is a little something that my honourable friend has not stated. Mr. Smuts
cabled to London that he objected to that
procedure--that he did not want the
power which had been granted to my right
honourable friend and his colleagues, of
representing the Dominions, to be diminished at Washington. He desired that
the Dominions should be represented
directly. And, in spite of the fact that
Mr. Lloyd George had made the statement
that it was a British delegation, representing the whole Empire, and appointed from
London, he gave way and recognized the
claim put forward by Mr. Smuts, and
Canada was communicated with. The details I could lay before the House. An
Order in Council was passed appointing
the Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden as the
Canadian representative.
The Order in
Council was sent over to London.
His
Majesty appointed the Right Hon. Sir
Robert Borden to go to Washington as his
representative for Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Certainly, but my honourable friend still misunderstands what the situation really was.
When Mr. Smuts communicated with the
Imperial Government or Mr. Lloyd George,
Mr. Lloyd George at once appreciated
Hon.

Sir JAMES LOUG'HEED.

the fact that the Imperial Government in
London could not say to the United States:
"We will not attend your conference unless
you invite our overseas Dominions;" consequently there was no other alternative
than for the Imperial Government to make
the appointments precisely as my honourable friend has just mentioned. It would
have been a most unseemly thing, and discourteous to the United States, if the Imperial Government had said to Washington:
"You must change your invitation; instead
of inviting the Imperial Government to
this conference, you must issue invitations
to the representative of Canada, the representative of Australia, and the representative of South Africa."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And Newfoundland.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
what it would resolve itself into. If this
is an Empire, there must be one head to
the Empire; and in our internationtal
relations those communications can be only
with one sovereign or with one head of the
entire state. That is what happened in
this particular case, and it seems to me
that nobody who is not hypercritical can
take exception to the method followed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I simply indicated that another channel could be constituted, and I cited a London paper which
said that the time had come for the Dominions overseas to have another representative than the Secretary of State for
the Colonies approach in their name His
Majesty the King.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, while it is not quite the practice for members of the Senate to speak
after the leader of the Government has
spoken, I would crave permission to do so
for a very few moments. I had intended
to think what I might say on this very
important subject, which has been so eloquently and so lucidly introduced by the
right honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster).
May I join with those who have preceded
me in expressing my congratulations to the
honourable gentleman upon the able way
in which he bas dealt with the subject; and
may I venture to express the hope that
he will not content himself with discussing
this question, as he told us he would, once
a year only, but that he, who follows so
closely the doings of the League of Nations,
s'hould provide the House with knowledge as he gathers it from his intimacy
and connection with the work in question.

Washingtan was decided upon, it was af

at Washingtan wauld communicate with the
Imperial Gavernrnent. He could nat carnmunicate výith Canada or Australia, and
still less the Colonies. The Governrnent ut
Washington invited the Gavernment at
Westminster ta corne ta this conference,
.ad the Gcve-nme-t't at Westminster accepted the invitation. When the tirne came
the Government at Westminster, out of pure
grace or pure kindness, and no daubt out of
recagnition af the part the Dominions had
played in the war, decided ta ask certain
Canadian representatives ta join the Brit.
ish representatives s0 that the whole rnight
constitute one complete Britiish delagation
at Washington. But we had no right te
expect, and certainly fia right ta in'dist
at Westminster, that any Canadian should
forrn part of that delegation. I repeat that
it was an act of grace; it was merely the
daing of sornething whi-ch. the limperial G<>varnment was nat bound ta do. Having
decided that the Dominions should take
part, they invited Canada ta nama certain
gentlemen who rnight came along with the
Imperial rapresentatives ta Washington
and f arm part of this one singla dalegation. Canada was asked nierely ta narne
sorneone. The Government of the day
chose ta do it by Ordar In Counil-and I
amn not criticizing thern for that-but it
might just as weIl have been done by letter. The'Minister might just as well have
communicated. with London and gïiven the
name of the Right Hon. -Sir Robert Bordert.
There was fia nacessity for an Order in
Council.
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Gavernent speaks by Ordar in Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Gavarnment
sometimes communicates with statas or
persans without an Order in Council.
Howevar, it does not make any difference.
It could have done the one thing or the

317

other, and either would have been perfectly right constitutionally. The matter,
flot the form adapted, is the matter to
which. I attach some importance, because
it affects aur status. The Right Han. Sir
Robert Barden was added to the English
gentlemen sent to Washingtan-rnay I repeat the words of rny hanaurable friend
Sir James Laugheed-to constitute one
single British delegation. 1 wonder what
rny honourable friend the Han. Mr. Dandurand would say ta me if I were ta ask
hirn what wauld have happened at Washingtan had Sir Rabert Barden disagreed
with the Earl af Balfour, for instance.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What
wauld have happened?

but we could very woll be told to-morrow
that wcv have nlot the right to do these
things.
But what I want especially to do is to
re-echo the words of the Earl of Balfour
which were used by iny right bonourabl,!
friend in this House, and which to me were
"If not a League of
very convincing:
Nations, what?" To me there is absolutely
no other hope of any kind that we can turn
to if we are going to get out of the frightful
miess in which the world has found itself
since the war. I repeat: "If not the League
of Nations, what?" I think I arn right in
saying that of ail the peoples of the
earth there is -none which has more
direct and more immediate interests in the
League of Nations than Canada. Canada
bas many other things to do than to go
to war or to participate in war. We are a
country of imnmense distances, a country
of great resources. We have the boundea
duty îmrposed upon us by Providence of
putting forth ail our energies and efforts
and brains to deve'lop our territories, flot
exclusively for ourselves, but for the world.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

We must, if possible, avoid practising the
arts of war; on the contrary, we must
practise the arts of peace. I think I may
say without fear of contradiction that
there is no other country in the worid
that wànts peace and needs peace moreý
than Canada. For that reason, like my
honourabie friend to my left (Hon. Mr.
Béique-I arn looking forward to world
peace. I have been laughed at mnany a
time; I have been called a dreamer because I have dreamed of Canada as a
country entirei1y devoted to the arts of
peace and preserved from practising the
arts of war. The Great War was a very
rude shock to me, but it was not sufficient
to destroy my faith in the doctrine to
which I have linked my hopes, that if yon
wish for peace you must prepare for peace.
The only way in which these hopes can
be realized is through the League of Nations.
The Whole motive and basis and
paramounit dbject of the League of Nations is to do betweenstates what men have

It is
true that the process of leading men individually out of the jungle has ýbeen a long
and tedious task.
It is hoped that the
nations of the world will learn the lesson
more quickly than the individuals.
But
until we can convince the world that arbitrament and not force, as it was in the
jungle, is the only means by whieh we can
bring about entente and world peace beiween the nations, we are not going te have
it.
That, of course, is the paramnount object of the League of Nations.
To s-ay that Canada or any other peope

this question is to propound a heresy. That

the part which I think they ought to take
in the working out of the objects of the
League of Nations is something to be ve-ry
nmuch regretted.
I do not agree with efny
honourable friend, however, that the part'icipation of the United States in the League
of Nations is an absolute necessity. I -do flot
agree with the doctrine that unless they join
it is going to be chaos. I believe that the rest
of the nations can and probabiy will maintain and perpetuate the object the League
bas in view, even if the United States are
not a party to it. I can quite realize that
direct opposition to the League of Nations
would pro-bably hinder and delay for a

say that the United States are a necessary

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: We have in this
House three or four ex-Cabinet Ministers.
0f course, they must not divulge Cabinet
secrets, but they were present, and I suppose it came as a sort of disappointment
to them when they heard of this Conference in Washn*ýgton and that we were to
be hef t out. They might take the Senate
into their confidence and admit that it was
sýgreat disappointment not to be invited to,

of the world were to be settled. I suppose
they got their heads together and said:
"It is too bad we are not invited; what will
we look like in the League of Nations if we
cannot get to Washington?"
Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend making -a statement of
faet?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn speaking.
You can judge for yourself.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend dealing with a fact?
Hon. Mr. CA.SGRAIN: Which?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
statement you have just made?
Hon. Mr. CA SGRAIN: That Canada was
not invited?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If so,
hie is entirely unaware of what went on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He means, by
Washington.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is what I
mean; I said it must have been a wrench
to tho>se who think we are a nation, when
by the nation right next door, the nearest
nation to us, there was no invitation sent;
it was sent acroas the water to the mother
country-and it was rightly sent there.
Then 'we said: "The parents were invited;
they will have to invite the children, so
we will beg for an invitation." The Imperial Parliamont got out of it by -doing
what they did. They said to Canada:
"Give us a name, and we will appoint him
as one of our own;" and Sir Robert Borden
wvent there as a delegate or a commisioner
of Hîs Majesty King George, appointed
upon the advice of the Imperial Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I challenge that statement. It was upon the advice of the Executive Council of the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He went
as representing both, and had the status of
a British representative just the sanie as
Mr. Balfour, or any other, and likewise
represented Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And King George
neyer put his name on that paper except
on the advice of the Imperial Government.
What could poor King George do? Is he
going to take advice from Ottawa and
from. London at the same time? If the

320

SENATE

advices differ, how is he to act as our
King? There is only one King, and one
Empire, and one Flag; you must not forget that; and the Right Honourable Sir
Robert Borden went there as the King's
representative.
I did not hear all this discussion, but I
think the positicn taken, as I understood
a moment ago, by General Smuts was much
more dignified: " If you do not want to invite me, I do not want to beg for an invitation to go to your Conference." While we are
talking of General Smuts and bis 200,000
Boers, I want to know what rights Canada
enjoys in the League of Nations that General Smuts and bis 200,000 Boers do not
enjoy, except the fact that they pay less
than we do to belong to the League? That
is all there is to it, nothing else, and as
for our belonginig to the League of Nations,
it is a beautiful dream. One that bas
gone, but for whose opinion I had a great
deal of respect-the Right Honourable Sir
Wilfrid Laurier-always said, "It is a
beautiful dream, as old as the hills, this
league of nations." If any honourable gentleman will take the trouble to go to the
library here he will find the work of St.
Pierre published and dated in 1736. In
1716 he published 20 volumes on that, and
nobody read his volumes, so 20 years
afterwards he made a summary of all his
writings. I had that book in my hands
for one whole winter. The fourteen points
of Mr. Wilson, ex-President of the United
States, were there, and some more points,
too. It was the same thing.
I think we are in this League of Nations
only by tolerance. In the argument the
American Senatc's attitude was mentioned,
and it was ask4ud why they would not join
the League of Nations. They said, "King
George will have six votes and the United
States will only have one. Well, if they are
going to stack the pack we won't play."
The American representatives would have
no standing there unless they could bring
with them the majority of the Senate. It
was to suit the humour of their own President that the League was started, because
European diplomats know that it is nothing
but a visionary scheme. As everybody
knows, it was to please President Wilson
that it was organized, and what happened?
As soon as be went home the United States
took all the applause that their Chief
Magistrate was getting; they accepted
everything"nice that was said about him,
but when it came to the American Senate,
they would not have it.
I do not know why anybody, even my
leader, is anxious to get the United States
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

to join the League. What would be the
good of their'representatives unless, forsooth, they could bring along with them,
every time they voted, a majority of the
American Senate?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Just for a minute I want to call the attention of the honourable leader of the Government to a suggestion I made in the
latter part of my speech when I introduced
this subject, and to which he has not referred. I hope it bas not escaped his mind,
and in order to refresh hlm I shall make
the suggestion again.
I am a little bit sorry that in a discussion upon the League of Nations we should
have got into a wrangle on what bas no
relation to it in the world, and which bas
had the effect somewhat of souring the
soup. But let that pass. I do not propose
to take any part in that discussion at the
present time.
My honourable friend who represents the
Government here was rightly strong on one
point, that is, that if the League of Nations
was to be successful, the people must be
educated.
My suggestion, made in my
address, ran along that line. I do not want
my honourable friend to think that the
nations engaged in the League of Nations
are unalive to the necessity of spreading
information. In a people of nine millions
such as we have in Canada information
goes slowly, and takes a long time to permeate them with the principles and practice of anything new, or comparatively new,
in public enterprise. The world is bigger
than Canada, and to attempt to indoctrinate the world is a very large operation.
It was not thought proper that the League
of Nations itself should contribute the
propaganda to support it, by the immense
amount of money that would be necessary
to support it well, but this was to be done
by independent propaganda in every nation
of the League. That task was left to
each nation itself, and it has been taken up
by almost every nation that is at present a
member of the League, and a great deal
of most excellent work has already been
begun and is being carried on. In Great
Britain itself they are raising this year
a fund of a million pounds for the express
nurpose of spreading information and of
bringing home to the units of that nation
the necessity for these principles and practices, and consequently getting their support.
The suggestion I made to my honourable friend, which I think is a duty of
the Government, was to see that infor-

JUNE 8, 1922
mnation which is now being published
monthly and eemi-monthly by the League
of Nations at Geneva is made available to
the niembers of both Houses of Parliament here. It is our League; we helped
to start it; they are doing the woric that
we commissioned them te do; they are
doing the work that we are supporting
them in doing. We in Parlianient should
know exactly what they are doing, through
the officiai publications that they issue.
Now, it requires but a small suni to be
put in the Estiniates te provide every
member of Parliament with the monthly
and semi-monthly publications of the
League ef Nations. They are informing:
t'hey are comprehensive; if you read them
through you carry along with you ail that
the League is doing, and how it is doing it,
and the exact progress that it is making.
I hold th.at it is the duty of the Government to form some liaison between
Geneva, the seat of the League of Nations,
and its doings, and the men in Parliament
who support ithat League of Nations in
the appropriations that we make in Parliament. I can conceive of nothing stronger
as an agency than 235 members of the
Commons and about 90 me-mbers ef the
Senate-ail alive on this question, as I
know they are-having the information at
hand from. month te mnontdl and from week
te week, and in their various spheres of
influence, which are distinguished and
which are notable in ahl the districts ef
Canada, using that information with their
neighbours, with their electorate, with
their friends. What aiency can be better?
What step by the Government would be
better, considering the advocacy of my
honourable friend who represents the
Government here, than the appropriation
of the sum of money necessary to provide
this regular information? And if the
Government would go one step further,
and provide for putting it into the hands
of every Provincial legislator as well as
the Dominion legisiators it would be a
good thing to do, and would not cost very
much. I want to bring that te the attention of my honourable friend, and I hope
that he will net allow his Government to
pass that around the corner.
I want te thank honourable members
of the 'Senate for the kindness with which
they received my initial address, and for
their support, the sulent and the spoken
support that they have given the cause.
It only requires good will, high courage
and persistent effort ef the flfty-one nations,

SACKVILLE SHIPPING FACILITIES
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Before the Orders
of the Day are called, I desire to refer for
a moment to an answer which on Tuesday
last was given to a question put on the
Order Paper by myself in regard to the
Sackville wharf. I regret that I was not
present when the answer was given, and
was therefore unable to refer to it at the
time. The reply as placed in the hands
of the leader of the Government, is, I am
sorry to say, not pertinent, and is no
answer to the inquiry which I made. If

JUNE 13, 1922

I may be permitted to do su, I will read
the reply. It is:

SECOND READING

When available traffic would seer to warrant
expenditure estimated at $17,000. Revenue from
old wharf during four years prtceding 1917
amounted to $412.92.

An Act respecting the Edmonton, Dunvegan, and British Columbia Railway Company.-Hon. Mr. Griesbach.

It is difficult to see where any revenue of
$400 could have come from during those
four years. As a matter of fact the
wharf to which I refer was built by the
Government during the years 1910-1911,
and there were no means of communication with it, no rails laid to it, and no
highways, and consequently, su far ah that
wharf was concerned, never a dollar was earned by it. Why was it
built? It was built because the old
wharf was not safe for traffic. As a
result of its condition during those four
years referred to in this reply, there was
practically no wharfage available for Sackville and the adjoining towns. These being
the facts, it is only fair that we should
have a reasonable reply as to when the
Government proposes to restore shipping
facilities at that important point.
While I am referring to this matter, I
also want to call attention to the fact that
the evasion is put on the ground of
revenue. There is nothing tu that, as I
have explained; but as a matter of fact,
if that were tu be the basis of consideration, on the same ground you would stop
operating the Government ràilways and
the canal systems and almost all the public
works of Canada. There is at present a
considerable volume of business, both coastwise and with the West Indies, which is
greatly handicapped by lack of wharfage
at iSackville and which will furnish revenue
when facilities are available. Therefore
the answer which I have before me is not
an answer, and I ask for a reply to the
inquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I know
notlng personally of the matter which
my honourable friend has just mentioned,
but I will convey his remarks to the Department and will try to obtain a satisfactory
answer for my honourable friend.

HOLOPHANE GLASS COMPANY
PATENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill D4, an Act respecting a
certain Patent of the Holophane Glass Company.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend not going to favour the
House with an explanation?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The explanation
is this.
Under Section 44 of the Patent
Act the patentee applied for and secured a
license to be dispensed from the obligation
of manufacturing.
My honourable friend
is, I am sure, familiar with that section
44.
The patent on this covers the well
known Adjusto-Lite and lamp bracket,
which is adjustable and may be clamped
in position on a bed or bureau. The patentee was advised by his attorney that placing the patent under the license clause not
only relieved him of the liability to manufacture, but permitted him to import. The
applicant has endeavoured through the
Crown Electrical Manufacturing Company,
of Brantford, Ontario, tu commence manufacture in Canada, but owing tu the difficulty in making dies, all of the parts have
not been made in Canada, and a number
of parts have been ùimported, and it is desired while the manufacturing operations
are being completed in Canada, to import
certain of the parts which can not be conveniently made here
These grounds are
supported by an affidavit, which will be
laid before the Private Bills Committee and
will be, of course, the subject of discussion by the Committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
tu me, honourable gentlemen, that this Bill
involves a question of policy, whether a
general statute such as the Patents Act
may be suspended in connection with the
manufacture ofavery simple article. It seems
to me that the applicant would find it very
difficult to support the contention that an

324

SENATE

article so simple as a holder for an electrie
lamp cannot be satisfactorily manufactured
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This Bill. does
not refer to the holder only.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
But
my honourable friend referred to certain
parts of a lamp which in itself must be
a very simple device; and to say that those
parts cannot be manufactured in Canada,
where the most complicated machinery is
constructed most successfully, seems to me
t> be simply trifling with a very important
general Act, the policy of which is to
encourage manufacturing in Canada. We
should see to it at this particular time that
every impetus is given to manufacturing
within our own borders. In extending to
an applicant the right to monopolize a
patent within the boundaries of Canada we
sihould not permit him to go into the United
States to have the article manufactured.
We extend to him very important rights
and privileges by which he is permitted
to charge almost anything he may ask for
the device in question. Moreover, he asks
from the Parliament of Canada and is
granted the right to preclude anybody else
from invading the privilege which has thus
been accorded to him in regard to the manufacture of the particular article. I think
that in the interest of our own workingmen, in the interest of the development of our own industries, we should discourage the extension of a patent if the
application is based upon non-compliance
with the manufacturing clause.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: Honourable gentlemen, I have been a member of the Committee for a number of years, and I have
observed that the House bas always sent
such Bills as this to the Committee. Then
the Commissioner aippears before the Committee, and states whether or not the department has any objection to the granting
of the relief that is requested. The Bill
is then reported to the House, and if after
the Commissioner's explanation the House
feel justified in opposing it, they may do
so. I do not see why the reference of the
Bill to the Committee should be opposed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point to my honourable friend that there is
a question of policy involved in this. The
Bill is before us for second reading. Parliament is not consulting an official of the
Patent Office as to whether or not he has
any objection to the extension of so imHon.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

portant a right. It is a question whether
or not we are going to insist on the manufacture of patented articles within the
boundaries of Canada and prevent their
importation from a foreign country.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: Some years ago
this House laid it down as a principle that
evidence should be taken before the Committee and unless the person applying for
the patent could show the Committee good
cause for having allowed the patent to expire or having failed to start the manufacture, or anything of that kind, the House
would deny him the right to go on; but
if the applicant, under oath, did show
reasons why he should be allowed his
patent, no objection was taken to it, and
as a rule it was passed by this House.
That is the way such Bills as this were
dealt with.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: One of the first
things I did after my appointment to the
Private Bills Committee was to take exception to applications for extension of
patent. We churned this question for two
or three years. The honourable gentleman
who introduced this Bill is a member of
the Private Bills Committee, as I am. So
is my honourable friend from Victoria
(Hon. Mr. McHugh); and I must say that
he has always been very partial to the granting of extensions in regard to patents,
no matter how they lapsed. Of course
applicants always have good reasons, supported by affidavits. Whether those affidavits are correct or not I am not prepared
to say. However, after considering the
question for several years we laid down
a certain policy or rule, that those patents
might be extended by the Commissioner
of Patents. We left the question in the
hands of the Commissioner of Patents and
his technical experts, so as not to have it
referred to us at all, as we were not experts and could not examine into the merits
of the question one way or another. * Now
what do we find? That instead of going
direct to the Commissioner of Patents the
applicants come back to us just the same as
formerly, with various reasons for requesting extensions. They claim that this part
or that cannot be manufactured in Canada.
I do not think it is competent for this House
to adjudicate on the merits of such questions as this. That is why I took exception
to the Bill introduced by my honourable
friend from Lambton (Hon. Mr. Pardee);
and that is why I object now that this
Chamber is not the proper place in which
to determine what is right and what is
wrong in the present case. We are not

JUNE 13, 1922
experts: we are not technically competent
to judge whether this application should be
granted or whether it should not. As final
arbiters or adjudicators, we have the right
to say yes or no, but I do not think this
House should deal with such applications
at all except under special circumstances.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Honourable gentlemen, I notice that this patent was taken
out as long as ten years ago. If a patentee
cannot perfect his arrangements for manufacturingHon. Mr. MURPHY: Twelve years.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: -in eleven or twelve
years, I do not think this House, or the
Commissioner of Patents, or anybody else,
should further extend the time. If somebody else wants to manufacture that article
and can make it, he ought to be allowed
to do so. These people, I say, have had
all the time to which they are entitled.
Hon. Mr. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I have in the past taken a good deal of
interest in questions of the extension of
patents by special Act. I have always
opposed the extension of a patent unless
there was some very special reason for it.
In fact I think that for a number of years
it bas been the rule to refuse the application. The difficulty with a patent of this
kind, which has lapsed so many years, is
that some other corporation may have
started the manufacture of the article or
something like it. A Bill is introduced and
is rushed through the House: at all events
it goes through in a few days. It may
interfere with some person who has already
started the manufacture of the article that
is covered by the patent. The patent having lapsed for a number of years, he would
of course have a right to manufacture.
The applicants in this case are an American concern. When they took out patents
in their own country, they took out similar
patents here, which they have allowed to
lapse. The renewal of the patent would
probably prevent for some time the manufacture of the article in Canada by others
who would like to go in for the manufacture of it. The applicants have had all
the advantages to which they were entitled
under the patent when it was first granted
them, and it does strike me that it is
hardly fair to extend it now. However.
if this Bill does go to a Committee, I hope
the Committee will take every means possible to ascertain whether or not the article
in question has been or is being manufactured by.any other concern in Canada. and
whether or not the granting of this appli-

cation would interfere with any other corporation who may have means or machinery to manufacture the article. I
think it is very dangerous at present to
allow a Bill of this kind to pass.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to
ask the honourable gentleman if there is
in this Bill a blanket protective clause,
such as is usual in patent bills. In
granting the extension requested, would
anybody else who had started to manufacture be protected? I do not see such
a provision in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: That is one of the
matters that the Committee would examine into if the Bill went before the Committee. I do not think the honourable gentleman who bas just sat down has ever
known of a patent Bill passing this Housq
without a clause protecting any person
who during the lapse of the patent was
manufacturing the article mentioned.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: As my honourable
friend should know, such a protective
clause would have to be in the Bill befora
it could pass the Committee.
Hon Mr. BELCOURT:
Honourable
gentlemen, I am afraid this Bill is getting
more severe treatment than it really deserves. It is not quite correct to say that
this patentee bas wholly neglected his
duty. The statement which I-have before
me, and which, I understand, is verified
by affidavit, is to the effect that the anplicant endeavoured to get the Crown
Electrical Manufacturing Company, of
Brantford, Ontario, to manufacture this
article for him, but that this Company had
not all the parts and could not make all
the parts, required to complete the article.
and certain parts have been imported from
the United States for that purpose. There
is, I think, an evident intention on the part
of the patentee to comply in the future
with the requirements of the Canadian
Patent Act by manufacturing in Canada.
It is simply because he bas jeopardized
his patent by importing these small parts
to complete the article that he is now before Parliament asking that we renew his
rights, which have lapsed, and that his
patent may be continued. That is all there
is in this.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
extension will this give him?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It will give him
two years. It is not a case where, as
bas been intimated by the honourable gen-

SENATE

326

tleman who has just spoken, the applicant
has wilfully or wittingly allowed a patent
to lapse. On the contrary, he has done al]
he could. He has not succeeded in getting the article completely manufactured
in Canada because the people whom he
naturally expected to do this for him have
told him that they cannot.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: May I ask the honourable gentleman, what is the article when
it is completed?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is the Adjusto-Lite and lamp bracket, which is adjustable and may be clamped in position
on a bed or a bureau.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Can my honourable
friend tell us what parts cannot be manufactured in Canada?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is an adjustable light to put on a bracket?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: To
stand on a bureau.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: On a bed or a bureau? And in ten years he could not get
all the parts made in Canada?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This statement
is to the effect that he has applied to this
company, but the company has not been
able to do it for him.
Hon. Sir . JAMES LOUGHEED: Are
there not other companies?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be.
Let me deal with the objection. Surely,
honourable gentlemen, the House is prepared to listen to what explanation can be
given of this Bill. If the House is not
prepared and willing to listen to the explanation, I will simply drop it here and
now.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Go on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to answer
what was said by my honourable friend
He
from Tignish (Hon. Mr. Murphy).
says that the Commissioner of Patents can
deal with this application, and that there
is no occasion to come to Parliament with
it. My honourable friend is a doctor;
but he is not a lawyer. If he were,
he would not make that statement,
for the commissioner bas no right to do
anything of the kind. The only power
that can revive or extend this patent is
Parliament. I submit in all earnestness
that it cannot be proper for this House to
decide a question of fact without having
the facts before it. If you do, and if this
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Bill is not given a second reading, what
does that mean? It simply means that
any patent Bill-not merely this one, but
the Bill of which the second reading was
moved a moment ago by the honourable
gentleman from Lambton (Hon. Mr.
Pardee), and any other patent bill--cannot get a second reading in this House,
but will simply be thrown out the moment
it appears. If this Bill is not referred to
Committee, that is what is meant. I do
not think it is quite within the role or
function of the Senate to decide a question of this sort without knowing the
facts. If the Committee before whom
these facts are placed feel that there is
no merit in the application, surely it will
be time enough then for the House to reject this Bill. I submit that this House
ought not to decide this question merely
on a discussion such as we have had here
to-day, 'and without having any of the
facts before it. If we do, I am pointing
out what the inevitable result will be. If
this Bill is not allowed to go to the Committee, I for one am going to watch for
the next Patent Bill that comes into this
House and I am going to ask the House
to be consistent and not look at it at all,
but simply prevent the second reading.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend entirely misapprehends
the purport of the discussion which bas
taken place.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
I do.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
with all due deference to the view entertained by my honourable friend, I think
that he does. If the principle of a Bill is
to be discussed on the second reading, in
what way can we discuss this Bill except
to point out its weaknesses and infirmities,
or its lack of merit? It does not necessarily follow that because we criticise with
some hostility-if you choose to use that
term-a Bill of this character, the House
is unwilling to have it submitted to the
Committee. I had no intention, in making
the criticism which I have offered, of attempting to defeat the second reading.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, well thenHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But it
is very desirable that the sentiment of the
House should be known to the members of
the Committee, so that they may approach
the consideration of the Bill from the
proper standpoint. If a Bill of this kind
is to pass the House in silence, the Com-

JUNE 13, 1922
mittee may very well construe that as approval of the Bill. When .the Bill goes to
the Committee, the Committee will have
heard the criticisms that have been made
and will be able to consider it accordingly.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: If honourable gentlemen supporting the Bill had had as much
experience with patents, particularly American patents in Canada, as I have had, they
would feel very differently towards it. Take
our railway cars, for instance: there is
hardly a thing about them that is not
patented, and 90 or 95 per cent of the
patents are held by Americans, to whom
Canada has to pay out millions of dollars.
On some articles more is paid on the
patent than for the article itself. Take
for instance a refrigerator car. If you
put in a Bohn refrigerator system you pay
$17.50 for the apparatus, and $50 of a
royalty for the right to use it. Many of
these articles never should have been
patented. They were made before patents
were taken out; nevertheless the patentee
got patents and they are protected, and
they are milking this country for millions of
dollars. I am sure my company alone
has paid several millions of dollars to these
people on the other side of the line. Conditions have got so 'bad that 20 per cent
has been added to the cost of equipment in
some lines because of these patents, many
of which, as I have stated, ought never to
have been granted, and others of which
should have been voided long before this.
The Westinghouse people got ot patents
for their air brakes when I was a small
boy, and by one means or another they
have carried them on until to-day, so that
no one else can Make Ithat equipment
although those patents are fifty or sixty
years old. I say it is an outrage, and
entirely unfair to the people of this country
to saddle them with such a condition of
affairs. If anyone in Canada can make
these articles, I say let them do it without
paying any royalty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, notwithstanding the heat which my
otherwise usually amiable honourable
friend has displayed on this occasion, simply because some of us wanted information which we thought we had a right to
have, I may say that I am still requiring
information with regard to this matter.
I cannot understand why in ten years time
it would not be possible to get some person
in Canada with sufficient brains to devise
equipment to build a bracket to hold a
lamp, which, I understand from tCie remarks

327

of my honourable friend, the senior member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), is
the particular thing which is being manufactured.
The honourable gentleman accuses some
of us of being hostile because we want
information. I might with as good reason
accuse the honourable gentleman of being
unduly friendly towards this enterprise.
I never heard of this thing before. I am
objecting on general principles. We ought
to have (these things manufactured in
our own country, as the honourable gentleman from Amherst (Hon. Mr. Curry)
bas pointed out. That is the only reason
that I raise any question about the matter.
The Bill ought to go to Committee, I think.
and the question ought to be threshed out
there; and I hope I shall be present when
the report of the Committee comes in, be-cause I should like to see what evidence this
ingenious American can advance as to why
this article has not been manufactured in
Canada.
I am very
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
sorry that I have not been able to give
more information; I have given all the
information I have.
The motion was agreed to and the Bill
was read the second time.
SALARIES AND SENATE AND HOUSE
OF COMMONS BILL
PROPOSED AMENDMENT AND POINT OF
ORDER WITHDRAWN

On the Order:
House again in Committee of the Whole on
Bill 14, an Act to amend the Salaries Act and
the Senate and House of Commons Act.--Hon.
Mr. Dandurand.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: When we go into
Committee I intend to withdraw the amendment that I moved to this Bill, as I understand another amendment bas been prepared which will be somewhat different.
If the proposed
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
amendment is withdrawn, I do not know
whether it is necessary for me to withdraw the question of order. If it is necessary to withdraw it, in order to remove any
obstacle in the way of the Bill, I would
be very pleased to do so, with the concurrence of the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: As the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon.
Mr. Turriff) does not intend to proceed
with his amendment, it is not necessary to
give any decision on the point of order.

SENATE
CONSIDERED IN OOMMITTEE AND
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, -the
Senate again went into Committee on the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeLennan in the Chair.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Turriff was withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: In lieu of the
amendment of the honourable gentleman
from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) which
has been withdrawn, I beg to move the
following:
That section 33 of the said Act is hereby repeaIed and the following section enacted in lieu
thereof:
33. A member of the House of Commons shall
not be entitled to the sesslonal allowance If he
does not attend a sitting of the House on
at
least three quarters of the days on which such
House sits, and a sena.tor shall not be entitled
to such allowance if he does not attend a sitting
of the Senate on at least three-quarters of the
days upon whdch the Senate sits after the expiration of the first adjournment of the Senate
of not less than one week's duration; and in
ca.lculating the fifteen days mentioned in section 35, the period between the commencement
of the session and the expiration of such adJournment shall not, in the case of senators,
be taken into consideration. The allowance for
any less number of days of attendance of either
senators or members respectively shal be $25
for each day's attendance.

The effect of that amendment will be

that no deduction would be made from the
allowance to senators in respect of days

of absence for any of the times they happened to be away prior to the first adjournment. It is unnecessary to tell the
members of this House, but possibly for
the benefit of members of the other House
it is advisable to place on Hansard the
fact that owing to the difference in the
duties and functions of the two Houses it
is the practice of the Senate to meet, pass
the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, and organize the Committees,
and then to adjourn for a period of two or
three weeks.
The reason for this is
obvious. It is not an exaggeration to say
that at least one-half of the time of each
session is taken up in the House of Commons in the Debate on the Address,
the debate on the Budget, and the
discussion of the Estimates.
In this
House both the debate on the Address
and the debate on the Budget are disposed of in a very short time-and the
Estimates do not concern us. That is the
explanation of the longer adjournments
that take place in the Senate.
I find that during the past ten or eleven
Sessions the first Session of the Senate,
Hon.

Mr. TANNER.

prior to the first adjournment, lasted about
six days. This means that Senators coming from a long distance have to travel ten
to twelve days, depending on the state
of the weather, and whether they get
through on time or not, in order to attend
to put through business that is a more or
less unimportant part of our public duties.
The remainder of the amendment provides that in calculating the fifteen days
absence which is allowed without any deduction being made the time that any
senator is absent prior to the first adjournment shall not be included. I should like
to point out that in discussing this matter
both with members of this House and members of the other House, I have found that
many of them are under the impression
that no matter what the length of the Session may be they are entitled to absent
themselves for 15 days without any deduction being made. That is an error.
They must put in an appearance at at least
three quarters of the actual sitting days
of the House to which they belong, and if
one-quarter of those do not amount to fifty
days, they are not entitled to the fifteen
days. Running over the duration of the
sessions for a period beginning in 1909
and ending in 1920, I find that the average
number of sittings in the Senate is fiftyseven. Taking that as a basis no senator
would be entitled to more than thirteen
days absence in any event. In the House
of Commons the average number of sitting days is ninety-one, so that members
of that House would not only be entitled
to the fifteen days, but if they chose to
incur the penalty, would be entitled
to another seven days, or twenty-two in
al], without incurring a forfeiture of the
indemnity and the risk of being put on
a per diem allowance.
Let us take what I admit to be an
unusual and extreme case, but one which
very well exemplifies the difficulties under
which Senators from the far distant provinces labour, under the present Act. Take
the ,Session of 1917. That Session conrmenced on the 18th of January and ended
on the 20th of September, having lasted
246 days in all. The number of sittings
of the Senate was 75, the number of sittings of the House of Commons 135. The
Senate met on the 18th of January and
adjourned on the 26th of January until the
5th of February, ai- on the 7th of that
nonth, after three days' sitting adjourned
until the 24th of April for two months.
We came back on the 24th of April, and
two days later adjourned until the 16th of

Columbia to have corne down to these sittings, to have gone home during the adjournment and corne back again, hie would
have had to put in twenty-five days on the
train to attend thirteen sittings of the
Senate. As I have said, I admit this is
a somewhat extreme exarnple, but it shows
what is the effeet of this Act if strictly
construed.
I feel satisfied that honourable members
of this Chamber wîll realize that we .who
corne from far-away parts of the country
are not seeking to impose upon the House
or trying to get something that we do not
earn, but that we wish to be placed in
such a position that we may performi our
duties here consistently with our natural
desire to spend a certain proportion of our
time at home if possible and to look after
our private interests. Therefore, in moving
this amendment, I have full confidence that
it will meet with the acceptance of the
House.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would like to
ask the honourable gentleman if hie has
taken into consideration this effect of a
member not being here on a day of adjournment, namely, that the days during
which the Senate is not sitting count
against him? If a man happens to fali
sick at home, and his home is a thousand
miles from Ottawa, or, as in my case, or
xny honourable friend's, is stili farther, hie
would not be made any allowance. Even
if hie were i11 with typhoid fever, the whole
period would be counted against him. I
think that if you are going to touch the
Act at ail it should be made right, and
these anomalies which are palpable should
be wiped out. If you have to go home to
bury your child and are not here on a day
of adjournment, and cannot get back
for a fortnight, the whole fortnight counts
against you. I think the matter should be
referred to a Committee so that. it may
be taken into careful consideration.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I have been very
greatly interested in the "remarks of the
honourable member for Victoria (Hon. Mr.
Barnard). If I were conducting a campaign throughout this country for the
abolition of the Senate, I should have bis
speech printed and circulated and put in
the hands of every taxpayer in Canada.
I think it would make interesting reading.
It seems to me that if the statement-

I would call it the indictment-which he
has presented against this body is true,
it is a very strong argument against our
being here at ail. If we have had so many
adjournmeats, if so, much time has been
wasted, it seexns to me it is an argument
against the existence of the -Senate. I was
astounded. Then, not content with the hon-.
ourable gentleman's statement, my honourable friend from Tignish (Hon. Mr. Murphy)
rises and asks that ail the days during
which a member is sick should be stricken
from the record of absence; also that the

fore the Committee previously.
I was interested in it then because I felt that the
rights and privileges of this House were
attacked, and there is no honourable member, no matter how long he has been in
this Chamber, who is more jealous of its
rights than I am.
Although I was somewhat vehement in my support of the rights
of this House to legislate as was proposed
by this amendment, I stated that I was not
in favour of the amendmient and that I
1eserved by right to vote as I saw fit when
the question came to be decided.
I stated
then, also, my sympathy with members from
distant parts of the country who have to
remain here during long adjournments. If
this amendment applied to only one adjournment, I should not oppose itHon. Mr. BARNARD: It does.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: -because even the
House of Commons, even that busy department of the legislature. is not very busy
during the first week or ten days of the
Session.
When I was a member of the
House of Commons, being a somewhat busy
man at home, I used to remain away until
after the first ten days or so had passed,
because, as everybody knows, very little of
importance would be done during that time.
So I wouild not object to this amendment
if it stopped at the first adjournment.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: It does stop there.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But otherwise I
think the present Act is a splendid thing.
because it brings members here. The House
is always filled with members attending
to the legislation, particularly in the last
two or three weeks of the Session. As to
the clause with regard to the last two or
three weeks, the only fault I have to find
with it is that the penalty for non-attendance during that period is not large enough.
I think it ought to be at least $100 a day.
All the governments I have seen during
the time I have been a member of either
House have been alike in this respect, that
they have delayed their legislation until
the last weeks of the Session. It bas always
been so, whether the Government bas been
Grit or Tory, and I fancy it would be so
if ever the friends of the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff),
the Progressives, got into power. They
would do the same thing, for an evil trick
is quickly learned. Therefore it is most
essential that members of the House of
Commons and members of the Senate
should be here during the last weeks of the
Session, and I do not want to see the clause
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

regarding attendance at that time altered
in any way except to increase the penalty
for absence by makin it $100 a day instead
of $25 a day as at present.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Is it the
pleasure of the Committee to adopt the
amendment?
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Barnard was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, this amendment has passed the
Committee. I should have liked to compare it with clause 33, which it supersedes.
However, it will appear in our minutes and
will come up for review on the third reading. I understand the amendment to mean
simply that absence during the first days
of the sitting of the Senate, between the
opening of Parliament and the first adjournment after the Address is adopted,
will not be computed in the three-quarters
of the sittings which Senators must attend
in order to be entitled to their full indemnity. I am inclined to think that that
would be fair treatment as applied to this
Chamber. My only fear is that the House
of Commons will not understand how it is
that rules that have been made for the government of both Chambers, and that have
always been applied uniformly to both,
are being departed from in this case. They
may find it difficult to reconcile themselves
to the different treatment being accorded
this Chamber.
If they understood
thoroughly our situation as explained by
the honourable gentleman from Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Barnard), I think they would
perhaps be satisfied with this different
treatment.
Hon. Mr. BOLDUC: Honourable gentlemen, I have great doubt that this amendment is in order, and so that we may have
time to study the question, I move that
the Committee rise and report progress
and ask leave to sit again.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
with much hesitation that I disagree with
the motion made by my honourable friend.
Opportunity will be given to the members
of the Senate to study the amendment before the third reading takes place. As
my honourable friend the leader of the
House has pointed out, it must necessarily
come up again on the third reading of the
amended Bill, and we shall be able to give
the amendment full consideration between
now and then. The amendment must necessarily be passed by the Committee of the
Whole if it is to come up at the third
reading. While it may be irregular to dis-

to the main idea contained in this Bill. 1

bas told -these people that their license is
faulty.
Now, what happens? We have this Bill
before us-for what purpose? It is to
cancel not only tb.at but other licenses.
Let me ask honourable gentlemen wbat the
effect of that is going to be. Is there any
bonourable gentleman here who clearly
understands wbo are going to be bit by this
Bill and whetber or not tbey sbould be bit?
The matter is left entirely to administration. I tbink before we go any further
that we, as a body of review, sbould have
the officiais of the Department of Justice
before us and sbould find out from. tbem
wbat licenses they want to cancel, and why.
I bave no interest in this matter in any
way; but I say that this body should go
very slowly before handing over to the Interior Department a power which sbould
not be exercised un]ess there is mighty good
reason for it. I tbink a good dea] of the
time of tbe House could be -saved if this
matter were reforred to a special committee, 50 that we might bave an
opportunity of examining the chief officiais of tbe Department who are conversant witb the situation. Otberwise I
feel that I amn not; in a' posiýtion to know
wbat I arn doing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will answer
the questions that the honourablo gentleman may deem proper to put, so far as I
amn able, and, if my answers are not satisfactory or my information is not sufficient, I will move tbe adjournment of the
consideration of tbe Bill until to-morrow,
when I shah bhave bore the Deputy Minister

this body moving very slowly in deciding
what shoul-d be done with this measure.
There has been a great dea] of talk in
Government circles and generally in the
city of Ottawa with reference to what is
commonly called the iloppe coal mine. I
have no objection to the statements made by
tle honourable gentleman from Compton ir

cal] attention to one point. Assume for the
time being that those people got their
license properly. We believe that that
license has been cancelled. The samne tbing

that a condition bas arisen wbich must be

They take tbe

as I understand, a letter bas passed from.

Department that tbis lease is vaiid. If
that is the case, I tbink that before passîng a iaw canceiling a lease wbicb is te

tbe decision of our own Justice Department, we sbould at ieast give tbese people
an epportunity te be beard, in order that
we may iearn tbeir side of tbe case. Wbat
other leases are there, or wbat other
properties bave been leased or granted by
the Crown that are in a position similar te
tbe Hoppe case? I do net know, and I
say again tbat there is flot an henourabie
gentleman in this House wbo dees know.

We sbouid at least bave an eppertunîty te

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I bave been
informed by the Department that a dlaim
migbt be raised in this Chamber in faveur
of the Huppe lessees-or rather in faveur
of Isenberg; for I tbink it is in the name
of Isenberg that tbe lease stood; but tbe
name of ne other ciaimant bas reacbed me,
eitber from the Department or from eutside, and 1 bave ail the proceedings in the
Hoppe case, wbicb 1 wiil put before this
Chamber if desired. Most of tbe members
are familiar with tbe details of tbat case.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I de net knew anything about it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shah bhave
occasion te inferm my honourabie friend.
However, that is the only case that bas been

JUNE 13, 1922
mentioned by the Interior Department since
this Bill was introduced. If they had
had before them any other case they would
have intimated it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me that there can be no objection to the
general principle of this Bill. It is introduced for the purpose of curing a defect in
notices which have apparently been served
by the Department of the Interior in accordance with a practice that has obtained
since 1904.
When default either in the
payment of rent or in other conditions of
the lease has arisen, instead of serving a
notice that the claim would be cancelled,
the Department apparently served a notice
that the claim had been cancelled, and the
Privy Council has held that the Department should send a notice of intended cancellation and not a notice of cancellation.
Now, there happen to be in the Department no less than approximately
twenty thousand cases to which this practice has been applicable; that is to say,
there are twenty thousand cancellations
which are subject to being set aside if the
law touching those particuilar cases is invoked; and in those twenty thousand cases,
I need not point out to 'honourable gentlemen, there have been many mines in which
hundreds of thousands, in fact millions of
dollars, have been invested, and the investment would be placed in jeopardy if
curative legislation, or legislation reguilarizing the notice, were not passed.
I doubt
very much if any objection at all would be
made to this legislation if it were not for
what is known as the Hoppe lease.
I happen to know something about the
Hoppe lease, because for some time I was
Minister of the Interior. A short history
of it is this. In 1912 the Department of the
Interior apparently leased approximately
19,000 acres of coal lands, at an annual
rental of say $19,000, to representatives
of one Hoppe.
Those leases were
afterwards
transferred
to
Isenberg.
During the war in 1918 confidential information was received by the Government
that these men were not only alien enemies
but were inciting by speech propaganda
against the Empire to which we belong.
During the war, in 1918, confidential inthe rent, and the Department, upon receiving confidential information from the
Dominion police and the other authorities
in charge of maintaining order in Canada,
cancelled the lease. They were clearly in
default. No question has arisen as to the
default in regard to the non-payment of
rent. Some time subsequent to the can-

335

cellation of that lease the representatives
of Isenberg, in whose name the lease
that the notice
out
stood, pointed
which had been served by the Government upon his representatives was
irregular. The basis of the claim was
that the notice was not served upon him
personally, but upon the Hawaiian Trust
Company, which represented his estate,
and upon his solicitors in Ottawa. There
was nobody else to serve. This man was
engaged in promoting disloyalty against
the Government of Canada in the United
States, and likewise his associate, Hoppe,
who, I understand, is an ex-officer of the
Honourable gentlemen
Prussian Army.
who desire to get any particular information upon the status of those two men can
obtain it from the proper authorities.
This lease was cancelled in 1918. Since
that time these people have been making
extraordinary efforts to bring pressure to
bear upon the Government, and, so far as
members of Parliament are concerned, I
may say that very questionable methods
have been employed to have the lease renewed. But the Government of Canada has
absolutely refused to renew the lease. During my time as Minister of the Interior I
pointed out to the representatives of Isenberg that the Exchequer Court was there
for the purpose of enabling them to assert
their claim, if they had any claim, and I
further intimated that I had no doubt that
the Department of Justice would issue a
fiat to permit of their claim being deait
with by the Exchequer Court. I was told
by the representatives of Isenberg that
they had no intention of going to the Exchequer Court; in fact, they absolutely refused to do so. This continued from 1918
to the present time, and, so far as I am
aware, tley have not yet made application
for a fiat with a view of establishing their
claim before that court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the honourable gentleman should not forget to
mention the fact that these mining properties were withdrawn by Order in
Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: When
the lease was cancelled of course the property was withdrawn, and is now vested
in the Crown.
Hon. Mr. WATSON': A special Committee of this House made the recommendation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen will find the recommendation made in 1919 in the report of
the special Committee appointed to inves-

tigate the cancellation of leases to certain
coal areas in the province of Alberta
standing in the namne of Paul R. Isenberg,
together with the evidence received by the
Conimittee. This report is obtainable by
any honourable gentleman upon his asking
for it.
This was a very valuable coal property.
This canceliation took place under the
extraordinary circumstances that I have
mentioned-the more than justifiable circumstances-with which we are familiar,
and the evidence of which appeared before
the Committee of which my honourable
friend fromn Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbury)
was Chairman. My recollection is that
the evidence that came before the Comnmîttee was incontrovertable, not only as to
the default in the payment of rent, but as
to the other reasons which led to concellation.
The question now resolves itself into
one of whether or not the Parliament of
Canada is going to give consideration to
people of that kind. I do not know that
the Parliament of Canada is going to assist allen enernies to recover this land. 1
arn unaware that the Parliament of Canada is called upon, because of a technical
defect, to cure that technical defeet
by putting into the hands of alien enemies
who were actively engaged in making
war against th.is Dominion this very valuable property for which they failed to pay
rent and concerning which they made man]fest default. It seems to me that this is
therefore not a inatter in which an appeal
should or could be successfully made to
the Parliament of Canada to give effect
to these technical distinctions and refinements of law which have been laid down
by the Privy Council touching the form
of notice. If there had been any substantial injury done these people, I would
say: overlook those irregularities and give
themn what they are entitled to. But that
is flot the case, honourable gentlemen, and
I think the Parliament of Canada would
fail to, do its duty, would fail to strike
that note of patriotism which should be
struck in connection with the utilization
of rour natural resources, if they for one
moment gave serious consideration to the
task of revivifying the dlaims of these
people.
It seems to me that this property is one
which peculiarly should be reserved for the
benefit of the people of Canada. Before
leaving the Department of the Interior 1
took occasion to attach to the file the vîews
which I held concerning this particular

property, namely, that inasmuch as by
Order in Council the leases were cancelled
and other leases of subsequent licensees
were cancelled, the property should be retained for the people of Canada. I believe that in the years to corne it will be one
of the most valuable assets we could have.
We have a National system of railways,
and there is no reason why this property
should not be handed over and developed
by that National system of railways to
furnish it with coal for its transportation through the mountains.
The
property at present is some 70 or 80 miles
from the railway; it is probably 1,000 miles
fromn a market; so no manifest injustice
is being done to these people. My contention is that, if we really analyze the situation, we shaîl see that we are saving
these people a substantial amount of
money, because it is idie to think a property of thîs kind 70 or 80 miles from a
railway and 1,000 miles from a market
can be placed upon a substantial basis and
made to pay.
This property should remain vested in the Crown, and the Parliament of Canada should absdlutely refuse
to assist in any way whatsoever the interest in this dlaim of these alien enemies.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: May 1 ask the leader
of the Government whether subsequent to
this judgment any notice was served on
th.e lessees cancelling the leasti? The
judgment as I understand it declared that
the former notice of cancellation was invalid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It does not
affect this case.
It does affect the case
of Paulson vs. the King.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If it is madF
to appear fairly to a Committee of this
Huse or to the House that there is a case
which is entirely similar to the Paulson
case would it be the intention to have
this Act apply to it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is where
a lessee would take advantage of a defect
in the form?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A case on aIl
fours with the Paulson case. Would it be
just to deal with that case differently?
Would not it be worthy of exception from
the Act in the same way as the Paulson
case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 draw attention to the fact that the Paulson case was
not decided on the defect in the formi of
cancellation and service of notice only.

JUNE 13, 1922
There was a question of forfeiture owing
to non-conipliance with sorne of the conditions, and it was claimed that there had
been an abandonment by the Department
of the Interior of the right to foreclose for
'non-fulfilment of certain conditions. The
judgment of the Privy Council mentioned
the fact that the form of cancellation and
the service of notice were defective. The
purpose of this Bill is purely and sirnply
to cure this technical defect.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
If there are
cases which cannot be dîstinguished froni
the Paulson case-my honourable friend is
a lawyer and knows what that meansdoes he say that it would be fair and just
to apply to theni a different rule to the one
applied in the Paulson case? If they canflot be distinguished in principle froni that
case should they flot be treated in the sanie
way?
Hon. Mr. LYNCU-STAUNTON:
1 do
flot see why it is necessary that they should
be distinguished. If the Department gave
a 'notice saying that a contract was cancelled, I should have thought, with great
deference to the Privy Council, that any
court would have understood that the word
"hereby" was meant to be understood in
the notice. If the notice had said " is hereby cancelled" the Privy Council would have
had no objection to it. There is no question
-of justice or injustice at ail. Here is a
notice given years ago, and every person
has taken it as being intended to cancel
the contract, and has acted upon that cancellation. How a mnan who had stood by
and seen this property re-leased and had
notice of the new lessee spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, could say
that his case is on ail fours with the case
in the Privy Council and that he is being
unjustly treated passes my comprehension.
This is a very serious matter to the Dominion of Canada. It is a very serious inatter
to all those who have taken these leases.
In my judgment the man would be dishonest, and would be perpetrating an injustice on both the Government and the
new lessees, who asserts his rights after
having had this notice years ago and after
having seen the Government act on that
notice. He couid not in a court of justice
dlaim that he was being injuriously
affected, because, if mot in the eyes of the
Privy Council, certainly in the eyes of the
world, he had abandoned his rights by not
asserting theni.
The only question that troubles me is
whether this is intra vires of the court of
S-22

337

this Parliament. If it is, I think it should
be passed without hesitation.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I amn altogether
in accord with the object of the Bill, but
my trouble is the sanie as that of the honourable gentleman froni Hamilton <Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton). I doubt very much
whether this Bill is constitutional, or
whether this Parliament has the right to
pass this legislation. The Government no
doubt bas the right to deal wîth its own
property, and to stipulate, wbether in a
deed of sale or in a deed of lease, that
the Government reserves the right to put
an end to that sale or lease if certain conditions stated in the deed of sale or lease
are not comphied with. But the Government, I believe, as well as the individual,
is bound by the law of the province in
which the property is situated, and therefore I fail to see how this Parliament has
power to corne to the relief of the Government and to grant it a right which does not
arise froni the contract which it has made.
I think, on the other band, that the Government has a remedy in its own bands,
whether the property. has been leased to
another lessee or not. If the, conditions of
the lease have not; been complied with it
is open to the Government to give the
notice contemplated by the Privy Council;
and I tbink if that precaution were taken
it would cover the defects in any of these
cases. I arn in sympathy with the object
of the Bill and have no intention of opposing it. I rnerely think it my duty to
caution the Government and to ask whether
it will attain its object if it relies only on
the Bill when passed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wben I
was on my feet I omitted to point out that
the Bill makes provision to protect ahl legal
proceedings taken on or before the lst of
May, which, I understand, is the date
when the Bill was introduced.
Consequently, if the Isenberg representatives
had taken proceedings in the Excbequer
Court before the lst of May, they would
have come within the clause and would
have been able to conduct their proceedings
irrespective of this legislation. Their lease
was cancelled in 1918, and surely it cannot
be contended that they had not sufficient
time between 1918 and the lst of May,
1922, to initiate proceedings in the Ex-.
chequer Court for the purpose of making
good the contention that tbe notice was
irregular.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The objection as

Canada would be a very serious one if the
question to be decided concerned sales, because the Government of Canada would
then have divested itself of its right to the
property. Somebody else would be the
proprietor, and that somebody else would
surely be under the jurisdiction of the
province wherein the land lies.
But I understand that that is not the
case. The question refers to leases. The
property is still in the hands of the Dominion Government, and the Dominion Government has not abandoned the right
which it had to deal with these leases. It
seems to me that there is another very
serious question.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Let us deal with a
lease which the Government grants to the
honourable gentleman of property situated
in the city of Ottawa. Do I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that as
regards the condition of that lease the
Government will not be bound by the law
of the province? If the province, for instance, says that a lease cannot be cancelled without thirty days notice, would not
the Government be bound by that?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not prepared to say that by the granting of the
lease rights would not be, as it were,
created. which would fall under the jurisdiction of the province. I think it would
be going rather far to state that. But
even if there were that danger, there is in
my opinion a greater danger confronting
us. It is this. Leaving aside altogether
the exceptional case of Hoppe or Isenberg,
and considering the bulk of these leases,
in what position is the Dominion of Canada? The Dominion of Canada bas cancelled 20,000 leases, but, according to the
Privy Council, the cancellation is not valid,
and that is the situation you desire to
remedy. But what bas the Government
of Canada done in the name of the country? It has re-leased these 20,000 properties to other persons. If you do not remedy
the situation, if you take away all these
properties from the new lessees are you
going to indemnify them? Surely they
have a recourse against the Dominion if the
Dominion leases property it bas no right
to dispose of, because of leases having been
granted to others and not having been
legally cancelled. Therefore there would

all a trifling one, and the question of
equity does not arise. These people surely
expected their leases to be cancelled, and
had no right to have them continued.
And they
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
accepted the cancellations.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: They received
notice, which was unfortunately a little defective in its drafting, and they abandoned
their property, allowing it to pass into
the hands of others. Now, after all that is
done, they would take the property away
from the rightful owners or lessees, who
in turn would go to the Dominion of Canada and ask for an indemnity, to which
they would surely be entitled.
HonourThe Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
able Mr. Dandurand moves that at page 1,
in line 5, after the word "granted" there
be added, "before the date of the passing
of this Act."
The amendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: And at page
1 in line 19:
Leave out from "authority" to "such" in line
30 and insert "if, at any time after the default
occurred and the power of cancellation became
exercisable, any written or printed notice was
heretofore given before the date of the passing
of this Act by or on behalf of and with the
authority of the Minister to the lessee, licensce
or grantee, or to his assignee, agent, executor,
administrator or representative, whereby it was
in terms or in effect stated that for or in
authority of the Minister to the lessee, licensee
permit or other authority was cancelled or had
been cancelled, or would be cancelled, or whereby an intention df the Minister was expressed
or implied to treat the said lease, license, permit or other authority as no longer subsisting."

The amendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: And at page
2 in line 2 leave out from "notice" to "(2)"
in line 9.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: At page 2,

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Honourable
Mr. Pope moves that there be added as
clause 3 the following:

and in the amendments thereof, coal mining
rights and lands containing coal, if such rights
or lands are within or adjoin the coal reservations near the jonction of the Muskeg and
Smoky Rivers in the province of Alberta,
which reservation was established by an order
in couctil (P.C. 2044) dated the sixth day of
October 1919, withdrawing from disposal under

accordance with the provisions of any act of
the F'arHiament of Canada hereafter passed and
specifLcally relating to such rights or lands and
to the sale, lease or other disposition thereof.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to submit to the Department of the Interior
the amendment proposed. Perhaps we could
adopt it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Adopt
it, and then you can move back to it on the
third reading if you so desire.
Hon. Mr. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
the purpose of the amendment that has just
been moved is, I understand, to protect the
anthracite coal regions in Alberta.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; it
simply deals with the Hoppe claim.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is, the
mining lands which were covered by the
Hoppe lease.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
which are now vested in the Crown.
Hon. Mr. REID: What I had in mind
was this. Would it not be good policy to
enlarge that amendment so as to have it
cover any anthracite coal mines that are
owned by the Government and have not
been alienated, and that may be found in
any province of the Dominion; that is, to
provide that they should not be alienated
without a special Act of Parliament? Anthracite coal is of great importance to
Canada. I merely make the suggestion that,
as that amendment is to be considered in a
day or so, honourable gentlemen might consider also the advisability of enlarging it to
cover any other anthracite coal mining
deposits that might be found in any province of the Dominion.

This Act shall not affect any right under any
judgment rendered before the date of the passing of this Act, or under any action, suit or

That will be a new section, either 3 or
4. If we pass the amendment proposed by
the honourable gentleman from Bedford

CAPE TORMENTINE WHARF ACCOMMODATION
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

On the notice of inquiry:
By Hon. Mr. Black:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
tG the desirability of the restorat:cn of proper
wharfage and loading facilities at Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, and inquire whether
it is the intention of the Governn ent to restore
shipping and export facilities aý Cape Tormentine, N.B., and when.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I ask the question
standing in my name.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that 13 steamships and two schooners
loaded lumber for foreign ports at Tormentine in the summers of 1912 and 1913.
On September 24th, 1913, an Order in
Council was passed closing the pier to
shipping, and the basin was used in connection with the construction of the car

JUNE 14, 1922
ferry terminais. During the progress of
the work this Order in Council was renewed from year to year, but lapsed with
the completion of the terminais, since
which time the basin has been used by
small schooners as a harbour of refuge,
and for the last two seasons by the Portland Packing Company for unloading
herring- from schooners into gasoline
launches for their smoke houses near by.
The management state that the wharfage facilities are practically the same
as before the construction of the ferry
terminails; with this difference, that whereas before the construction of the ferry
terminais there was about 16 feet of water
along the south face of the original wharf
west of the pier there is now oniy about
13 feet. Some filling was done adjacent to
the south track of the original wharf, on
which the track was located, but a new
spur was built on. the new fil1, 'which cari
be used if necessary for the transfer of
materials from cars to vessels. This track
's at present used for the switching of cars
handled to and from the ferry.
The General
Superintend'ent informs
Mr. Hanna that he bas flot; heard of any
request recently for lumber shipping
facilities at Tormentine. As far as the
physical lay-out is concerned, there does
not appear to be anytbing to prevent
shipping being carried on as formerly,
with the exception of the deptb of water
mentioned above.
The question of increasing the depth of
water at the pier to sixteen feet as
formerly is one for the Department of
Public Works.
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. B. BLA'CK: Honourable gentlemen, 1 wish to make a remark with regard
to the reply that has been given to my
question on the Order Paper for to-day.
It is not an answer to the question which
I asked. It informs myself and others
interested that the harbour has been fllled
up. This we knew. It states also that the
wharfage facilities have been used by.
smail schooners as a harbour of refuge.
0f both these facts we were quite wellk
aware. As a matter of f act I consider that
that answer was prepared by the Railway
Department. 1 know that the Railway
Department made inquiries and ascertained
that there are sixteen or twenty million
feet of lumber lying alongside that port
now, awaiting export. The fact that
wherea s formerly there was a depth of
twenty-four feet of water alongside the

pier and there is now only thirteen feet
gives a clear answer as to why that cannot
be exported. A steamship of reasonable
draught cannot lie at that pier. Furthermore, I can say this, that an expenditure
of from $6,000 to $10,000 for dredging
will make an extra bertb for one or more
steamers. I consider the reply an evasion,
and not an answer to the question which
I asked.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may state
to the honourable gentleman that bis
question was referred to the Railway
Department, which gave the explanation
which I have read to the House. I find in
that answer a reference to the Public
Works Department in the case of dredging
being needed or decided upon. So if my
honourable friend will leave the questionî
on the Order Paper, I will now send it to
the Public Works Department with the
remarks of my honourable friend.
Notice of inquiry stands.

DIVORCE BILL
THIRD READING

Bill C4, an Act for the relief of Frederick
McClelland Aiken.-Hon. Mr. Blain.
SCHWEYER PATENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. PARDEE moved the second
reading of Bill B4, an Act respecting a
patent of Daniel Herbert Schweyer.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in accordance witb the request of yesterday that
this Bill be explained to the House prior to
the passing of the second reading, I desire
rnerely ta say this. By section 8 of the
Patent Act, chapter 69 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, it is provided:
Any inventor who elects to obta in a patent
for his Invention In a foreigri country before ob-

SENATE

342

taining a patent for the same invention in
Canada, may obtain a patent in Crnada, if the
patent is applied for whithin one year from the
date of the issue of the flrst foreign patent for
such invention.

This patent was applied for in the United
States and was granted. Apparently the
applicant, Schweyer, then took legal advice
in Washington. He was advised there-so
my instructions are-that if the applicant
made application prior to June 4th, 1922, in
Canada, the patent would be considered,
and would be granted as a matter of course
if there were no objections. He made such
application, but found that it was beyond
the time in which section 8 provides such
application should be made. What he asks
now is that, having been misinformed, and
through a misapprehension not having
made that application, he be permitted to
come in and make it, provided he 'does so
within two months of the passing of this
Bill. It is not a request for an extension.
The relief is asked for purely on the ground
that there has been a misapprehension on
Schweyer's part. I may add that my instructions are that he proposes to commence
the manufacture of the article in Canada
providing the patent is granted to him.
Moreover I would point out that under section 2 of the Bill any person having obtained any previous right in Canada under
this patent, by reason of Schweyer's failure
to make application, is hereby protected.
I would ask that this Bill be sent to Committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend be good enough to
inform the House how it has come about
that twelve months have elapsed before
Schweyer secured advice upon the subject?
It seems to me that this is a pretty long
delay.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: That is quite so.
I may inform the honourable gentleman
that my instructions are that in May, 1921,
the applicant filed the necesary papers.
That was within the prescribed time. But
he was misinformed by an attorney in Washington, who stated that under the War
Measures Act the applicant would have
until June the 4th, 1922, in which to file his
I suppose he thought that
application.
under the War Measures Act there was
some sort of moratorium or something of
that kind in regard to such matters as this.
These are the instructions I have as to the
reason why the application has been delayed for a period of practically twelve
months.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does my
honourable friend know what the particular
invention is?
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: It is a train-controlling device. More than that I cannot
inform the honourable gentleman.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
would like to ask my honourable friend if
any of his instructions, or any of the information on which he has acted, has been
received from the Patent Office here in
Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: None.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then it does seem to me that, before undertaking to enact a law to cure a defect, we
should know the attitude of the Department
upon the matter.
These are instructions
from the interested individual, who wants
to get his patent put into shape whereas
now it is entirely out of shape. There is a
general law, and I am very much opposed
to the passing of special legfislation to break
a general law. I do not think we ought in
any case to pass such a Bill into law without knowing the attitude of the Department
upon it. I do not know whether this Bill
goes to the Committee or not. Anyway,
the motion is for the second reading, and if
we pass the second reading we affirm the
principle of the Bill. If it is to go to a
Committee it may be possible to get the
desired information, but I am very jealous
about either this House or the other undertaking by special enactment to cure defects
in application for patents.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: In reply to the right
honourable gentleman, I would say that, as
I take it, we are not establishing any precedent whatever in passing this Bill. All
we are asking for is that thi Bill go to the
Private Bills Committee; that the officers of
the Department be called to appear before
that Committee; that such proofs as the
applicant has be submitted to the Committee; that the Committee report back to this
House. If then there does not appear to
be sufficient reason for it, the Bill should
not be allowed to pass. As I understand,
if 'a Bill is referred to a Committee, the
reference is made purely and solely for the
purpose of examining the very point that
my honourable friend raises. For that reason I ask that the Bill go to the Committee,
that its merits be there thoroughly considered, and that the House act on it accordingly.

DISCUSSION CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from May 16 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Casgrain:
That an order of the Senate to Issue for a
copy of ai reports and correspoxuience In relation to the iSt. Lawrence ShLp Canal.

Hor.. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, to my mind, with
the exception of the war, there has not
been a more important question before the
Parliament of -Canada since Confederation
than the question involved in the St.
Lawrence waterways and Parliament owes
a great debt to the honourable member
for Delanaudière (Hon. Mr. -Casgrain) for
the lucid and full explanation he bas given
to us of his views regarding the matter.
True, we have before us for our perusal
the report of the International Joint Commission; but I imagine that, like other
reports, it bas been received and pigeonholed by nearly every person in Canada,
and I believe it is only by such discussions
as this that it can be brought to the
attention of the people of this country. 1
must say that, although I had the report
on my desk for some time, and have read
it to a certain extent, I neyer had a
curiosityr to try to sound its depths or
understand its arguments until I listened
with astonishment to the arguments
addressed to us in the discussion of this
motion.
It goes, I think, without saying, that if
this body is of any use to this country-and
I consider it of great use-it should caref ully consider these great questions and
make up its mind upon the evidence produced, and upon the information which is
obtainable whether or not a great commercial proposition such as this--for it is a
commercial and not a flag-waving proposition-is worthy of consideration and

SENATE
adoption by this country as a national work.
Unless there is a demand for it which will
outweigh the expense, and unless as a commercial proposition it will not put an intense burden upon the people of this country, we should not adopt it. We should be
satisfied that it is not only practicable, but
economically sound. I have always noticed
that in dealing with other people's money
most men are very generous, very reckless;
and I think it is not extravagance to say,
in looking over the history of transportation in Canada, only excepting the Canadian Pacific Railway, that in every case we
have embarked upon the development of
transportation without any thought of the
cost or without any appreciation of the responsibility that the country was undertaking. One has only to consider the vast
amount of money which was spent in aid of
the Canadian Northern Railway, money
which came out of the pockets of the people
of Canada, to parallel a national system
from at least Montreal -to the Pacific, to
realize it. At the same time we were building the Transcontinental and Grand Trunk
Pacific Railway we were also building another line to undermine and injure it. Not
only did we do that, but we went into the
building of the Transcontinental and Grand
Trunk Pacific without the faintest idea of
what it would cost. We built a great part
of it paralelling within a block the Canadian Northern railway, and no person in
Canada thought it worth while to protest.
In discussing this question I am not
taking any political view of it. In my opinion both parties in this country were equally
rash and equally unwise in the development
of a railway or transportation policy. We
built from the city of Quebec to Moncton a
road which was only useful to destroy the
Intercolonial, and we built it at -a cost of
$30,000,000. I recollect travelling over that
road within five years after it was built,
and it was so over grown with trees that
they nearly knocked the windows out of the
cars.
The development of our transportation
problem, assisted by a senile directorate in
England, destroyed the greatest benefactor
we have ever had from a transportation
point of view-the Grand Trunk railway.
Had it not been for the insane policy of the
Grand Trunk Railway directors in loading
that company down with $120,000,000 or

$130,000,000 for the building of a road
through a country that required no road at
all, and had it not been for the borrowings
they made from the Canadian Government
and the responsibilities they assumed, the
Hon.

Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

Grand Trunk Railway might have been today in the hands of its original owners and
not have gone into bankruptcy.
Now, standing by the grave of the Grand
Trunk, some people are contemplating a
rival to it and to its successors, to take from
the railroads of Canada some of the business which they now have, and of which
they stand very much in need. This report
which we have before us tells us that the
transportation facilities of Canada are
away in advance of our requirements. It
tells us that we have at least 2,800 miles of
railroad for which we have no use, and for
which we shall have no use for many years
to come; it tells us that the railway facilities that we have far outstrip the demands
of our people. And we know that those railroads are increasing the indebtedness of
this country to the extent of nearly $100,000,000 a year; we know that if we were to
close up half of them we could save within
the next three or four years the cost o
reconstruction of all the roads which migi
fall into decay. I do not think that in tht
history of the world there has been such a
disastrous policy as that adopted by Canada
in the development of its transportation;
and I do not know of any man who can say
that we ever gave the grave and serious
consideration to this question that it wax
entitled to before we plunged into tht
vortex of near bankruptcy.
Anyone looking over what the wisdom of
our statesmen have done for us can quite
realize and can agree that fools rush ip
where angels fear to tread. I have heard
men who know little or nothing about it
vehemently advocating this development,
and when I look at the report made by this
Commission, I say it is unworthy of any
consideration at all.
The report, as it
states itself, is founded upon inaccurate,
unreliable and sketchy information. Let me
read you one paragraph written by these
gentlemen who have advised the Governments of this country and the United States
to adopt this scheme of navigation and
power development. It says at page 167:
The Commission is convinced that in a matter
of such unusual magnitude, involving engineering factors that are more or less debatable-

Debatable is a very serious word in a
question of this kind when one is making a
recommendiation-and
affecting the interests of iany millions
of people, too much care cannot be taken to
insure the adoption of plans that will be beyond
reasonable criticism, both as to the general
scheme of development and the working out of
its details. It is therefore desirabhe that, before
any steps are taken to carry out the Commis-

JUNE 14, 1922
sion's recommendations, the plans of the Engineering Board, together with such comments
or criticisms or alternative plans as have been
filed with the Commission by other engineers,
should be referred back to the board enlarged

in the title of the soil of lakes and rivers,
the Dominion Government might take expropriation proceedings for the purposes of
navigation, or for the purpose of creating

In a

moment, I think, I shall answer the honourable gentleman's question.
In the case of the Attorney General of
Canada versus the Attorney General of
Ontario, 1989 Appeal Cases 700 (Fisheries
case), Lord Herschell said, at page 709:
It must aise be borne in mind that there is a
broad distinction between proprietary rights
and legislative jurisdiction; the fact that such
jurisdiction in respect of a particular subject
matter is conferred on the Dominion Legislature, for example, affords no evidlence that
any proprietary rights with respect te it were
transferred ta the Dominion. There la no presumption that because Legislature jurisdiction
was vested in the Dominion Parliament proprietary rights were transferred ta it. The
Dominion of Canada was called into existence
by the British North America Act 1867. What
proprietary rights were at the time of the
passing of that Act possessed by the Provinces
remain vested in them except such as are by
any of its express enactinents transferred ta
the Dominion of Canada.

And it is held in that case that the beds
of all lakes and rivers and other waters
situate within the territorial limits of the
several provinces and not granted before
Confederation continued on the above provisions the property of the provinces.
The case 'of Burrard Power Company,
Limited, vs. the King, in 1911 Appeal
Cases, page 87, is the case which comes
nearest them all:
In this case, British Columbia, by its Water
Commissioners, had sold a record of 25,000
inches of water out of the Lillooet Lakes and
River situate in the Railway Bei.
The Railway Belt was as part of the agreement of Union transferred ta the Dominion "in trust te be approapriated in such manner as the Dominion Governinent may deem
ad'visable in the furtherance of the construction
It was held that the
of the said railway".
Dominion obtained the same interest in the
Railway Belt as the Province had before the
transfer, and that, in other words, the Railway Belt was "public lands" beld by the Crown
in right of the Dominion.

All public lands in the province are held
by the Crown in right of the province, and
this case, which was asserting the right
of the Dominion in lands which were held
by the Crown in the right of the Dominion,
is exactly on all fours with the other.
The Don. inion Government brought this action
ta have it declared that the Province had no
right ta sell this water out of tzis River, and
in that contention they were upheld by all
the Courts.

This case is an exact authority for our
contention, as Ontario's rights in regard to
the public lands in this province are identical with those in the Dominion in regard
to the Railway Belt in British Columbia.
In this case Mr. Justice Duff (43 S.C.R.,
page 27), says:

The design of the Act (i.e, B.N.A. Act) appears ta have been that such of the property
as by the Act was appropriated ta the Dominion
should be subject te the excIfsive control of the
Dominion legislature, and such as was left in
the Provinces should be subjeet ta the exclusive
provincial control.

Lord Mersey gave the judgment in thp
Privy Council, at page 95:
The grant of the water record in the case now
under consideration is an attempt on the part
of the Province ta appropriate the revenues
ta itselif and would if carried into effect violate
the terms of the contract, as interpreted by
Lord Watson.

And further down he says:
Their Lordships are of opinion that the lands
in question so long as they remain unsettled are
"public property" within the meaning of section
91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867- and as such are
under the exclusive legislative authority of
the Parliament of Canada by virtue of the Act
of Parliament. Before the transfer they were
public lands the proprietary r.ghts in which
were held by the Crown in right of the Province.
After the transfer they were stili public lands,
but the proprietary rights were held by the
Crown in right of the Dominion. and for a
the
public purpose, namely the construction of
railway. This being so, no Act of the Provincial
upon the
Legislature could affect the wa.ers
lands.

I do not wish to weary you, honourable
gentlemen, but I would refer you to another
case, that of the Attorney General of
British Columbia against the Attorney
General of the Dominion, which is reported
in 30 Times Law Reports, 1913. This case
confiruns that decision, and I have reason
to believe that the Dominion Government
has been advised by its law officers that
that is the exact position.
If that is the position, then thé Dominion
Government has no power or authority to
construct any dams for power or any other
purposes whatsoever, and has no power
to take water from these lakes or rivers,
even for new canals, without the consent
of the province. The old canals are vested

SENATE
in them by the British North America Act.
For some purposes, for navigation, perhaps, they could no doubt expropriate the
water of the river. But they must pay for
it: they cannot, Lord Watson says, confiscate anything.
The reason I draw the attention of the
House to this, point is that the law in the
State of New York is exactly the sane as
it is in the Province of Ontario. The United
States of America, considered as a Republic, has no proprietorship in the waters
of Lake Ontario or in the waters of the
St. Lawrence River. The riparian owner
owns the foreshore if it has been granted,
but the State of New York or the riparian
owner is sole owner of that property. I
therefore say that before the Canadian
Government and the United States of
America commit themselves to the construction of this stupenduous work they had
better be perfectly sure that they have
acquired the St. Lawrence River and Lake
Ontario.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen, I have listened with a great deal of
pleasure to the speeches made by the honourable member for DeLanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) and the honourable member
for Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton).
This is a subject in which I have taken
some intexest, and I feel that I should not
let the matter be disposed of without
making a few remarks.
I wish to correct some of the statements
that were made by the two previous
speakers in reference to this matter. First,
the last speaker (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) gave me the impression that this Commission was appointed and did its work
within three months. The honourable gentleman has read the report of the Commission, and he knows- that is not correct.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I said
that they had made their report three
months after they had got the material
from the engineers.
Hon. Mr. REID: This commission was
appointed by the two Governments-the
United States Government and the Government of Canada. The Commission, as
you will see by reference to the report,
was appointed on January 12, 1920, over
two years ago.
They commenced their
work immediately after appointment, and
carried on their investigations up ta the
time they made their final report.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: In December, 1921.
Hn. Mr'. LYNCH-STANTON.

Hon. Mr. REID: So they gave two
years of their time to getting all the information possible to formulate their report.
So far as this great work is concerned
let me say that the Dominion Government
has been carrying on investigations and getting information in regard to navigation,
not only from Montreal to Lake Ontario,
but from Quebec right through to Port
Arthur, because this work is one of the
greatest importance to the Dominion of
Canada. That work, as I have stated, has
been carried on for many years. It has
been carried on not only by the late Government, but by the Governments before
that. This data was brought together and
compiled by the several departmentsnot only the Department of Railways and
Canals, but the Department of Marine and
Fisheries, and other Departments also,
collected data and submitted it to the Commission that made this investigation. This
Commission went over the ground and got
all the information they could from different parts of Canada and the United States,
and, after going into the matter thoroughly
with the engineers of the Department of
Railways and Canals and those of other
departments, and after going into it with
the engineers of the United States Government, over a period covering three
months, they came to the conclusions stated
in the report and made their recommendations accordingly. I mention this so thaL
honourable gentlemen will understand that
this investigation occupied not three
months, but at least two years, and was
made with the assistance of the best men
that could be chosen by both Governments.
There is another impression that I wish
to correct. The impression that I get from
the honourable gentlemen who have spoken
is that if we go into this work it will mean
an expenditure of a billion dollars, and
that if we carry out the recommendations
of the Commission we must be prepare:
to assume at least half that amount. That
is not the recommendation of the Commission as both honourable gentlemen
understand thoroughly. If we carry out the
recommrendations of the Commission there
will be an expenditure by both governments
of $252,000,000. The Commission recommend that the work shall be proceeded
with from the east end of Lake Ontario
to Montreal, and that at what is known as

The honourable gentleman from De La- through the canais in 1920 and 1921, and
naudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) objected to the arigin of the freight. In 1920, 1,28522

SENATE
tons of freight that originated in Canada
passed through the St. Lawrence canals.
In the same year 1,782,690 tons originated
in the United States and passed through
these canals. A larger quantity of American freight went down to Montreal and was
transferred there. In the year 1921 1,547,743 tons of freight that originated in
Canada passed through the St. Lawrence
canals. In the same year 2,186,332 tons of
freight originating in the United States
went by that route. That is the statement I have received from Mr. Coats, Dominion Statistician, this morning.
Considering these figures as a fair basis,
we should be called upon to undertake
jointly with the United States an expenditure of $252,000,000, and when the work
would be completed we should have a
twenty-five foot navigation route from Port
Arthur to Montreal and 1,464,000 horsepcwer developed, and it would allow vessels
800 feet long, if we so desired, to pass
through from Port Arthur to Montreal.
We have on the upper lakes to-day vessels
600 or 625 feet long, that are carrying
300,000, 400,000, or 500,00) bushels of
grain. You can now estimate from that
what number of bushels of grain could be
carried if the vessels were increased from
600 to 800 feet in length.
The honourable member from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch--Staunton) has stated
that, so far as the rates are concerned,
the lowest rate he ever heard of between
Port Arthur and Montreal was, I think he
said, five cents to Kingston. If I am not
right, the honourable gentleman will carrect me.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
average.
Hon. Mr. REID: The average rate. Now
let me say to the honourable gentleman
that I have also asked the Dominion Statistician for a statement as to what rates
we have had in the past, and what are the
rates this year. I knew quite well, that the
rate had been much lower. In the year
1913 the yearly average rate from Port
Arthur and Fort William to Montreal-not
to Kingston-was 5.35 cents, and to Port
Colborne 2.43 cents. The monthly average
was 6.34 cents to Montreal, and 3.08 cents
to Port Colborne; but the lowest rate between Port Arthur and Montreal during the
year 1913 was 4.08 cents per bushel. In
1914 the yearly average rate per bushel to
Montreal was 4.58 cents and to Port Colborne 1.48 cents. In 1921, the rate from
Port Arthur and Fort William was 10.86
Hon. Mr. REID.

cents to Montreal, and 3.13 cents to Port
Coliborne.
What has been the history of these transportation systems? I can remember when,
a good many years ago, the rate from Port
Arthur or Fort William, or from Chicago,
to Montreal was 25 cents a bushel, and the
reason for that was that the ;Welland
Canal was so small that it would take only
vessels of 15,000 or 20,000 bushels capacity.
But it was enlarged, and when it was enlarged the rates came down. It was enlarged again and again: four times, I
think, it has been increased; and in every
case the rates have come down. I believe
that if this scheme is ever carried out the
rates will fall and will be much less than
what they have ever been in any year previous to the war or since. If the rates can
be reduced from 1 to 2 cents a bushel on
freight from the great Northwest, that reduction will almost pay for the work which
has been recommended by the Commission.
But I desire to point out that the scheme
would help not only the West, but every
port of the Dominion from Port Arthur
east. Let me mention why this is so. Is
it not true that the very fact of having
water transportation through all these provinces compels the railways to keep down
their freight rates? If it does, then has
not the improvement of our waterways
system assisted those provinces in the past,
and will it not assist them in the future,
by reducing the rates and putting the provinces-those of the West, as well as the
others-in such a position that they may
compete with foreign countries in getting
their products to European markets? What
is our position with respect to the Eastern
provinces? Why should we not be using
Nova Scotia coal and New Brunswick coal
up as far, say, as Toronto anyway? If
we had a system of waterways whereby a
10,000 or 12,000-ton vessel could be brought
from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick up to
these Ontario ports, you could afford to use
that coal; but just so long as you have to
bring coal from those lower ports in such
small vessels as are used, so long will it
be unable to compete with the coal from
across the line.
Does
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-•STAUNTON:
the honourable gentleman know the cost of
carrying coal from Nova Scotia to Montreal?
Hon. Mr. REID: I must plead ignorance
at the present time, but I will say this to
the honourable gentleman, that prior to the
war it was carried for about eighty cents
a ton.

JUNE 14, 1922
It is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
carried for less from Pittsburg to Toronto.
Hon. Mr. ReID: I do not agree with
the honourable member. Perhaps he bas
more information than I have. At all
events, I have in the past looked into this
matter, and I believe that if we can get
transportation facilities between Nova
Scotia and the Western provinces it will
be to the material advantage of all concerned.
I might give an instance which honourable gentlemen have probably read in the
newspapers this morning. I give it for
- t
it is worth. I observe that in an investigation in another place, some gentleman, trying to get the railways to reduce
rates, made the statement that freight of
some kind-I think it was iron-could be
loaded at Winnipeg, shipped to Port Arthur,
loaded in vessels there and sent around to
Vancouver, and a saving effected of $7.50
a ton. No doubt that statement, which I
read in the papers, was correct and will
appear as evidence when the reports are
submitted to this House.
No railway can carry freight from Port
Arthur or Fort William to Montreal or
Quebec at rates which are less than three
times the rate at which a vessel can carry
it. It is only in the winter time that the
railways can compete. They cannot possibly compete otherwise with water navigation.
I would take it from the discussion by
the first speaker that he was of the opinion
that if this scheme proceeds it will hurt
Montreal. His idea was that vessels might
pass Montreal and go right through to
Port Arthur.
It is true, many vessels
will do that; but I believe that vessels
will be constructed for travelling between
Port Arthur and Montreal, similar to those
that -we have on the great lakes-not vessels built to be continuously on the ocean.
In other words, there would be built a
much cheaper type of vessel, more like a
box, which would run from Port Arthur
to Montreal or Quebec and would tranship
into those great ocean liners that have
been built at such enormous expense, and
that have necessarily to be built strong on
account of the ocean work they must do.
At Montreal the freight can be transferred
for about one quarter or one third of a
cent per bushel. That is a very small
amount. Instead of hurting Montreal, the
carrying out of the scheme would in my
opinion bring more traffic to that port.
Not only would Montreal and Quebec receive all our Canadian traffic, large quan-

351

tities of which now go by the Erie canal,
but a large traffic from the United States
would go through Montreal and Quebec,
where the freight would be transhipped
for European countries. Therefore I cannot see but that the scheme would be a
benefit to the city of Montreal and the
city of Quebec as ports of transit.
A little pamphlet which the city of Montreal has been circulating, and which every
honourable member of this House has received, shows the business that the port of
Montreal does as compared with United
States ports. In this pamphlet, which
you have all doubtless read, you will read
figures for the year 1921 showing the
quantities shipped by Montreal in her
seven months' season of navigation as compared with a twelve months' season at
other ports. Montreal shipped 138,453,980
bushels of grain in seven months; Galveston, 94,000,000; New York-the great city
of New York-84,698,000 in twelve months;
New Orleans, 73,689,000; and Baltimore,
55,314,000.
The statement mentions the
advantages of Montreal and gives reasons
why ships should go that way. It says:
The port of Montreal, being ncarer Europe
than any other large Atlantic seaport, as is
demonstrated by the following distances to
Liverpool, offers superior advantages not only
to her immediate hinterland, but -also to the
American States, bordering on the Great Lakes.

Montreal is trying to get the traffic from
the American States, and this pamphlet
states that the distance from Montreal to
Liverpool is 2,773 miles; from Boston,
2,810; from New York, 3,010; and from
Philadelphia 3,116 miles; and so on.
What is the position to-day? Freight
for Montreal is brought to Port Colborne
and Buffalo in large 12,000 or 14,000-ton
vessels; and it has to be transhipped at
Port Colborne to small vessels of about
75,000 bushels capacity. It takes several
days to come from Port Arthur to Port
Colborne, and if the Welland canal and
the other navigation were open, the distance fron Port Colborne to Montreal
would be covered in thirty-six hours, and
at a very much lower rate than is
being
paid
at
the
present
time.
I am not urging that we should start at
the present time to erect a work at a large
expenditure; but what I hesitate to do is
to express the opinion that this is not a
great national transportation highway.
When anybody tells me that it is not international, I say he is wrong, and for this
reason: of the 1,000 miles, 940 are international. The Governments of Great Britain and Canada together in *a Treaty gave

352

SENATE

the United States, in perpetuity, the right
of navigation through the remaining 40
miles in Canadian territory. Because of the
Dominion Government constructing the
canais between Cornwall and Montreal,
there was a question raised as to whether
it was really meant that the United States
could use the canais. Just let me read the
clause in the Treaty that gives that right.
Article 26. The navigation of the River St.
Lawrence, ascending and descending from the
451h parallel of North latitude where it ceases
to form the boundary between the two countries
from, t0, and înto the sea, shall forever remain
free and open for the purposes of commerce
te the citizens of the United States, subject
le any laws and regulations of Great Britain
or of the Dominion cf Canada, not inconsistent
with such privilege of free navigation.

I am not a iawyer, but I take it that that
Treaty, made between England and the
United States, and giving the United States
the free and uninterrupted right to navigate the river St. Lawirence, is one that vie
in Canada must respect no matter vihether
the question of provincial rights or anything else shouid arise.
There is another clause in the Treaty
to which I would like to refer. Lt does not
refer to navigation, but it is necessary to
read it to understand the next clause. Lt
says:
The Governnent of the United States further
engages not to impose any expert duties on
goods, wares or menchandise carried under this
article through the territory of the, United
States; and Her Majesty's Governinent engages
to urge the Parliament of the Dominion of
Canada and the Legisiatures of the other
colonies net to impose any export duties on
goods, wares, or merchandise carried under
this article ; and the Government cf the United
States may, in case such export duties are imposed by the Dominion of Canada, suspend,
during the period that such duf les are imposed,
the right of carrying granted under thls article
in favour of the subjects ef Rer Britannic
Majesty.

Now, here is the clause I wish to emphasize:
The Goverrnent of the United States may
suspend the rights of carrying granted in
faveur of the subjects ef Rer Britannle Majesty
under this article, in case the Dominion of
Canada should, at any time, deprive the cîtizens

of the use of the canaIs in sald Dominions Of
termas ef equality with the inhabitants ef the
Dominion as previded In Article 27.
Taking those items together, I dlaim that
any rights enjoyed by the Dominion of Canada are equaiiy enjoyed by the United
States so far as navigation, through canais
or otherwise, is concerned-and that is in
perpetuity. That is the policy adopted by
the Dominion Of Canada many years ago.
The deepening of the Welland Canai £rom

feet and then te twenty-five feet was followed by the enlargement of the St. Lawirence canaIs. Every person I ever heard
discuss the matter took the position that
it vias of no use te eniarge the Welland
Canal uniess you couid go through te Montreal if you have to break buik and transfer it, you spoil the vihole transportation
system; therefore it was net very many
years before the St. Lawrence canais were
deepened aise. That poiicy bas been carried eut, I believe, by every Government.
Lt is now intended te eniarge the Welland Canal se that vesseis with a draught
of 25 feet can go through; the iocks are
being se constructed that the canai can be
deepened te 30 feet in the future if it is
desirable. Are we going 'te foilovi eut that
policy and spend $252,000,000? This may
net be done new, but the time wiii corne
Nwhen ýCanada can afford te de its share,
and when it wiii be done; and I ask vihether
we should turn devin forever the effer of
the United States Gevernment te jein in
such a vierk vihen they have an equai right
with us te use the Canais and St Lawirence
river through te the ecean.
Se far as the 3,000,000 horse-power in
our ovin territery is concerned, the United
States say: "We do net want te interfere
with it; -that is your ovin. You need net
deveiop it if you don't want te; if yeu viant
te develop it in the future you can de se
and have the vihole development; but it is
in the interest of the vihole work that this
particular
deveiopment for navigation
should go on, and that vie sheuld proceed
together, and, of the expenditure of $159,1)00,000, vie are wiiling te pay our share
in proportion te the traffic." The question is
hevi are you going te appertion the expenditures at the present time? The United
States say: "We wiii take the last five years
prier te the commencement of the werk as
a basis, and vie wiii pay our share ia proportion te the traffic. We wiii do that during construction, and after that the proportions can be ascertained frem the traffic
that gees through the canal, or vie can
agree upen a further period, if necessary,
until the viork is established."
If you take the figures which I have
given, you wiii see that, instead of being
cailed upon te pay $252,000,000, we wouid
be called upon te assume haif or iess of
that amount and viould have available 732,000 horse-power, in addition te a waterway
right through te Montreal.
Is that soniething Vhat vie should turn devin without
giving it any thought?
This Commission,
1 think, bas done a great service in pilacing
this vihole matter before the people of this

JUNE 14, 1922
country in such a way that they cati understand it. I think that the Goverrnnent,
in'stead of lightly turning down this proposition, âhould make every effort to try
to bring the freight; that la not being diverted .by way of Buffalo and other ports
through our awn territary so that it can be
shipped from Canadian -ports.
That is
the policy I arn advocatin.g.
The honourable member for Hamilton
(Hon. Lynch-iStaunton) made a statement
in regard to the enormous railway expenditures. We ail ýagree that reckless expenditures were made, and that railways were
buiît many years in advance of their tinte.
But I take issue with the honourable gentleman in regard ta the railway in New
Brunswick and northward.
Any person
who, goes over the 'Transcontinental railmway between Québec and Moncton will see
large towns and growing settlements, as
well as timber, minerals and agricultural
produdts, te the value of many millions of
dollars per annum.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNT'ON: Does
the honourable gentleman say that railroad
can pay not on'ly the interest but its running expenses?
Hon. Mr. REID: I think it wilL.
I will
say this.
Now that we -have the Caitadian Northern and the Grand Trunk we are
in a more favourable position than we ever
were before to direct traffic to our iCanadian ports of St. John and Halifax and
ship it by our own vessels.
We have a
double track which la of great value in the
developmnent of that trafflo.
So far as the Canadian Northern is concerned, except for the section between Port
Arthur and Montreal, it was a good thing
for Canada that it was constructed.
The
develanment caused by the building of the
Canadian Northern has been of great advantage to Canada.
A very seriaus mistake was ma-de when the Grand Trunk

or fifty miles north of them, I do not know
but tbat it would have been to the advantage of the Dominion.
I am not holding a post mortezn upon
what bas been datte in the past. I feel that
there are two, outstanding problems that
we must face.
One is the transportation
problem.
If we have to depend entirely
upon our railways, and pay railway
freig'hts, then I say the manufacturers and
proiducers of Canada cannot compete with
those of foreign countries.
We must have
S-23

351q

the very best of water transportation we
can get.
Further, 'we cannot develop our country
unless we have water-power.
It is true
that we have great water-powers in the
Niagara district.
In driving through that
section a few days ago il met a gentleman
who had not been in Niagara for many
years, *and he remarked upon the numbe-r
of cities around there.
I contend that
they have grown up because of the cheap
water-p-ower.
Mantreal is being developed
because. it has great water-powers.
But
there are other .parts of the country between
Montreal and Toronto which have not the
same advantages.
We have railways running between Montreal and Toronto.
Are
we to continue for ail time to depend upon
coal for their operation?
Surely the tinte
will came when electricity will be, much
cheaper than coal.
If 700,000 hersepawer are put at the -disposai of the railways, and they can operate more cheaply
with it, they will carry passengers and
freight more cheaply; and surely that would
Therebe a great benefit to the country.
fore I say it would be a great benefit to
bave water-power available in the future
for ahl these railways.
I have taken much longer than I intended, honourable gentlemen. This waterway front Port Arthur to Montreal is, I
believe, the greatest waterway in the
world. A vessel carrying 12,000 or 15,000
tons could proceed in open water for 960
miles with the exception af perhaps hall a
mile of canal with one lock at the Sault
and 14 miles and seven locks at the Welland canal. If this waterway is completed,
a vessel will be able ta go right ta Montreal with 15,000 ta 18,000 tons of freight.
This, I believe, la one of the greatest transportation prajects that has ever corne
bel are the people of Canada. The Commission, after studying it for two years,
recommend it. Some fault is found with
them because they say that it is a very
large problent and that before a final decision is made other engineers should be
consulted. The estimates of cost, I maintain, are within reason. Pre-war prices
could have been taken in estimating the
cost; but the engineers were told to add a
sufficient amount to caver any additional
cost that might be incurred owing to war
conditions and the after effects of war.
Eighty per cent has been added to the
pre-war rates. I have checked that up ini
two ways. Years ago when this matter
was before the other House an effort was
made by a United States company ta get

REVTSED EDITION

SENATE
a charter to dam the River St. Lawrence
at the Long Sault, in order to develop
power. If my memory serves me, the estimate of cost at the time was $40,000,000.
The Commission to-day are estimating the
cost at $72,000,000, and they have added
eighty per cent to that. Some honourable
gentlemen from Montreal may remember
that when the Georgian Bay Canal was
being constructed some estimates of the
cost were given. An estimate was published,
which may be found in the Library, stating
that the Montreal section would cost some
$18,000,000. Engineers of the Department of Railways and Canals have said
that this work between Montreal and Lake
St. Louis would cost practically as much as
the Georgian Bay Canal, giving an estimate of $55,783,000.
Honourable gentlemen, let us not condemn this great work for all time to come.
Let us not make speeches that will throw
cold water on the scheme and cause the
United States to back down and say:
" Very well, if you will not agree to it,
go ahead and construct a waterway on
your own side, or do not construct it, as
you like. If you do, we will use it when
it is completed." I say we should take
the matter up with the United States,
place our cards on the table, and say:
"This is a waterway system in which
we are to have equal rights. Are you
willing, in accordance with the recommendation of the Commission, to approve of
taking in also the Welland Canal, and
to pay your share according to the traffic
that has been done for the last five
years and will be done in the future?
Will you pay your share of the upkeep and
cost of operation of that waterway? If
they are willing to do so, then, I say, we
should consider undertaking the scheme.
Of course, if we are not financially able
to go ahead with the work at the present
time- and I am not urging immediate
action-then we should lay our cards on
the table and say: " This is a work which
we agree should be done; we are not in
a position to proceed at present; as soon
as we are, we will join with you and
carry the work to a conclusion." I ask
you, is that not a fair proposition? Ought
we not to do so rather than let the public
believe that if we ever considered the proposal for one moment it would involve
an expenditure of $1,400,000,000, and must
add a half billion dollars to the debt
of this country? I say that is not in accordance with the recommendation. It is not
what I believe to be just and right. I do
Hon. Mr. REID.

not think we ought to discuss this matter
in such a way that the people may be deceived by statements of that kind, cold
water may be thrown on the scheme, and
the United States may be driven away
from it. Let the matter stand for the
present, and when the time comes that
we are able to take it up and discuss it,
then let us -do so, and if we then find that
it is not going to be in the interest of
Canada we can drop it.
Hon. JOHN S. MeLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, I had intended to move the
adjournment of the debate, but what I desired to say bas been so clearly and forcibly

stated by the honourable gentleman who
bas just sat down that I feel it is unrecessary to make that motion. I had intended to speak from my business experience in connection with the grain trade
and with transportation on the St. Lawrence, both in the upper regions and between Cape Breton and Montreal. I renember that in one of the years when I
was engaged in the grain trade Montreal
reached what the trade then regarded as the
magnificent

total export of eight million

bushels. Now, by successive improvements
in navigation, a total of 138 millions is
raached in a single year, much of that
That is a

triumph of the energy of the people dealing now with that transportation, as I am
not, and it indicates the advantages of the

St. Lawrence route.

Every step towards

improvement in the navigation of our
waterways bas resulted in the greatest possible gair in our trade; and that, I believe, will continue to be the case.
Estimates have often been proven wrong.
I have known, as I think most honourable
members have known, very few estimates

of the cost of anything which have proved
to be correct, and the cost bas very rarely
turned out to be less than what had been
e. timated. If time is taken to re-examine
and revise the figures stated in the Commission's report, no great loss will ensue;
and if ultimately we improve the navigation of the whole system from the head of
the Great Lakes to the sea, to make it the
most perfect, the easiest and the cheapest
route in the world, the result will be enor-mously to the benefit of Canada. Moreover, it seems to me that from the provision of cheap power, not only for the railroads, as has just been stated, but also for
manufacturing purposes, we shall derive
the utmost advantage. Too large a pro"
portion of the products of Canada go out
in the form of raw materials-our grain,

JUNE 14, 1922
our asbestos, our lumber, etc. If it be possible by means of cheap power to develop
those products further, so that they may
mean more value to Canada, more Canadian
work, there is another line of endeavour
that will ease the burden under which we
and the next generations shall labour by
reason of the cost of the war.
I cannot agree with the honourable
Senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) in the view that he took, that the
report of this Commission was superficial or
misleading. It seemed to me that great
care and caution had been exercised and
great ability displayed in the work that
they did, which is exactly what we all
should expect from the personnel of the
Commission-at all events, as we know it
to be on the Canadian side.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have listened with considerable interest to the debate that has been
going on, and which was initiated by the
honourable member for De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain). I was glad to hear
the remarks of the honourable members
who have spoken to-day. They approached
the subject from a national, not a provincial or parochial, point of view. They
approached it from different angles, but I
feel that they have contributed greatly to
the information of the members of this
Chamber.
The ex-Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr.
Reid), who seems to have given considerable time and attention to the work carried
on by the Commission, is full of optimism
as to the future development of that great
waterway which is called the Lake and
St. Lawrence system. But he has admitted
that the project should be approached with
caution and prudence, and with all the
science that experts can apply to the solution of the problem. He has, moreover,
recognized that the time was perhaps not
prbpitious fo5 the Federal Government, if
it decided that the work should be carried
on, to enter upon that development scheme
at the present time. He realizes, better
than many of the members of this Chamber, what a heavy burden the railways
have laid upon the Dominion exchequer.
We must first regain our financial'equilibrium and await better times before incurring such large obligations as would be
involved in thi-s scheme. The present Federal Government, which has had no time
to examine into the project, has replied
-and, I believe, properly-to the communication from Washington that it had not yet
had the opportunity of studying the proS-231

ject, and did not consider it expedient at
the present time to deal with this matter.
This is somewhat along the lines of the
argument of the ex-Minister of Railways,
whom we have had the advantage of hearing to-day. It does not express any enthusiastie opinion over the scheme, I admit, but it states that the Government has
not had an opportunity to study the project.
It will be some time yet, I fear, before
the Government is ready to approach the
Parliament of Canada with the suggestion
that a large expenditure be begun upon
this improvement. I feel that any improvement of our water-powers will be of great
benefit to Canadian trade in general. It is
without any prejudice whatever that I approach the question.
The information
which we have received this afternoon will
go a long way to incite honourable members of this Chamber to give close thought
and study to the project. I have no objection to the motion which is now before
the House.
The motion was agreed to.

RULES OF THE SENATE
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is not the
Senate called by special notice to amend
a rule? And, if so, should not the motion
have precedence over the regular procedure?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
should take precedence.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It comes as
the first notice of motion. I do not think
there is in our rules anything that requires

356

SENA1'E

us to deal with that motion before we
corne to the motions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My only recollection is that a special meeting of the
Senators has been generally called at haifpast two, for the purpose of revising the
rules. That has not often been duone. 1
remember that in past sessions we did
nieet at half-past two for such a purpose,
but perhaps latterly the meeting bas been
deferred to a time nearer the time the
Senate usually meets. I remember quite
clearly, however, that we did take up n
motion for a change of rules before proceeding with the routine business of the
Senate. I do not know whether my honourable friend the leader of the Conservative
party remembers or not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. I
quite agree with what my honourable
friend has said. The practice in the past
was that the Senate was called specially
to deal with a change in the rules, and
invariibly before three o'clock. Apparently
we are departing fromn a well-establîshed
practice and making this matter simply
a part of the business of the sitting.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: But we were summoned for three o'clock.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: There was a special
summons this time for three o'clock.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If the House
desires to deal with this motion now, I
presuire that would be the best way to do
it. But I would draw the attention of
honourable members to rule 29, which
says:
No motion for making a standing rote or
order ban be adoYpted, unless two days' notice
in writing has been given thereof, and the
Senators in attendance on the session have
been summoned to consider the same.

That is the only rule I can find relating
to an amendment of the rules. A question
of privilege would go before the Special
Committee on Privileges, and in that case,
I understand, we should proceed in the
way indicated by the honourable leader
of the Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Witns
ail due deference to what His Honour the
Speaker bas said, I would direct the
attention of the House to the fact that a
special notice bas been sent out for a
meeting to deal with this subject. The
motion reads as follows,:
H-on.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

And that the Clerk summon the Senaýtors to
conaider the motion as requested by rule 29.

That would be a work of supererogation,
to speak, if we could deal with this
matter in the Senate, for it would be
unnecessary in that case to issue a special
summons. The motion contemplates that
we should be specially summoned to deal
with this particular subjeet.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: And the notice was
given four or five days ago.
50

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
has been done, and we were here to-day
at three o'clock in pursuance of the notice,
to deal with the proposed amendrnent of
the rule. However, no good purpose w-111
bê served by our resolving ourselves at
this moment into the special meeting. We
shall deal with the matter when motions
on the Order Paper are reached.
Perhaps we
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
might take the matter up at this stage
and the motion might be moved now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the
pleasure of the House that we proceed to
motions at once?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then we wiil
proceed to the motion of -the Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT moved:
That Rule 136 of the Standing fioles and
Orders o f the Sena te be arnended by substitoting
for the words 'during at least three months"
the word's "once a week for a period of five
wîeeks". and that Rule 139, clause 3, paragraph
(a) and Form E, paragraph 5, 'be amended by
substituting for the w'ords "two months" the
words "thirty days" ; and that the Olerk summon the Senators 4to consider the Motion as
requested by -Rule 29.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, one of
the purposes of this motion is to amend
rule 136. That rule reads as follows:
Every applicant for a
give notice of his or her
and ishall specify therein
what cause such divorce
cause such notice to be
Ieast three months before
the Committee on Divorce
for the said Bill...

Bill of Divorce shall
intended application,
from whom and, for
is sought, and shail
pu'blished during at
the consgideration by
of his or ber petition

What we desire to do is to strîke out the
words "three months " and substitute
the words "once a week for a period of
five weeks." In that way we limit the
length of time for advertising, and we
place Divorce Bis in exactly the samne
position as Private Bills. That is, if you
desire to bring forward a Private Bill,

JUNE 15, 1922
the period of publication required is only
five weeks.
As to the other amendment, of rule 139,
clause 3, the only change is in the length
of time from the service of a petition. The
time is changed from two months to thirty
days. That is, instead of being obliged to
wait for two months, the 'Committee of
the Senate can hear the petition thirty
days after it bas been served.
The only other amendmnent is in Form
E, to change the words " two months " to
" thirty days." The whole objet of the
change is to expedite the proceedings before the Senate. Advertising for five weeks
should be quite sufficient for ail purposes. In fact, it does not seem to me that
it is necessary to advertise in two local
papers. We have been in the habit of requiring aýdvertising for three monthi, but
five weeks should cover ail that is necessary. I neyer could see th.at any usefui
purpose was served by having advertising
run for three months. Not only does this
proposed amendment save expense, but it
also enabies the Committee to get on with
its work. The saine applies to the service. A person wbo is given thirty days
within whicb to put in an answer to a
petition lias ail the time that is really required.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Honourable gentlemen, with these explanations made to the
House, so that honourable gentlemen may
have an opportunity to consider the object
of the motion, it has been suggested that
this matter be adjourned until next Tuesday; and at this stage of the Session I
would ask to be permitted to add as a furtber amendment:
The 'Senate may order more than one igitting
of the House on any day, and each such sitting
shall be counted as a separate day upon which
the House sits.

This will enable the House to deal more
expeditiously with legislation, and if the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot) bas no objection, bis motion
could stand over until next Tuesday.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before
the matter now under consideration is adjourned, I sbould like to point out, in addition to what my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot) bas said, tbat the intention
of the Committee, particularly during this
Session and last Session, bas been directed
to the unnecessary expense incident to advertising. Under the rules at present three
months advertising is required in two local
papers. This amounts to a very substan-

tial sum, particularly when it is made by
petitioners wbo belong to the poorer classes
of the community. Furtbermore, it is really
unnecessary, wben one considers tbe fact
that the papers are served personally upon
ail those baving anything to do witb the
proceedings.
In the case of a Private Bill, no matter
how important the undertaking may be,
even if it involves an expenditure of millions, only five weeks advertising is required. Why, then, in a proceeding of
this kind, should we impose greater obligations upon the applicant than are imposed
upon the promoters of a Private Bill for
an important undertaking?
There is another factor wbicb should be
taken into consideration. In the Commons
a Divorce Bill is deemed a Private Bill,
and comes under the head jof Private Bis.
There is notbing to prevent a Divorce Bill
originating in the House of Commons and
being introduced there, and deait with in
the samne way as any other Private Bill.
Consequently, if a petitioner originated bis
Bill in that House, ail hie wouid have to
do would be to comply with the requirements of that House for Private Bis.
With these considerations before us, it
seems to me that this amendment is only
along the lines of what is rigbt and proper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It bas been
suggested by the bonourabie gentleman fromn
Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson)
that this debate be adjourned tili Tuesday,
and that another amendment to the rules
of the Senate be made in the form whicb

otherwise wouid.
The Committee was calied again for

I was aghast when I received that wire,
and found, after making certain inquiries,
that the Bill had corne before the Committee. It would appear that the Cornmittee was jockeyed se, that those opposed
to the Bill would not be present.
I
believe the sponsor of the Bill has been
perfectiy honourable in his action, but the
promoters of the Bill must have known that
it was going to be opposed, and consequently the sponsor of the Bil. was directed
to hoid it over, and it was clearly intimated
that the Bill might be dropped.
It was menH-on. Mr. CASGRAIN:
tioned.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In view of the
fact that there are thousands of innocent
bondholders ail over the country who had
no intimation of this intended legisiation,
the least we can do is to send it back to
the Committee. The Company seeking the
Bill is not a company in the ordinary sense,
as it is part and parcel of a merger and
has no shareholders, as the entire issue of
the shares was purchased by the Quebec
Railway, Light, Heat and Power Company in 1909, and ail these shares were

JUNE 15, 1922
pledged and 1hypothecated -on the 15th
December, 1909, to the Montreal Trust for
the payment of an issue of ten million
dollars of bonds by the merger. The only
stock outstanding is the shares given by
the trustee to the directors to quaiify them.
If this Bill passes the Senate wiil be sanctioning an issue of bonds taking precedence
of the bonds now hehd by the public, and for
the payment of which ail the shares of the
Company now before the Senate are
pledged. This Bill is absolutely prejudicial
to vested rîghts. It ailows no say to the real
owners of the shares to control any action
by the directors, as the trustee under the
deed of trust must give an irrevocable
power of attorney or proxy to the nominee
of the merger. It must be plain to hionourable gentlemen that those responsible
for this legisiation have taken an unfair
advantage to secure the passing of the
Bill through the Committee.
Perhaps the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman would postpone his
remarks to the Committee, if the Bill is
returned to it. Is there anybody opposing
the motion that the Bill be referred back to
the Committee?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
If there is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
an agreement formuhated by some of the
interested parties, the matter should be
ventilated.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes, but not here.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I am quite satîsfied.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I may say, as fa-r
as this Bill is concerned, that the honourable gentleman who has ju.st spoken has
presented a very fair statement of t~he
facts. The Bill was put in my namne at
the request of a fellow meinber of this
House who was going overseas. I presumed that as it had passed the Commons
in the ordinary way, it had been dissected
there, and any objections to it couhd then
have been taken; but they were not, and
the Bill hooked to me to be an innocent one.
I did only what I wouid do for my honourable friend the leader of the Government, if he were going overseas, or for my
honourable friend ta his qeft (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain), who is interested in this Bill.
So far as I am concernied, I took no advantage of anybody. Gentlemen interested in
this Bill came up from Montreal and said:
"We are going to oppose it." I said: 'II do
not know very much about it; I know it

only in a generai way." 1 have received
a wire from Montreai this afternoon asking
that the Bill be ai.lowed to .stand. An attorney here came subsequentiy to see me
and said: "'We may decide practicaliy to
withdraw it aitogether." That is the statement that I made to the Comrnittee. So
far as recommitting the Bill is concerned,
I have no objection if there is anything
wrong in it. My honou-rabie friend f romn
De Saiaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) and the
honourabie genbieman opposite, both of
whom corne from Quebec, were in the Coinmittee, and I thought they understood ail
the conditions of the Quebec Raiiway,
Light, and Power Company. So when I
received notice yesterday that this matter
was coming up in the Hou-se I was very
much surprised. However, I have no objection at all to the Bill being recommitted.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Bradbury
was agreed to.

COLD STORAGE WAREHOUSE BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITEE

On motion of Hlon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Report
of the Speciai iCommittee on Bill B, an Act
to amend The Coid Storage Warehouse
Act.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Subsections, 1 and 2 of new section 4A,
section 2, were agreed to.
On su-bsection 3 of new section 4A, section 2-certain articles not ta be returned
to coid storage:
Hon. Mr. ROBE RT SON: May 1 inquire
whether goods taken ont of coid starage
and consigned to a retailer, who, for some
reason or other, is unabie ta dispose of
them, are not permitted to, be returned to,
cold storage? It seems to me that such a
practice woid tend to cause a waste of
good products without doing any person
any good.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: This is one of
the niost important clauses of the Bill. One
of the biggest crimes that has been comnmitted against the heahth of the people of

36U

SENATE

Canada is the taking of goods out of cold
storage and consigning them to a retailer,
and then, when he is flot able to dispose
of them, and after they have been exposed
to a warmer temperature, putting them
back into cold storage again. Scientists
will tell you that f ood that bas been deait
with in that way is one of the principal
causes of ptomaine poisoning. Nearly
every State of the Union bas passed legislatiun along these lines. When a frozen
article is taken out of cold storage and
offered for sale, it must flot go back into
cold storage. That does flot prevent a man
putting goods into, his own refrigerator,
but he cannot put them back into cold
storage.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: In connection with
this matter I shuuld like to give you the
opinion of Eugene H. Porter, the Commissioner of the State of New York, on this
subject:
TPhe State prohibits the return of food to
cold storage when once released for the purpose of placing the same on market for sale.
The reason for Ibis is that it bas been found
that once an article of food bas been taken
fromn a low temperature to a higher one deterioration sets which in a comparatively short time
renders it unfit for human consumption. If a
side of beef for examrple, were withdrawn from
eold storage, and then returned. after being exposed to the warm air to a cold storage roomn
again, the Process of deterioration would be at
work, and while the col'd air would retard it,
Yet il would nul restore the meat to its former
condition. 'So, to avoid ail chances of danger,
the State forbidýs the return of any food commodity.

That is the statement of the Commissioner who bas charge of and is responsible for this matter in the great State of
New York.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Notwitbstanding ail that bas been said in defence of this
clause of the Bill, I should like to point
out to tbe House that subsection 1 of section 2 provides tbat no article shaîl be put
into, cold storage if it is unfit for buman
consumption. If it is fit for human consumption, wby sbould it flot go back to cold
storage to prevent it being destroyed? What
difference does it rnake wbetber it is put
back into cold storage for preservation or
into one's own ice box? It seerns to me
tbat these regulations aIl tend to increase
the cost of living to very rnany people. If
a man bas bad sorne goods in cold storage
and bas taken tbem out, and for some
reason desires to return tbem to cold storage and bas no cold storage facilities of
bis own and tbey are stili fit f'or bumain
consumption, wby should tbey be prevented
from going into eold storage under a
special clause la the Bill? I may be a
Hon.

Mr. BRADBURY.

layman, and not a bealtb officer, but I fail
to see any reason wby an article that is fit
for buman consumption sbould flot be put
into cold storage wbetber it bas been tbere
before or flot.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Mr. Chairman, yesterday you said tbat I was not a lawyer,
but a doctor. To-day I arn a doctor, not
a lawyer, and 1 want to say that the mover
of tbe Bill is perfectly correct and accurate
!n the statements wbicb be bas made. It
is dangerous for anyone to take food tbat
bas been re-stored after it bad been exposed to the air and microbic action bas
taken place. In this I want to make a
reservation. Some of our good friends, tbe
British, wbo are good feeders, wîll flot eat
any game food unless it is wbat tbey caîl
"bigb". I bad a good friend, a lawyer, wbo
came from England. He bappened to be in
the town in wbicb I first practised. He would
bang up his partridge and game until it
was "bigh". He said it was not fit to eat
before that was done. I said: "My friend,
you wilI get caugbt some day." I said:
"You are taking poison, your digestive
,juices are taking care of it now, but you
will be caugbt some day." One nigbt I
was called to hlm. He bad taken down
some of this game and eaten it, and bad
ptomaine poisoning. Beef will stand such
treatment better than anytbing else. Fisb
will flot stand it. The minute a fish dies
it begins to deteriorate, and tbat will be
admitted by my good friend to my rigbt
(Hon. Mr. McLean), wbo puts bis fisb
into freezing temperature as quickly as
possible, almost wbile tbey are still kicking.
But if fisb go to a buckster on tbe understanding that if be does not sell tbem tbey
can go back into cold storage, and tbey
are sent back into cold storage, tbey are
not fit for buman food. They are a menace to the community, and the poor people
wbu buy tbem bave to trust to their digestive juices or tbe good Lord to take care
of tbem.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Section 2 would
take cure of tbat. Articles unfit for buman consumption are flot to be stored.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Wbo is going to
tell? Do you mean to say that you could
tell whetber or not a mackerel was good?
Tbe only way you can get a mackerel that
is fit to eat is to go down to the boats
and take it home kicking and put it on
your pan almost before it dies. We from
tbe Maritime Provinces, wbo cannot get
fisb up here that is fit to eat, know that.
I amn a Roman Catbolic, and unfortunately

JUNE 15, 1922
some three days a week I have to eat fish
or go without. I cannot eat the kind of
stuff you get here; I push it away from me.
If there is one clause in this Bill that
should be passed, this is the one.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: I would call the
attention to the fact that while you refuse
to allow the food to go back to cold storage, you will allow the man who takes it
into his store to put it into his cold storage.
If it is not fit to go back into a public cold
storage, it is unfit to go into bis private
cold storage.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: The honourable
gentleman is quite right, but I draw attention to the fact that once the food reaches
the retail store it becomes a matter for
the civie authorities to say that it shall
not be offered for sale if not wholesome. I
am going as far as I can go in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I disagree entirely
with the honourable gentleman fron Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) when he says
that if the food does not go back to cold
storage there is a loss to the public. Take
the handling of fruit for instance. In the
city of Ottawa, whether in the smallest or
the largest store, you buy bananas and
oranges at exactly the same price. The
prices are controlled by the wholesalers. I
am satisfied that in the city of Ottawa tons
of fruit are destroyed or allowed to go to
waste every week, whereas if the retailers
were compelled to dispose of it they would
sell it at a reasonable price, and the cost
of living would be lowered. There would
be tons of fruit used that are to-day
dumped into the canal. That is one of
most important features of this Bill. I
would go further. I think the cold storages
ought to be responsible for every dollar's
worth of goods destroyed in cold storage if
they let the temperature change for a few
hours.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The cold storage company is responsible now.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: If they are, I am
glad of it. I did not know that they were.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They are responsible
to the owner of the goods.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I am certainly in
favour of this clause of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand that the retailers who get fish or
meat or fruit from the cold storage in the
morning are in the habit of returning it to
the cold storage that day or the next day?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They are. It is
spread out on their tables all day and then
returned.

361

I thought
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that it belonged to the retailers, and that
they had to take care of it or dispose of it.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It is done, perhaps not very often, and this is to make
that impossible; but if it is done only once,
that is once too often.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not desire
to block this Bill at all, but simply to bring
out points and to gain information. It
occurs to me that the provisions of this
clause permit the transportation of food
from one cold storage plant to another in
refrigerator cars.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Absolutely.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But there are

scores and probably thousands of dealers
in a small way who would like to transport
their goods in less than carload lots from
one place to another, and it seems to me
that they are put at a disadvantage as
compared with the large dealers. The cold
storage regulations seem to tend towards
putting the whole handling of perishable
foods into the hands of a constantly diminishing number of firms and eliminating
competition, and consequently towards increasing the cost.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Does not subsection
2 provide for what you are after?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Subsection 2
is satisfactory to me.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It is very evident that my honourable friend has not
given very close attention to the clause.
It makes ample provision to meet the situation which he has outlined. It reads as
follows:
If eggs, fish, poultry, game or fresh meats
are taken out of cold storage and erposed for
sale, they shall not be returned to cold storage;
but this provision shall not prevent the trangfer
of any of the said articles of food from one
cold storage warehouse to another if the transfer is made in refrigerator cars on railways, in
refrigerated space on steamships or other vessels, or in such other means of conveyance as
may be approved by regulation made by the
Governor in Council.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have not
overlooked that at all. But I point out
that in the absence of any regulations the
small dealer is absolutely debarred. He
is dependent on the Governor in Coundil
making regulations.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I should like to
draw the honourable gentleman's attention
to the fact that if a man ships threequarters of a carload he can get a refrigerator car.

62

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: By paying full
car'load rates.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes. And myhbonourable friend here (Hon. Mr. McLean)
will tell you that they do flot ship in less
than carload lots, because it does flot pay
them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Suppose you wanted
to ship a basket of fruit, would you pay
for a refrigerator car?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: No. You could
get it into an express car. I had some
lobsters corne up here the other day in that
way, and I had to throw them out.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The cold storage
people are quite satisfied with the clause.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The point raised by
the honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) may be easily explained by the fact that it is quite optional
to shippers to ship in refrigerator cars
in the summer, either in carloads or less
than carload lots, and during the cold
months they can ship in heated cars. The
railway companies operate refrigerator
cars in the summer and heated cars in
the winter for this service, and any shipper can ship in carload quantity or in less
than carload quantity.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The shipment of
smelts is a very large industry with us,
as it is in the locality of my honourable
friend from Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler).
Every morning a car is put on going to
the steamer, and small lots can be shipped
as well as carload lots.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They are frozen
anyway.
Hon. Mr. POPE: What about the smal]
consumer in the country? Are you going
to sbip carload lots to him in cold storage? Take our people in the province of
Quebec. We do not get our fond from
cold storage. We are entitled to some
considerat ion.
Subsections 3 and 4 of new section 4 A,
section 2, were agreed to.
On new section 4B of section 2-period
of storage:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Are you going
to have the Minister do this?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
After twelve
months the Governor in Council can
decide.
Hon. Mr. REID: There bas been a complaint in the past about doing the business
of the Government by Order in Council.
Hon.

Mr. MURPHY.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: This is very exceptional. You fellows did too much of
that.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I arn a little
surprised at this remark coming from a
member of the late Government.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: He is trying to
apologize.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Part of this
section is obligatory, and the other part
is referred to the Minister, who may
make regulations.
Hon. Mr. REID: If it is to be carried
out by Order in Council, and the Government carnies it out by Order in Council
as well as the previous Government carried on, I am satisfied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I hope that
neither the present non any future Government will abuse its powers.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

But you said the

New section 4B of section 2 was agreed
to.
On new section 4C of section 2-label

Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

Hon. Mn. FOWLER: "A description of

it mean its geneology, or its pedigree?
The article itself would show what it is.
What do you mean by "a description of the

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I will tell the
honounable gentleman exactly what I mean,
and when I tell him he will see how necessary it is. This manking is adopted by
every state in the Union that bas legislated on cold storage. 1 have examined
their cold storage legisiation, and I do not
think there is one state that bas flot
adopted a card similar to this.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do you put that

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Why would it be
necessary to fix a maximum period of
twelve months?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But I can give you
some evidence on that subject from a man
who is qualified to speak.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: A scientist.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is, Dr. Wiley.
I look upon Dr. Wiley as the highest
authority on this subject on the North
American continent. I do not know where
you can find anyone who bas devoted
as much scientific investigation to this
subject as bas Dr. Wiley. He has made
it the study of years. He bas investigated the effect of cold storage on decomposition, on palatability, and on the
wholesomeness of food-in every way that
it is possible to make a scientific investigation of those things. He gave his evidence before a Committee of the Senate.
What does be say? I want to give you
these points, because they are points on
which, I think, Mr. Ruddick's evidence
should not be taken as scientific. Here
is what Dr. Wiley says:
The idea that freezing will preserve indefinitely is contrary to scientific fact.

He gives that as the result of his own
investigation. He says further:
There is progressive decomposition of a coldstored produet from the day it is put in until
the day it is taken out.

In that be is completely at variance
with Mr. Ruddick. Mr. Ruddick is a cold
storage man, not a scientific man. He bas
never investigated any of these things
scientifically. His knowledge is simply
that of a cold storage man. Dr. Wiley
is a scientific investigator, and is looked
upon as the highest authority on the subject in the United States.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Will the honourable gentleman tell me how decomposition

Mr. MURPHY.

could take place under proper conditions
of freezing-at a low enough temperature?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I will give the honourable gentleman, not my opinionHon. Mr. MURPHY: I want to know
something about it.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:-but the opinion
of Dr. Wiley:
There is progressive decomposition of a coldstored product from the day it is put in until
the day it is taken out.

Then he goes on to say, in another statement:
There is always the activity bacterially and
vitally going on in the stored article, even If
it is frozen.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: How?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: There is Dr. Wiley's
answer to that.
A freezing mixture, even ice, does not inhibit
bacterial activity: because water is frozen when
you buy ice, yet it may be full of Lyphoid germs,
alive and kicking the moment they get out of
their bonds.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They do not develop in it, though.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL (reading):
It is heat that destroys bacteria, not cold.

It is on the evidence of seientific men
like Dr. Wiley that this Bill is based, and
it is on his evidence that the label is
based, so that the purchaser may know,
when buying a cold storage article, how
long it bas been in cold storage, and may
know that he is not being imposed on by
being told that the article is, say, a freshlykilled chicken.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I disagree entirely
with Dr. Wiley's statement that no matter
how hard a thing is frozen, or in what
place, it is not preserved indefinitely. We
know as a matter of fact that there was
a time, many ages ago-aeons ago-when
what is now the Arctic region was tropical.
The remains of animals that could inhabit
only a tropical country have been found
embedded in the ice. Glacial action has
taken place and these have become uncovered, and the flesh of those animals
buried in the ice a million years ago--at
least a million years ago-has been found
fresh and perfect so far as its food quality
is concerned. That is an absolute fact.
That is a scientific fact.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: No, it is not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, it is an absolutely scientific fact that in the Arctic

the importance of this thing. They may
look upon it as a trifling matter if they
are slightly old-fashioned, and not up-todate, and may not think that it is of much
importance whether there are labels on
eggs and fruit and so forth. Therefore
when a man is brought before them they
may say: "Oh, we will fine him 5 cents, or
10 cents, or 25 cents"-not enough to impress him with the fact that he has committed a serious offence in contravening
this very important health law. Therefore
I think that there should be a minimum.
If honourable gentlemen think $250 is too
much, we might cut $50 off it. But when
we consider that the men who will be adjudicating are not the judges, or trained
men at all, but country magistrates and so
forth, surely we ought to mark out a line
beyond which they should not trespass.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: As a matter of fact,
these infractions of the law would occur in
big cities and not in the rural districts
where one might find a magistrate who perhaps was not well acquainted with the law.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Oh, yes, because that
is where the cold storages are.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
my honourable friend from Sussex (Hon.
Mr. Fowler) bas made out a case. The
trend of legislation is not to fix a minimum penalty. I would cite a case in point.
There are very many technical offences in
.the case of which a judge bas to apply
the law and yet is faced by a minimum penalty. It is a very great hardship. In the
application of the Indian Act, it ýis prohibited to serve liquor to Indians, under a penalty of three months in jail as a minimum.
One day the late member for Jacques Cartier, Mr. Monk, came to my office, apparently very much aggrieved and affected
becatuse of the sentence of two hotelkeepers in Lachine, in 'his own county, to
three months in ja'il.
They were respectable fathers of families, with their children about them, and they had been condemned for giving a drink to two Caughnawaga Indians from across the river.
Witnesses had been Ibrought in to prove the
charge, and the proof was self-evident to the
judge.
They looked like white men, but
they were Indians from the reservat'ion.

consistency of that would be that the House
would not be apprised of the contents of
the report, and consequently it would be
difficult to reconcile the Bill and the report
without having a knowledge of the latter.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Not if what
I indicated had been done-if the report
had been considered by the House.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But it
seems to me that the duty is to report
upon the report before the Committee;
then on the third reading of the Bill we
shall harmonize the Bill with whatever
report may be adopted.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Honourable gentlemen I desire just to make a statement
before the Committee rises. It is in reference to what I consider a very important matter in connection with this Bill,
namely the enforcement of the Act when
adopted by Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why
not make those observations upon the third
reading of the Bill? They would be pertinent then-more pertinent then than now.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: All right; I am
satisfied.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shall the
preamble of the Bill be adopted?
The preamble was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shall the
titIe be adopted?
The title was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Not the
preamble and title of the Bill but of the
report. Shall I report the report?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As
amended.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: As amended.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I do not see why it
is not the Bill.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Because the
Bill is not before the Committee. I cannot report it. Does the Committee understand that I have asked for the adoption
of the preamble and the adoption of the
title of the Bill?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Yes.

The Committee rose and reported.
The report of the Special Committee, as
amended by the Committee of the Whole,
was concurred in.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY moved the third
reading of the Bill.
He said: I have a statement which I
would like to make to the House regarding
the enforcement of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the honourable gentleman any expectation that the
Bill will be passed in the Commons this
Session? I doubt that he can have that
expectation. I hope he may get some Commoners to take it up at the beginning of
next Session. The Senate will have performed its work, and the Commons will
have to examine the Bill anew.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I desired only
to point out the importance of placing the
administration of this Act under a departmental branch which would enforce it. The
Cold Storage Commissioner of Canada, in
the first place, bas no experience in the enforcement of a statute of this kind. In the
second place, according to his evidence, he
knows absolutely nothing about many of
the provisions covered by this Bill. In
the next place, he states that it would take
$50,000 to enforce this measure. There is
at the present time, in another branch of
the same Department, a staff of men who
are highly qualified to enforce this Act.
I refer to the Meat and Canned Foods
Branch. They are specialists. If honourable gentlemen are really desirous, as I
am sure, judging from the attention they
have given to this matter, many of them
are, of seeing that this measure is enforced
properly, and without undue expense to the
country, I want to point out in a few words
how it can be done. Mr. Ruddick stated
in his evidence that he would not undertake the enforcement of this law for less
than $50,000; but, as I have stated, we
have in the Department of Agriculture another branch which is well equipped for
this purpose-the Meat and Canned Foods
Branch under Dr. Torrance. That branch
has a large staff, comprising, I think, about
250 men, and among that number there
are about 125 trained veterinaries. These
men are highly qualified to detect any unwholesomeness or imperfection in food. I
understand that in Mr. Ruddick's branch he
has under him only two inspectors who go
about the country; so, apparently, there is
absolutely no inspection under the Cold
Storage Commissioner. I think most of
his time is devoted to the cheese business.
It would be in my opinion a great mistake
to place the administration of an Act like
this in the hands of a man who is so pre-

,ý

judiced against it. He has stated distinctly
that he 'sees no reason for a measure of
this kind; that there should be no interference with the cold storage system, which
he knows from end to end. Well, in my
opinion, according to his evidence, he knows
absolutely nothing about haif the cold storage eystem of Canada.
Just let me read a letter which I have
received from the office of the Veterinary
Director General:
Ottawa, June 14th, 1922.
Dear Senator Bradbury,
In compliance with your request by teiephone,
for information relative to the scopL of Inspection carried on by officers off the Meat and
Canned Foods Division on fond products coming
within their purview, I might state that the
supervision is complete in every detail.
For your information, 1 am enclosing a copy
of a certificate, used on shipmnerts of meats
and meat food products.
You wiii notice that every phase off inspection
is covered ; such as examination for disease, the
hand*ling, the storing. freedom from noinur, preservatives or adulteration in any form that
would render it unwhoiesome or unit for humnan
fond.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Yor obedient servant,
Robt. Barnes,
for Veterinary Director General.

When Dr. Ruddick was examined under
oath he stated that these men only examined for disease; and when Dr. Daniel
put the question: "Only for disease?" he
said: "Yes, only for disease." But it comes
out in this letter that they examine every
bit of ment that has the Government stamp
on it as a guarantee that it is wholesome.
It ie examined only when it is for interprovincial or export trade. I say that this
Bill should be put under the control of
this branch of the Agricultural Department. When that is done we shall have
some guarantee that its provisions are
being properly enforced by competent men.
I have another letter which I think 1
had better put on record for future reference. It is dated June 13th, 1922, and is
as follows:
Dear Senat-or Brad'bury:
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt
off your letter off the I Oth inst., addressed to Dr.
Barnes, in which you request information relative to the system of inspection carried on by
nificers of The Meat and Canned Fondis Division,
and also, if, in the event off the Coid Storage
Bill at present before the House becoming law,
our present staff couid administer samie without
en.tailing any large excess off expenditure.
In repiy I would state that, at the present
time, the staff consists of approximately 275
inspectors, off which 157 are graduates In
Veterinary 'Science, the balance being Lay
Inspectors, acting under direct supervision.
The activities off this Division, extend frnm
coast to coast, the work carried on being of

both economic and hygienic Importance. Ail
products coming within the purview off
The
Meat and Canned Foods Act and the Regulations, namely, meats and meat food products,
fruits, vegetables and milk, and their products, which have been canned, ljottled evaporated, and dried, or ntherwise preserved for food,
receive its attention.
As to meats and their produots, I might state
that our men *are situated in ail establishments
where such are handied and stored for excport,
either intenprovincial or out of the country. The
inspection consists of ante mnortem and post
mnortem examination of ail the meat animais,
foii.owed by close supervision over var1ous p)rocesses sanie undergo prior to being sh:pped out
for human consumption.
This, you no doubt are aware, would cover the
different processes of manufacture, together
with the storing andi proper care of saine. in
order that it may be 'placed on the market in a
soun d, wholesome condition and fit for human
consuntption.
As to the other products, such as preserved
fruits and vegetabies, and milk, and their prodocte, I would say that ail plants ergaged in the
manufacture of samne, and whicli desire to export either out off the province or out of the
country, are under the supervision of this Dlvision's inspectors, the requiremenýts of the law
being such, that samne is imperative.
In connection with the above, I might state
that the inspectors directly respousible for the
enforcing of The Meat and Canned Foods Act
are men that have been trained along scientiflo
uines and since graduating have concentrated ail
their efforts to the sphere off food inspection,
and sanitary science. For instantce, in meats
etc.. the first point would be the examination
for disease conditions: secondly, their care.

As to the other products eoming within the
purview of the Act, they are made to comply
with the rigid inspection as required by law.
Incidenýtiy, I might add that in fruits and
vegetabies, standards have been set and are
enforced, the label in ail cases showing the
quaiity.
The inspection of imports of I' odýs as outiine'd by the Regulations, is aiso carried out
by this Division, înspectors being stationed at
au the different centres and work in conjonction with the Customs authorities, in order that
nothin-g but innocoous food materiai, which
in every way imeets the retjoiremients may be
permitted inmb the country.

This is the important part of the letter:
As to whether or ot our presert staff could

providing it becomes an Act of Parliament, 1
*may say that if it were deemed advisabie in the
interests of eoonmY and also de'partmental

the officers of The Meat and Canned Fondýs
Division, it could be put loto operation almost
immediately witholit any large increase of staff
or any great expenditure if money.
Your sincereiy,
F. Torrance.
Veterinary Director General.

I place that letter on record for the
purpose of drawing the attention of the
Governmetnt to the fact that the provisions of the Bill can be enforced by a

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.
ANIMAL CONTAGIQUS DISEASES
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 62, an Act to nmend
the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
He said: Honourabie gentlemen, Parliament bas frem time to time fixed a
maximum amount of compensation to be
paid to owners of animais that have been
sinughtared under this Act. During recent
years the maximum has been grndually
incrensed because the value of the animais
in the market has incrensed. It has now
been deemed proper to reduce the cernpensation to a figure which would ha
justified by the prasent price of the
animais and to revert te the figures of
1918.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What compensation
is paid? The Government does flot pay the
whole of that monay?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, it gives
two-thirds of the amounts mentioned. My
honourahia friand will see in the Bill:
-such value shall fot exceed, In the case of
grade animais. oe hundred and fifty dollars for
eaeh horse, sixty dollars for each head of
cattle, and fifteen dollars for each pig or sheep;
and in the cas 'e of pure bred animals, ithree
hundred dollars for each horse, one hundred
and fIfty dollars for aach head of camte and
fifty dollars for each pig or sheep.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What is done
with the carcases of tha animais that are
sinughtered?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They are

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is anything dona
to have them destroyed? For instance,
suppose a miiking cow is slaughtered because she shows traces of tubercuiosis,
and it is thought that the use of ber miik

owner sali the carcasa?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Vary oftan it is

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do the authoritias
hold that the flash of an animal which, by
reason of being tainted with tuberculosis,
cannot ha used for milking purposas, is
fit for human consumption?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think it makes a

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
is the rule adoptad by the Dapartment?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: When wa go
into Committee I shall ha able to give that
information to my honourabia friands. I
know the carcase is laft with the ownar
for salvage, but there must be mnchinery
by which the Inspector can see to the disposai of the sinughterad animal if thara
is danger to hath.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wouid
my honourabie friand nsk the proper officer
to furnish him with a comprehensiva statement as te, how this Act is enforced, both
as te the animal itsalf and to the flash.
Hon. Mr. WATS ON: I know that animais that have been sinughtered are often
soid in the butcher's shop. The test for
tubercuiosis is appiied by the inspecter,
and if the animal raacts it is disensed for
breeding purposes and is sinughtered; but
a reaction vary often takes pince in an

culosis, which is one of the greatest scourges
we have in this country.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I was just going
to remark that I am rather sorry that the
Department has seen fit to reduce the
amount to be paid for cleaning up herds.
A very active campaign bas been carried
on against glanders, and large expenditures have been made. Last year we had
practically got rid of glanders from the
Atlantic to the Pacifie and I think only
about $30,000 was spent. I regret that
the Government is reducing the amount for
cleaning up the herds. The lower price
of cattle may be a reason for reducing this
amount, but the people who -own the cattle
will not be as anxious as they were to clean
up their herds, which, except in the killing,
is a voluntary matter. Most people in
Manitoba with pure-bred herds are cleaning them up.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Many stock men
would have been glad to have had them
all killed last year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The larger
payment increases the tendency not to take
care of the herd. It is not a payment for
the animal, but is to compensate the owner
for the loss he suffers, and to give him a
chance to re-establish himself and reorganize a new herd.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
heard that frequently it is an adequate
payment for the animal itself.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have just
hurriedly looked over the Act itself,
chapter 75 of the Revised Statutes, and
to my horror I find that there is no provision for disposing of these tainted animals. As the honourable gentleman from
Sussex (Hon. Mr. Fowler) has pointed out,
they might be a source of great danger.
Under the circumstances I think my honourable friend should consider the advisibility of adding something to the Bill.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: As a matter
of fact, they do dispose of the carcases.
They have to destroy them. The course
generally adopted, particularly with pigs,
is to burn them. I have had occasion to
be interested in animals disposed of in
that way, and they were certainly disposed
of by regulation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Apparently my honourable friend diýd not
strike the right inspector.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think the

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He can insure his
herd, as he insures his barn.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why
should the Government compensate him
and not compensate another man who has
lost his herd through accident or otherwise? It is -a risk that every man takes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: We all have
to take the risk of accident; but when a
herd becomes infected through no fault of
the owner, and the Government, through
its inspector, destroys the animals, the
owner should be paid the full value, and
it should not be left to some inspector to
fix the amount. As the law is now, the
inspector says that an animal is worth
so much money and fixes an arbitrary
figure. The result is that the owner bas
no recourse, but bas to take the price
offered or nothing.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Would the honourable gentleman have the owner fix the value
himself?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, I would
have it fixed by some independent person.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is not the inspector independent?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would have
the owner appoint a veterinary surgeon and
the inspector appoint another, and if they
could not agree I would have them call in
a third.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And have a lawsuit, and call you in as counsel.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
would be no incentive to the owner to maintain a clean herd.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I be permitted to qualify what I said a moment
ago? I find there is in the Act a clause
which deals particularly with the subject,
but to my mind it is wholly inadequate.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:The Director directs
the disposal of them.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think there is
a distinction to be drawn between the

DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL

Hon. Mr. WATSON: The line is drawn
on the condition of the animal.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 92, an Act to
amend the Dominion Elections Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill has for its object the remedying of a
defect which appeared in the Act when it
was applied at the last election. The
elector must register before a certain date
prior to nomination day. If he leaves the
riding in which he has registered he loses
his right to vote in that riding, and has
no right to vote in the other riding to
which he goes to reside. Many such cases
occurred at the last election, and the purpose of this amendment is to remedy the
difficulty. The new clause reads
as
follows:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The test is one
with regard to tuberculosis.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That is ail.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The cattle may
be destroyed for a dozen other reasons.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes.
Hon Mr. BELCOURT: The honourable
member from Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr.
Watson) refers to only one case, but there
may be a dozen others, and there seems to
be no provision in regard to those other
cases.

was read the second time.
ADMIRALTY BILL
SEOOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 123, an Act to, amend
the Admiraity Act.
He said: Honourabie gentlemen, the
purpose of this Bill is to authorize the

in wbich the Registrar refuses to appoint
a deputy for a certain district. He wants
to retain bis jurisdiction over that district.
It is deemed to be in the interest of the
administration of justice that a deputy
sbouid be appointed. The Governor in Council, under this amendment, wiil decide when
there sbould be a deputy registrar or a
deputy judge appointed. Heretofore the
Registrar bad the rigbt to appoint bis deputy and tbe judge to appoint a deputy
judge. That jurisdiction will be taken away
froin tbem and transferred to the Governor in Couneil.

in the statute:

Judge in Admiralty, with the approval of thue

AIR BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 136, an Act to amend
the Air Board Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill is to authorize the Governor in Council to prescribe the compensation payable for death or injury directly
resulting from a flight undertaken in the
course of duty:
6A. The Governor in Council may make regulations prescribing the compensation to be paid,
the persons to whon and the manner in which
such compensation snall be payable, for the
death or injury resulting directly from a flight
undertaken in the course of duty in the public
service of Canada of any person employed in
the public service of Canada, or emuloyed under
the direction of any Department of the public
service of Canada: Provided, however, that
such regulations shall not extend te the payment
of compensation for any death or injury in
respect of which provision for the payment of
compensation or a gratuity or cens'on is made
by any other Act, unless the claimn-nt elects to
accept the said compensation, instead of the
compensation, gratuity or pension under any
such other Act.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend be good enough to
advise the House, when this matter comes
before the Committee, as to the extent of
the operations of the Air Board? Some
little time ago we established the Air Board
on a rather expensive basis. It has been
felt during the last year or two that it
should be eut down considerably. I do not
know to what extent the present Government is following the policy of reduction
or retrenchment which was some time ago
adopted.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

will give a good idea.

The Estimates

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
very desirable that that policy should be
pursued.

ADMIRALTY BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
XtEPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 123,
an Act to amend the Admiralty Act.
Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
On section 1-Governor in Council may
appoint a Deputy Registrar for any district or registry division:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can my
honourable friend say how many Deputy
Registrars there are in the Admiralty
Court? Are they very numerous?
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: No, they are not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I cannot
answer that question. 1 know we .have one
in Montreal. The Admiralty Judge is in
Quebec, and we have a Deputy Registrar
in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: They are not; numerous enough in Ontario.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Not
enough to go around?
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: There is nothing
in the position, unfortunately.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-appointment of Deputy
Judge; not determined by vacancy; tenure
and removal:
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: The necessity frequently arises to take summary proceedings in the Adniiral.ty Branch of the Exchequer Court between ships, in cases of
collision, or towage, or (something of that
kind, and it is very necessary that in
addition to the judge, who niay be indisposed, or may be on circuit or in somne
other position, somne person should be available before an occurrence of that kind
takes place, to whom application could be
made for seizure processes and such matters, and for the settlement of the preliminaries of an Admiralty suit. I think
that that circuit judge-or whatever he is
called-should be appointed beforçhand to
act as alternative to the Judge in Admiralty.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Honourwble gentlemen, as I understand the constitution of
a Court of Admiral.ty, the Chief Justice of
the Exchequer Court, Sir Walter Cassels,
is the Judge in Admiralty, and there is
a deputy judge in each Admiralty district.
Does this Bil contemplate that there shaîl
.be a deputy of that deputy? That is what

381

1 should infer from the explanation of the
honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Roche). Or is there to be just one
more deputy appointed? If so, where are
his headquarters to be, and over what district is he to have jurisdiction? I do not
understand the situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section il of
the Admiralty Act provides:
(1) A local juldge in Admiralty may, fromn
time ta time, with the approval of the Governor in Council, appoint a deputy judge; and
such deputy judge shall have and exercise ail
such jurisdiction, powers and authority as are
possessed by the local judge.
(2) The appointmnent of a deputy judge shall
flot be determined by the occurrence of a
vacancy In the office of the judge.
(3) A local judge in Admiralty mnay, with
the approval of the Governor in Council. at
any timne revoke the appointmnent of a deputy
judge.

This was amended 'by chapter 33 of 10-11
George V., 1920, by giving power to the
Governor in Council or a local Judge in Admirailty with ithe approval of the Gover-nor
in Council, to aippoint a. deputy judge, the
latter to exercîse the jirrisdiction, po'wers,
and au'thority that are posse-ssed by the
loical judge appointing him.
TPhe amended
Act is now sought to 'be aniended by the
withdrawal of the power given to the local.
judge, which w-as somnewhat ephemerral,

Governor in Council.
(When this proposed aimendment is 'passed the Act 'will
read:
The Governor in Council may appoint a deputy
judge in admiraIty, and such deputy judge shall
have and exercise all such jurisdiction, power,
and authority as are possessed by the local
judge.

That is the sole change.
'There has
apparently been soSS friction here and
there, or sonie diffioulty in, getting the <local
judge to appoint a deputy j'udge.

The

SENATE

amendment which was passed in 1920 gave
equal power with regard to the initiative:
The Governor in Council, or a local judge
in Admiralty with the approval of the Governor
in Council, may from time to time appoint a
deputy judge.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: You are now taking that power from the local judge and
placing it in the hands of the Governor in
Council?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Withdraving
that power from the local judge.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me the Government practically had that
power · efore, because the alpproval of the
b
Governor in Council ýwas necessary before
any validity eould 'be given to the appointment made by the local judge of his deputy.
Consequently all the Government had to
do wasHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

To proceed.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -to refuse to give its approval to the reconmendation of the 'local judge.
However, this
places the sole power of apipointment in the
Lands of the Government.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Could the 'honourable leader of the Government tell me how
nany Admiralty judges there are in Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That I cannot
tell, but we will take only one stage of the
Bill now, and at the third reading I may be
able to inform my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It appears to me
that if under this -legislation you appoint

deputy judges, who hold office during good
behaviour, you depart somewhat from the
policy of appointing judges who cannot be
removed. The judge would be absolutely
in the hands of whatever Government was
in power. I do not know whether that is a
good move or not, but it appears to me that
if there are several judges of the Admiralty

Court now and you are going to appoint
deputies who would have all the powers of
judges, you would have to pay them a good,
big annual salary.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: No; they are only
paid fees. There is nothing in the position
at all.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I had not understood that.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: The deputy wouId

judge.

Mr. DANDURAND.

look after all Admiralty work throughout

that province. In many cases quick action
is required. A collision occurs, we will say,
in or near the harbour of Halifax. Quick
action must be taken either for the purpose
of allowing the officers of the vesels, who
are to be summoned in court, to proceed on
their voyage, or for the purpose of preventing them from going out of port, or out
of the jurisdiction of the court, before
action is taken. If the Admiralty judge
happens to be ill or absent, the deputy may
act. The object of this amendment, I think,
is to provide for an emergency of that kind,
by having some person available before

whom an application may be made or proceedings taken.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
principal object of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Yes.

That is the
There is no

permanence at all to the appointment, as

regards salary.

The deputy receives no

salary; he gets only fees; and I imagine the
number of applications made before the

deputy would be very few. It would be only
occasionally that applications would be
made before him. Practically all the work
is carried on by the judge in Admiralty,
but if he should happen to be ill or incapacitated there would be somebody to act
in his place.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My impression is
that in Nova Scotia there is at the present
time not only a judge in Admiralty in

Halifax, but also a deputy judge in Admiralty in the Cape Breton district, with
jurisdiction over the eastern part of the
province. Perhaps the honourable leader of
the House would be able to inform me on

the third reading if I am correct in that,
and who is the deputy judge, if there is
one, in Cape

Breton; also how this pro-

posed -legislation will affect the tenure of
office of the deputy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend that the Solicitor
General, who introduced this legislation,
said that it was not his intention to change
the nominee for Cape Breton. I understood from his remarks that the idea was

to enlarge his district.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I suppose the
deputy in Cape Breton is probably a friend
of the Solicitor General.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But cases
have arisen in which a writ has been
asked, and it bas happened that it was just
outside the district and there was some
pressing necessity for it.

JUNE 16, 1922
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Perhaps my honourable friend will make inquiries and give
us more particulars about it when the Bill
comes up for third reading.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend from Pictou (Mr. Tanner)
will look at page 2923 and following pages
cf the House of Commons Hansard, he will
get all the information that he seeks.
The Bill was reported.
AIR BOARD BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 136,
an Act to amend the Air Board Act. Hon.
Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
On section 1-Governor in Council may
prescribe compensation payable for death
or injury, directly resulting from a flight
undertaken in the course of duty:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is an observation I should like to make,
growing in fact directly out of this Bill,
and yet not involving the consideration of
the Bill itself. I refer to the different
pension funds established by the Government, upon which we are drawing from
time to time under the miscellaneous legislation that we are passing every Session.
Now, I say advisedly that the pension funds of the Government, touching
services of offithe various public
cials, are in an unsatisfactory state.
There is no uniformity about our different
pension funds. I doubt very much if they
are established upon the same actuarial
basis. The greatest possible misapprehension exists as to their being self-sustaining, and they are left almost entirely
in the hands of the different departments
or offices interested in the benefits or advantages flowing therefrom. I doubt if
there is any other branch of our financial
business in Canada that receives so little
attention from the Department of Finance
or those responsible for the administration
of Finances That was illustrated in a
marked way a short time ago in connection with the Pension Fund of the Militia
Department. During the time I was in the
Government I repeatedly heard the statement made that that Fund was self-sustaining. If there was any comment when
applications were made from time to time

383

by different officers of the Department to
take advantage of the Pension Fund, it
was pointed out by those upon whom the
responsibility devolved that the Fund was
self-sustaining, and that the contributions
of the beneficiaries as well as those of the
Government, were sufficient to maintain
the fund. I directed the attention of the
Finance Minister from time to time to tha
desirability of looking into the pension
funds, not only of the Militia Department,
but of other departments; and upon investigation it was found that this particular fund was short of being self-sustaining by some 75 per cent, which has to be
paid out of the Exchequer. Honourablq
gentlemen will be able to appreciate how
an invasion of a very grave character can
be made upon those funds and not command any great public attention.
The actuarial basis of those funds contemplates that the beneficiary will continue
for a period of years to pay in a certain
percentage to the fund. By and by he asks
that a certain number of years be allowed
him. In that way the term of contribution
is frequently cut short by 50 per cent, and
yet the beneficiary obtains the advantages
of the fund. It seems to me that if the
Government will not assume the responsibility of establishing the pension funds
upon a uniform basis, and administering
them by some financial head instead of by
miscellaneous departmental officers who
ultimately participate in them, it will be
sustaining a very serious loss, as it has
done in the past. in my judgment there
should be a thorough investigation made
into all those funds. They should be administered by one department or one
head; a fund should not be administered
by the department specially interested in
it. Otherwise, honourable gentlemen can
readily appreciate that the tendency will
be to broaden the advantages of the funds
and to restrict to a minimum the contributions by the beneficiaries. If the Government will not assume this responsibility,
the Senate may at no distant date see its
way to appoint a Committee which will
appoint experts to thoroughly examine
those funds and ascertain where we stand
in their administration.
We have, for instance, a special fund in
the Militia Department; we have a fund
for the Northwest Mounted Police; we
have another fund. I think, for the
Dominion Police; and we have a fund for
Civil Servants. I venture to say that wa
must have eight or ten different different
pension funds, each of which is being ad-

SENATE
ministered entirely irrespective of the
others, and without any parity or uniformity or scientific basis for the superstructure upon which they should be built.
I simply direct my honourable friend's
attention to this subject, because it is involved in this Bill, and in the hope that
the Government may see its way to review
the whole financial situation relating to
pensions.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: The aeroplane business of the Militia, and I suppose of the
Naval Branch also, is a very precarious
one. The reports in the papers and in
Government records of accidents indicate
that this must be a very serious matter
to the Pension Fund. Perhaps it would
be useful for the House to consider who
gives the orders for the various experiments that are conducted. Where I live,
there was during the war and afterwards,
and is now, I think, a constant flight of
aeroplanes. I do not know whether the
circuit is laid out by any authority or
whether those making the flights prescribe
their own limitations, but it seems to me
that if this system is elaborated and
extended it will involve a very great expenditure for pension funds, because accidents involving a great amount of compensation will be very numerous. It would
perhaps be well to decide who should
prescribe the fiights of these aeroplanes,
indicating how far they should go and
what they should do, and not leave it to
be decided by the individual.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I am very glad
the honourable gentleman from Calgary
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) has brought
this matter to the notice of the Government. I think it is one well deserving of
attention. I have felt for several years
that there has been a good deal of latitude
in the granting of these pensions.
There is another phase of this question that I should like to bring to the
attention of the leader of the Government,
and that is the fact that since the war many
men who dyid not take any part in the war,
except perhaps in office work, have been
promoted and promoted and promoted-and
this, it has been openly stated, is to enable
them to retire in a year or two at a greatly
increased pension. It must be remembered,
as my honourable friend from Calgary bas
pointed out, that we pay 75 per cent of
all those extra pensions, only 25 per cent
coming from the levy that is made on the
beneficiaries while they are in office. I
think it would be very advisable for the
Government to look carefully into the matSir JAMES LOUGHEED.

ter and to see whether a great deal of
unnecessary expenditure cannot be cut off.
The Air Service, no doubt, is very valuable in time of war; but whether or not it
is advisable for us to go into the air business for civil purposes I am unable to say.
I have very grave doubts of the good that
will be accomplished by the surveying of
timber from aeroplanes. It does not seem
to me that it will be very accurate or worth
a great deal. The Air Service may be of
some advantage in locating fires, but only
by way of giving information. A year or
so will prove whether or not there are fewer
fires and less destruction of timber than
we have had in the past as a result of
keeping an expensive air service for that
purpose. I doubt very much if the saving
in standing timber will amount to anything at all, although I am not prepared
to say definitely that it will not.
However, I think that the Government
ought to go carefully and slowly in the
matter of expenditures on air service, and
that they should follow the suggestion
of the leader of the Opposition to have a
thorough investigation into the matter of
pensions, and to put them all under the
head of one responsible Minister. In that
way I am sure a great saving can be
affected.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I think the suggestion of my
honourable friend that the Government
should investigate the different pension
funds with the view of placing thein under
a central authority is a very good one.
When my honourable friend from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) put bis inquiry on the
Order Paper as to the classes of persons
other than employees of railways, and persons entitled under the Pension Act,
chapter 43 of 1919, who are entitled to
receive pensions or superannuation allowances, payable by the Government of
Canada, I asked myself if I should not
circularize all the departments of the
Government in order to obtain an answer
from each and every one of them. Then
it occurred to me that the Finance Department would perhaps be able to give
the data asked for. I simply mention this
to show that there are a number of members of this House who do not know exactly
the facts of the matter. Even the leader
of the Conservative party (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed), who has been a minister, and
who has gone from one department to
another doing the work of some of his
colleagues while they were absent, is asking whether there is a general control over

JUNE 16, 1922
these pension funds, and, if so, who has
that general control.
The Act creating
the Air Board did not give very much
authority to the Government as to the pensions or compensation that may be paid
to aviators for injuries sustained in the
Clause 5
performance of their duties.
simply ýsays:
The Air Board shall have power to employ
such officers and men under this Act as may

be authorized by the Governor
under such conditions as to discipline and pay,
as the Governor in Council may determine, and
may make such arrangements for their proper
training, housing, board, clothing and equil)ment as may be necessary and as may be ai)proved by the Governor in Council.

Under this Act an Order in Council
was passed in May, 1920, setting out the
rates of compensation for injury or death.
The authority for this Order in Council
has been questioned, and the amendrnent
now before us is proposed for the purpose
of clarifying the situation and giving a
certain authority to the Board. Here
again the question of overlapping of pensions appears. This arnendment aims to
compensate not only the aviator, but the
ernployee of sorne other department, from
the Forestry Branch, for instance, who
rnay be with him, and who rnay be killed
in the flight undertaken. But it is provided-and this was suggested, I may say,
by the ex-Minister of Finance, Mr.
Drayton:
That such regulations shall not extend to
the payment of compensation for any death
or injury in respect of which provision for the
payment of compensation or a gratuity
or
pension is made by any other Act, uniess the
claimant elects to accept the said compensation,
instead of the compensation, gratuity or pension
under any such other Act.

This proviso is to enable the injured
person or his heirs to take advantage of
the pension provided under this Act in
preference to one to which he or his heirs
would be entitled under any other Act.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Conservative party (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) has asked with regard to the
policy of the present Minister of Militia,
who will have the supervision of that
branch of the service calied the Air
Board. Last year the ýsum of $1,600,000
was expended on that branch of the service, and this year the arnount voted is
$1,000,000. He has already dismissed over
250, perhaps nearer 300, ternporary empioyees, and he wiil try to give the aviators
training for civil work that will be done
for other departments, and for such provinces as accept the service and pay the

the surveillance of forests. 1 know thal.
some of the provinces have already avaiied
themselves of the service. Aviators who
belong to the Military Branch will have
the benefit of the experience obtained in
carrying on this work.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There would
appear to be regulations under the original
act to provide compensation for empioyees
of the Air Board. 1 arn not familiar with
their effect, but I would like to know why
power is now taken to make regulations.
I do not see the necessity of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friénd wiii look at section 5 of the
Air Board Act of 1919, he will realize,
perhaps, that it was prnperly urged that
it was not wîde enough to alloW of regulations being made to cover the question
of pensions and compensation in case of
death. This amendment is to make sure
that the Board has that right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is it to cover
cases not aiready provided for by the
original Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. It would
extend to ail employees of other departments who are asked to accompany the
aviators on su-eh expeditions.
Hou. Mr. BEIjCOURT: In the performance of duties not necessarily connected
with the Air Board?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It seems to
me that this Bill is worded in such a way
as to give a right which, from the reading
of it, I wouid suppose the Government ail.
ready. had. It is to provide compensation.
From section 5, however, it is clear, that
that power does not exist. The wording
is peculiar. The section before us says:
The Governor in Council may uîake regulations prescribing the compensation to be paid.

I understand that section 5 does flot give
power to grant compensation. The reading
of this Bill infers that the power does
exist, and that we are simpiy providing
for the passage of regulations.
Arn I
right?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I must take
the statement of the Minister who, introduced the Bill as to the reason which
actuated him, and the reason which he
gives is that the Order in Council passed
in May, 1920, setting out the compensations for injury or death was passed under
that section 5, and that the authority has
EDITION

386

SENATE

been questioned. I understand quite well
why the authority should be questioned.
I have considerable doubt that such an
Order in Council could be passed under
the authority of section 5, and it is because
section 5 is too restricted that this enabling
amendment is now sought.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: As I understand, from the honourable leader's reading
of that section, there is no authority to
grant compensation such as has been spoken
of. It does not seem to me that this
section is going to confer that authority.
It presupposes that the authority to grant
compensation exists, and its purpose is
merely to provide for regulations.
In dealing with this section I would like
to know if in the other branches of the
Government service any provision is mad,
for compensation for injury to various
employees. For instance, we are now in the
railway business, in which a great many
employees are under Government control
Are they paid compensation for accidents
which happen during the course of their
ordinary work, or is this something or,
side of what is granted or allowed in the
other branches of the public service?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is the Workmen's Compensation Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course,
there are various funds, as bas been explained by my honourable friend the
leader of the Conservative party in this
Chamber; but any Act which would operate
in favour of a victim in an air expedition
will be superseded only if the party injured
elects to come under the Act which we are
now amending. He may prefer to remain
under the Act governing his department,
if he finds it advantageous to do so. The
Pension Act relating to the Civil Service
makes no provision for compensation for
injury:

it

provides

only

for retirement.

Inasmuch as flying is perilous work, this
measure will allow the injured party who
bas been asked to accompany an aviator,
and who belongs to another department, to
obtain the same advantages as would accrue to the aviator himself.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Is this work
any more perilous than driving an engine
on a railway? I should not think so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That bas of
course nothing to do -ith this Act; but
I know that the Canadian Pacific and the
Grand Trunk have funds which provide
compensation in case of injury or death.
Hon. Mr. DANDU'RAND.

I do not know whether there were such
funds in the Canadian Northern, but I suppose it had similar arrangements. As to
the Government railways or the Intercolonial, I cannot say at present.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: They have a
pension Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They have a
pension fund also.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But this is
not a pension Bill, as I understand it. This
is to enable the Government to make direct
payment to men employed in this particular service. The Acts to which my
honourable friend has just referred have
no bearing, so far as I can see, because
they are pension Acts. We all know that
pension funds are secured and maintained
in a certain way, the individuals paying a
proportion to the Government or the railways as the case may be. This, as I
understand it, is a proportion entirely outside of the ordinary pensions, which have
really nothing to do with it.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: May I ask, has any
compensation for accidents been paid by
the Government under any Act up to the
present time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The same
question was put to the Minister, and he
cited one case, concerning the death of
Major Holland, whose family received
$7,500 under the Order in Council of May,
1920.
Hon. Mr. BLAIN: Was that the only
case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They received, besides, under the Soldiers' Insurance Act, the sum of $5,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
my honourable friend from Huron (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot) is right as to the defect
which he has pointed out. In the Air
Board Act, of which the present Bill is an
amendment, there does not seem to be any
power given to the Government to fix any
compensation whatsoever.
It does not
deal with the question of compensation,
and the Bill before us deals only with the
question of regulations, presupposing that
the Air Board Act gives power to make
compensation. It is quite clear that if the
primary power is not given to the Government there is nothing to regulate. So it
seems to me that if it is desirable to fix
compensation the
Government
should
under this Bill take authority to compensate and also to pass regulations.

JONE 16, 1922
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Possibly the
words in this Bill would be sufficient to
create the power. It says:
The Governor In Council may take regulatiens prescribing the compensation to be paid.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
may I direct the attention of my honourable friend to line 15, by which, as he will
see, the restricted meaning must necessarily be questioned upon this Bill, because
it says: "Provided, however, that such regulations shall not extend te the payment
of compensation," and so on. It
is
clearly a regulation, that is all.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It does not seem
te me that those words help us at all, because their object is merely to state that
the individual shall not get double compensation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; it
shows that this is simply a regulation.
That is the point.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am quite free
to admit that if I had had the d'rafting of
that section I would have given the
power first, and then determined the manner of exercising it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
that should be specific.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps the
point is worth examining carefully. When
trying to find in clause 5 the right exercised
by the -Government in May, 1920, I had some
dificulty, and I quite realize the importance of this amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Certainly
section 5 does not deal with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will ask that
the Committee rise and report progress.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before my honcurable friend does that-if we are going te
be logical let us be logical te the end. I
understand that 'compensation has been
raid in one case, at least.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
Hol}and case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In the Holland
case, under section 5, whikh we all now
realize did not authorise it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A validating Act may be required.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: So I hope that
when this Bill comes up again, it will contain some provision preserving the liability
of the Crown in any case of damages that
might arise.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING POSTPONED
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill P3, an Act te amend

Hon. Mr BELOOURT moved that the
order be discharged and piaced on the
Order Paper for Thursday next.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I pointed out to ny honcurable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) a
few days ago the.desirability of the Government taking control of a Bill of this
kinîd.
It is a public Bill.
It has to do
with security of hife and property on a
very large scale.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What does the
Bill provide for?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It provides for
the limitation of the area within which
a magazine may be located.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It provides for licensing.
The marginal note
reads:
Factories and magazines licensed after this

subsection comes into force net te be within
two miles of any other buildings.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does that restrict or enlarge the area?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It enlarges the
forbidden area.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It apparently places a restriction upon the issuance of licenses.
Still it involves such
very important considerations that I think
the Government should take charge of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I took up the
matter with the Deputy Minister of Mines
and the chief of the branch of the Department concerned, and they suggested
that this Bill, if given second reading, should be sent to a Standing Committee or a Special Committee, so that they
might have the privilege of giving their
views. I have had a lengthy interview
with them, and it was my intention to
suggest that the Bill be sent to the Private
Bills Committee if it passed the second

SENATE

reading. The honourable Senator for Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Boyer) has realized that
the Bill cannot go on the statute book this
session, and I think he is hesitating about
inoving the second reading. That'is why
1 suggest that the Order be deferred to
Thursday next. The Bill may then be
dropped for this Session.

~,and

be said: I took occasion when notice of
this, motion was given to point out that

this a'mencLment would bring our rules intbo
hiarmony with those of the bouse of Comnions. The botuse of Commons would deal

JUNE 19, 1922
with a Divorce Bill as a Private Bill, and
its rules with reference to Private Bills
require an advertisement to appear for a
period of only five weeks.
I also pointed out, and I feel very convinced in making the statement, that no
good purpose is served while unnecessary
expense is caused by the requiring of three
months advertising in two public newspapers. The class of people who come
before the Divorce Committee are not
wealthy; almost invariably they corne from
either the very poor dlass or the class in
very moderate circumstances, and in many
cases application is made and satisfactory
evidence is submitted to the Committee,
upon which they feel justified in remitting
much of the expense which has been incfrred in prosecuting petitions for divorce.
Furthermore, there is the fact, which is of
even more importance, that in all these
cases the parties are served personally with
the papers requiring them to appear before
the Committee. It would be almost analogous to say that the plaintiff in a suit
shéuld not only serve the defendant with
a writ of summons, but should advertise
in the public press for three months that
he was going to sue the defendant. It is
entirely superfluous, and as it involves an
absolutely unnecessary expense we can
very well dispense with that procedure in
the future. I will read the rule in question. It is number 136:
Every applicant for a Bill of Divorce shall
give notice of his or ber intended application,
and shall specify therein from whom or for
what cause such divorce Is sought, and shall
cause such notice to be published during at
least three months before the consideration by
the Committee on Divorce of hi, or her petition for the said Bill, in the Canada Gazette
and in two newspapers published in the district
in Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Briti;h Columbia or the Northwest Territories,
or in the county or union of counties in other
provinces, wherein such applicant usually
resided at the time of the seperation of the
parties; but if the requisite number of papers
cannot be found therein, then in an adjoining
district or county or union of counties.

We only change the requirements so that
the notice shall appear once a week for a
period of five weeks instead of for a period
of three months.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You do not lessen
the time of the notice that is to be given
to the respondent?
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, not
as to that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend know why at the time these
rules were made there was this difference

389

between a Divorce BI1 and an ordinary
Private Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
very largely traditional. When I came
here the time was six months, and when
the rules were revised, it was reduced to
three months.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why was there
a difference?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Because
it was thought to be a very much more
solemn proceeding. We are familiarising
ourselves with this proceeding to such an
extent that we have to get down to an
every day basis. When the rules were re-

vised we rarely had more than half a dozen
cases each Session, but they have increased

now to about 150 each Session, there is no
little diffeulty in arranging a sitting because we cannot fix a day for the hearing
of the case until the expiration of the
three months. Consequently if the first

step in securing a Bill of Divorce should
be taken a month before Parliament 's
called, Parliament would be sitting two
months before the petitioner could present
his petition.
The next rule dealt with is subsection
5 of rule 139, which reads as follows:
If the respondent desires to oppose the granting of the divorce and to be heard by the

Senate Comnmittee on Divorce, tie respondent
must send a notice to that effect to the Clerk
of the Senate at the Parliament Buildings,
Ottawa, within two nonthe from the date of
service upon the respondent, and muet In the
notice to the C¶erk of the Senate give:

Certain particulars. Honourable gentlemen can very well see that by the time the
three months and the two months expire,
it is very difficult in a three or four months'
Session to deal with many applications.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You are not changing the three months?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. We
are shortening the notice of opposition
from two months to thirty days, and we
are shortening the time of advertising in

the newspapers in the first instance from
three months to five weeks. These are the
only changes we ask the House to endorse.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If these notices that are necessary are
legally given to all parties to the divorce
suit, what is the reason for any advertising
at all?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is a kind of fiction that the public should

SENATE
be made aware of the proceedings which are
taken before the Divorce Committee of the
Senate. There is really no necessity for
it. As I said the other day, it is a work of
supererogation, so to speak, because the
papers are served on all the parties. It
would be just as sensible to ask a plaintiff
issuing a writ to advertise to the world
that he was suing the defendant.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not yet quite
understand about the notice to the respondent. If it is now three months I think
that is quite short enough.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
does not deal with the notice at all.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does it affect the
notice?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It does
not affect the notice at all except the
notice of the defence. If the respondent is
going to contest the petition, he or she
must do it within thirty days instead of
within two months.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Thirty days after
service?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
thirty days after service.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why not thirty
days before hearing?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
gives them plenty of time to make all
preparations.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That does shorten
the time for the respondent, then?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the
respondent is not concerned in the three

months. The respondent, upon the service
of the petition, if he or she intends to contest the case, must at the present time

file notice within two months. Applications are being held up to-day and cannot be heard because the two months have
not elapsed.
We ask that the time of
notice of opposition be thirty days instead

of two months.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It seems to me
that that is a hardship upon the respondent. He has not as much time at his
disposal as he has at present.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, he
has thirty days less.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why should you

the applications that come before it. Let
me illustrate. Say a petition was served
seven weeks ago. The respondent would
have a week yet in which to file the notice
of opposition. That precludes the Committee from dealing with the case, because
we cannot fix a date for the hearing until
that time is up. After the thirty days are
up the respondent will have ample time,
because he or she can appear before the
Committee after that time, and will be
consulted in fixing the date for the hearing of the petition.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do you not permit
a respondent to go in and give evidence
even though there was no notice filed?
Would not a man have a right to defend
himself?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
very much like an appearance being filed
in answer to a writ of summons. The
respondent must indicate in some way
that he intends to contest the case. The
hands of the Committee are tied until
those two months expire and there is no
indication on the part of the respondent
as to whether or not he intends to contest
the case or to let it go by default.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I observe
to my honourable friend and to the House
that his answer to the question which I
put to him does not satisfy me. My honourable friend says that the distinction
between a Divorce Bill and all other Private Bills is purely a matter of fiction.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
did not say that at all.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understood it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. My
honourable friend from Ottawa asked why
it was necessary, if the papers were personally served upon all the parties to the proceedings, that there should appear notices
in the press advertising the intention of
the petitioner to apply for a bill of divorce,
and I said that this was largely a fiction
which had obtained for many years.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I thought I did
not altogether misunderstand my honourable friend. I think he rather confirms the
impression which his remarks had made
on me.
This may not be a very grave
matter, but what I want to point out is
that originally there was a distinction.

put that hardship upon him or upon her?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Between
what?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: So as
to permit of the Committee dealing with

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A distinction in
the time required for notices.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

JUNE 19, 1922
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: With regard to
divorce on one hand and Private Bis on
the other. 1 take it that a body like the
Senate, even in the remote days to which
my honourable friend has alluded, did flot
tio things without sorne reason. There was
some occasion or some reason, good or bad,
which induced the Senate to make this distinction. My honourable friend has told us
that when hie first entered this House the
period was, six months, and that later it
was reduced to three months. It is stili
three months. I do think that this is flot
purely and exclusively a matter of fiction,
and I want to indicate why in several respects it is not so. The distinction was
reasonable because of the difference between an ordinary Private Bill-and I include them ail-on the one hand, and a
Divorce Bill on the other. There are these
three reasons. First of ail, the purpose
was to prevent collusion. It was thought
that in order to prevent collusion a longer
time 'wouid be required. The second reason
-I was flot present at the time, but I can
imagine the reason, and I can see no other
reason for it-was that there are not only
immediate parties to the divorce petition
who are interested in it; the children may
also be interested. These children may be
living in a foreign country. They have a
direct, immediate, and probably very large
interest in an application of that kind. It
was in order that they-that everybody
înterested-rnight know that such an application was before Parliament. Last, but
not least, I think society bas an interest
in every divorce petition that cornes before
this House. Society at ail times and in
ail civilized countries bas an interest in the
family tie. Society everywhere is interested in seeing that the family is not
broken up. I need not go over the whole
ground. 1 arn sure it must be obvious to
every honourable member of this House, as
well as to persons outside that society bas
an important and direct interest in maintaining the family tie. Apart altogether
from the religious aspect, I consider divorce
a social calamity, and for my part I arn
not prepared to give xny voice in support
of anything which wili make divorce easier
or cheaper.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Where
courts have jurisdiction to grant divorceas in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British
Columbia, and every other province of this
Dominion except Ontario and Quebec, and

39'

also in England-is there any notice required to be published in the papers?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know.
They have the responsibility for their own
actions. We have the responsibiiity for
what we do here, and I feel responsible
for the stand I take.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I desire
to ask xny honourable friend this questonas a l.awyer he will understand how pertinent it is. Will the honourable gentlemian
point out to the House in what way the
family, or societyOr children.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -- or in
,What way the children would affeot either
the refusai or the granting of a divorce?
These divorce proceedings are conducted
upon evidence, not upon sentimental
grounds, and the case is disposed of -in
precisely the sanie way as would a case
in a judicial tribunal, upon the facts stated
The introduction of the family, or of the
children, or of society, would snot in any
way influence the Oornmittee.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, unless they
had some evidence would be of more or
less value to the Committee on coming
to a conclusion. I arn quite free to admit
that the evidence of cbldren of three,
four, or five years of age would be of no
use whatever; but I can conceive that the
interest of some members of the familynot necessarily children-might very properly be offered to the Cornmittee, and that
such evidence might considerably affect
the Cornrittee's decision. I submît that
every opportunity should be given to the
Cornrittee to bear, not merely certain evidence, but ail evidence that might bear on
the subjet. Surely my honourable friend
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) will agree to
that proposition. My honourable friend
cannot dissent from that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
given now.
li1on. Mr. BFLCOURT: It is given now,
but you want to reduce the possihility of
that evidence being given.
Hon.,Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Well, why reduce the tirne, if not for that?
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
fact of the matter is, I remember the tinie
when it was necessary to give six months'
notice in the press of a private Bill. The

392

SENATE

time for advertising private Bills has likewise been reduced.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
Honourable
gentlemen, the best answer to the statement
just made by my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) is the tact
that, although divorce proceedings havr
been going on here for a great many
years, and the petitions have been advertised for the length of time stated, we
have not yet found any person interested, so
far as the public is concerned, who has
come forward for the purpiose of opposing
an application. The only object I know of
for advertising is to let the public
know that the divorce is being applied for.
and, if . ny person knows that there is collusion or any other special reason why a
divorce shoul-d not be granted, he has an
opportunity to come before the Committee
and show it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It may be that
the time is too short, and that that is why
such persons have not come.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: By the third
month people pay no attention to .the
notices. I think that is the idea. And
where personal service of the petition takes
place, I can for my part see no reason or
object for advertising at all, in view of the
experience of the Divorce Committee and
the Acts that have been passea by this
House ever since Parliament commenced
to grant divorces. Take the ordinary
action at law. My honourable friend knows
that in the province of Ontario a person
served with a writ of summons has ten
days within which to appear, and if he
does not appear within that time, then certain other proceedings are taken.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; the court
may grant him relief from that. If he
has failed to appear within the time, and
the writ comes to his notice later, he may
get relief.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Undoubtedly
the same thing would apply to the Divorie
Committee. If any respondent, before the
case is actually tried and disposed of,
comes to the Committee with the statement that for some reason or other he
has not had an opportunity of putting in
his defence, and wants more time, there is
no difficulty in his securing an extension
of time. The Committee, in carrying on
its work, acts in practically the same way
as a court conducting a trial of a lawsuit.
Therefore, so far as I can see, my honSir JAMES LOUGHEED.

ourable friend is in error when he
imagines that the notice is of any benefit
to the public or that so far any one has
ever taken advantage of it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not intend to discuss the question of the notice
that should be published of the application for divorce. Two views have been
expressed: one by the honourable the
senior member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt)
and the other by the honourable leader on
this side (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) and
the Chairman of the Divorce Committee
(Hon. Mr. Proudfoot). But, with reference to the notice of opposition to be put
in by the respondent, I think that the reduction of the time from two months to
one is a desirable change. The real advantage of that change has been pointed
out by the honourable leader on this side
of the House. The work of the Committee may be held up by a period of two
months being allowed for the purpose of
putting in a defence. Inasmuch as the
rule at present provides that the responlent must " within two months from the
date of the service of the notice of the
application," etc., the case cannot be proceeded with until the expiry of that two
months. The work of the Committee is
therefore retarded. I think all members
who have had anything to do with the
Divorce Committee will agree that nothing
should be placed in the way of the Committee that would retard its work, which
is sufficiently onerous. Taking the view
of the Committee without having consulted
it, I may tell the House that where the
respondent has sent in to the Clerk as intimation that a defence was to be put in,
whether the intimation was received
within the two months or not, the Committee bas not refused a hearing of the
defence in any case; and even if the rule
is amended so as to reduce the period to
one month, the Committee would be only
too willing to hear any respondent, man
or woman, who came after that period
with a bona fide intention of resisting the
divorce. The effect of the rule as it
stands at the present time is simply to
prevent a more prompt disposition by
the Committee of its work. In my judgment, if the amendment is made, the respondent coming forward with what appears to be a valid defence to the petition
would suffer in no case, whether the notice
of defence was given within the prescribed
time or not.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourablegent'emen, may I venture to suggest a reason

JUNE 19, 1922
which we in the Province of Quebec stili
find important in cases, not of divorce, but
of separation fromn bed and board, as to,
why a long notice should be given, and

some obstacle thrown in the way of decrees
being granted.

The reason is that, in the

like to know that. Rule 137 says:

the foundation of society; and therefore
when they saw the menace of the breaking
up of a home and the dispersion of a family
with ail the effect, harmful to society that
would f ollow in its wake, every possible
means was taken to cause a delay which
would allow the parties W reflect. It is
necessary to give three months' notice. In

So personal notice has to be at least two

That is a reason that induces our

Church in the province of Quebec to refuse
the separation and attempt to do ail it can
to, bring bot~h parties together again. Is
not that one of the reasons why, in the

provinces in which courts have jurisdiction
over divorce, there is at the samne time a
law declaring that the divorce shail not
become effective for a certain period after
the decree is granted? Is it not because
there is, as it were, a hope that sui.
arrangement, seme compromise, some forgiveness, some conference between the
parties, may take place which will prevent
the serious injury not only to the f amily
but to society in general? I think that the
saine reason that dictated that Iaw exists
to-day. We forget it, honourable gentleaien, because the applications for divorce
-are now showering upon us, an-d our hands
are pretty full in disposing of themn. These
divorces are a menace to the foundations of
society, and we should use every fair nieans
we can to prevent divorces being granted
as they are being granted to-day, by the
dozens and the hundred.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, there is one difficulty that 1 see in
this matter. Perhaps it may be easily explained. If the amendmaent is adopted,
what are you going to, do with rule 137?
It appears to me that it would also have to
be amended. Under this rule the respondent gets not less than two months' notice
before the petition is heard by the Conmmittee. I may be wrong; I amn not a lawyer;
but this is the way it strikes me, and 1

Hon. Mr. DANIEL; Then how will the
respondent get two months' notice if the
rule is changed so as to require only one
month in'stead of three months?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the

the respondent is to put in his notice of

DISEASES

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE, REPORTED,
AN.D PASSED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dand7urand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 62, an
Act to ame 'nd the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
I would like
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to give the Senate the information which
was sought when this Bill was being read
the second time. The question was asked
as to the disposai of the carcases of the
animais that are slaughtered. The answer
which I am authorized to make is:
When animals are slaughtered under the
Accredited Herd Plan or Municipal Tuberculoais Order, slaugthter occurs under the
supervision of an inspector, either at an
abattoir under Federal inspection, or at a
private slaughter house, or, if necessary, on
Practically ail the
the farm premises.
inspectors engaged in this work have
passed through the Meat Inspection Division, and are acquainted with the practice
and requiremenlts of the regulations goveraing the inspection of meats. As a result
of the inspection made at the time of
slaughter the inspector advises the owner
as to disposition of the carcass. In case

of condemnation in an abattoir under
Federal inspection, the regular procedure
is followed as provided for such cases. In
the other cases the inspector is respoinsible
for disposai of the carcass usually by 'burying or burning.
This question is asked: Do the authorities hold that the fiesh of an animal whioh
by reason of being tainted with tuberculosis cannot be used for milking purposes,
is fit for human consumption!
The answer is that the tuberculin test
merely indicates the presence of tuberculosis. There is at present no way of
knowing fromn the reaction given to the test
to what extent, or in what condition tubercuiosis is present in .the animal body.
Animais showing any reaction to the test
are slaug'htered, but it is quite possible that
the meat from, any of these animais is fit
for human consumption. The finding of
the inspector as to disposition, is based
upon the extent and condition of the tubercular lesions found in the carcass upon
postmortem inspection. It is impracticable
to make a ýhard and fast rule whieh will
apply in every case, or to state definitely
the -point at which the disease becomes
The
noxious, or the fiesh unwholesome.
disposition of the carcass of an animal
affected with tuberculosis must, therefore.
be left to the judgment of the inspector.
In arriving at a decisien he is guided by
research which establishes the fact that
certain principles. These are based upon
certain inicrolbiological conditions have corresponding microscopie appearances. Consequently, an inspector is infiuenced by the
stage of the disease exhibited, as well as
by its extent.
As to the question: Is the flesh infected
more than the milk? the answ-r is:
That is impossible to say unless indication is given in specific cases as to the
location and character of the lesions. The
meat when passed for human consumption
is always protected by the fact that it is
cooked previous to use, 'wihile in the case
of milk such protection is only afforded
where pasteurization plants exist. Simple
boiling will ýdestroy tuberle, bacilli in
fifteen minutes.
As to whether oontaminated ecarcasses are
allowed to be sold if the disease is not bad,
it should be noted that the detection of
tuberculosis by the tuberculin test does
not necessarily mean that the carcass is
"contaminated." For exainple, the tuberculin test frequently gives a reaction when
tuberculosis is presen-t in an exceedingly

SE NATE
small spot, perhaps in the lung. This spot
while being actually the result of tubercular infection, may be in a calcified or dry
condition. The damage resulting to the
carcass in such a case is negligible,' especially when the fact of subsequent cooking is considered.
During the debate on the second reading
it was stated that every day there are
animais butchered which are infected with
tuberculosis, but not sufficiently to affect
health or the wholesomeness of the food.
This is only partially correct. The finding
in the first place is based on the cond'ition
and extent of the disease. The condition
of the animal influences the inspectors
decision when emaciation is present,
according to the inspector's judgment as
a result of the disease itself. In such cases,
however, extent of infection is generally
sufficient to remove any need for a close
decision on the basis of condition of the
animal.
On section 1-maximum compensation
reduced, grade animals-horses from $200,
cattle from $80; pig or sheep from $20;
pure-bred animals-horses from $500;
cattle from $250, pig or sheep from $75:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does
this reduction apply to pure-bred animais
as well as to ordinary grade animais?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, lit affects
both the grade animais and the pure-bred.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
was the figure for the pure-bred before?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The pure-bred
horses are reduced from $500 to $300.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend has not told us yet whetber in the
Department they have regulations, instructions or directions to those inspectors; that
was one of the things about xvhich I wanted
to be informed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, thereý
are very full instructions and regulations.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should like to
see those.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Would it not be
roasonablo in these cases, where the Governrnent is' to pay for the slaughtering
of the animais, to positively ordain that
the carcasses should he burned and destroyed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANU: I am informed
that rnost of the animaIsthat are destroyed
are in part fit for use, so that it w'ould be
serving no purpose to destroy the whole

animal when parts on]y need to be cut
off.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Are we to understand that if the post mortem discloses that,
for instance, part of the lung or part of
the liver is affected with tuberculosis, it is
simply cut off and the rest of the meat
soid on the market?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the disease
is Iimited to one organ the practice is to
limit the destruction te that organ, and
the balance is left to the ewner.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should think
that the presence of tuberculosis in a part
of the lung or liver, or some other ergan,
would indicate that the disease was somewhere else in the body. I always understood that tuberculosis was a disease of the
bleod. If it is, and if localized in the liver
or the lung, I should suspect that it must
be in some other part of the animal.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER: We
nmust recollect that this eperation has been
going on for a long series of years, and it
is worked out according to practîcal rules.
One might sýay, fromn a scientiflc point of
view, that if a man is sick you should not;
allow any part of his body to be accepted
as sane and sound, and if an animal is
sick in a certain part, say the lights or
the lung, you must conclude that the whole
animal is unsound; but the scientific theory
works out along the practical line, and
under the competent inspectors that we
have had this regulation has been carried
on for the last fifteen or twenty years,
and it is largely governed by what is found
to corne out well in practice. It would be
a waste if good sound meat were destroyed,
provided it were good for food and carried
no bad qualities. At the samne time, it
would he equally wrong to allow any portion of it to be used if it were prejudicial
to health, and I imagine that you could
only ho goided by the rule of practice.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My right honourable friend puts the question as to whether
the meat is sound. For my part, I would
like to know that the practice has been
dernonstrated te be correct, because the
on]y thing suggosted in such cases is to
boil the meat before it is eaten, which it
1s stated, will destroy the bacilli. I would
ho rnuch botter satisfied if I knewv how
the practice works eut in actual demonstratien. It soems to me the whole thing is
speulation. I have made a study of tuberculosis to sorne extent, and I doubt if in a
earcase you will find the liver or the long

JUNE 19, 1922
or any of the digestive organs with tubercuiosis localized in a very obviaus manner,
and yet the rest of the body sound. I arn
afraid that doctrine will flot hold.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have in my
hand the Meat Inspection Regulations, and
on tubercuiosis this is what I read:
(2) Tuberculosis.-As It Is impracticable ta
make isard and fast rules whlch can be applled
in every case, and to state definitely the point
at whtch the disease becomes noxious or thse flesh
unwholesonie, the disposition of the carcasses of
animale affected with tuberculosîs muet, of necessity, be lef t to thse judgment of tbe inspector,
who shall be guided by thse following principles,
and shall base judgment on hie totaL flndings:
(a) Meat shall flot be used for food if It contains tubemle bacilli, or If the disease has
readhed that stage where -tise fkahi cannot be
cons'dered as wholeome.
(b) Meat shal flot be destroyed, If the animal
je well nourisised. unileas there je evidence, or
reasonable grounds for suspicion, Ihat thse flesh
le unwholesomne.
(c) Any carcass affected witis tuberculoes, In
which the disease is associated with emaciation,
or in wisich tise disease le exteL.ve, shall be
condemned.
(d) Wisen thse lesbons are collectively smnall
in extent, and are either calclfied or encyeted,
andconfined to tise iead, or to tise head and the
abdominal and thoracle viecera, teir coverinýgs
and lymphatic glande, thse affected parts ehail
be remnoved and condemned (extept the isead,
wisich shal be removed and dispoaed of as
provided In subsection f). Thse remainder of
tise carease, if well nourlshed, and In thse iudgment of the Inspecter otherwise healthy, may be
passed for food.

There are a number of other provisions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would my honourable friend teIl us what is done in other
countries-in England, in France, and in
the United States?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: It seems to me that
the regulations there spoken of are in cases
where there is no compensation to the
owner.
What damage is done ta the owner
if hie is paid for the animal?
Ail danger of
injury to huinan heailth is obviated by the
fact that the animal is destroyed.
The

Governnient pays the owner the value of
his animal.
I think the cases cited, are
ir conditions where the animal ie flot paid
for.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Honourable gentlemen, I know that in practice, in Manitoba,
the compensation paid for the animal is as
a
rule below
its value.
Any salvage
that may ibe made £rom the
animal of course goes ta the owner.
I have seen animais vaiued at $1,000 or
ý1,500 slaughtered, and ail the compensation paid to the owner was two-thirds of

$250.
The 'beef was pronounced good, and
was sold in the regular way. I understand
that the inspectors have no difflculty in determining when meat is bad enough to be
condemned, and what is nokt bad enough
ta ha condemned is aliowed to the owner as
pLrt of bis compensation for the loss of
the animail.
The testing of animaIs, except dairy cattle, is voluntary.
The stocknien are trying to dlean up thair hards, and
the Government assists -by paying a portion

The people are

We are endeavouring ta have the embargo on Cana-

The proposai ta cut dtwn the compensation given

not a good advertisement.
However, the
desirabiiity of economy and the fact that

As to condemning

have been quite alive to the solution of
these problems, and I find that their regulations are somewhat similar to ours. One
of their rules says:

culosis shoul-d be passed for food when the
lesions are slight, localized. and calcified or
encapsulated or are limited to a single or
several parts or organs of the body (except as
noted in Rule A), and there is nouevidence of
recent invasion of tubercle bacilli into the
systematic circulation. Under this rule carcasses showing such lesions as the following
may be passed, after the parts containing the
lesions are removed and condemned In accordance with Rule B.
Then there is a list of lesions which are
deemed not to be sufficient to require the
whole animal to be sacrificed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I notice that
the regulations or directions treat almost
exclusively of tuberculosis. There is no
mention in the regulations, for instance,

what is the object of limiting the new
subsection so that it will be effective only
for three years from the lst of July?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
That is done
because the value of cattle varies from
time to time. It has been customary to
fix the rate for a certain number of years,
in order at the expiration of that time
to revise the rate, if necessary.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That may be
quite true, but even if the price of cattle
should vary, either upward or downward,
this provision would apparently prevent
the reopening of the question until the
three years had expired. I fail to see just

a man who has been away from a constituency three months have the same right

Hon. Mr. PARDEE: If he had been three
months away he would be on the voters' list
in the new constituency.
Hon. Mr. REID: Some of the voters'
lists in the province of Ontario are not prepared until almost the end of the year.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: That is in the cities.
Hon. Mr. REID: No, in rural municipalities. The judges hold their courts
away on in December and an election might
come on in February. If we are going
to adopt the policy of letting any of those
who have moved from a constituency go
back and vote, I think we should allow
them all to do so and put them all on the
same basis.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That cannot be.
You would have all sorts of troublefrauds and so on. Two months is not a
very long period in which to establish a
change of residence.
Otherwise people
might go back the next day and say: "We
want to vote here." I do not think you
can change your domicile overnight; I
should think two months was little enough
time.
Hon. Mr. REID: You are just getting
back to the policy of many years ago. The
law we have had for so many years is fair
to both parties; it does not affect one more
than the other.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Does the honourable gentleman think it fair that a man
should be deprived of his franchise because
he has moved out of a constituency two
months prior to an election?
Hon. Mr. REID: If we were to adopt
a provincial list made eight or ten months
before, and a man moved to another constituency he would not have the right to
vote. Why not make it the law that any
man who is on the voters' list that is to be
used in the election shall have the right to
vote?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can
throw some light on the question. I had
a case under my own roof in December last.
We had a maid from the country who had
been in Montreal two months. She wanted
to register. She could not register in Montreal, and could not return and register
where she had come from, because she had
left there. The object of this Bill is to deHon. Mr. REID.

clare that anyone who has removed two
months preceding the election, and who was
otherwise qualified to register or was on the
list, is qualified to vote.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Is it
because of this maid losing her franchise
that this legislation was introduced?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In a large
city the labouring element moves from
one division to another. If they are
living in the extreme east of the city and
are working in the extreme west, or vice
versa, they will be constantly transferring
their families, if they can find lodgings,
because, if they do not, they have to travel
two or three miles to work every morning,
and back to their homes again every evening. Hundreds of these people would be
disqualified if the law remained as it is.
The object of the Bill is to allow people
who have removed a few weeks before
election to register their votes.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would suggest
that the honourable gentleman produce a
photograph of this maid. If she is good
looking, the Bill will pass.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think objection to this Bill might very well be advanced in another place. It does enable
certain voters who may otherwise lose
them to cast their votes; but from the
point of view of the candidate it is very
objectionable. You get back to the old
abuses under which the expense of the
non-resident vote falls upon the unfortunate candidate. We all know of it;
everybody in this House knows something
of it. If the other House intended to pass
legislation of this kind I would not take
exception to it; but if I were in that
House I would be inclined to take very
serious exception to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman tell me what alternative he would adopt?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Leave it as
it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then there
are people who are deprived of their vote.
Surely they have a right to vote either in
the place in which they were qualified to
vote on a certain date before the election,
or at the place to which they have transferred their residence. It is a question
of residence. They should have a right
to vote in either one place or the other.
It is immaterial to me which place is

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are

Hon. Mr. BELC'OURT: It would be more
conducive to a proper understanding of the
Bill to postpone it until we know something
more about it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We may as
well discuss the policy.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It will -have to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
The
qualifications of voters ia this respect are
contained in subciause c of clause 1 of
chapter 29 of 1920, which says:

Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Suppose a man is
iegistered in a certain constituency. After
the registration and within two months of

constituency.
He bas left bis old constituency witbin two montbs of the date

The only other place in
which Lie would have a right to vote would
be in the constituency ýfrom whicb Lie

months, then Le should be entitled to vote
in his old place of residence.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
dealing with the case of the man who bas
been there actually and exactly two months.
He is qualified in both places. I do not say
that he would have the right to vote in
both places, because the policy of the Act
is that Le shall have only the one vote.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Does not the bonourable gentleman see that be could not
reside in both constituencies for two months
prior to the election?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He bas
a residence in one, and notwithstanding his
removal you provide that Le can go back
to the other and vote.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If within the
last two months preceding the election be
bas removed his residence Le cannot
qualify. Under the old Act Le is not qualified to vote in either. This Bill is to give
him the right to vote somewhere. Surely
you will give him the right to vote somewhere. It is immaterial to me where be

electors may declare that they have
come in a bona fide way to reside. I
believe that it is a more prudent and better
policy to enroll them in the constituency
where they were qualified, even if during
the last two months they have abandoned
that constituency and gone into another.
But one of the two alternatives should be
adopted so that every elector should be entitled to register his vote.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: A man may
have changed his place of residence two or
three times or more in two months.
That is an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
argument in favour of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think there is
an inequality because of the fact that in
some urban districts registration must take
place, whereas in rural districts an oath
may be taken on election day. For example, if a resident of St. Antoine ward
moves to St. Lawrence ward be is required to register in both, so this Act
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

would work no injustice to him. But supposing that an elector living in the county
of Argenteuil, where Le is not required to
register, moved to St. Lawrence ward
forty-five days before an election, Le would
have to register there and live there two
months. If the reverse were the fact, and
Le originally lived in St. Lawrence ward,
and moved to the county of Argenteuil, be
could not vote there because be had only
resided there forty-dive days, and he could
not go back and vote in St. Lawrence ward,
because Le is not registered.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
doubt that one might leave a riding where
he was qualified, and where Le was on the
list, and go to another place within two
months; but be could not register in the
latter place because Le had not been there
two months, and be could not return and
vote in the place which be came from because he would no more be a resident there.
So you have a man who is in no man's
land, and this Bill has the effect of giving
him the right to vote somewhere. The
policy of the Bill is to give him the right
te return to his old constituency and vote.
There have been many cases in cities like
Toronto and Montreal of men moving from
one side of the street to the other and being
disqualified.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My point is
that the amendment as proposed will not
cure all the ills.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Assume you have
an election on the lst of December, and
on the lst of October a resident in a
certain constituency moved to the next
constituency within an hour, which is not
inconceivable, Le would have resided less
than two months in both constituencies
so it would not cure that case.
Hon. Mr. REID: I have not had my
question fully answered yet so that I
understand it. In Ontario the last revised
list, as I understand, would be used as a
basis for making up the list for the elections. Suppose the list is made up in
February or March and the election is
held in December, there might be a number
who had moved from one constituency
to another. As I understand this amendment, all those who had not been longer
than two months absent would have a
right to come back and vote, while those
of two months and a week, or three months,
would not have that right; so that probably a great many that were on the last
revised list would not have the right to
vote. What I contend is that any man

JUNE 19, 1922
who is on the last list used in an electarai district, if he has not been resident
in the constituency ta whîch he has gone,
shauld have the samne right as the man
of two months ta corne back and vote in
the constituency where he was befare he
went away. I arn satisfied with the Act
as it is, and believe it is fair ta ail, but
if it is ta be amen ded it should be done
in such a way that every citizen af Canada
wha has a right ta, vote should exercise
that right in sarne canstituency.
Han. Mr. PARDEE: Does nat the honourable gentleman think that this Bill
gets nearer ta that than the aid Act did?
There were many people in my part of the
country, and thraughout western Ontario,
wha were disfranchised because they had
left the canstituency two months before
the election. They had no place whatever
ta vote. In the cities there is a system
of registration, so that under the Act passed
last session such a voter could came back
and in the presence of two qualified voters
swear in and vote no matter where he
lived, provided he was entitled ta vote in
that constituency and that ward; therefore
the argument of rny hanaurable friend
does nat; apply in such cases. In constituencies where registration is not made the
voter rnay get over the trouble by the
provision suggested in the arnendrnent.
Hon. Mr. REID: The sarne thing happened in my own constituency.
Peaple
who moved away withiu two rnonths or
four months could neither vote on the lisi
in the rural constituency from which they
had rnoved, nar could they vote in the constituency
ta which they had rnoved.
Therefore, while this amendrnent rnight
assist in urban constituencies, it would
not help in rural cases except ta the extent of two rnanths. Why not let every
man who is on the vaters' list in a rural
constituency and cannot get on the list in
anather connstituency ta which he has.
rnaved, be put in exactly the sarne position
as the rnan in the urban constituency?
Han. Mr. PARDEE: Because in aIl probability in mare than twa rnonths he will
be on the list in the new constituency ta
which he has gone.
Hon. Mr. REID: He could flot; possibly
get on within two rnonths. These lista are
made up once a year; and if you are going
ta allow any of those who are on the list
to return, I think it should be open ta
every rnan on the list.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman recognizes that the Act as
S-26à

40

it is deprives a number of people who are
qualified and on the list fromn vating because they have lef t within the last two
months.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes, 1 agree with that,
but this arnendrnent would still deprive
rnany that are on the list, because they
have been probably twa and a haîf months
away-all thase that are over twa months.
Han. Mr. PAR DEE: You must draw the
line soniewhere.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The axnendment now says two rnonths; what would rny
hanourable friend suggest?
Hon. Mr. REID: I suggest that if the
law will not allow a voter ta get an the
list in the canstituency ta which he has
rernoved, he shauld have the right ta go
back ta the one he left and be put on the
list there, in the same way as a mnan wha
bas moved away only twa rnonths.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But is there
not a point where a party baving left the
constituency will have been long enoughi
in the new one ta qualify? And if he can
qualify in that canstituency, should nat the
line be drawn there?
Hon. Mr. REID: As I understand, the
Election Act does draw the line; you are to,
accept a list that is made up within two
years, but different provinces make lists
every year. If a province daes nat rnake
a list, lists af voters not over two years
old must be used, so that if an elector
rnoved from ane con stituency ta another he
would do sa probably within the second
year; sû I would like ta see that cured in
that way. That would do justice ta the
rural constituencies. 1 think that this Act
is intended more for cities, although twothirds of the canstituencies are rural, and
you are only curing it ta the extent of two
manths, thus, I believe, depriving rnany
thousands in rural constituencies from having a goad honest vote sirnply because they
are not in a position, through any forrn
of law, ta get on the voters' lîst in the constituency in which they live.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will move
that the Cornrittee rise and repart progress and ask leave ta sit again, and meantirne I will ask honourable gentlemen who
have interested themnselves in this debate ta
work on any kind of arnendrnent which
they think will improve this proposition,

SHIPPING
BILL

(PILOTAGE)

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEZE.
AND PASSED

]EEPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 79,
an Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act
(Pilotage).
Hon. Mr. Willoughby in the Chair.
On section 1-foreign ships of war and
h->spital ships may be made exempt ships;
Canadian fishing vessels to bc exempted:
Section 1 was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL moved that the following be added as section 2 of the Bill:
"2. Section

478

of the said

-ct

Is hereby

amnended by inserting the word "St. John" between "H-alifax"

and "Sydney"

'ni the second

line thereof.Y

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: What is the effeet
of that amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Perhaps I can explain it more easily and quickly by reading
section 478:
Pilotage authorities -and pilotage districts of
Halifax, Sydney, Meramnichi and Ilictou may, as
to eaeh of such ports respectively. notwithstanding anything contained in the last pre.ceding section-

I may say that the last prece&ding sec-tion relates to ships exempted f rom compulsory pilotageanything contained in the
-notwithstanding
last preceding section frorn time to timne determi-ne, with the approval of the Govern-or General,
whether any and whieh if any stearnships emnployed as in the said section specifled shall or
shal -not be wholly or partially, and if portially to what extent and under what circumstances, exempted from compulsory paymnent of
pilotage dues.

I do not know why St. John was not in
that list in the first place. But whether
or not there was any reason at that time,
it is absolutely impossible for any reason
to exist now, because ail pilotage ports
and districts are under the authority of
the Minister of Marine and they can pass
[Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.]

no rule, order or regulation that bas not
the approval of the Governor in Council.
I may say that I brought this matter to
the attention of the Minister of Marine and
he quite approves of the change.
This stateHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment of my honourable friend prompts me
to accept the amendment.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Daniel was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Reference is made
there to ships of war and hospital ships
belonging to foreiga nations. I should
like to know what that means.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It means that
ships of war and hospital ships belonging
to a foreign nation or nations as may ho
specified by the ýGovernor in Council inay
be exempted from-f pilotage when we have
received similar treatment -from. such foreign countries.

The preamble and the title were agreed
to.

The Bill was reported as amended.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bî'l
was read the third time and passed.
AIR BOARD BILL
FURTIIER

CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

The Sonate again went into Committee
on Bill 136, an Act to amend the Air
Board Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1, new section 6A-Governor
in Council may prescribe compensation payable for death or lijury, directly resulting from a flight undertaken in course of
.duty:
Hon Mr. PROUDFOOT: I understand
the honourable leader of the Government
intended making an explanation of this
particular clause when it came before the
Committee again. It reads:
The 0-overnor in Council may mnake regulations prescribing the compensation to be paid...

The question raised the other day whero
this was before the Committee was: where
is there any authority to provide for
compensation? We were not able at that
time to discover any. This clause as it
reads now presupploses that there is a provision allow'ing the compensation to, ho paid.

vice, but if we are going to provide for
compensation we should make clear the
authority for the payment of it. I yenture to, say that if regulations are made
under this section as it now stands, the
Auditor, reading it in conjunctian with
section 5 of the original Act, will not paso
such payrnent. Sa while we are dealing
with the statute we shauld make it perfectly clear. That is the only point I arn
rnaking.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It seems to me that
the clause is sufficient to, give power to
the Governor in Council to, declare that
the compensation shaîl be paid, and what
the compensation shahl be. There is the
other question raised by the honourable
6a. The Governor in Council may make regulations prescribing the compensation to be

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: It is quite
clear in reading chapter il of the statutes
of 1919 that there was flot sufficient
power granted to the Governor in Council
to grant compensation and inake regulations therefor. That is the reason for the
present Bill. When we were in Committee
Iast week the question was asked, does
this proposed clause give sufficient authority? I have consulted the law officer of the
Senate and we have corne to, the conclusion
that it does. If honourable gentlemen wil
read with me the section that is now before us, I think they will agree that, while
the clause might have been drafted otherwise, it does provide the necessary powers.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do flot wisih

compensation to, be paid for injuries to an
individual. I think that in each case the
action of the Government should be submitted to Parliament for approval, just
as has been done in the cases I ýhave
mentioned, whiere violent deaths have occured by reason of accidents to persons
engaged in the public service.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Any-way, 'by the

very early after the commencement of next
Session take the matter up seriously with
the object of revising all the conditions

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not
know that I shall succeed in getting the
Commons to take first action in this
matter, but I will cordially support any
motion made in this Chamber for a joint
committee of both Houses and will give
my best efforts towards bringing about
the formation of such a joint committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable member (Hon. Mr. Barnard), in my
opinion, cannot withdraw his amendment
at the present stage of the proceedings.
I think the only course that can be taken
is to deal with the report.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move that the report be not concurred in, but that it be
referred to the Committee of the Whole.
The report covers the Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is only
the amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
Bill was reported to the House as
amended.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Then I move that
this House do not concur in the amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
say to my honourable friend, in answer to
his proposal that the House should pronounce non-concurrence in the amendment, that it might be prejudicial to the
action which the House would take next
Session, as suggested by my honourable

seems to me that it would be very much
better to refer it back to the Committee
for further consideration by passing a
motion that the Bill be not now read a

the Committee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: We are not at

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understood that the Committee reported the
Bill to the House. Are we considering the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If we
are dealing with that subject, I fail to see
why my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Barnard) cannot, with the leave of the House,
withdraw the amendment. That would relieve the House of the necessity of pronouncing upon the subject; whereas, if we
did pronounce upon it, and if at next
Session we entered upon a discussion of it,
it would very properly be pointed out that
the House had voted down the amendment.
I would therefore suggest that my honourable friend, with the leave of the House,
be permitted to withdraw his amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If His Honour
the Speaker sees no difficulty in that procedure, I concur in the suggestion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There can be no
objection if nobody takes objection.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I move that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The amendment
would be withdrawn at the request of the
honourable gentleman and with the leave of
the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I vould like
to explain to the House the way I see the
matter. What we are considering is not
the amendment, but the report of the
Committee on the amendment. I do not
see how the Committee's report can be
withdrawn in that way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could not the

VANCOUVER HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 106, an Act to
amend the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill has for its purpose the withdrawing
of the appointment of port wardens from
the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners.
They are *the only Harbour Commission
in Canada who have at present the right
to appoint the port wardens, and it is
deemed advisable that that power should,
as in the case of all other ports, remain
with the Minister of Marine and Fisheries.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 125, an Act to
amend the Supreme Court Act.
He said: The object of this Bill is to
give power to the provinces who express
a desire to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada in cases referred by the Lieutenant-Governors in Council to the Courts
of Appeal of the various provinces. Of
course, the Federal Parliament has vested
the Supreme Court with the power to hear
references from the Federal authorities.
It is necessary to amend the Supreme
Court Act in order to give a similar facility to the provinces who may desire to
appeal from judgments in cases referred
by them to their respective Courts of
Appeal.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CANADA TEMPERANCE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 132, an Act to
amend the Canada Temperance Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the
Federal Parliament, in response to the
demand of various provinces, has prohibited the importation of liquor into certain
provinces. The demand from those provinces is that exportations from those provinces be stopped. Before the prohibition
to import became law, there was imported
into those provinces large quantities of
liquor-millions of gallons, I am toldand it is legally in warehouses, of course

409

subject to the provincial.laws. The only
power remaining to the owners of those
liquors is to export them, but they are unable or unwilling to do so. The liquor remains an eyesore in such provinces, and
the provincial authorities fear that some
of it is leaking out, a proper administration of the prohibition law being thus prevented. By this Bill, when the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in a province asks
the Federal authorities to prohibit exportation, the Federal Government will respond by prohibiting it. This is a warning
to the holders of liquor in various warehouses to hurry and dispose of it, otherwise, if they cannot find a means under
provincial machinery of transferring it to
the province, or to persons licensed by the
province, it will remain on their hands.
In some provinces, as in Saskatchewan, I
understand, the prohibition of importation
has been on the statute book for some time,
and yet the holders of liquor-and they
are very many-still have large stocks on
hand.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Is it possible for this Government to prohibit the
export of liquor from any individual province without including all the provinces?
This is something that I do not quite understand, and I am simply asking for information. Can we pass an Act providing that
Saskatchewan, for instance, shall not export liquor, and say nothing about any
other province?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill simply authorizes the province that desires to
prohibit exportation to do so. It is a
facility given to any province that desires
the Federal Government to intervene and
prohibit exportation to do so. This is not
a law that is being applied to the provinces.
I understand that the policy of the Parliament of Canada has been to allow full
freedom to the provinces, and this policy
has been carried out. This Bill does not
alter the principle that the provinces are
supreme within their borders. It only
states that when the province, by Order
in Council, notifies the Federal authorities
that it desires to -stop exportation, the Federal Government, authorised by this law,
will pass an Order in Council prohibiting
exportation.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If a province
allows the manufacture of liquor within
its borders, can it then prevent the exportation? I do not think it can, as I understand it.

110

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DAI$DURAND: This does not
affect the distillers nor the brewers under
Federal license.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Nor the makers
of native wines?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am speaking of the power of the Federal Government. I understand that in the province of
Ontario distillers are still allowed to distil
and to export; but this Bill does not affect
the right of the Federal Government in
the giving of licenses for the distilling of
liquor.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I beg to
draw the attention of the leader of the
Government to the fact that last session
we passed a rule stating that all Bills
amending Acts should be printed in such
a way as to show the amendments. I think
that rule should be observed in such important legislation as the Bill before us
and the Bankruptcy Bill and the Trust
Companies Bill, and so far as I am concerned I intend to oppose this Bill until
the rule is complied with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the honourable gentleman will read the Bill which
is under review, he will find that it is
sufficiently clear and that he need not insist
upon having the clauses of the old Act
before us. If the honourable gentleman
will notice clause 2, for instance, he will
find that it says:
Said Part IV is further amended by adding

immediately after section 156 the following
sections:
We have only to read section 156 and
see whether it has anything to do with the
section we are adding. I think that is clear
enough sailing as far as this Act is concerned.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The
trouble is that there is a very important
provision in part V which relates to the
importation of liquors into a province which
is not a temperance province, and which
creates the old Queen Elizabeth monopolies
again. I dbject to these monopolies being
vested in the Crown, and I think, therefore, that all portions of this Bill which
vary the present law should be clearly
indicated. These are not minor amendments, but in some cases very important
amendments. We are asked in this Bill
to give the Crown a monopoly. I am referring more particularly to clause 5. I do
not want to embarrass the leader of the
Government in the least, but I do think
Hon. Mr. BENNETT.

that when we are considering Bills of such
importance we should not have to run all
about to get the statutes in order to see
what is meant.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am under the impression that the rule which the honourable
gentleman refers to does not apply to
this Bill, because it is sought by this Bill
to add new provisions to the Act. The
Bill is not amending any of the clauses
of the main Act: it is simply adding new
provisions.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH,STAUNTON: That
cannot be so in the case of amendments
to section 163. I have not examined the
Bill very carefully, but if one looks at
page 3 he will see that:
The provisions of subsecion 1 of this section
shall not apply to-

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is subsection 1
of section 163. It is the new section that
shall not apply in the cases mentioned in
subsection 2.
Hon. Mir. LYNCH- STAUNTON:
I
object to the Bill because of clause 5, which
certainly varies the law as laid down in the
statute. I would like to know what those
variations are.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am quite in accord with that. I have ýnoticed that other
Bills have not been properly prepared.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The rule is not
observed in reference to Bills from the
Commons. May I take this opportunity
to speak again on the subject of that rule?
I had a great deal to do with its being
adopted by the House, and had been advocating it for years before it was adopted last
Session. I have noticed that every Bill
that comes from the Commons is submitted
to us without the rule being observed. I
suppose the reason is that the Commons
has not yet adopted a similar rule. Notwithstanding this, I wonder if we could
not have the bills reprinted according to
our own rules. If that House does not
choose to observe this rule, we cannot of
course force it on the House of Commons,
but I have observed that not onl-y is it
not observed in the case of Bills from that
House, but also in the case of bills initiated
here.

attention of honourable gentlemen to the
very great difllculty of applying this rule

of adapting a Bill to, an Act as it wil
appear in the revision of the statutes.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNÇH-STAUNTON:
honourable gentleman wifl notice that there
is no legisiation of any importance brought
down in this House until the last couple
of weeks of the session. There is no reason
on earth why ahl these very important Bis
should be crowded into the last few days of
the 'session. We should be given time to,
consider them. We pass Bis that we do
flot understand.
,Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The rule is to
be found in the minutes of last year, at
page 344:
On motion of the Honourable Mr. Belcourt, it
Výas
Ordered,-That a Special Committee, composed of the Honourable Messieurs Lynch..
Staunton, Proudfoot, Ross (Middleton), Willoughby, and the Mover, be appointed to submit ta the Senate an amendiment to the Rules
of the House. so as to provide that ail Bis
ta be submitted ta this House shall contain In
full the section, or sections o! Acts which It is
proposed ta repeal or amend.

That rule certainly has not; been complied with. As my honourable friend has
said, same additional time and effort may
be needed ta comply with the rule, but 1
think more time wauld have ta be saved
in the discussion of the Bill than* wauld
be used in complying with the rule sa that
the Bill might be braught ta us in proper
form. Take the time we have wasted this
morning. I cannat see why the rule shauld
nat be adheréd ta.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Hanaurable gentlemen, the rule is evidently
a goad one. It is not proper ta ask us
ta take up a piece ai legialation which has
ta do 'with clauses that are hidden away

41

in the general statutes. It is quite easy ta,
have the clause printed in the Bill with
the amendment that it is proposed to make
ta it: then everything is clear. I think
that is an excellent ruhe, and should be
The question is
adhered ta generalhy.
whether or not it is practically better for
us ta insist upon that rule at the present
time. 1 quite agree with the remarks
made by the honourable gentleman from
Hamilton (Hon. Mir. Lynch-Staunton).
Yesterday and the day before, particularhy
yesterday, I went over the Bis which have
been thrust upon us within the last six
or seven days. Nine-tenths of those Buis
might just as well have been here two or
three months ago.
That ieads me ta make a remark with
reference ta the general business af the
Senate, which 1 hope ta f ollow up a little
more in particular, maybe not this year,
but in another Session. There ought ta be
some different method af allocating the
business that we are called upan ta perform. Here you have an assemblage ai
men, eighty or ninety in nurnber, men af
very varied and widely distributed experience-men who have been business men,
men who have been pahiticians and statesmen, and they count or aught ta count for
something. I ask yau ta put the question
ta yaurselves as ta what has been put before this Senate this year, when we have
had a Session of pretty nearly four months.
It is net praper that the Senate should be
treated in this way. We have na member
af the Government ta represent it here
in the Senate. It is impassible for my
honourable friend who leads the Gavernment (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) ta make himself au fait with aIl the legislation ai al
the different departments. He cannot do
it. 'There ought ta be some distribution ai
work. There are men ai ability on the
ather side ai the House, and they aught ta
have ailocated ta them certain departments
af work, and they ought ta be asked ta
make themselves au courant with the legislation which is required. In fact, it does
seern ta me that it might be an erninently
practical thing ta have the Minister from
the other Chamber present before us when
his legislation is -going through. He knaws
what it is; he can give us exactiy the information we need. When a measure dealing with very important particulars ai a
certain department is brought before us,
we get a cold douche when we ask the
representative ai the Government ta please
give us the information in reference ta
this thing, and he, who has only a small

412

SENATE

brief which cannot possibly cover the information which is required, is frankly
compelled to say: "This is all I have; it
does not fill the bill, but I will go and get
more and bring it to you." The psychological moment has gone by. You have trained
yourself on that particular piece of legislation, and are immediately thrown back
a day or two or three days, and then comes
a further bit of information. In some way
we ought to have these matters arranged
so that important legislation could come
before us earlier. I wish to make a protest,
as every other member no doubt has done
before, against attempts to rush the whole
of the legislation through the Senate in
the last five or six days. It is not proper,
it is not seemly. We are not being treated
fairly by the lower House when that method
is followed; and we are not doing our
duty fairly to the country as a legislature, nor, in many respects, for the benefit of the country.
My suggestion is that we should not insist upon the reprinting of all these Bills.
We would probably delay the Session much
more if we did so. Let us get through with
these as fast as we can this year, but let us
have it well understood that this sort of
thing shall not be continued year after year.
The legislation before us to-day is important. There is no reason in the wide world
why it should not have been passed in the
House of Commons two months ago, and
have come before us when we had very little
to do. I would suggest, therefore, that we
should not insist categorically on the rule at
the present time, but that we should make
a very decided determination that hereafter
things shall be differently arranged, as they
easily can be, so that we shall be given a
better opportunity to do our part in the
legislation of the country.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Personally I did
not intend that the rule should be insisted
on at this stage.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I am
not inclined to withdraw my objection, because I do not think it is a matter of form,
or a question of the dignity of the Senate.
These are very fundamental amendments to
the Bankruptcy Act, the Trust Companies
Act, and the Temperance Act, and such
amendments may not come before the Senate again for years. I have examined them
and they are very important.
The same
thing occurs every year, and, notwithstanding the right honourable gentleman's remarks, will occur next year again. Since I
have been in this House we have .protested
Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER.

again and again, but the same thing always
occurs. Nobody takes any trouble preparing the legislation; it is flung at the House
of Commons, and is passed along here, and
a year or two -afterwards we are thunderstruck to find what we have done.
So far as this Bill is concerned, if the
leader of the Government says it is not
varying but only adding to the law, I will
not persist in my objection. I will insist
with all my powers when we come to the
Bankruptcy Act and the Trust Companies
Act. I have examined those Bills, and I
have found it almost impossible to understand them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Of
course, honourable gentlemen should not
fail to consider what the situation really is.
While it is very desirable that we should
not only adoýpt rules of this character, but
carry them out, we must not overlook the
fact that if there has been any omission or
default in carrying out the rules, it lies
with the Senate itself. The duty would be
upon our officers to see that these Bills are
printed according to the rule. The House
of Commons and the Senate are co-ordinate
branches, and we cannot impose upon the
Commons certain conditions as to the'submitting of Bills in any particular way. They
have their own rules as to the printing of
these Bills, and when the Bills come to the
Senate we must accept thern as they come
from the House of Commons. But that does
not preclude the officer of this House, or the
House itself, seeing to it that the Bills conform with the rule; and in this particular
case, while we make the criticisms in which
we have been indulging, let us not overlook
the fact that the fault is our own.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest that at the opening of the next
Session we appoint a Committee, and ask
that the House of Commons join us, in
amending their rules to the same effect.
I think it will be found that our officers
will be unable to comply with, not the
rule, for we have passed no rule, but the
recommendation we have made. Whatever we may say, whatever protest we
may register, and in spite of the criticisms
we make yearly, important Bills will
inevitably, in very many instances, come
at the end of the Session. That has been
the case since 1867. Surely, then, we should
get at the root of the trouble and ask
the Commons to join with us in affirming
the same principles, or adopting the same
procedure. I agree with my right honourable friend in what he has said as to the

JUNE 20, 1922
difficuhty of understanding Bis when we
have not before us the clause of the Act
to be amended. That difflculty ought to be
faced in the Ôther Chamber as weii as here.
Those 235 members of the Gommons shouid
be as interested as are the Senators in
having before them the clause which is
sought to be amended. I therefore suggest
that there be appointed a joint committee
of both Houses in order that Bis may be
framed on proper lines. I doubt very much
that we can in the last ten days, or twa
weeks of the Session get our iaw officers
to do what we have recommended, if Bills
corne from the Gommons in such a state
as they do at present.
I have said that it was, not a rule that
we had passed, and I think my honourable
friend could not at this date raise a point
of order. This is the report fromn the
Gommittee:
Your Committee reci>mmends that ail Bis
which propose to amnend or repeai any existing
statute shail when first printed have in parallei
columons the sections as it 15 proposed to amnend
it, showinig in brackets the words to be deleted
in the existing Act and showing in braokets
the words to be added by said amendment.

This report was adopted, but our ruhes
were not aitered. It was cieariy a wish
expressed by the Senate that this shouhd be
done. I doubt that my honourabie friend
couid raise a point of order upon this
report.
Hon. Mr. LYNGH-STAUNTON: Why

Han. Mr. LYNGH-STAUNTON: There
rias been pienty ,of time to make this
change. The Debates are printed every
day. There is no reason on earth why any
industrious officer, spending an hour on
each of these Bis, could not insert the
sections being amended. If it would take
the officer too long to coliect the sections
and add them to the amendinent, how on
earth are we going to give them any decent
consideration at ahi? If eight or ten days
is flot sufficient for the officer to do this
work, how can it be sufficient for us?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, as
we go into Gommittee we take up the Bihl
clause by clause, and we muet be ready,
by having before us the Act which it is
sought to amend, so as to indicate in
what particuhar it is being amended.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
are oniy one or two copies of the Act
around the building.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF : I think the suggestion of the honourabie leader of the Government is a good one, that the two Houses
should at the next Session appoint a joint
committee to deai with this inatter.
I would point out that for some years it
has been the practice, in some departmnents
at ail events, to have the Act printed with
the proposed amiendments. 1 remember
that when the Interior Department was
having the Dominion Lands Act amended,
before I left the bouse of Gommons, the
aild section to be amended was printed with
the Bill, in different type, so that everything was plain and clear, and members
might know what they were doing. They had
ail the information right in front of themn,
as *my honourabie friend £rom Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) now suggests
we shouid have. I quite agree, however,
that at this stage of the Session it is inypossible to carry out the proposai. But 1
think xny honourabie friend should see to
it that at the opening of next Session a
Cornmittee of both Houses is appointed to
deal with the matter and arrange that ail
important rules shali be introduced into
the House of Gommons or the Senate in the
form desired.
We
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: 1 do not see why
a Committee of both Houses should be
appointed to deai with the printing o'f Bis
that come before us. Why can we not
have set out side by side, in parallel
coiumns, the clauses that are proposed to be
amended and the amendments proposed?
We can do that ourselves. We do not have
to consuit the House of Ganmnons as, to
whether they shall foiiow that pTactice or
not. If you are going to have that decided,
the result wihi be that the matter wili go
over ta next year, and we shaii find ourselves in the same position as we are in
now. It was the saine last year. It bas

be given so easily.
My honourable
friend speaks of a change made in the
House of Commons. That is only in cases
where many amendments were made. There
were two or three occasions on which existing sections and amendments were printed
in parallel columns. That applied only to
individual cases. There is no rule with
regard to it. I think we should have a positive rule, that, even if there is only one
section of an Act amended, the section proposed to be amended and the proposed
amendment should be printed side by side.
Then there can be no difficulty whatever.
To say that the officers of the House have
not the time is an absurd statement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
out to my honourable friend that the
officers do comply with our recommendations in regard to Bills originating in the
Senate; but the difficulty is for them to
take the Bills that are rushed in during the
last few days of a Session and transform
them by placing side by side with their
clauses the sections from the Act which is
sought to be amended. It is perhaps a
material difficulty.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It does not seem
to nie that it is such a herculean task as
my honourable friend would have us think.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I know. That is
all very weli, but it can be done easily
enough. Let us hire additional help, if
necessary. It is in the interest of the
country.
I understand that an ex-Minister of a forn'er Government has been speaking< of
Governments not bringing in legislation until the dying hours of the Session.
That
is a crime that is not new, and it would
seem to me that the honourable gentleman
might have made some reform when he was
a member of the Government, instead of
waiting until now to remind us of what has
been, 'I may say, the rule ever since I have
been in Parliament, both in the House of
Commons and here.
Every Government

there have dieen several Goevernments since I first came to Parliamenthas been guilty of the same offence, and
it is a serious offence. The result is that
a mass of un-digested legislation goes upon

to be changed.
That would not be so
if there were proper management on the
part of the Government.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Or just stay
here until we have dealt with them.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Let theni know that
we are sick and tired of this kind of thing,
and that it is against the interests of the
commonwealth to have it continued. But
I say it ill becames a right, honourable
gentleman, who for many years was a

Bills?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am quite willing
to do that.
I am quite willing to remain

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: You live here.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am glad my, honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) bas

I say, let us stay
here and properly digest those Bills and
have them properly considered.
But let
us have that proposed printing of the sections and amendments side by side.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The honourable
gentleman feels quite at home here, does he
rot?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do-yes.
I consider iýt is a very fine city.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: And you like to

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I know my honourable friend must feel at home here too: he
has been here a great many years, probably as many years as I have. But I
hope that the proposal will be carried out
now.
Let us not have a joint committee
of the two Houses, 'but let us deal with the
matter on our own account. To attend to
cur own business is as much as we can do
here.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
Honourable
gentlemen, I do not want to take up very
much time with the discussion, but it seems
to me that the difficulty rests with ourselves. Why should we feel rushed at the
cnd of a session? Simply because the Commons say they are going to end the session
at a certain time, should we be placed in

JUNE 20, 1922
the position of agreeing with that proposition? If legislation does not come down
here in proper time, then it is our duty as
members of the Senate to stay here and
examine that legislation properly, and not
feel that we are rushed in any way at all.
Let us take proper time to digest and dispose of the legislation. It may be that it
will keep the Commoners here longer than
they desire. I do not approve of the suggestion that we should refuse to pass the
Bills which come down to this House, because that would not be fair to the country. It might be reading a lesson to the
members of the Commons, but we are not
here for that purpose; we are here for the
purpose of legislating for the people at
large, and, even if it does take several days
longer, the members of the other House
will require to remain. If we take the
stand that we are going to stay here long
enough to close up the legislation properly,
it may have a salutary effect in this way,
that the members of the other House will
see that the legislation is brought before
the Senate at the proper time.

SENATE

the whole Dominion from ocean to ocean.
We have apparently, by an insidious process, delegated to the provinces the exercise of a right which is purely a Federal
right. Although I was a member of the
Government that delegated to the provinces the power which they are now seeking to exercise, in my saner moments I
deny the right of the Federal Government
to delegate to any provincial government
the right to restrict importation or exportation throughout the Dominion.
I
could understand the proposal being a
reasonable one if ail the provinces joined
together and a uniform body of law were
applied to ail the provinces touching the
importation or exportation of liquor; but
for one province to go to the Government
of Canada and say, "You must prohibit
the importation of liquor into our province," and thus to deprive the people of
that province of a right which under the
British North America Act is clearly exercisable by them, does violence to any
reasonable interpretation of the British
North America Act.
It simply means this, that we are reducing
our constitution down to a patchwork of
provincial powers. If it had been intended
when the British North America Act was
passed that this kind of thing could be
done, the power would have been given
to the provinces; it would not have been
vested in the Federal Government. It
seems to me to be an arbitrary right, and,
apart from ail moral considerationsbecause I am not dealing with it from that
standpoint at all-if we are to have a
constitution by which the Federal Government can administer law throughout the
whole Dominion, then we must abandon
this policy of delegating Federal powers
to provincial legislatures, into which we
drifted under war-time conditions. While
it may be late in the day to reconsider the
position we took and the policy we adopted
during the war, yet it seems to me that if
we are to retain the integrity of our
institutions which exercise federal power,
we should review the legislation we placed
upon the statute book, and not indulge in
any further extension of the dangerous
policy we have introduced into the Canada
Temperance Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I agreed in the past
with the policy which the honourable leader
of the other side of the House promoted
as a member of the late Government in
this House, but I disagree with the adverse
position which he has taken to-day. It has
been the policy of ail Governments for a
[Hon. Sir James LOUGHEED.]

great number of years to leave the question
of prohibition to each province; and not
merely to each province, but under the
Scott Act to the counties in each province.
I think that is a proper principle and a
proper policy. Why should we impose the
opinion of the inhabitants of the province
of Quebec on the province of British
Columbia or any -other province in the
Dominion? I think it is for each province
to decide whether it desires to have prohibition or not; and under our constitution, as the powers are divided, it is but
proper that the Dominion Parliament
should come to the rescue of the provinces
and give them the enabling power which
is necessary in order to give effect to the
opinions of the inhabitants of any province.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend would leave the impression upon the House, from his remarks,
that when Parliament adopted the Canada
Temperance Act years ago it adopted
this principle; but I would point out to
him that it was not until the last three
or four years that we went so far as to
delegate to the provinces the right to
say whether liquor should be imported into
or exported from a province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend is not quite exact when he
states that we have delegated powers. We
could not do so, and we have not done so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
know what it is, then.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not
accusing my honourable friend of having
done so. He has declared that he would
use the powers vested in the Federal
Parliament to meet the wish of any
province, and this was based on provincial
freedom. I think that that principle is to
be commended. I supported my honourab!e
friend when he affirmed that principle, and
I still stand by it. I believe that Confederation could never have been accomplished in
1867 if it had been said squarely to the
people of the four provinces that one
province could impose its habits and its
ways of living on a neighboring province.
Confederation was based on respect of the
rights of various provinces to live their
own lives as they pleased. This is the
principle upon which my honourable friend
has stood, and on which we are now standing. We are simply enabling the provinces
to live their own lives as they please, with-

JUNE 20, 1922
out iniposing the will of the rnajority, and
we are doing Sa by using our owfl powers,
without going outside the ternis of the
Federal constitution.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I arn surprised
that the honourable leader of the Government should say that Confederation would
neyer have been entered into if the people
of these provinces at that time had understood that they were flot going ta lead
their own lives as they pleased. It is an
absolute irnpossibili'ty to formi a pact of
any kind between individuals, as it is between states, unless there is a mutual
giving up ifl same regard, and a mutual
shortening of the powers they individually
possess. My honourable friend is charging the fathers of Confederation with irnbecility when hie says that these provinces
would not have gone into it if they had
understood that it meant the giving up by
one province of any rights that it had. Previous ta Confederation the provinces were
units, were individuals, were sovereigns
so f ar as concerned each other, owing ailegiance only ta the Imperial Crown; but
when they joined in the Confederation for
mutual protection and mutual help, they
did so by giving up certain rights and
certain privileges which they then passessed. At the tirne of Confederation we
had it settled under the Act passed by the
Imperial Parliarnent, which is the only
authority that could settie it, what part
the Federal Governrnent should take, and
what part the individual provinces should
take. I hold, and I think I arn right, that
the Federal Government cannot delegate
its powers ta the provinces.
That can
only be done by the authority that divided
those powers, namely, by an Act of the
Imperial Parliament. We entered into the
pact of Confederation on the understanding that certain powers should remain
with the Federal Governrnent, and certain
powers with the provincial Governments,
and this cannot be changed. The provincial Parliamxent cannot give up its rights,
neither can the Federal Parliarnent give
up its rights, without the confirmation of
the autharity which divided those rights
in the first place; and I say that what we
are trying to do here is illegal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

ever hie thinks he wants? It may not be
the best thing for hirn, but whatever hie
thinks he wants hie had the right ta get,
before this importing legisiation was introduced; and ta say that this is done in
the interests of freedom is absurd.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Freedom, of
the province.
Han. Mr. FOWLER: It is a deprivation of the freedom of the individual. It
is in the interest of putting shackles on
people. After ail, the individual has some
rights. To say that this Bill should be
passed because it is in the interest of
f reedoni is, ta iny mind, a very strange
contention ta corne frorn the leader of the
Government. I trust there will be no
more attempts on the part of this House
to deprive the Federal Governrnent of the
rights secured ta it by the B.N.A. Act,
because I hold it is illegal, and I think it
is improper in every way. If you want
ta legisiate in the interest of freedom you
certainly are not going ta do that when
you give the provinces power, the sole
power, ta rnake importations. Why do
they want that sole power? In the interest of temperance? In the interest of
prohibition? Na, but in order that they
may get more profits, that they rnay raill
up larger surpluses; that is why they want
it. They want ta deprive everybody else
of the right of selling, so that they can
charge double prices. They do not want
any competition in the trade. That is
not in the interest of prohibition, nor in
the interest of temperance. If there is
anybody here whose heart is bound up
in the interest of temperance, let hirn get
away frorn the fallacy that this Act is
proposed in that interest. As a rnatter of
fact it is opposed ta the interest of teniperance. It is propased in order that
those provinces may have flot only the
sole right ta seli, but also the sole right
ta adulterate, the sole right ta dispose of
any sort of stuif they make, so that their
profits rnay be the greater. That is what
it is for, absolutely. Sa I say, if there is
any strong ternperance man here who feels
that while his vote may be wrong it may
yet be in the interest of temperaxce, let
ffim get away frorn the idea. The provinces of British Columbia and Quebec
only want to rnake a littie more rnoney,
and do not want any opposition in the
trade, and this legisiation is -in the interest of rnonopoly, the worst kind of
monopoly, and I trust that honourable
gentlemen will vote against it..

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: 1 want
to draw attention for -a moment to the f act
that this -is novel legisiation. It is brought
in regarding the Canada Temperance Act,
and is ail founded on the decision of the
Privy Council in the Scott Act case, the
effect of which was that for temperance
purposes or for the purpose of liquor
license laws, the Dominion iGovernment
might make an area. That area was
usually a county. In order to help the
temperance people, the late Government
extended that doctrine, I think very improperly, and made a province an area,
and passed this legisiation, which, though
within the letter of the decision of the
Priivy Council, is absolutely, I submit, outside the ýspirit of that decision.
This Government is now going a step further, and saying: "Well, if that is good
enough for temperance law, we will make
it good for every other kind of law." They
have incorporated this legisiation in the
Temperance Act, but it has no more to do
with an Act for the enforcement of temperance legisiation than it has to do with
the Lord's Prayer. They mlight as well
put an amendment to the Lord's Prayer
into the Temperance Act as to put this
amendment into it, because it is absolutely
unconnected with or unrelated to temperance legisiation. What the Act proposes to
allow in the provinces of British Columbia
and Quebec is absolutely against prohibition as understood in the other provinces. British Columbia and Quebec .have
refused, and I think properly, to adopt
prohibition; but they have said that the
liquor traffic, unless properly regulated, is
a dangerous traffic and an evil to the
people and they have abolished the bars,
which no man in America, I should thinkreto see
leastCanada at
in
introduced.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

provinces have taken 'into their own hands
the selling of liquor within the province,
because they say: "People are entitled to
have liquor if they choose, but we are
going to see that the trafflc is not abused
as it was, before, and that the people in
this country get proper liquor." That
policy has met with universal. approval -in

and they want to do something which. is

wrong. They want to prevent me and you
and everybody else from exercising our
right to buy outside of Canada the productions of foreign countries in wines and
liquors. They say, "No, we will seli you the
confiscated liquor that we pick up from
the bootleggers;" and they do that, and in
the Province of Ontario they have done
it in great quantities. They say: "We
won't allow you to buy your champagne in
France or your whisky in Scotland; you
will have to pay not only the Dominion
tax on it, but al-so whatever price we
choose to charge you." Protectionists, free
traders, and ail kinds of people who think
they know something about political economy, have always protested against that
policy. One of the greatest instances of
freeing legisiation was the getting rid of
the Crown monopolies in England. Yet
here we are going to harness ourselves
again to this monopolistic chariot because we believe it is temperance iaw; and
everybody ýbows down now and worsbips
temperance iaw in one way or another.
Now, I say that that is an innovation
involving very serious danger. There is
no precedent in our law for doing this:
there is no decision of the Privy Council
which justifies it; and it is an absolute
departure fromn the entire spirit of the
B.N.A. Act. If you can pass this legislation saying that the Lieutenant Governor
in Council can prohibit importation into
British Columbia, you can pass legisiation
saying that the Covernor General in Council can prevent importation. Importation
of what? 0f anything you like, into any
county of this province, into any county
of any province; they can absolutely hoid
the peopie's rights in their own hands. The
principie does flot appiy only to liquor: it
applies to everything. If the Government
can get a majority in the House of Gommons and a majority in the Senate they
can deprive anybody of any specific article
that he uses in if e, in any township, city,
province, or anywhere else; they need not
limit it to a province. This is a very important natter. We pass legisiation here
taking away the rights of the people, and
then we stand up and say there is no ýperson so jealous of his rights and iprivileges
as a British subject. We let legislation go through here Session after
the

By accepting the principle of the present

JUNE 20, 1922
legisiation, we practically recognize the
right of the Government to take away anything they like fromn the people.
This
legisiation has no temperance basis, it has
no moral basis at ail, but is simiply an
arbitrary exercise of power to deprive
people of their acknowledged. riglit to buy
anything they choose.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do flot know
enough about the legal phases of this Act
to discuss it from that standpoint, but I
know that as long as I can remember anything in legisiation the temperance question lias been -shuffled across fromn the
Dominion Government to the local Governments, and vice versa, ea-ch one wanting to
get out of the responsibility of either allýowing licenses or of enforcing prohibition.
My honourable friend from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. Fowler) makes out quite
a case, but I want to tell him that the temperance people throughout the country look
on prohibition as something that is in the
interests of the country and of the people,
and many people are confident that the prohibition laws have accomplished a good deal
I want to tell my honourable friend and
the other members of this bouse that the
only legisiation that we ever had in the
province of Saskatchewan that accomplished anything in the way of temperance
was when bars were closed up and the Government took full charge of the sale of
liquor throughout the province.
At one
time there were twenty-two public dispensaries. You or I or anybody could go into
one of those dispensaries and buy a case of
whiskey or a keg of beer, and we could
take it home or give it to our friends, but
we were not allowed to sell it.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: You could import
also.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: You could not take
a bottle into a boarding house, a livery
stable or a blacksmith's shop, and op.en it
and drink it there; nor could you drink
it in the dispensary.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Could you not import it?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, you coùld at
that time.
Let me tell my honourable
friend what occurred through the legislation of the Dominion Government and the
legialation of the provinces. In my constituency in the little town of Maryfield, a
place of 400 or 500 people, upon the dividing ,line between Manitoba and Saskatchewan, we had two wholesale liquor bouses
within a few hundred f eet of one another.
S-27î

41U

One was in Saskatchewan and the other
in Manitoba. The liquor house in Saskatchewan was not allowed to sell a drop of
liquor in Saskatchewan, but could send it
into Manitoba or into Alberta.
Hon. Mr. LYNÇH-STAUNTON: Change
the boundary.
Hon. Mr. TURRIEF:
The wholesale
liquor shop 100 feet away in Manitoba
could send ail the liquor it wanted to sell
into Saskatchewan. The whole thing was
nothing but a farce. At the present time
they import liquor into Saskatchewan, not
for sale in Saskatchewan, but for export
to the United States, and for years past
there lias been the greatest illegal rumrunning business going on over the boundary line of Saskatchewan. I do not know
whether the samne condition exists in Manitoba or not. But 111 miles of that bound-ary
line is in the constituency that I used to
represent in the House of Commons, and
there are dozens of liquor warehouses
where that business is carried on. I know
that some of them, as many as six or
seven huge automobiles, just run lîquor by
the hundreds and thousands of dollars
worth.
Hon. Mr. POPE: There is no harm in
that.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It is a condition
that has existed for years under the law.
I say to the leader of the Government in
this House that if this Act prohibits the
exportation it will be a good thing. I have
always been in favour of prohibition, but
I have corne to the conclusion that it is
utterly impossible to enforce a prohibitory
law when a large number of people are
ready to break the law; and I say that
when the Government of a province wants
to take hold of the business, keeping liquor
and selling it to prevent individuals from
importing it or exporting it, they are perfectly right and should be allowed to do it.
My honourable friend fromn Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) says: "You are
interfering with the riglits of the individual.
The individual lias a riglit to import.'
Under the liquor laws you interfere with,
the rights of everybody except the man
who lias a license. You or I cannot sell
liquor, and in that respect we are interfered with.
In my judgment, by interfering to the
extent of prohibiting the export and import
through the Government, you are doing
more to enforce legialation than lias yet
been done. I know that during the years
there were Government dispensaries in

420

SENATE

Saskatchewan not 10 per cent as much
liquor was used as was used under the old
bar system, and very much less than is
used now. We had the best condition of
affairs in Saskatchewan that we ever had,
and I believe that under this legislation
we will get back to something of that kind.
Therefore I would like to sec this legislation go through.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Honourable gentlemen, I may say that I am not an admirer
of the policy of the late Government on
this question. The example was set them
in the first place, I think, by the administration of the party to which my honourable friend the leader of the Government
belongs in the passing of the Lord's Day
observance law. It seems to me that on
such questions as the observance of the
Lord's Day, or the drinking of intoxicants,
the law cannot be good for one part of the
country and bad for another. I can see no
logical reason why it should be a good thing
to allow the people on the other side of
the Ottawa river to go to a moving ipicture
show on Sunday afternooon, and at the
same time to prevent people who are not
more than half a mile away from doing so.
I fail to grasp the distinction. In the same
way, I can see no possible reason why
people on the other side of the Ottawa
river should be allowed to purchase liquor,
while people on this side are prohibited
from doing so. I can see no logical reason
why the city of Toronto, with a population
of 600,000 people, or the city of Ottawa,
with a population of 125,000 people, should
not be as capable of deciding for themselves on a question of this kind as the
100,000 people who happen to live in the
The
province of Prince Edward Island.
state of the law in this country is such
because of an arbitrary physical boundary
of some kind by which one section of the
people are deprived of their rights owing
to the wishes of the majority within that
boundary. It seems to me that there is no
nagic in the Ottawa river or in the
Rocky Mountains, that should prevent the
people of Alberta or the people of Ontario
from enjoying exactly the same treatment
on a question of this kind as is enjoyed by
the people of British Columbia or of the
province of Quebec. The policy that has
been followed is really one of shifting a
responsibility. In other words, practically
"passing the buck." As I say, it was commenced by the late Liberal Administration
in the one case, and that example was only
too readily followed by the Conservative
Administration in the other.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

It seems to me that there is no necessity
for this particular Act. In the first place,
the senior partner in this nefarious traffic of
giving the people of the province what
they want, that is to say, the province of
Quebee, is not asking for this legislation at
all. That province, as I understand, had
in the Liquor Act a provision making it
illegal for any person to have in his possession any liquor not purchased since a
certain date from the Quebec Liquor Commission. If that legislation is intra vires
of the province of Quebec legislation of the
kind now before us is not necessary, because no one can import after the date
specified in that province. The province of
British Columbia has, I think, a similar
provision, although I would not speak
definitely on that point. It has a section in
its Act which provides that if any person
imports liquor after the coming into force
of that Act, he must report the fact to the
Liquour Commission, which then imposes
upon him a tax equal to the profits which
it would have made had it sold the liquor,
plus 10 per cent by way of penalty. I have
no doubt that at first flush it comes as
rather a shock to honourable members of
the Senate to think that legislation of that
kind can be passed by a province, being,
as it is, practically an import tax on the
However,
product of another province.
that question has come before the courts of
British Columbia, and the legislation has
been sustained. The case in question was
one in which Canadian rye whisky was imported from the province of Alberta into
The
the province of British Columbia.
duty was paid. The importer then sued
the Attorney General of the province of
British Columbia for a return of the money
on the ground that the legislation was
ultra vires being contrary to the provisions
of section 121 of the British North America
Act. In the court of first instance, and in
the court of appeal, it was held that the
legislation was intra vires. There was a
dissenting judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Martin, and there are one or two words
in it that I should rather like to read,
because I think it will give the Government
of this country food for thought, particularly when we consider that at the present
time some of the provinces in the western
part of this country are somewhat hard up
for revenue, and may, if they find that they
can put on what to all intents and purposes
is an import tax on the products of the
other provinces, attempt to do so, and bring
into the arena of local politics a series of
questions of free trade versus protection.

JUNE 20, 1922
The Hon. Mr. Justice Martin, one of the
Judges of the Court of Appeal, after dealing with the argument, says:
If the province may impose a discretionary
prohibitory tax, (as it esse'ntialiy is in its imposition and practical working) upon liquor
then it may do so, to the extent of its unfettered
discretion upon Saskatchewan wheat, or Alberta
coal or cattle, or Manitoba wheat, or Ontario
implements or whisky, or Quebec boots and
shoes, or Nova Scotia steel, or any one or more
of them, or any other Canadian article, either
in general or in discrimination, against any one
or more provinces, with the result that it could,
in effect, build up a general or discriminatory
tariff walil against some or all th_ products of
other provinces, which disastrous internai policy
is just what I regard section 121 as being designed to prevent whether donc directly or,
equa;lly unlawfully, indirectly.

It seems to me that in that judgment
there is some food for reflection on the
part of the Government, and I think it
shows to what lengths legislation of this
particular kind is driving this country. I
submit that this is a matter which the Government should take into consideration, and
that that case should be carried te the
Privy Council te ascertain whether or not
such legislation is intra vires. However,
the legislation having been held te be intra
vires by the courts se far, what is the necessity of the kind now before us?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
going te the Privy Council?

Is that case

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: No. The plaintiff
has been driven out of businesss by the
prohibitionists, and unless the Federal Government takes up the case, I suppose the
matter will have to rest where it is.
I say, first of all, both from the experience in Quebec, and the legislation in
British Columbia, that this particular legislation is unnecessary. I say also that
it is bad in that it creates a monopoly. I
say also that if the governments of the provinces will import good liquor and sell it to
the people at reasonable prices, the individual will not want to import, and there
will be no necessity for this legislation.
Therefore I am opposed absolutely to this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I interject another thought which perhaps
has been overlooked? I refer te the danger
of establishing a precedent. I think that
at this Session of Parliament there has
been in another House a request made te
the Government te pass a law forbidding
the manufacture or importation of oleomargarine into Canada-a wholesome, cheap
food which many thousands of poor people
in this country are using and desire te use.

421

Why is the prohibition of that article des'red by a certain class in Canada? It is
for the purpose of enabling them to produce
their products without ceompetetion and to
sell them for higher prices.
If this legislation passes, and it becomes
the right of the provinces te prohibit the
importation of liquor, how long is it going
te be before a province may be here saying:
"We have the right, and you have established the precedent, te prohibit the importation of anything produced in this
province." I am opposed te this legislatien on the basis of the dangerous precedent which it will establish.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Before the
leader of the House answers the objections
that have been made te this legislation, I
should like te call his attention te this fact.
It is important that we should know the
exact character of this law. Is it for the
purpose of allowing the provinces that can
use it to enforce prohibition, or is it for
the purpose of strengthening the hands of
the monopoly that exists in two of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That monopoly
has been itstituted, I understand, for the
purpose of controlling the sale and reducing the consumption of liquor, and thus
preventing abuses and furthering the cause
of temperance.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am coming te
that. There are two laws now operative,
I believe, in the province of Quebec, by
which in certain districts prohibition can
be enforced. There are several districts in
the province of Quebec that are still dry.
I should like te ask my honourable friend
whether the passing of this law will change
the right of any man living within any of
those dry districts in regard to the importation of liquor. I humbly suggest that itwould
net, because prohibition exists there already. No one can import liquor into a
dry district now it is against the law.
Therefore, this law being inapplicable te
the dry areas, it can only be applicable te
the wet areas. If that is the case, then, I
understand, we come within the jurisdiction
and the scope of the Commission which has
the monopoly of selling the liquor. If that
is so, is net this simply a means by which
that monopoly would be strengthened in
the exercise of its trade?
When I say that, I do net want te condemn the system which exists now. At the
sane time, I do not know that I can approve in principle the state taking in hand
business of any kind at all. Se far, the

422

SENATE

results of the operation of that legislation
in the province of Quebec have not been
bad. But can my honourable friend interpret the fact that individuals can import
liquor into the province of Quebec as being
a very serious menace to the nonopoly? It
is not, except in one respect: the monopoly
being estaiblished and money being made,
there is a great temptation for that monopoly to abuse its power and to increase the
prices and thus increase its profits. The
right to import is really a tempering, so to
speak, of this monopoly, and perhaps it is
also an inducement to it to keep within
reason the prices at which it sells liquor
to the public.
I can hardly agree with my honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
when he states that the legislation empowering the Commission in the province
of Quebec is now sufficient to prevent any
man from importing. I do not believe that.
Either you can import legally or you can
not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt very
much the right of the province in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If you can import, surely you can hold the goods you
have a right to import. Possibly it is a
doubt that bas crept into the minds of the
provincial Governments of both provinces
that has brought about this legislation. I
submit that it is not legislation to enforce
temperance; it is legislation to make tighter
the holid of the monopolies on the two provinces. Let us admit that they may have
a hold of the province, but it is going rather
too far to allow the grip to be so tight that
it would choke all importations. Let well
enough alone.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Casgrain, the
debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until 3 p.m. this

the various sittings.
For the present Session 139 notices of

Of the applications presented 105 were
from residents in the Province of Ontario
and 8 from residents in the Province of

An analysis of the occupations followed
by the applicants brings forth the following facts, that one is an accountant, one
is an agent, one is an apprentice, one is an

The last issue of the Canada Gazette contained ten notices of intended applications
for divorce for the next Session of Parliament.
Many people are under the impression
that as soon as we finished with applications for divorce by retur-ned soldiers
the number of applications would become
fewer. You will observe by the list of
occupations which I have read out that
there are very f ew petitioners who now
give their occupation as returned soldier.
I arn therefore inclined to think that in
future we shall have about as many divorce
petitions to deal with each year as we have
had during the present Session. I arn also
of the opinion that now iB the time for the
Senate to consider serîously the propriety
of providing Divorce Courts for the provinces, particularly the provinces of
Ontario and Prince Edward Island, and
perhaps the province of Quebec, because
in that province there are many people who
would very likely desire to have the samne
privilege of securing divorce as the people
in, say the province of Ontario. At next
Session, I think, we should bring forward
a Bill and see if it is not possible to place
on the statute book a law which will provide for the granting of divorces withour
our being obliged to take up the time of
this Parliament in dealing with questions
which should properly be deait with by
the regular courts of the land.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I arn just
wondering whether, prior to deciding upon
any such legisiation as is suggested by my
honourable friend, it would not be desirable
to hear frorn those provinces whieh my

honourable friend has mentioned, through
their officiai organs, the provincial legislatures.
The report was concurred in.
CANADA TEMPERANCE BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resurned consideration of the
motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for the
second reading of Bill 132, an Act to arnend.
the Canada Temperance Act,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, with regard to this Bill I have
been asked by the solicitors of Hiram
Walker and Comnpany, of Walkerville, to
say that according to the legal advice
they have obtained it would be impossible
feor themn to ship anything outside of their
own distillery, because the transportation
of intoxicating liquor into and through a
provin)ce can be done only by common
carriers. The common carriers are not at
the place where the distillery is. They
would have to go not rnerely across the
street, but, shipping by water, they would
have to go through even to the town of
Windsor, which is a couple of miles west
of Walkerville. Therefore, while they
might manufacture liquor until they were
black in the face, they could not ship anything, according to their lawyers' interpretation of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That wiii corne up
in Conirittee.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
is in this Bill a provision to cover that.
"Exceptîng for delivery direct to and
frorn such -common carrier," the Bill says.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My contention is that the Bill as drafted covers the
point. If it does not, we rnay look into the
question in *Conimittee.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The difmculty
is that the common carrier is restricted to
water and railway. If you cannot carry
except by water or by raiiway, then, you
cannot carry across a highway. That is
the difficulty.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, before the motion
is put, I desire to, ask the indulgence of the
Chamber for a f ew moments whilst I presoins views wîth reference to
sent
this legisiation. I do not think it would
be without some use to take a little more
extended view of the whole subject and
make a little analysis of the difference.
between the two parts of this Bihk

424

SENATE

It is rather striking when one thinks
that the lapse of a single lifetime covers,
within our country, a tremendous change
with reference to the sale and use of intoxicating liquors. Seventy-five years ago
there was very little agitation with reference to the matter. There was very little
severe restriction as to importation, manufacture, or sale, and the public sentiment
was quiescent almost to a degree. I can
-quite well remember when as a mere youth
I first heard the impassioned appeals of
temperance lectures-men who, in most
cases, had gone through the fire themselves
and were now warning their fellow men as
to the perils and dangers. The 75 years
from that time to the present mark a most
To-day you have
wonderful change.
scarcely a country in the world in which
there has not been and is not now strong
propaganda against the abuse and to a
varying extent the use of intoxicating
liquors. There are hardly any Christian
countries that have not more or less severe
legislation, running from control by license
up to control by governments and to actual prohibition, and in the greatest and
most compact country of the world, which
lies to the south of us, there are 110 millions of people who have gone through the
whole gamut of changes with reference
to sentiment and legislation, and have
ended, after legislation through the States,
in placing the 18th amendment in the Constitution of the United States, thereby irrevocably fixing the prohibition of the licensed
saloon.
We may have our individual views with
reference to this matter, and each man has
a perfect right to his own. I am not
bigoted; neither do I wish anybody else to
be; and we will treat each other's conscientious ideas and feelings with reference to
the question with the utmost liberality.
But let us look into just this phase of the
question. When in Canada, after Confederation, the sentiment in favour of doing
something to curb the excesses of the sale
and use of intoxicating liquors was made
evident, people came to the Federal Parliament and asked it to pass a law prohibiting the sale, importation, and manufacture of intoxicating liquors. That was
pressed with a great deal of strength and
power from different parts of the Dominion. Later on a plebiscite was taken
for the Dominion, and although all the
provinces of the Dominion with the exception of Quebec voted strongly in favour of a
prohibitory law, the government of that day,
and the Federal legisiature of that day,
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

did not see fit to implement that. The
reason was, principally, that you might
put prohibition into effect by a Dominion
law, but with the sentiment of a large province like Quebec, not in favour of prohibition, you would have a law which would
not be well carried out in that large section
of the country, and therefore the effect
upon the law and order generally would
not be what it ought to be. Besides, that
might lead to a reaction of opinion which
would detract from the opinion which
had been passed with the assent of the
majority of the other provinces of the Dominion.
At the same time, in a democratic country, and rapidly growing more democratic,
it was felt a hardship and an injustice to
keep within the sphere of sale through the
licensed dram-shop a community which did
not want such dram-shops; and the first
thing that was done-and, after -all, on
looking back, it was a reasonable compromise-was to give a local option to the
small 'area, the municipal area, which if it
w:shes may banish the sale of intoxicating
liquor from its limits by a majority or a
two-thirds vote. That was the old Dunkin
Act, and the old Scott Act later. What always happens is this-that in proportion
to the smallness of the area which comes
under prohibition, surrounded by areas
where there is no prohibition, you make
it more difficult to carry out the law effectively in the small area.
The next step was to enlarge the area,
and so in due course of time the area was
enlarged. If it was a right thing, a fair
thing, a democratie thing, a constitutional
thing to make the county the area, it was
equally so to make the province the area;
but in making the province the area you
had this added condition, that you would
have a larger part under the prohibitory
law, and therefore you would have a better
opportunity of successfully carrying it out.
Well, that went through.
Now, there are some people who stick
greatly for the constitution. I admire the
constitution; I stand by it loyally; but,
after all, I say this-that the constitution
is made for the people, and not the people
for the constitution; that the constitution
expresses the strong, ardent, militant spirit
of its people, and with this strong, ardent,
militant spirit in the community, it will
change its constitution in order to give it
a proper habitation. The constitution is a
temple of the best conscience, the best
sense, and the best intellectuality of the
people for whom the constitution is used;

JUNE 20, 1922
so that we may change our constitution, and
will change it from day to day, or from
year to year, or from decade to decade.
9Hence, I say again, if rwe do give over in
certain respects, by a delegation to a certain extent-although not a delegation in
fact-the powers that we possess. if it is in
the interest of the common weal to do it,
we are quite justified in listening to the
demand for it and in doing it; and if the
time comes when the constitution which we
have bas become a little too narrow to
accommodate the vital being that is enshrined, then the constitution bas to be
widened and broadened in order to suit the
spirit of the times.
Now, you have that third development
that I spoke of. The provinces by large
majorities, repeated over and over again,
voted in favour of prohibition for their different provincial limits. They went to work
to enforce the law; but the first thing they
found was that the province beside them
which did not have prohibition. with a
mere line dividing them, and with every
facility for exporting liquor into those
provinces that had passed prohibitory laws,
brought up again the old difficulty
of enforcement because there was facility
for importations and exportations, which
tended to make it difficult to enforce the
law.
The Dominion legislature was invoked,
and it said: "If we thought it a good
thing to give the provincial area, and to
enable it to pass a law prohibiting the
sale, with only the idea that it was for
the betterment of the people living within
that area, if, when they come and tell us
that the facility of importing into that
province from the provinces surrounding
them is such as to make it impossible for
them to well enforce it, are we not justified in going one step farther?" So we
did. We said: "Very well, if that is your
difficulty, if you wish the importation into
your province stopped, take the constitutional method, the democratic method, of
intimating that wish; and if you intimate
that wish, we will not give over our
powers to you, but we will put our powers
into execution to aid you in that respect
towards the better enforcement of the
law."
So the next step was that importation
was forbidden by Federal legislation into
those provinces. Then those provinces
found that they were beset by another
difficulty. It comes out as one reads the
discussion in another Chamber, particularly in the case of Saskatchewan. A

425

plebiscite was called in Saskatchewan, and
the people there voted by a very large
majority in the affirmative: they wanted
the exportation stopped, and so the plebiscite carried. But there was a four
months' interregnum between the time of
the plebiscite and the time when legislation could be enacted in the legislature.
The will. of Saskatchewan was definitely
known, but the interregnum made it possible for liquors to be exported and stored
there.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Imported.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
No, exported from other sources, and
stored there. Now, do not let us run
away with any misapprehension-which
I had at first, and which some of the rest
of us may have had-that those export
bouses in Saskatchewan, or in other provinces that have prohibition, are Dominion
export houses. They are not. The Dominion bas a right to license. a brewer,
or a distiller, in any of those provinces,
and it has not forgone that right. It bas
a right to license warehouses, and it bas
not forgone that right. But in the province of Saskatchewan these bouses are
not Dominion licensed warehouses, but
warehouses from the livery stable up to
any other kind of a shack in which people,
who knew exactly what the sentiment of
Saskatchewan was, forestalled that sentiment because of the interregnum and, it
is said, sent a million gallons of liquor
and stored them here and there and
everywhere in the province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: When will the
interregnum cease?
It bas
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ceased.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The plebiscite was in 1920, and the legislature met three or four months thereafter and passed the legislation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is the trade in
liquor still going on in Saskatchewan?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It bas been stated in another Chamber
that there are now 59 of those unlicensed
warehouses, that is, places where intoxicating liquors are stored for export, purposes. I read the statements of members
of the House of Commons living in those
localities, and who are fresh from them,
and all that we have to do is to read them
in order to know what, in practice, is

SENATE
carried on, and what we knew in theory
would be carried on under such circumstances.
There are 59 places where
liquor is stored; that is, 59 resources for
bootleggers; that is, 59 depots where
automobiles are loaded with liquor and
sent by night express through to the
United States, where they have to be
smuggled and taken care of, illegally,
against the comity of a neighbouring
country. That means that there are all
the leaks between those different warehouses and their ultimate destination, and
that consequently there is an equipment
which it is impossible for the Saskatchewan Government successfully to cope
with in the enforcement of the law.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, you go out there on the prairies and
take a look around, and see how far your
eye will carry you; find out the distribution
of population on that prairie, the little settlements here and there and everywhere,
and with 59 places equipped, and under the
incitement of tremendous profits; aind I
think you will find that, even with all your
organizing ability-and you have great organizing ability-you would be put to your
uttermost to carry out the law efficiently.
However, the people in Saskatchewan have
their own view with reference to it in the
legislature.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Might I ask the
honourable gentleman, are there still a
thousand gallons stored there?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not know.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: ýIt would not be a
very heavy trade if they had got rid of most
of it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCIHSTAUNTON: How
rnuch had they, or how much is there now?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It is stated that there were a million gallons.
I do not know how much went in;
there may have been two million gallons,
and there may have been much more.
I
have no definite statistics, neither has anyone else, with reference to that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In what better
position will the province be if there is a
law against exporting liquor from the province than <t is now?
What I mean is,
how much more easy will it be for the
province of Saskatchewan to control, and
have the law observed, if this proposed law
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

goes into force, than it is at present?
If
it cannot control the situation to-day, what
better means will it have of doing so with
this -proposed law?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Because at the present moment there is no
law to prevent the exportation of that
lFquor from Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But there is a
law to prevent its being there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, no.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
No, it is said that there is no law to prevent
it being there.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
authorities can confiscate it.
Has my
honourable friend given any thought to
that?
They might, by provincial legislation, confiscate this liquor.
They have
done the same thing in Alberta.
All they
have to do is to seize it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I am not so sure they can cope with
:t in that way as easily as they can in this
way.
However, the people on the spot
have asked the Dominion legislature to go
one step further and make it illegal to export from one province into another province, or to a foreign country. Once make
it illegal, and then the liquor ýbecomes contraband, and it is easily confiscated. It
being illegal to export, they cannot export;
consequently they cannot hold their positions as resourceful equipments for the violation of tht law.
Now, what I say is this.
If we have
taken the first step of local option in small
areas, if we -have taken the second step of
local' option in large areas, and if
we have taken the third step and
aided these areas by bringing as to importation the force of the 'Dominion Government to bear in their aid, what reason is
there that we should' not tale the final
step, and give them the opportunity of the
best chances that they possibly can have for
enforcing the law?
That is the way I
look upon it, and it seems to be a reasonable view.
That has to do with simply
one-half of that Act.
In that respect T
am in favour of the legislation, and I think
we ought to grant it, and I think we would
take a great responsibility upon ourselves
if we did not grant that.
ýBut, to my mind, the second part of tht.
Act has a ver; different aspect. That is
the Act which was first demanded by the
Province of British Columbia. That pro-

JUNE 20, 1922
vince and the province cf Quebec have
not by plebiscite or legisiation introduced
prohibîtery laws in their territeries. In
the other provinces we have a compact
mass froni the British Columbia mountains
te the berders cf Quebec-feur provinces
which have passed this legisiation, and
which ail avaîled thenuselves, or will avail
theniselves, of this added power if we give
it to theni. In the Maritime Provinces9 we
have three provinces massed together on
the sanie line, and for them this legisiatien will be beneficial. But you have the
province of Quebec and the province of
British Columbia which have net passed
,prohibitory laws, and which seek to carry
on the liquor business through contrlgoing froni centrel of a mnore modifiediforn
in the province of Quebec to a control which
becomes, if I read it aright, an absolute
government monopoly in the province of
British Columbia. Here I think we meet
with a principle and with a condition very
different indeed.
As a temperance man I amn net in faveur
of Government menopoly of the liquor
business, for some very good reasens, as
I think. If there is any reason for teniperance legisiation such as I have described
very briefly, it is that yeu may lessen the
opportunities for obtaining intoxicating
liquor; that you may take away the distributing centres in close contîguity te
every man as 'he passes and repasses;
that yeu may take away to a large exVent the idea of individual gain, which is,
after aIl, the incentive for pushing the
trade and distribution in intoxicating
Now, this is the ideal that is

presented when you give legiglation on the
line of prohibition; it is te get rid of the
temptations, opportunities and facilities for
intoxicating liquers being bought and used
generally threughout the community. But
in the oCher case ail that vanishes, Vo mv
mind. In those monopolies-take that of
British Columbia particularly-you are net
doing away with the opportunity for procuring drink. 'You are simply taking the
sale away f rom individuni licensed sellers.
and putting it in the hands of the Government, and the Government entirely. In the
province of Quebec you are simply taking it
away from individual licensed sellers who
might make a revenue by it, and gain by
it, and you are cenfining it te a Goverument controlled systeni of commission,;
and of sellers, as I understand it.
In both. of these cases as many opportunities as are necessary are given, because
what ground lias a Government which is

carrying on business in a uine that everyene blas a right, if he wishes it, to buy,
and for which therefore it must set up
facilities, flot to give lt to every community which in whole or in part demands the
sanie facilities as its neiighbours in another and flot far distant locality? In British Columbia, for example, you are flot
lessening the opportunities for getting intoxicating liquors. If you are, you are
lessening theni only te a certain degree,
and you mîght in the sanie way lessen themn
by a systeni of licenses,'cutting off some
each year and brin-ging down the total nuniber. The opportunities for drinking are
practically the same as they would be un-der
a license system. They are flot tabeoed,
they are net hindered, they are not prohibited, as they are in the provinces which
have prohibition law. 1 think I arn right
in that.
What else are you doing? You are flot
only affording the opportunities, but yeu
are not taking away f rom that passion for
aniassing wealth which has been held up in
argument against the sale of intoxicating
liquors by licensed individuals. You arc
only transferring it froni the individual tc
a corporation, and you are transferring it
to a corporation that is a political and
party corporation at the sanie tume.
For my part, as a man wvho has been in
favour of temperance-and I arn still-I
do net view wïth favour that system, of
carrying on the trafflc in intoxicating
liquors. It 'is a peril which. to niy mind is
menacing to the body corporate. When yeu
have a license system, the licensed man or
woman makes his sale and makes his profits.
When you 'put the sale of intoxicajting
liquors into the hands cf a Government
hard pressed for mneiihds of finding revenue, and meeting the general disapprobation of the people who have been taxed more
and more after the heavy taxation already
upon them-and I amn told that the sales
last year by the British Columbia Government anxounted to $10,000,000 and brought
a profit of $3,000,000, 1 amn afraid that
you are putting it into the hands of a Government, and consequently a party, to debaudh the public conscience, to soothe and
deaden it, and to, make the ease that it
gives to the 'taxpayer. an excuse for allowing the systen to go on from. year to, year
and from deoade to decade. I do not 'believe that this is heak'hy, nor do I believe
that the people of those provinces will
wholly subscribe to that systeni.
Is it true or is it net that the facility
for drink hinders the efficiency of the citi-

zen? Does anyone deny that? Your railroad manager does not want men who drink
operating his railway; your system of automobile carriage -in this country does not
want chauffeurs who drink; your banks do
not want help that tipples and drinks. You
cannot find a single business enterprise
anywhere in which efficiency is not threatened by the facility with which intoxicating liquors can be got. You have now
more than the preacher, more than the
moralist, more than the goody-goody philanthropist, more than the women of the
country, who feel the plague where it is
most to be felt-you have the soundest sense
of the community and country-in favour of
as temperate a people as we can possibly
get. There is no doubt about that. The
war showed us what efficiency meant, and
we have not lost the lesson, nor will we lose
it as applied to the arts of peace; for,
surely, if efficiency is good in war, efficiency
is equally good-nay, better, and for a more
useful purpose-when it is applied in the
arts of peace. If waste of moral fibre and
material fibre, human units, of time that is
precious, of efficiency, which is the chief
thing called for to-day, is the result of the
traffic, British Columbia is putting it upon
a pedestal and foundation where to the
cupidity of the State, the corporate body,
there is added this great system which to
my mind will make it very difficult for a
people to throw off the incubus, but which
will not take away one single bit of the
hurt and harm which comes from a distributed liquor traffic.
Therefore I am not in favour of the
second part of this legislation. As a
temperance man and a prohibitionist
I am against it.
As a publicist I
think it is tremendously bad to put into
the hands of either Grit or Tory the monopoly of a liquor traffic which may run
into tens of millions of -dollars, a traffic
which is distributed at a price and through
mediums which are wholly at the beck of
the party in power. I do not care whether
it is Liberal or Conservative; I do not
care whether it is a party headed by the
Angel Gabriel-if he found himself in a
tight place and had a big monopoly like
that to help him out, I am afraid he would
fall from grace and help himself out. On
that ground I think this part of the legislation is vicious, and I am opposed to it.
The other part, I believe, is along the
line of our gradual growth in the last fifty
years, and I would go the other step and
give the legislative power t'hat is asked for.
We are not delegating it: we are not
Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER.

ceding it to the local legislature: we are sim,ply exercising that power when the local
iegislature makes out a case and asks us
to exercise it. We may exercise it or we
may not. It is our power, and we do not
give it up; it is we ourselves as a Dominion
legislature who exercise the power. These
are the few observations I wish to make
,with reference to this matter, and they
define my position on this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the honourable gentleman allow me one question?
Is he aware that in the province of Quebec
one cannot move any liquor from one place
to another, even from his own house to a
neighbour's, without exposing himself to a
very heavy fine running from $1,000 up
and the confiscation of the vehicle in which
it is carried, even if it is hired. Why is it
the thing can be done in Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before moving the second reading, I should like to
inform the right honourable gentleman that
the second part of the Bill, like the first
part, is for the purpose of respecting the
will of the province as expressed by the
legislature of that province. The province
of Quebec believes it has passed an Act
<which will go a long way to develop and
maintain the principles of temperance. It
believes that by limiting the licensed houses
to the sale of beer, it allows the people a
chance to have their glass of beer, in which
it does not believe there is any harm, and
it allows the public at large to purchase
its wine for the home table from the
Commission, which is governed by an Act
which makes it independent. Liquor can
be obtained from the Commission as well.
The purchaser can have only one bottle at
a time. It is true that there is perhaps a
certain facility in procuring more than one
bottle a day.
Hon. Mr CASGRAIN: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some facility
exists, because one can send two members
of the family if he pleases. On the whole
the province of Quebec protects the right
of the people to purchase for home consumption whatever they feel like purchasing. It d'oes not see that in granting that
power it puts the public health and moral
fibre of the nation in any very great danger.
The situation is very simple in the province of Quebec. We want one to have in
his own home what he pleases. We have
done away, I think before any other province, and to a larger extent than any
other, with the licensed saloon. When this
law came into force, nine-tenths of the

429

JUNE 20, 1922
municipalities voluntarily refused to grant
licenses. So we believe that to-day we -are
working on the lines of real temperance.
I believe that this Parliarnent would be
doing no barm in allowing this system to
be applied in the province of Quebec, and
in so doing I believe we should' simply be
recognizing the autonomous rights of the
province. This ie the principle which my
right honourable friend applied while hie
was, at the helm. Not only in the first
part of the Bill, but in the second part, it
je just, a continuance of the same principle.
My right honourable friend fears that
Governments, like private individuals, may
have an incentive to obtain gain and to
replenish the treasury. I have more confidence in the public spirit of the men who
are called by popular favour to administer
the affaire of the provinces than to think
that they would lower themeelves by tempting the public to drink more than they
desire. 1 know that in the province of
Quebec the atmosphere on that point is
perfectly clear and pure. The Commission
wields a formidable power; it ks independent of the legielature; and in a few years
we shahl see whether the end the legislature had in view, of bettering conditions by
maintaining the principle of teniperance
but flot prohibition, will be attained.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER1 do flot question the bona fides of the Quebec Government, and I am not questioning
the bona fides of the British Columbia
Government. They may fleel that they
have the best way. In one respect it probably may not he altogether uselees to try
different rnethods in different provinces, so
that we may corne to a comparative view
as to which works out practically as the
best. I arn quite willing to see the experiment go on. But if the ultirnate object in
Quebec and British Columbia is not to get
rid of the public sale of intoxicating liquors,
then I withhold rny consent. When an inihabitant of either of those provinces says:
"I want to buy my liquor in Scotland, or
in Ireland, or in Jamaica; I want to buy
it wherever I please; why have you permitted the buying and the selling and the
using and at the same tinie made a coniplete monopoly preventing me froni importing rny own liquors?" I withhold my consent from that monopoly, and add my caution to tlhat of some other honourable
gentlemen, that if a province can do that
with respect to one thing, it can do it with
respect to another, and that in passing such
legielation you would be introducing a system into our country which would not pro-

mote the general comity or, I think, the
general prosperity and unity of the counI arn therefore opposed
try as a whole.
to giving to such a monopoly the weapon
of exclusive right to import.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
seems to be no objection to going into Committee on the Bill provided it is understood
that we may take exception to any particular section of the Bill when it is in Commîttee.
0f course,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there -are two large schernes in the Act,
and one is free to vote either for or againet
both, or against one and for the other.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CANADA SHIPPING BILL (HARBOURS
AND HARBOUR MASTERS)
-SEOOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 144, an Act to amend
the Canada Shipping Act (Publie Harbours and Harbour Masters).
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill is to extend to the new
Harbour Commissions that have been created within later years the privilege of
appointing harbour masters.
The motiop was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
FISHERIES BILL
.SEOOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 145, an Act to amend
the Fisheries Act, 1914.
He said: Honourable gentlemen who peruse this Bill will see that it is for the
purpose of licensing salmon-curing establishments according to the value or quantity of their operations. It simply indicates the annual fee, which will be charged
on a sliding scale, on sahnon-curing establishments and on the canned or pickled
herring industry.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Is there any fee now charged?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The existing
fee for a s9almon saltery ie $50. This fee
is un.fairly high to the small operator, who
.puts up only a f ew tons of salmon. On the
other hand, it is unfairly low as compared
with the salmon-canning fee to the
operator who pute up large quantities.
For instance, the salmon cannery license
fee is $500, plus 4 cents.per case of 48
pounds each of sockeye salmon put up and
3 cents per case of ail other varieties.

SENATE

430

Several salmon salteries in British Columbia put up over one hundred tons of drysalted salmon in a season. This would be
equivalent to about 2,300 cases of canned
salmon, and keeping in view the cost of
operation involved and the markets for
dry-salted salmon, it is considered that a
fee of $1.25 per ton would compare fairiy
with the salmon-cannery fee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It is imposed on the output, then, instead
of there being a flat rate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. An important trade in dry-salted herring for
the oriental markets is carried on in
British Columbia. This business is largely
in the hands of the Orientals. At the present time there is no license fee, and it is
desirable not only that these establishments should be under license, so that
better records of their operations can be
kept, but also that a reasonable revenue
from them should be obtained. It is considered that a similar fee to that for
salmon curing is reasonable, for while the
product is worth less it costs very much
less to procure and produce it.
Everything feasible should, however,
be done to encourage the development ot
the pickling and canning of herring, as
this not only means much larger expenditure in the Province but a much better
food product is put up and a larger financial return results to Canada. It is, therefore, proposed to exempt from a fee bona
fide operators who are seeking to develop
the pickled and canned herring industries,
and who are really using largely the
herring not fit for such purposes for dry
salting. These are white industries, while
the dry-salting alone is in the hands of
the Japanese.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
ESCHEATS BILL
SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 124, an Act to
amend the Escheats Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the
Escheats Act applies more especially to
the Western Provinces, where the land
belongs to the Federal domain. An Act was
passed in 1910 to regulate the taking possession of vacant estates, and giving power
at the same time to hand over some of
those estates to heirs who had, or seemed
to have, no special legal status. This Bill
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

is for the purpose of fixing a prescription,
a limit within which a person may press a
claim against the Crown or the holder of
such a property. A limitation of five years
has been granted.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CRItMINAL CODE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 93,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Farrell in the Chair.
On section 1-making it an offence for
a police commissioner to take a bribe or
for a person to offer him a bribe:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The first
clause has for its purpose the addition of
the name of 'a police commissioner to the
list of officials who may be fined or imprisoned for taking a bribe. This official
had been forgotten.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-reference to numbers of
sections instead of three preceding sections,
amendment having inserted three sections
before 243:
It is not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
necessary to read the section in the existing Act, because without explanation it
means very little. ýSection 244 of the Criminal Code provides punishment for the
offences mentioned " in the three last preceding sections ".
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What
are they?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These sections
relate to the duties of persons in charge of
insane persons and heads of families to
provide the necessaries of life to those under their charge or care. In 1913 three
sections were inserted between section 242
and section 243, so that now apparently
section 244 applies to sections 242B, 242C
and 243. The present amendment is to
remove any doubt that there may be, by
naming specifically the sections to which
section 244 applies.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What

into the Senate a Bill by which he assumed the responsibility of recommending
that the age be increased to 16, but it was
defeated in the Senate. He was not able
to put through his own Bill, and he dropped
the measure. From 1900 down to 1921
this has been the law on the statute book
of Canada, and it has neyer been changed.
In 1921 the Commons increased the age
to 16, but upon this amendment reaching
the Senate it was struck out, and when
it went back to the Commxons they agreed
to the change which the Senate had made.
The Commons adopted the view then entertained by the Senate.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It was too late
in the Session to do otherwise.

Hon. Sir JAMES 'LOU'GHEED: Yes.

Right Hon. ýSir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Was that perforce or because of agreement? My recollection of the matter was
that there were in the Bill several provisions that the Commons desired to see
passed into hegisiation; that the Senate
accepted ail but this one and did not assent to this; and that at the late period
of the Session we thought it best to sacrifice that part rather than to lose the whohe.
But I do not think it was an assent by
either the Government or the House.

advisedly that the Commons have never
given it the same consideration as the
Senate has done.
Now the question arises whether, after
alil the thought we gave to this matter in
1921-and I doubt that there was any
subject which received more attention at
the hands of the Senate than these amendments to the Criminal Code-we should
to-day recede from the position we have so
strongly held, just because one or two individuals in the province of Ontario seek
to obtrude their views upon the Parliament
of Canada. Let me say further that, notwithstanding this question having been
before the Senate for over twenty years,
notwithstanding it having gone before
special committees in the past, and notwithstanding the advocates of the proposal having been present at almost every session
when it was discussed, I am aware of any
occasion upon which the promoters of the
amendment have submitted to the Parliament of Canada any facts or evidence
showing the necessity of any change in the
law. If there is an abuse upon the statute
book, I am satisfied that the Senate will
always, with alacrity, not only listen but
be prepared to act for the purpose of protecting public morals; but there should be
some reasonable evidence before the Senate when we place upon the statute book
an amendment which, I say, is a menace to
the community. There is no reason to suppose that a girl of fifteen years of age
cannot protect her chastit-, Particularly

best attention in the past. The present
provisions provide for the protection and
the safeguarding of public morals so far
as our knowledge goes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not sure
that we would be doing our duty towards
the girl of sixteen, or whose age runs from
fourteen to sixteen, by not giving her the
advantage of this amendment. I say I am
not sure, because I am somewhat reluctant
to admit that a girl is not still practically
in childhood up to sixteen.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: So is a
boy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have the
Juvenile Delinquents Act, which fixes the
age limit for childhood at sixteen. We have
the Prisons and Reformatories Act, which
also says sixteen. All the provinces which
have enacted legislation for the protection
of children have fixed sixteen. Now, I am
not one of those who have had considerable
experience in the administration of any of
those Acts; I have not examined into the
statistics of cases from the Juvenile
Courts; but I have my own inner feelings
to govern me in this matter, and I believe
my inner feelings are those of every honourable gentleman in this Chamber, when
I ask any father of a family who has girls
if he would not feel that that child, that
girl of fourteen or fifteen, moving towards
sixteen, is not a sacred object which needs
protection. I heard a voice asking why a
boy of the same age should not be protected. Well, we all know that the male is
the active element-

Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The male is
the active element; the female, the innocent
female-

The male needs

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
is no question that a girl sixteen years of
age is just as capable of protecting herself as a youth of nineteen years of age.
It was only the other day that the Divorce
Conimittee had before it a case in which
a girl of thirteen was married, and she
seemed to be a full-grown woman. -Must it
follow, then, honourable gentlemen, that we
should increase this age to sixteen and
place the youth of the country in the
hands of designing persons, that we should
make criminals of them, and subject
them to the lash and to imprisonment for
five years? I think it is monstrous to
call upon us iSession after Session, to

against anyone who has carnal knowledge

Now, we
have done that for carnal knowledge in

This is clause

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes, but if I understand it, indecent assault may consist
of a very innocent matter. Putting the
hand on the leg of a girl, or up her clothes,
is an indecent assault; and, as pointed out
in this House hy the honourable member
for Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross), who unfortunately is absent, when this clause
came before this House last year, there was
a line of demarcation there. He showed
that the Criminal Code, in respect to that
particular clause, was enacted for the purpose of defending children, and the question of sexual offences did not corne into
its consideration at ahl; sexual off ence
began only after the child was fourteen
years of age.
It appears to me that it
would be a very serious proposition to alter
the Criminal Code frorn its present reading,

knew a case last year where a girl, who
appeared to me to have as much knowledge
as a waman of twenty, swore an offence
'against a nman-in fact, a young school
boy-under section 301. I did not think
there was any such case as she swore to

carnal knowledge of ber, and there was
no corroboration. He was just a school
boy, and was tried by the judge, who
would not find hirn guilty; but frorn the
way the girl went on la court, if there
had been a jury, they might have found
hlm guilty, and what a terrible thing it
would have been, for he was liable to be

lation of that kind where there is no corroboration r.equired, we should be very
careful, because not only are girls to be
protected, which is what is airned at la
this section, but boys and youths are going
to school where there are boys and girls
altogether. As the honourable leader of
the Opposition said, this la a matter we
have considered so many tumes that we
should not think of disturlbing this law.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Might I ask my honourable friend if that
case could not, with ail its grievances, arise
in the case of a girl of fourteen?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUN'TON:
It
mîght, but I say that there is a great and
crying need to reform the law ln order to
protect young boys as weUl as young girls.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: My honourable
friend froni Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) makes a mistake in this respect.
Section- 294 is for the protection of boys
just as much girls: it states:
It la no defence, to a charge or indicetment for

the age of fourteen years to prove that he or
she consenjted to the aot of lnde<.ency.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The
man is not named ln that, but I think there
is need for his protection.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: There are acts
of indecency other than those referred to
by my honourable frdend. Now, it la 'hardly
a fair argument to mix section 301 with
the section we are dealing with, because
section 301 deala with an entirely different
situation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It cornes to the
sanie thing.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, because 301
refers to carnally knowing, whereas there
may be nothing of the kind in section 294.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is indecent assault along the same lines.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Possibly so,
but the two sections are entirely separate
and distinct. Now, niany people devote a
great deal of time to the study of the
question of moral reforrn.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, and they

stead of their being spoken of as "socalled moral reformers", I think they are
entitled to credit for the work they have
done.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend aware that Iseveral
organizations when in 1920 we refused to
place this amendment upon the statute
book, conducted a propaganda against the
Senate, and spent very considerable time
and moved sundry resolutions recommending not only the reform of the Senate, but
in many cases its abolition? This is very
largely the work of moral reformers: they

Senate in a hostile spirit as they do

able friend that when this matter was
before the Senate on the last occasion,
the Committee asked 'the moral reform
organizations to submit cases that would
warrant a change in the law, and they
did not do so.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Could not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
were not able to do so.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: They did not
get the opportunity.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
they did: they were summoned before the
Committee.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If there is an
opportunity given to them, there will be
no difficulty about their coming forward
and stating many good reasons why there
should be a change in the law. Of course,
their attempt to reform the Senate would
be quite as futile, apparently, as to get
the Senate into the mood of passing this
legislation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: One of the

do not know.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
it affords an opportunity for blackmail,
such as nothing else affords, so far as
young people are concerned, and in marrying young people to one another.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have never
heard of blackmail under similar circumstances.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
have been any number of cases.

There

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It was also
referred to in relation to marrying young
people. We had one case before the
Divorce Committee, as I have stated, where
the girl who gave evidence said she had
been married at the age of thirteen years,
and that she had a child when she was
fourteen years of age. When she appeared
before the Committee I think she was
something over twenty years of age. I
fancy that is the case that was referred
to. I think the fact that those moral
reformers have taken so much interest in
this question, and that they are dealing
with people in what might be called the
slums of the cities, makes them worthy of
respect, for they know that this protection is required; otherwise they would not
ask for it. The mere fact that the Senate
threw out this legislation on a former occasion does not seem to be a conclusive
argument. I do not see any reason why
we should throw it out now. We have
the fact that the elective body, the House
of Commons, not only saw fit to introduce
it last year and pass it through that
House, but have introduced it again this
Session. That should bring it before this
House, and draw attention, at any rate, to
legislation of this nature. We must also
remember that the Minister of Justice,
who is engaged in carrying out the law,
has doubtless communications showing
why the law should be changed.

Matters

of that kind do not come before this body.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
they should.

Well,

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But one can
only bring them here when legislation of
this kind is proposed. Honourable gentlemen say that this legislation is not
necessary. If so, what harm is it going
to do to raise the age from fourteen to
sixteen? I think it is in the interest of

JUNE 20, 1922
the community and of the people who are
engaged in this work that a change should
be made in the law.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Those people who
aet in moral reform. are somatimes, perhaps,
actuated by good motives, but in my opinion the great majority are mere busybodies
who desire to intarfere in other paople's
business. Because they do flot have desires a.long certain lines, they want to stop

that actuates them. If they really desire

I congratulate hlm upon the position-bas
said that they would corne, aithougli the
last itima it was discussed they were invited,
and declined to corne. Do not let us put
legisiation upon the statute book with the
idea that perhaps it will do good, not knowing whether it is going to do good. or harm.
We are here for the purposa of passing
necassary lagisiýation, sucb as is essential to
tbe well-b6ing of the common-waalth. The
argument, "Well, it won't do any harni,
aven if it won't do any good," should not
actuate members in passing legisiation or
considering proposed amendments. So far
as the protection of the young person is
concerned, I do flot know what to think.
The style in which the flapper dresses in
thesa days, it see'ms to me, holds out an
inducemfent towards improper desires on
the part of the maie sex. If you are going
to pass this lagislation, I would suggast
that no femala should get the protection of
it unless her drams came witbin at least
four >inohes of the ground. To say that
people should ha permittad to hang out a

that of a young girl of thirteen who was
niarried to a boy of about tbe same age.
When a gentleman from Toronto interviewed mna yastarday in connection with

particulars set*out in a divorce case is. tbe
information as to wbo married the parties.

epoken, I think we ought to hesitate before
we refuse to give them the relief they think
is necessary and for which they have
pressed so long.
By the amendment of 1920 the age of
consent was raised from 14 to 16, but with
the proviso that the girl must be of previous
chaste character. So it will be seen that
there are two clauses in section 301. The
first one deals with carnal knowledge of
a girl below 14, where no defence can be
made on the ground of either consent or
unchastity. The second clause prohibits
the plea of consent if the girl is between
fourteen and sixteen years of age and of
previous chaste character. Now it is proposed that the words "of previous chaste
character" be struck out. The provision
to strike out these words was passed by
the House of Commons in 1921, but was
rejected by the Senate.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

Properly so.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The demand
which is made is based upon the assumption
that we have made the age of consent 16
instead of 14 as formerly. It is claimed
that the same enactment which covers the
case of the girl below 14 should cover the
case of the girl up to 16. The argument
may be advanced that a girl of 16 may
have fallen and that it is a precaution to
give to the accused the advantage of the
condition that the girl must have been of
previous chaste character. Before the age
of consent was raised from 14 to 16, clause
211 read as follows:
211. Every one is .guilty of an Indictable
offence and hable to two years' irnprisonment
who seduces or has illicit connedion with any
girl of previously chaste character. of or above
the age of fourteen years and under the age
of sixteen years.

It will be noticed that that clause, covering the case of a girl between 14 and 16,
contained the words "of previously chaste
character," but the preceding clause declared:
The burden of proof of previous unchastity
on the part of the girl or womar under the
three next succeeding sections shali be upon the
accused.

That clause 211 has been wiped out and
has been superseded by subsection 2 of section 301, and the protection of the girl
from 14 to 16 has been changed by the
burden of proof of previous chastity being
placed upon the Crown, or upon the girl,
instead of the accused.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: The girl knows
about it.
Mir GEORGE

FOSTER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So it seems
to me that there is much to be said in
favour of making no distinction between the
protection given to the girl of 14 to 16 and
the protection which is given under clause
301, subsection 1, to the girl up to 14 years
of age. It is all a question of drawing
the line. There are those who claim that
16 is still a tender age; that a girl at
that age is still in her childhood and needs
the protection of the law. There are others
who claim that there is a distinction to be
between the girl under 14 and the girl between 14 and 16. I have told this House
that I was inclined to favour the putting
of the age of consent unconditionally at
16, and for this reason I have no hesitation in moving the amendment which was
adopted in the Commons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, while my honourable friend
has made a very lengthy explanation of
this section, I venture to say it is somewhat involved on account of his introduction of section 211. If we passed the section before us, the law would simply mean
that any man or youth having carnal connection with a girl 16 years of age, no
matter whether she was a prostitute or not,
would come under section 301, which is not
disturbed and which reads as follows:
Every one is guility of an indictable offence
and liable to inprisonnenit for lite, and to be
whipped, who carnally knows any girl under
the age of fourteen years, not bing his wife,
whether he believes her to be of or above that
age or not.

Would the Senate deliberately pass a
law to sentence a young man to life imprisonment and to be whipped because he
had carnal connection with a girl sixteen
years of age who might be on the streets,
might be a prostitute, and might have
represented herself to him as being of the
age of 18 or 20? We know very well that
many of the street walkers in large cities,
many of the prostitutes in bawdy houses,
are less than 16 years of age. At the
Committee sessions which we held in 1920
on this same question the evidence was
quite clear and incontrovertible that a
great many houses of ill-fame were occupied by girls of 16 years of age. And I
would point out to my honourable friend
and to the House that a very large percentage of our immigrants coming from Europe
are less than 16 and yet are fully developed
women, and that, in the western provinces
particularl f, numerous marriages take
place of foreign girls of 16 years of age.

JUNE 20, 1922
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Fourteen years of
age.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
iess than 16. Shall we deiiberately place
upon the statute book a provision by which,
as I have said before, the youth of this
country wiil be subjected to irnprisonrnent
for if e and to whipping because sorne designing fernahe may entrap thern in the
snares. which are laid for them? Is it unreasonable that the law should be saf e-

guarded by the words which the moral reformers seek to strike out, namely, the
words " of previous chaste characterl"?
When this section 301 was before us two
years ago, honourable gentlemen, we did
flot disturb it. Section 301 rernains unimpaired in ýits entirety upon the statute book.
It is, one of the most drastic-I think it is
the most drastic section in the Criminal
Code, and yet we did not disturb it; but
we safeguarded it in this way:
(2) Every one le guiity ef an Indictable
offence and liable to imprisoanent, for flve
years who carnally knows any gir! of previous
chaste character under the age of sixteen a.nd

Section 4 was negatived.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend has just read subsection 2 of
section 301, which it was sought by this
amendment to change. I move that the
foilowing words be added to subsection 2:
The burden of proof of previous unchastity
shall be upon the aocused.
This was the law under sections 210 and
211 up to the year 1920.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
it is on the accused by the iaw now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: You
cannot presume that a girl is of previous
unchaste character. That invoives a fundamental principle of iaw, and I think those
words were struck out because they were
unncessary. No court 'wiil presume that a
girl was unchaste.

SENATE

amendment to strike out the words "of
previous chaste character" was passed by
the Commons. It having been lost, I am
suggesting that we should throw upon the
accused the onus of proving that the girl
of whom he had carnal knowledge and who
was between 14 and 16 was not of previous
chaste character.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: If the girl gave
evidence that she was previously chaste,
would not that satisfy the onus? What
more is wanted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
onus has not been disturbed. In the first
place section 5 of the Bill proposes to
strike out section 17, passed in 1920. By
that section we modified somewhat the
matter of onus. The section reads as
follows:
On the trial of any offence against sections
four, flve or eight of this Act, he trial judge

may instruct the jury that if in their view the
evidence does not show that the accused is
whoIy or chiefly to blame for the commission
of said offence, they may flnd a verdict of
acquittai.

Under the Act the question of mitigation

could not be raised, but under section 17,
which it is sought to strike out by section
5 of this Bill, it is in the hands of the
judge, and surely it is not unreasonable
to say that the judge may surely it is not
unreasonable to say that the judge may
instruct the jury that if in their view the
evidence does not show that the accused is
wholly or chiefly to blame for the commission of the offence they may find a
verdict of acquittal. If the man is not to
blame, and if the woman is to blame-if she
is a designing strumpet and brings him
into court with a view to sending him to
prison for life, surely the jury should be
instructed that it was a work of design
and the accused was not wholly or chiefly
to blame for the commission of the offence.
And that provision is now sought to be
struck out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not
insist upon my amendinent, because I
believe the point made by the honourable
gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) is well taken, namely, that the simple
affirmation of the girl would throw the onus
of proof upon the accused.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was withdrawn.
On section 5-provisions respecting
instructions to jury in cases of seducing
girls between 16 and 18, seducing female
employees, carnally:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 17 of
chapter 43 of the Statutes of 1920 is the
clause which my honourable friend (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) has just read.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Why is it to be
repealed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In 1920
amendments were passed raising the age
in case of seduction from 16 to 18 years
and making general the offence of seducing female employees, instead of restricting
it to female employees of certain classes,
and the age in the case of carnally knowing girls was raised to 16; but the Senate
added the provision that in any of these
cases the trial judge may instruct the jury
that if in their view the evidence does not
show that the accused is wholly or chiefly
to blame for the commission of the offence,
,they may acquit. This clause is to repeal
that provision.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: What is the argument against that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And it
is only permissive: it is not obligatory on
the judge to do so.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Surely it may be
left in his discretion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) voted for it when it was put in.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not sure
that I did.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED': Better
vote for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was apparently carried against the will of my
honourable friend
(Hon.
Sir James
Lougheed), but he seems to-day to have
changed his mind.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: And you have
changed yours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amendment comes from the Commons. I quite
realize that the Senate does not seem to
have changed its mind as to the value of
this amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I notice that the
leaders of the Government change their
principles in changing sides.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
,principles go with the side.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: With regard
to the section which it is desired to strike

JUNE 20, 1922
out, I took the ground when it was formerly before the House, and I take the
,ground now, that the clause is not necessary; that the judge has always had the
power to instruct the jury in the way indicated, and the words are wholly unnecessairy.
However, some honourable
gentlemen
thought it idesirable to have the words in
the Act, thinking they might be some sort
of protection, and for that reason they
were put in. I do not think it makes any
difference.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
do not do any harm.
Section 5 was negatived.
On section 6-definition of word "trademark" amended so as to include English
Hall marks, on articles of gold or silver or
of which gold or silver form part:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This clause
is to extend the definition of "trade mark"
so as to include the British Hall marks on
gold and silver. This amendment is sub-mitted at the request of the Imperial authorities, the four English Assay Officers
having urged that adequate protection of
these marks should be given in Canada,
and it is very desirable that these marks,
which indicate the purity of gold and silver articles, should be protected.
Section 6 was agreed to.
On section 7-penalty of seven years,
or ten years for subsequent offence:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
What
is the maximum?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Last year
an amendment to the Criminal Code was
passed fixing a minimum punishment for
those who steal automobiles or motor cars.
A doubt bas arisen in consequence of the
amendment to what the maximum punishment is. The present amendment is to
make it clear that the maximum punishment is that prescribed by section 386,
which is seven years for the first offence
and ten years for subsequent offences.
The section is a general one, and covers
the stealing of anything for which no
special punishment is provided.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8-conveyance of cattle without proper rest and nourishment by railways, etc.:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
By an
amendment passed last year the maximum time within which cattle could be kept
in cars for transportation was extended

441

from 28 hours to 36 hours if the railway
has a written request to that effect from
the owner or person in charge of the shipment. It has been found by experience
that this extended time enables the railways to carry the cattle with much greater
expedition, and therefore reduces the suffering of the cattle; but it was found difficult in some cases to get the written consent of the owners, there being no person
in charge who could give the consent required by the statute, and this bas led to
inconvenience as well as to unnecessary
delay in the movement of the cattle. This
clause therefore removes the requirement
of the written consent.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Is it
just striking out the written consent?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the
explanation that I am given by the Department.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:: Does it not extend twenty-eight hours to thirty-six?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; the
hours could be extended from twenty-eight
to thirty-six under the old Act, but it
needed the consent of the owner, and it was
hard to get the owner's consent within the
proper time.
Sections 8 and 9 were agreed to.
On section 10-section giving Clerk and
Deputy Clerk of Peace of Montreal and
Three Rivers certain powers of a Justice:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Under section 605 as amended last year the Clerks
and Deputy Clerks of Peace of Montreal
and Three Rivers have certain powers in
connection with arrests, search warrants,
and bailing the accused. The Attorney
General's Department at Quebec have asked
that these provisions might be repealed, as
they have not been found to work satisfactorily, and there is no further reason for
the continuance of these powers now that
facilities are afforded the administration of
the law by district magistrates.
Section 10 was agreed to.
On section 11-certain fines in Ontario to
be paid to the municipalities:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under section
1036, with certain exceptions, where no
special provision is made for their application, fines, penalties and forfeitures, etc.,
are paid over to the province. In Ontario
a large number of municipalities have asked
that these fines may, in Ontario, be paid

442

SENATE

to the municipality which wholly or in part
bears the expense of administering the law
under which the sane are imposed, and this
clause is to carry out that request.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What is the attitude of the Ontario Goverament in regard
to this?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have gone
through the discussion which took place in
the Commons, and I have seen nothing to
indicate what was the attitude of the Ontario Government.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It seems to me we
should not pass such legislation which
affects so materially the Ontario Provincial Government, without some information
from them as to whether they favour it
or not.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
is another reason also. I have known cases
in which magistrates thought that by increasing the revenue of the municipality
under by-laws they would be doing a good
act. In cases where they get their salaries
from municipalities the magistrates might
be inclined to impose larger fines, so that
when they ask for an increase of salary
they can say, "Look at the revenue we
bring in to you." I have known such arguments used.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
what is the opinion of representatives of
Ontario in this Chamber.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
do the fines go now-to the Dominion?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, they go to
the province.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It seems an unfriendly act on the part of the Commons
and the Senate to pass legislation of this
kind without asking the views of the
Ontario Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am disposed
to suspend that clause and obtain information on that point.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: It says, " wholly or
in part." I suppose there might be some
substance of justice in the Province objecting, but I should not think it would at all
apply where the expense is borne only in
part by the Province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It might cover
only the fines from Federal legislation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Might I ask
why this clause applies only to the province
of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because the
system in Ontario is different. I understand that some counties or municipaliies
build their own court-houses, and carry
practically the principal part of the costs
of the administration of the law.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: They
pay for the jury and all that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Other provinces have not the same system. I know
that in Quebec the Government pays.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: In Ontario the
administration of justice is borne principally by the Government, and a certain
amount of assistance is given by the municipalities. The counties contribute towards
the administration of justice, and it depends for its returns to a very great extent on the fines. Some expenses are borne
entirely by the county, and others by the
county and the province. It would be taking away from the province certain moneys,
not only fines, but estreats, penalties and
forfeitures, etc.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will have
this clause stand, and get the information
to-morrow.
Section 11 stands.
On section 12-section made to extend to
corporations:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 1038
provides how pecuniary penalties imposed
under the Act for which no mode is prescrilbed for the recovery may be recovered
by civil action at the suit of the Crown or
any person suing as well for the Crown as
for himself. It is now proposed to so
amend the section as to make it extend to
corporations as well as to private persons.
Section 12 was agreed to.
On section 13-definitions: feeble-minded
person; carnally knowing idiots:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I think the word
"dumb" might be struck out, because a
person might be deaf and dumb and yet
have a very acute mind: there have been
I think "feeble-minded"
such cases.
should be inserted, because the feebleminded certainly require every protection
that can be thrown around them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The first
clause deals with the Interpretation Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Section 13 was agreed to.

Yes.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What is the reason
for niaking this change?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know of a
reason that has arisen in my province.
In Mpntreal we have been confronted with
a great many cases of people being vietimized by men operating on streets and
in saloons, who were filching money frrom
innocent people in the most cruel way, and
there was a general outcry that something
should -be done to stop such business. Some
actions were taken, and people were arrested, but it was founld that they could

has for its object the preventing of the
ignorant public froin being victimized by
those gaines. They are generally managed
hy people who have moved from the United
States, and who go from one city to another and succeed in making a few hundred dollars illegally by their smart tricks,
at which they are past masters, and who
are living thus on the public. I amn sure
that this section is to- cover such cases as
I have mentioned, but I will talce it up tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:,If xny honourable
friend is going to give consideration to
this section, I would ask that he consider
another amendaient to section 286. I observe that that section is directed against
lotteries or prizes in cigar stores, and
offences of that description, and it makes
them indictable offences, liable to imprisonment for two years and a fine not exceeding
$2,000. I notice that by subsection 6 (b)
there is an exemption in the case of:
Raffles for prizes of small, velue at any

bazaar held for any charitable or religlous ohWet, if permission to hold the same has been
obtained from the city or other municipal council, or froni the mayor, reeve or other chief
officer of the clty. town or other munielpality,
,wherein such bazaar is held, and the articles
raffled for thereat have first bee.n offered for
sale and none of them are of a value exceedinig $50.
I would like the leader of the Government to say whether he can draw any
distinction in principle between a raffle iný a

bazaar and a raffle in say a cigar store.
If lie cannot, would lie consider favourably
a motion to repeal that?
Hon. -Mr. PROUDFOOT: Honourable
gentlemen, I have an amendinent to this

that there is an arrangement made between the drivers 'of the cabs and the

Now I will trouble the House for a few
moments whil-e I read quotations from letters written by various people throughout
the provinces of the Dominion to members
of this Board.
Dr. M. M. Seymour, Health Commissioner. Province of Saskatchewan, says:
I quite agree w iih the idea as tu) the desirability of this legisiation.

Hon. Dr. W. F. Roberts, Minister of
Health, New Brunswick, says:
Persýonally, I think it Is a very Important
matter, but rather a difficuit one to carry out.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Who said that?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Dr. Roberts,
Minister of Health in New Brunswick-you
know him?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Oh, yes. He recognizes the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes, but be is
quite in accord witb this legisiation.
Miss Jean Gunn, Superintendent of
Nurses, Toronto General Hospital, writes:
The necessity for the amendrnent Is qulte
apparent. I approve most heart.ly of the attempt to secure the propoted legýslatlon.

Rev. Gilbert Agar, General Secretary,
S~ocial Service Council of Ontario, says:
The suggestion
regarding arnendment
to
Criminal Code would seem to be quite in harmony with the nature of the case.

Dr. J. A. Baudouin, Superior Board of
Health, Province of Quebec, says:
Hon.

WMr.PROUDFOOT.

I have read the wording of It and find it quite
right although 1Iimagine the d.fficulty of its
enforcement. The role of the aulomobile rides
in the Immoral sexual intercourse je weil known
but the proof that the hlring of the vehicle for
the purpose was known to the owner or his
representatives should be difficuit to establish.
Anyhow this amendment should prove a good
move in the right direction and so we cannot
but approve of It.

Dr. G. G. Melvin, Chief Medical Officer
of Health, New Brunswick, says:
1 arn heartily In accord wlth anything that
will reduce in any measurable degree sexual
promisouity, but why restrict this to motor
vehioles or even to rowboats, or yachts, or
houseboats, even If these latter beý not actually
propel]ed by gas?

Dr. J. A. ilutchinson, Westmount, Montreal, says:
Personally I ar nb favor of the amnendment
and will help in any way 1 can.

Dr. Hutchinson is a man welI known
throughout the Dominion. He is the medical officer of the Grand Trunk Railway
Company, and bas given this matter considerable study, and bis opinion should be
of some value.
Dr. J. Halpenny, Winnipeg, Manitoba,
says:
I think this ie saf e legisiation to ask for.
I arn satisfled that the automobile. In more ways
,han one, Is contributing to selfishr.ess and many
times worse.

Dr. C. A. Hodgetts, Director General,
the St. John Ambulance Association, approves of the legislation and suggests that
it be extended to private or other boatbouses.
Emily F. Murphy, Police Magistrate. Edmonton, Alberta, says:
I have your letter enclosing proposed amendment to the Criminal Code. I arn very pleased
that our Council le furthering this amendment.

Mrs. Murphy then makes soine valuable
suggestions as to strengthening the amendment. This lady bas a reputation from one
end of the Dominion to the other as a
philanthropist, and her opinion should carry
some weîght.
Dr. J. G. Shearer, General Secretary,
Social Service Council of Canada, writes a
letter of approval, with certain sugg-estions.
Dr. A. C. Jost, Inspector of Health,
Province of Nova Scotia, writes:
One realizes the necessity for action along
the line sugge.sted, though it le felt that there
may be criticieme made of the way in which the
amendment is drafted and the fact that there
has been a rather inexplicable selection of the
vehicles which might or might not be "used'
for the purpoýse of Immoral sexual intercourse.
What is meant by that terma? Can an auto be

brothel? Oan a carniage? If nat. why not?
Would it be passible to secure a conviction by
proving com'plicity on the part of the owner of

Dr. C. K. Clarke, Director, National Committee for Mental Hygiene, says:
I think the amendments are the rnt
Important you have brought forwarcl, and I heartily approve of Utn being adapted !f possible.
Dr. A. k. Haywood, Committee of Sixteen, Montreal; General Superintendent,
Montreal General Hospital, says:
This ainendment to the Crirninal Code la a
very necessary one and one whicb wiii receive
the support of those interested. If It is miade a
Dominion matter It will directly benefit each
province.
Then we have a letter from the Hanourable Mr. Justice W. R. Riddell , of the
Suprerne Court of Ontario, who is President of this Association. He says:
I ani wholly in favour of the proposed legislation in respect of mbotor vehicles. It la aU too
manifest that the Imp)roper use of these vehicles
has as much ta do with the spread of venereal
disease as any ather agency. I hope that the
legislation whidh in proposed may be pawed.
I niay say in reference to Mr. Justice
Riddell that he is frequently engaged in
trying criminal cases in different parts of

the province of Ontario; lie is a man of
the world and goes around a great deal,
and his opinion upon a subject of this kind
is entitled ta respect.

Dr. J. W. S. McCullough, Chie£ Medical
Officer of Health of Ontario:
I am of the opinion that this Âniendment will
be satisfaetory.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We aIl

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The report
presented to the Governrnent by the Canadian National Council is a very valuable
document, and if honourable gentlemen
saw fit to read it I arn sure they would
corne to the conclusion that it is high tirne
something was done in this country to
prevent the spread of venereal disease.
Why flot give the people engaged in the
enforcement of laws of this nature an opportunity to deal with the subjet from
a standpoint which they have examined
into? They state without any fear of
contradiction that the manner in which
automobiles and taxicabs are used is a
menace to the people of Canada. Why
not give them an opportunity of enforcing
the law in this way? The clauses which I
propose are such that any one who desires
to see the law enforced and who desires to
prevent the spread of this fatal disease
should support as affording an opportunity for dealing with it. I therefore move
that they ibe added to, the Bill.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if part of the
amendment would not be covered by the
decision in a recent case that an automobile was a "place" under the Act, and
that any one found there having illicit intercourse rnight be prosecuted as the
keeper of a bawdy house.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I arn not

DOMINION CHAIN COMPANY PATENT
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT moved the second
reading of Bill C5, an Act respecting a
patent of the Dominion Chain Company,
Limited.
He said: The Bill relates to a patent
granted November 21, 1916, for a puddling
furnace for making wrought iron. The
time for manufacture as extended under
the provisions of Chapter 44 of 11 and 12
George the Fifth expired June 4, 1922.
Manufacture was commenced, so the patent
is not void, but to complete manufacture of
the furnace would require $40,000, and
there is at present no demand for the furnace and the patentee wishes his patent
to be placed under the Compulsory License
Clause of Section 44 of the Patent Act, so
that if any person desires to use the invention he may obtain a compulsory license.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

There is at present no demand for the
furnace in the applicant's business and the
furnace cannot be built in advance of a
demand.
The section of the Act clearly points out
the situation. This strikes me as a case
in which the patent should be placed under
the compulsory clause of the Act. The
public, if they desire to use it, will then
get an opportunity of doing so.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

furthering the claims of the municipalities,
and who told me that, although Hon. Mr.
Raney had at one time expressed his dissent, latterly he had remained silent. I
am simply giving you General Mewburn's
statement.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: While I would not
throw any doubt upon his word in the matter, it iseems to me that we should have
something more definite than that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Even if we
were face to face with an official dissent
from the Attorney General of Ontario, it
would not alter the situation. We are
proceeding by virtue of a right which belongs to this Parliament. The statute
says that these fines will go to the Provincial Government; but legislation is now
before us to amend that state of affairs,
so that the fines in whole or in part may
be paid to such municipalities in Ontario
as are contributing to a certain extent
to the administration of justice.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would it not be
fair for the Ontario Government to have
an opportunity of being heard? That is
all I ask before this Parliament passes
legislation of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that they were heard. But surely the
movement of the municipalities, which sent
delegations to the Federal Government for
the purpose of obtaining this legislation,
which is supported by all the Ontario members in the other Chamber, has not gone
unnoticed by the provincial Government.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: In the Province of
Ontario, with very commendable enterprise,
the municipalities built municipal or civic
buildings. Incorporated in those buildings
in the larger places there is always a lockup. In addition to that, the police magistrates, though appointed by the Provincial Government, are all paid by the municipalities. Then, towns of any size have
always a fairly efficient municipal policeman. In liquor cases the provincial authorities send detectives after the whole case
has been worked up by the municipal
authorities, and then the case is taken
up again by the municipal policeman.
Then the head man comes from Toronto
and gets a conviction and goes away with
the fine. Surely after incurring all the expenses of policemen and magistrates and
lockups, the municipalities should have the
fines.
The provincial authorities have
enough ways, God knows, of harassing the
municipalities by taking money out of them.
•

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

They have recourse for revenue to the
gambling devices used at horse races, and
the municipalities cannot get any part of
that. As there has been a strong demand
from all over the province for this law, I
think we could pass it almost without question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
heartily in favour of the principle embodied in this clause. The money belongs
to the Federal Government. The Federal
Government, therefore, should have the
right to say in what way it should be appropriated. I have very little sympathy
with the course of legislation now being
pursued by the different provinces. There
is practically no source of revenue that
has not been appropriated by the different
provinces of Canada. Of late years they
have invaded the realm of the municipalities, and are now demanding part of the
revenue that hitherto bas been theirs. Today most of the ratepayers are contributing not only to taxation imposed by the
municipalities, but are really paying municipal taxes to the Provincial Government.
Therefore, it seems to me only equitable
that if the Dominion Government has the
power to say in what way fines of this
character should be applied, they should
exercise that power in favour of the municipalities.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am not against
the idea at all. My idea is simply that
the Ontario Government ought to be notified
as a matter of courtesy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was
correspondence with them.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I am in favour of
this section, and, after listening to the remarks of the honourable gentleman from
Simcoe (Hon. Mr. Bennett), I am more
satisfied than ever that all the other provinces ought to be included.
In our
province as in Ontario practically everything is done by the municipalities, so, as
the leader bas suggested, we will look after
this matter next Session.
Section 11 was agreed to.
On section 14-disposal of goods by
game, etc:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yesterday we
suspended the study of this clause, which
seeks to amend subsection 1 of section 236
of the Act. The reason for this amendment is to be found in the following facts.
It is now a common and extensive practice to use dice, slot machines, punch
boards, etc., in the sale of tobacco, cigars,

JUNE 21, 1922
confections, and even certain groceries. The
punch board consists of a board with a
nuniber of holes in it, each hole containing
a number. Men and boys pay ten cents
for the privilege of punching or choosing
the hole, in the hope of selecting a lucky
number which entitles theqn to the chocolates or other goods offered. The deaier
has a sure thing for large profits, the customer bas one chance in many. The Court
of Appeal has held that this practice is
not now covered by the Code, hence the
widespread desire and strongly feit need
for this amendment. I would suggest a
slight alteration. It bas been represented
tc me by members of this Chamber that
magistrates would perhaps try to enlarge
upon the last phrase of thîs amendment,
and that it would be better to qualify it by
one expression. I wil'l read it wîth the expression included:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to two years' inmprisonrnent who
(e) incduces any person to take or hazard
any rnoney or other valuable property or thing
on the reeult of any dice game, shell gamne,
punch board, coin table or other likýe game of
chance or mlixed chance and skili or on the
operation of any wheel of fortune.

That is, I suggest that we should say,
"other like game."
Will
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the honourable gentleman tell us what a
stell game is?
No, 1 will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
confess I arn not absolutely au fait.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does that include
auction whist?
Hon. Mr. DANDU RAND:- I think it
was a sîmular query of my býonourable
friend that suggested the addition of the
word "like," so that it reads "or other like
gaine of chance." That would niean: like a
dice game, sheli game, punch board or coin
table. 1 would not like my honourable
friend to be deprived of bis auction bridge.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
friend described a game the practice of
which bas led the social reformers to bring
in thîs legislation, that is, a game in which
the players roll on holes num-bered from
one to nine. When I was a boy we used
tc play that game with marbles. Is that
game going to be cut out? If we rolled a
inarble through No. 1 hole we got one
marble, if through hole No. 9 we got 9
niarbles, the ninth hole being much more
difficuit. Is that te be shut out? I see
'boys to-day doing that thing.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think

get nine maribles.

Parliament, because you have to shell out.
Will
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
you not except the marbles?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
it is necessary, because any one who will
faîl under this' subsection e, will have to
irduce some person "to stake or bazard
any money or other valuable property or
thing on the resuit." I do flot suppose that
niaribles would faîl under the expression
"valuable property."
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I would like to
ask niy honourable friend if that would
apply to a roulette wheel.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Sure.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I have in mind
a very pleasant evening spent at the bouse
of a friend where a roulette wheel was in
operation for very smaîl stakes. I do not
think any of those people would have iiked
to have it thought that they were running
theniselves into a chance of two years'

imprisonnient and $1,000 fine.

I amn quite
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sure I could find for my honourable friend
a clause by which any money being made
or .money or other valuable being won by
a roulette wheel faîls under the Criminal
Code.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I think that would
only be in a common gaming bouse. I do
not think roulette itself ts prohibited.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would like to
ask the honourable gentleman if there has
been any protest from the churches against
this amendment, because I see that it shuts
out a very lucrative source of revenue to
the churches. As I understand it, it is
certainly shutting out the lotteries.
But that

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: The end justifies
the means.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Why is it wrong

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend need not prolong the discussion
on this point, because we are not touching
this clause at all. If he wishes to have
stricken out the exception in favour of

bazaars for charitable purposes he can so
move.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: The honourable
gentleman mentioned the investment of ten
cents in a punch board game. Will he
seriously say that the crime of putting up
ten cents on a punch board is worthy of the

penalty that he asks the Senate to inflict$2,000 fine and imprisonment?

the raising of money from innocent and

prizes fixed on the paintings, that the winners would get as they drew the lucky
number.
This became such an evil that
police magistrates throughout the country,
especially in the large cities of Toronto and
Montreal, made representations to their Attorney General that most of the boys who
came before them for pilfering admitted
that they had stolen for the purpose of
buying a lottery ticket and becoming rich
quickly. I had the privilege of moving to
strike out the clause that made an exception in favour of the disposed of objects of
art by lottery, and the motion was carried
in the Senate.
There was a formidable
resistance in the House of Commons fron:
all the people interested in that trade
but the motion carried there also, and the
exception was eliminated because it was
felt that it was unhealthy to allow such a
practice throughout our country. The lot.
tery had been eradicated from all civilized
countries, the onlv one remaining and thriving being the Louisiana lottery; but a
strong protest came from the public conscience of the United States, and it was
snuffed out.
This amendment is on the
same principle. I purpose moving another
amendment on all fours with that which
a few years ago abolished the possibility of
running art lotteries.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: The trouble in
these cases is the administration of the law
by fanatical magistrates-and I speak for
the province of Ontario. When one considers the fearful collection of magistrites

JUNE 21, 1922
it is a serious matter to put such a law into
their hands. If you say, in paragraph e,
"or other gaine," every magistrate could decide for himself what gambling is.
Hon. Mr.,DANDURAND: I suggest that
we make it say: "or other like game". That
will bring it nearer.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: That will meet
the case exactly "or other like game." Let
me tell honourable gentlemen of a game
that is played in stores, on railway trains,
and other such places although I have net
played the game. A man pulls out of his
pocket a square top about one inch square
on which are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Each of
the four in the game puts up a
dollar. The players give the top a twang,
and the one who gets the turn of the figure
4 gets $4, or if they want to enlarge the
ante they make it $5 apiece. Would that
game be covered by this clause? New, if
you hand this statute over to a magistrate,
he says, "Shell gaine, it is net that"-because he knows what a shell game is,
having seen it played at the horse races.
He says: "'Punch board'-it is net that;
'other gaine of chance'-well, this is a
gaine of chance." You propose te meet
this case by saying that this man, one of
the four who bas been gambling, is guilty
because he bas induced the others te stake
or hazard. But how bas he induced them?
Just because he was the only one of the
four who happened te be the happy possessor of one of those tops. New, there is
a limit to everything, and there should be
a limit te allowing magistrates to say what
a gaine of chance is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does net the
honourable gentleman think that the word
"like" covers it?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: No. I would make
the man who is doing the gambling carry
around under his arn a punch board. A
shell game is usually concealed in a vest
pocket, because it is only a piece of rubber,
and is 9 sually small. The whole thing is
absurd; we are going crazy on these things.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: As the honourable
gentleman bas moved sema amendmentsHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have suggested that, but I may say that I am simply
the channel by which this amendment is
here.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would net accuse
the honourable gentleman of being in
faveur of this Bill himself. I move as an
amendment to paragraph e of section 14
these words:
S-29i

Provided that this shah. not affect the game
now played by boys under fifteen with marbles,
the stake for which is one or more marbles.

I would not let thein play for cents, but
surely they ought to be permitted te continue the marble gaine.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would rather
this Chamber would strike out- this clause
than add this amendment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If ever there was
legislation introduced which was calculated
te bring the law into disrespect, it is legislation of this kind. I therefore move to
strike out the whole clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask honourable gentlemen who are discussing this case, in what way would a fraud
be met such as was perpetrated in the city
of Montreal for some time, known as the
shell game? It was played most successfully on simple people-of whom there are
very few in Montreal-and they were relieved of very substantial sums. In defiance
of the courts and the police authorities
there, they continued te play the gaine
upon the public streets of Montreal, because courts held that the Criminal Code,
notwithstanding its very comprehensive
provisions against frauds of this kind, did
net cover t'he particular gaine in question.
While it is very desirable that we should
net be too puritanical in the way of suppressing innocent games, yet there is no
reason why we should net legislate against
the perpetration of frauds of this kind by
such experts artists.
Hon..Mr. FOWLER: I thought that was
wire tapping.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the
ordinary shell gaine.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say,
honourable gentlemen, that people have
come, mostly from the United States, te
play those games in Montreal and have
fleeced some men of hundreds of dollars;
and, as they could net be reached by the
criminal law, some way was found te treat
them as vagrants and, by perhaps stretching a point, te get rid of a formidable evil
which was developing. One of them took
an action for $10,000 damages against the
policeman who considered that he was in a
barefaced way practically stealing money
from the people. This amendment would
cover such a case. Of course, I know there
is a sentiment against overburdening our
statute law with all kinds of prohibitions,
but that is a situation which we have te
face. I remember that at the time of

SENATE
which 1 speak, there was amongst thinking
men a strong desire that something should
be done to cope with this evil.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Suppose you Say,
"dice game, sheil game, punch board, coin
table"-I do flot know what that meansand stop there, leaving out the words that
follow. Here is where you have the trouble:
"or other game of chance or mixed chance

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
ont to îny honourable friend that those
men, when face te face with our enactment,

not fali exactly under the terms that we

that these words arc added. In order to
limit the description I have suggested the
addition of the word 'like", to make it

"Iother game" would thus be restricted to
any game similar to a dice game, shel!

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
venture the suggestion that the chief infirmity in the Criminal Code lies ln our
particularizing too much and in net having
sufficiently general phraseology to cover all
classes of fraud. Lt is utterly imposible to

true, but it is not a punishment that deters,
because the law will be broken; and the
more legislation that you put upon the
statute book that is fragile and is going
to be broken, the worse it is for the wellbeing of the country. The reason for the
feeling that I have against prohibition is
that the real sentiment of the country is
not to have it, and therefore you have
turned a moral nation into a nation of lawbreakers, and you are going to make matters still worse if you prohibit these harmless games. I do not believe in the shell

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the honourable gentleman moving an amendment?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would move an
amendment. I was going to ask to strike
out the words "or other games of chance
or mixed chance and skill."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is an
amendment to strike out the whole clause.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not think that
the whole clause should be struck out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the honourable gentleman from Nipissing pressing
his amendment?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, I press my
amendment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
whether the honourable leader of the Government has any intention, by the change
which he himself bas indicated, of changing what would be the legal effect of the
language as it is now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have suggested that if the clause is not struck outand there is a motion to strike it out-it
should read "or other like game."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I followed
the honourable gentleman's amendment;
but, speaking from a legal point of view,
I do not think the introduction of the word
"like" would make the clause any different
from what it is at present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I recognize
that; the point is well taken; but it is
argued that magistrates will be more easily
directed to that principle which my honourable friend mentions if we insert the
word "like". It is because it has been re-

presented to me that some magistrates
would probably extend too widely the interpretation of those expressions, and the
word "like" might be a direction to them
in interpreting the Act.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Magistrates would
have nothing whatever to do with this, according to my reading of the Act. Section 236 reads:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to two years' imprisonment and to
fine not exceeding two thousand dollars....
a

Apparently the case does not go to the
magistrate at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under this
Act a summons can issue for the preliminary enquête, to be passed upon by the
magistrate.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The magistrate
has no jurisdiction over an indictable
offence. Perhaps the honourable gentleman
has overlooked that particular point. An
ipdictable offence must go to a jury for
trial.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Would that
clause interfere with business advertisement? Frequently premiums are offered for
the best name of an article. Could that
clause in any way be construed or twisted
so as to interfere with legitimate advertising in which prizes might be offered?
It is in a certain sense, a game of chance
to of&er a premium for the best name of
an article. There is in that an element
of gambling. Would the clause stop advertising of that nature?
I intend to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
propose in a moment an amendment which
may come very close to the point raised
by my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was attending
another Committee, and did not have a
chance to hear this discussion. If it bears
on the necessity of making clear paragraph
e or defining properly what is a crime, I
would like to say this, although it may be
a repetition. In defining crimes we ought,
I thin-k, to be very precise. To my mind
no magistrate ought to have imposed upon
him the duty of determining whether or
not a game which is a mixture of chance
and skill is a crime. It may be almost
impossible, even for a man who has spent
all his life in administering law, to draw
the line of demarcation between chance and
skill. If a crime is made of it, the result
would never be satisfactory. The magistrate might think the game was all luck
and no skill, or vice versa, and act accordingly.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps, before discussing ýthe drafting of this clause,
my honourable friend wili wait until we have
di-sposed of the amendment rnoved by the
honourable gentleman from Nipissing, to
strike out the clause altogether.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 confess I did
not know t1hat.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I would hope we do not take the action
of striking out the whole clause. It seems
to me that the case which has been
brought before us deservcs some very
serious ýconsideration. Suppose you strike
out the whoie of that clause that will be
interpreted as the voice of the Senate in
favour of ail those kinýds of games. Every
one of us knows that at thiýs particuiar
juncture of circurnstances there seems to
be a combination and employment of ail
kinds of maievoient, malicious, and ingenious schemes tu make money without
the sweat or toil of the body or the effort
of the mind, but by the wit, and these are
engineered by men who miake a trade or
business of it. What is more terrible to
think of than that there is an organized
band of mien scattered throughout Christendom who are endcavouring to make ail
the money they can out of the destruction
of the fibre, mental and moral, of humanity, by the traffic in noxious drugs. Anyone 'who troubles to read the literature of
that attempt knows that it is being prosecuted with the greatest skill, ingenuity,
and cfficiency. And what is its purpose?
It is to make gain for that class of people,
whe are flot by any manner of means the
good element of society, and to make it
out of the depreciation of the human unit
in e"thier one way or another. Sheîl gantes,
dice' ganws ail these kinds of gamesare being used.
Unless the authorities
have scrnething that tbey can take hold of,
these men flaunt such games with impunity la the face of society, and say:
"We do flot care for the conventions of
society; xve do not caro for the common
weal, or for the prosperity, the comfort,
or the happiness of the individuai; we are
makirig money, and wo will make it out
of human fraiity as far as we are allowed
to go," and thoy will go until they are
hauied up. 1 do not think you can enter the
courts of any city in our Dominion-not
to go outside the Dominion-and talk with
the police magistrates and the judges
without coming upon this thing. Constantiy and without
intermission this
malevolent
industry isbeing carried
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT,

on. Now, I do not think we ought to give
any chance to that. We ought to corne as
nearly as we can to definitions and let it go
at that. Wiil theSenate declare that it xviii
give no quarter at ail to the dlaim of society
to be protected against the class of people
who are continually attacking and loating
it iby these games? Theso peuple are the
worst ciass of society. They are organized
gangs and bodies, who go about f rom city
to city to carry on their games. There
ought to be some met:hod by which xve can
corral them in the interest ôf society and
1 think we ought not to go so far as t.oj
make the pronounicement which would be
impiied in the striking out of that clause.
Let us try to arrive at a definition xvhich
will keep the substance of it. It occur-,
to me that it might read in this xvay.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: On this questio'
of the addition of the words "other like

been said by my right honourable frierd
from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster). But lot us get right dlown to the
bottom of the xwhole trouble. The bottoni
of the xvhole trouble is that the institution
of horse racing in the provinces-and 1
speak particularly of the province of
Ontario-bas heen fostered and petted amri
in every way encouraged by the local
Government. The remedy for the whole
disease lies in the hands of the Provincial
Government. It is quite plain from the law,
that the province of Ontario has the right
to, license the holding of races. Under
former Governments the fee per day for
running races was $2,500. In one of it-,
spasms of reiigious fanaticism the DruryRanoy-and-Company Government annouriccd that the foc would be $10,000 a day. The

I know some very conscientious ladies
who are very much opposed to playing bridge for points, and with whom it is
a common practice to offer a prize at
bridge parties. Anybody who plays for a
prize at a bridge party clearly comes
within this section.
The next objection I have to this kind of
legislation is this. It is all very fine to talk
about fanatical magistrates, but we have
to look out for more than that. I do not
think very many of our magistrates are
fanatical about this question of gambling.
But we pay a great many of our magistrates and constables by fees, and unless
they get a conviction they get no fees. I
have very seldom seen a case in which a
man was pulled up for one of these trivial
offences in which there was not a fine of a
dollar, which is followed by fees of perhaps $20 or $30. That is what impels
prosecutions and the imposition of fines
for trivial offences. The squire gets up on
the platform and the constable comes wi.th
some chap that he has brought in 20 miles
or more-he has all that mileage to gainand they corne to the conclusion that the
law is all right. The accused person wili
not appeal: he bas to put up $100 as security for costs before he can appeal.
Another objection that I have to this
subsection is that it is drawn with the usual
slovenliness of parliamentary legislation.
They have half a dozen schemes in mind,
and they want to drag in everything you
can imagine. They will not take the trouble
to ascertain what they want to legislate
against, so they stick in an omnibus phrase,
whieh falls within the legal definition of
ejusdern generis-"or other game of chance
or mixed chance and skill." It is quite
open to argument whether or not these
words do not involve every game in the
world. I object to the amendment proposed by the leader of the Government because it only puts in the word "like". An
ingenious arguer can perhaps bring within
that word things that we would not think
about. Why pass legislation against what
we do not know anything about? There
might be some other game of chance, or
part chance and part skill, which
we would all approve of, and whieh

result was that horse racing was practically cancelled. The Government then had
the opportunity of stopping racing, but
they refused to do it. Drury-Raney-andCompany, finding that they were going to
lose the money, made overtures to the
horse racing people, who agreed to pay
$7,500 a day, and that is the reason why
there is a continuous round of horse racing
in the province of Ontario at the present
time. There are three tracks in Toronto,
one at least at Fort Erie, two at Windsor,
and one at Hamilton, and when the races
are ahl over in the spring they come back
for an autumn round-up, and they are
followed by all this gang who play these
different games.
If we are going to bit anyone, do not let
us hit three or four commercial travellers
on a train, who want to have a little
gamble, as it were, and who, knowing that
they cannot play euchre or poker or whist
for stakes, because the law forbid-s it on
a publie conveyance, pull out the dice and
roll them for a dollar a head, the man
rolling the highest number getting the
$6, just because they happen to be seen
by a religious fanatic who says that they
are liable to a big fine. Take, for instance,
the case of four boys, one of whom bas one
of these little tops. They have each put
up a cent, perhaps, and the one who gets
the number 4 gets the 4 cents. A fanatical
magistrate says: "They are gamblingI am going to send them down;" and their
parents are put to no end of trouble. For
Heaven's sake, let us go out after the big
fellows who are encouraging horse-racing,
keeping it going all over the country, and
who are drawing our young men and
women to the races, instead of wasting our
time over the question of whether children
shall spin a top. If it is established that
that is an offence the storekeepers disposing of those goods will be fined too. I am
quite willing that such things as a dice
game, shell game, punch board or coin
table should be put down.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CURRY: I have been wondering whether any of the honourable gentlemen who have been finding so much fault
with this particular section have in the
past been in the clutches of these dreadful
magistrates and have been fined for misdemeanors that they supposed were not misdemeanors. It seems to me that legislation
of this character must be for the greatest
good to the greatest number, and I am sure
the harm done to innocent persons is very
small ceompared to the harm done by the
blacklegs and shell-men that this section
is supposed to cover. I am quite satisfied
with the section as it is, and will vote for
it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
I think the
point made by the honourable gentleman
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) is
well taken. There seems to be a great deal
of difficulty here as to what magistrates
may do and as to what power they have.
One would imagine that a magistrate
would simply sit down, and, after having
heard very little evidence, impose a fine of
$2,000 or imprison some person for two
years. That is not so. All the magistrate
can do is to hear the evidence, and, if he
thinks it is sufficient, commit the accused
for trial before a higher court.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Of course, that is
no injury to the accused.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It removes one
of the objections, namely, that you are
placing unlimited authority in the hands
of the magistrate.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You put a man on
trial for a criminal offence.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But the magistrate does not dispose of the case, so one is
not so much concerned with that argument.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It seems to me that
a man with a nice sense of honour would
be disgraced almost as much if he were
charged and brought before the courts.
That does not seem to mean anything to my
honourable friend. He bas mixed up so
much with the divorce courts that his
sensilbility seems to be dulled.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
I am simply
speaking with regard to the statement
made that the magistrates may do the
things complained of.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton to strike out the words
"or other game of chance or mixed chance
and skill" was agreed to: yeas, 28; nays,
20.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Before the balance of the clause passes, I may say that
in my part of the world, and I fancy it is
the same in other parts of Canada, it is
the custom for two friends to go into a
cigar store and to shake the dice for a
cigar. Is that prohibited?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
tainly it is.

Cer-

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Then I move that
the words "dice game" be struck out.
Is it
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not now the law that dice games are prohibited? Certainly craps are prohibited,
and they are a dice game.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL:
There is a
statute against all gambling.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Code provides
a penalty for any person indulging in any
game of chance, but the word "induces"
in this paragraph is new.
The proposed anendment of Hon. Mr.
Barnard to strike out the words " dice
gane " was negatived.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would ask the
Committee to go back to paragraph d, and,
in order to meet the difficulty mentioned
by the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), I would
move that this paragraph be amended by
adding at the end of it, after the word
"skill" the words "for money." That would
permit the practice of offering a prize at
bridge.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I doubt very
much if that would save the bridge-player.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I cannot
accept that amendment, because I do not
see exactly what effect it may have, and
to what extent it may neutralize the clause.
If it passes, the Minister of Justice, who
bas charge of the Bill in the other House,
will perhaps be able to say what will be its
effect, whether damaging or not.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Béique was negatived.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
The whole of
paragraph e is directed to the man who
"induces." I propose to amend this paragraph to read in this way:
(e) Any person who stakes or hazards any
money on a game of chance. etc.

Would that not be better? If you want
to make it an offence to carry on the game,
you must make the individual liable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the idea
is to strike at the man who engineers all
those games.

There are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
several newspapers in Western Canada
which have been carrying on tguessing
contests as te the resuits of English football matches ;and American basebaîl
matches. The procedure is te publish in the
paper an advertisement containing a
coupon. The purchaser of the paper may
clip eut this, coupon, insert his name and
address, and guess as, te the result, and
then send the coulpon, te the newspaper
with 25 cents. The man who sen&i in the
first correct guess gets 50 per cent cf the
total proceeds, the second 30 per cent, and
the third 20 per cent. The result of the
scheme has been te increase the circulation
cf the O.B.U. Bulletin from 1,600 until
Iast week it is stated there were 300,000
guesses made. That means that in oee

457

week the amount of prise money for distribution among three people was $75,000.
The consequences are at least as serieus
as those which arise from any large
lottery. The scheme is se devised and
worked as to ren-der possible an escape
fromn the existing provisions of the Crimmnal Code in regard to gambling. A prosecution. was entered at Winnipeg before
the Judge of Sessions, and Sir Hugh J.
Macdonald, the police magistrate, dismissed the case on the ground that it was
flot; covered by the Code. An appeal has
been entered, but the Crown Prosecutor
anticipates an unfavourable decision. The
matter is more serieus because similar
schemes are being adopted by papers
started solely for that purpese. I have the
papers beçfore me, which I will lay on the
table of the Senate.
Now, I have received two telegrams,
which I will read:

Some publishers, seeing the success
which was made by other people, were
tempted to issue sheets such as this one
entitled "The First Basebaîl", which is
issued sîmply for the purpose of carrying
on the scheme which I have described.
Winnipeg employers have noticed' that
their employees have gone mad on these
schemes, and the result will be, as we found
in the organisation of those art lotteries
in the large cities like Toronto and Montreal, to which I have referred, the pilfering of money by young boys and other
employees of varieus business establishments, in order to get a chance at the big
prises which are offered as premiums. It
is obvious that this is nothing but a
lottery scheme under another namne, and
the Minister of Justice has suggested that
I should move te cover this case, by adding the following clause at the end cf this
Bill:
15. (1) Paragraph (b) of gul'section oe of
section two. hundred and twenty-%even cf the
satd Act is amended by striking out the words
"as or for the consideration" in the third line
thereof, and by repealing subparagraph (1)

thereof, and substituting therefor the following :
(i) ail or any. part of which morey or valuable thing or is equix-alent is to be paid or
given to any other person on any evýent or contingency of or relating to any horse race or
other race, flght, gaine or sport; or
(2) Subsection two of sec!ion two hrindred

cha4pter forty-three of the statuteF of 1920 is
amended by insertîng the words "between nlot
more than ten iiidiv.idtial," after the words
"atny bets" in the elghth line ther(-oÈ."

The presenit legislation apparently covers
these very samne operations, but there is a
technical difficulty in the clause which prevents those people from being reached.
I confess that it takes some legal and technical knowledge to understand the distinction which a mag-istrate is obliged to
make \vhen applying the law to ýsuch cases.
Ini order that honotrrable gentlemen may
see that the coves'ing of this offence is
simply a question of drafting a very small
modification, 1 will rend the Act as it is:
227. A c r oi

(b) orrered, kcrryt or uscii fir the parpose of

The following words are those that are
to be replaced by the new paragraph which
I have read:
.,,c- or fror tire conrideration.

Honourable gentlemen will see that the
distinction is a very slight one. The present clause deals with a contingency, game
or chance-a bet pure and simple.
The
ameadment provides for a contingency involving, besides a mere chance, also an
element of skill.
Lt is but a technical
difference, Jn the drafting of the Act,'
between that and the amendment which is
proposed. I may add that the Law Clerk of
the Senate and the Parliamentary Counsel

agree that this new clause will absolutely
cover the case that I have described. I
think the Department of Justice have also
examined this clause.

MATCHES BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

second reading of Bill B5, an Act respecting matches.

He said:

it is at the expense of efficiency or not I do
not know. For myself, I wish to have the
clauses read before I vote upon them.
But w'hat I rise for is to make an inquiry
in regard to section 5. Where officers are
appointed you will have to have inspectors
and the like of that. Is any fee placed
upon this inspection with the idea of making the Department self-sustaining? It does
seem to me that where we put on these
regulations, which are necessary, as we do
in many departments, a system of fees
should be devised which would carry the
inspection expenses so that they should not
be saddled upon the country. Is there any
regulation proposed, or any section, which
looks after that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see nothing
in the Act, but I will draw the attention
of the Department of Insurance to that
point. I know that that Department bas
adopted the general practice of collecting
fees from insurance companies for inspection, and they will probably do the same
in this case.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Folloe
:ng up what my right honourable frienu
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) has
said, I may say that I was very much impressed with the necessity of adopting some
well-defined policy touching this subject
when I had the honour of being Minister
of the Interior. J made an examination
:nto some of the branches which came under
ne, and found that only nominal fees were
being charged by the officers for the work
done, supervisory,
administrative, and
otherwise, the expense of which could easily
have been covered had sufficiently large
fees been imposed. I may mention the Explosives Act by way of illustration. Where
licenses were issued the fee chargeable was
$1, while there was certainly a vast amount
of paper used, not counting the clerical
services involved and the inspection work
necessarily performed.
I found upon
examination that in other countries suhstantial fees were charged for that class
of work. I found that we had established
a branch under that general Act whicb
probably did not pay 10 per cent of the
costs involved. I made inquiries into other
branches of the public service and found
very much the same condition existing. I
brought the subject before the Government,
but the electors of this country did not
think it wise to continue us in office so
that we could give effect to our views. I
would direct my honourable friend's attention to that want of intelligent thought in
connection with the public service. I say
Sir

-EORGE FOSTER.

with every confidence that there is not one
of these branches that should not be made
to cover the expenses incident to its administration.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
J recollect that when we undertook the
inspection and certification of grain in the
West, we fought out the question of
whether the State or the industry should
carry the expenses.
There was a very
strong opinion amongst certain persons
that the State should do it.
They said:
" Oh, let the State pay expenses; let the
public funds carry it." But we were able to
institute a system of fees. Anyone knows
that the cost of that immense branch of
work runs into millions of dollars. We
instituted a system of fees on the basis
that the industry should carry the protective measures necessary to make it a
better industry and more productive to
those who were carrying it on. We have
had no deficit. In the inspection and certification of our grain in Government elevators and in grain inspection
ve have
paid the expenses, and in the course of
years have thereby saved millions of dollars
to the public service.
The same thing was partially carried
out with reference to weights and measures. But the fee was too small. During
iy
terni of office the fee was increased
until at the present time weights and
measures and electric light inspection more
than pays its way, and there is no cost
upon the public treasury. The Patent Office
is another illustration of the same thing.
There the fees more than pay the expenses.
In respect to the inspection of insurance, a
branch of the Finance Department, fees
are fixed and the companies pay all the
expenses.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And without any grumbling.
This is one
field where tremendous expenditures have
been saddled upon the State, and that is
where we may make some of our best gains
in the matter of economy that we all speak
a good deal about. So, on the inception of
new services like this for the benefit of
trade and of the insurance companies, let
the fees be sufficient to carry them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would this House
he allowed to fix the fees, or would it have
to be done by the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

it

JUNE 21, 1922
Hon. Mr. REID: Clause 5 reads as follows:
The Minister may direct or appoint officers of
his department, or any other person to carry
out the provisions of this Aqt and of the regulations made thereunder.

The situation at the present time is such
that no appointments can be made to any
department except under the Civil Service
Act. If clause 5 passes as it now reads,
there will be a lot of faptory inspectors
appointed, and they will be exempt from
the Civil Service Act, by the words "or any
other person". I therefore ask the leader
of the Government whether I interpret the
Bill aright, and, if so, could he not strike
out these words? In that case the officiais
of the Department would be appointed in
the regular way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think that
there is no restriction of the Civil Service
Act under this wording, and that whatever is done must be done in conformity
with the Civil Service Act. I am in hope
that the Minister of Finance, he having
the administration of the Act, will carry
it on in conjunction with the Insurance
Act, and that he will find all ready a staff
covering the whole country and able to
carry on the inspection without addition
to their number.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I submit
that these words should be struck out.
Here is an opportunity to appoint a whole
flock of new inspectors. I think the least
useful men we have are the inspectors for
the administration of these Acts. I read
in the Montreal Star yesterday a bitter
complaint by a dealer in Montreal in regard to the enforcement of the Act relating to boxes for fruit. It was said that
Montreal is inundated with boxes which
are small-sized and half full, and no one
pays any attention to the enforcement of
the Act. A gentleman in this House informed me that he was told on the market
in Ottawa that the inspector there had
seventy cases of evasion of the Act, and
that not one prosecution had taken place.
These inspectors perform their duties in
the most perfunctory way, and I do not
think we should encourage the Government
to appoint a new lot of them. If they are
going to be appointed under the Insurance
Act, let the Bill so state. Do not leave the
way open for the appointment of a new line
of inspectors who will help the other fellows
to do nothing.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: In connection with
this question, I should like to draw attention to the fact that when strawberries,

461

for instance, are imported early in the
season they come in fair-sized and I presume legal boxes. But many of the dealers
in this city-I will not say all-take four
boxes of berries and fill five smaller boxes
out of them and sell them to the public.
When we are on the subject of inspection
it occurs to me that the attention of the
Government should be drawn to this, and
that some effort should be made te see
that that sort of thing is not allowed.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I certainly object
to the principle of this clause. We have
in our service inspectors of all classesmen inspecting meat, food, grain, cattle,
coal mines, and so on. In nearly every department of the Government we have inspectors who, so far as my knowledge goes,
are all appointed by the Civil Service Com-mission. As I said in connection with another Bill, if we are going to deal with the
principle of whether or not the Government itself should have the right to appoint
inspectors, I am prepared to deal with the
question; but I do not think we should
deal with it piecemeal as it is proposed to
do in this Bill. We must either stay by the
principle or depart from it. If we are
going to depart from it, let us know what
we are doing.
By this clause it is proposed to give the
Minister a right to appoint any one he
chooses, and to give him any salary he
chooses. I doubt very much whether the
provision contained in this section should
be passed. Personally, I have come to
the conclusion that the Civil Service Act
as passed some two or three years ago
should be modified. I think Parliament
went much too far in the direction of socalled Civil Service reform, and I think the
administration of Government business is
being hampeted to a large extent by certain provisions in that Act. But if we are
going to deal with that question, let us deal
with it by amendments to the Civil Service
Act which will clearly define the departures
made from the Act. I would support the
amendment proposed by the honourable
member from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid),
that the words "any other person" bu struck
out.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I would suggest to my honourable friend
a different kind of amendment, which
would perhaps meet the whole case; that
is, to insert after the word "may" the
following words: "under the provisions of
the Civil Service Act." It would then read:
The Minister may, under the provisions of the
Civil Service Act, direct or appoint officers of
his department, or any other person, to carry

SENATE

462

(ut the provisions of this Act and of the regulations made there-under.

Then every person who was appointed
would have to be appointed in conformity
with the Civil Service Act.
Hon. Mr. REID: I do not agree that
that really meets the case if we leave in
the words, "or any other person".
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not see why "any other person"
should be in it, but with the striking out
of those words I think we ought te put
the other words in.
Hon. Mr. REID: I have no objection te
that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The amendment
would scarcely do where it states that the
Minister, und'er the provisions of the Civil
Service Act, may direct or appoint. The
Minister does not appoint: the Civil Service Commission appoints. It is not necessary te insert the words, "under the pro.
visions of the Civil Service Act." I think
the section should simply read something
like this:
Officers may be appointed te carry out
the provisions of this Act, etc.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: What would be the
practical working of this amendment? The
question before us is the specification and
testing of matches. Would any officer of
the Civil Service be able te give a technical
opinion upon brimstone and sulphur and
phosphorus and the other commodities used
te make matches effective? Would he institute a competitive examination on those
points? Are there people in the country
who could give expert evidence on that
point, or who would be qualified in competitive examinations to be appointed inspectors? Would it net be a great deal
better for the Minister to take the power
of selecting some person who is conversant with the business, and of making him
an inspector, or making somebody else
superviser of the whole work of inspection, rather than submit it te the general
government of the Civil Service Commission? They have not expert knowledge
of all subjects themselves, and they must
hand over the matter te the opinions of
people who are conversant with the special
line of business upon which to appoint
inspectors or officers or servants. As this
is a special kind of legislation, I think the
Minister should have the power of selecting
the officer and discriminating as to his
qualifications for investigating that special
branch.
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

In this connection I might remark that
there is a gentleman here who is rather
supersensitive. He spoke of strawberry
boxes. I do not. think he was in the House
or he would have rebelled against what
was done when it was solemnly enacted
here that balls of twine which held only
120 yards should in fact be stamped by
the Government inspectors as holding 150
yards, and those balls of twine were to
be sent to Russia. I do not know whether
this caused rebellion in Russia or not, but
I thought it was a very singular proceeding, and the gentleman ought not te
be se very sensitive on the matter of
strawberry boxes now.
Hon. Mr. REID:
altered now reads:

My

amendment,

as

Officers may be appointed to carry out the
provisions of this Act and of the regulations

The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Reid was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I think it ought to
be obvious te all honourable gentlemen in
this House that the amendment made to
this section 5 is an attempt to evade the
provisions of the Civil Service Act. Other
honourable gentlemen have called attention to that point before, but I do not
think it can be emphasized too much, that
the Civil Service Act was passed in order
to take out of the hands of the Ministers
and Government the power of appointment,
se that there would be absolutely no political influence used in making appointments.
That Act was carried through the two
Houses of Parliament after a great deal
of opposition, but the public desired such
an Act, and I do not think it is a proper
proceeding te attempt te evade that Act.

would take this opportunity of moving an
amendment to the amendment proposed by
the honourable member for Grenville:

I would
draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the fact that the amendment
has been carried.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out that under the Civil Service
Commission Act all appointments have to
be made by that body unless we specifically
provide otherwise. If we enact that officers
shall be appointed, they are automatically
appointed by the Civil Service Commission.

JUNE 21, 1922
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I got up two or
three times to speak on this point, but
business is done so quickly here that before
I could get an opportunity the amendment
was adopted.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They have anticipated the honourabie gentleman's desires.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would suggest a
slight amendment to the amendment that
is stili before the Committee, to read:
by
'Such officers as may be deemned necessary
the Governor in Council may be appointed to
carry out the provisions of this Act and of the
regulat ions mnade thereunîder.

The phrase "officers may be appointed,"
is very indefinite, and I think the number
of officers to be appointed is a matter that
should go before the Council and be decide
by it. Once that is decided the Civil Service Commission would operate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman desires to reconsider that
clause in order to improve it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; the
clause is carried.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Do I understand the honourable gentleman to move
this in addition to the clause, or in place
of the amendreent? The amehidment was
carried.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Read the clause
as amended now.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The clause
as amended is:
-Officers may be appointed to carry out the
provisions of this Act and of tho regulations
rnaide thereunder.

Hon. Mr. REID: I think this wouid be
an improvement, and I move that we reconsider the clause, and allow the amendment of the honourable memberHon. Mr. TESSIER: No, you will have
to give notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am disposed
to favour the suggestion of my honourable
friend from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Calder).
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Calder was agreed to.
Sections 6, 7 and 8 were agreed to.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The word "wilfully" has no meaning if you use the word

The amendment of Hon. Sir James
Lougheed was agreed to.
Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 were agreed

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would like
to revert for a moment to section 7, which
seems to place in the hands of the inspector
a very wide authority, and possibly may
p]ace an individual or corporation in a very
awkward position, because it says:
The certificate of an inspecto shall for the
purposes of this Act be prima facie evidence

!n ail courts of justice and elsewhere of any
facts ascertained by him in the execution of his
duty.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: That is only prima
facie.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes, but the inspecter need not necessarily be called as

would place too great power in his hands,
simply that his certificate is to be accepted
as evidence in an action.

the section should not stand as it is.
Right Hon,. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What does my honourable friend suggest?
We must have some evidence, and it would
seem to me that the proper evidence is to
be given by the man who made the investigation and was the public official.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Quite true, if
that official were called as a witness; but
why should a certificate of his be sufficient?
If he is called as a witness and gives his
evidence, he is subject to cross-examination; whereas, if he only puts in a certificate, the other side have had nothing to
do with the making of it, and do not know
what he may certify, yet it is evidence

against them. The inspector should not be
placed in a position different from that
of any other witness; and if it is necessary to give evidence of what the inspector discovers, then the inspector should be
called as a witness and the other side given
an opportunity to cross-examine. I move
that the clause be struck out.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think that this
is very usual legislation. Take for instance
joint stock companies. It is provided in
the statute that the certificate of the secretary is prima facie evidence.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the courts.

Not in

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Of course, it is
always permissible to cross-examine the
party, but where is the necessity of having
formal evidence entered in a suit if the suit
is not contested? The mere filing of the
certificate should answer the purpose. We
have such a provision in a great number
of statutes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
the honourable gentleman miscomprehends
the meaning of that. A person is charged
with an offence under section 3. It says:
Every person shall be guilty of an offence
and liable on summary conviction to a penalty
not exceed1in'g five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a term net exceeding six months,
or to both fine and imprisonment, who-

(a) imports, manufactures, stores. uses, sells
or lias in lis possession any dangerous or unsafe matches.

An inspector goes down to a shop in
Toronto. He comes back to Ottawa, and
sends to Toronto a certificate that he bas
found unsafe matches. That certificate is
used in the courts. The inspector is not
called. The inspecter may be entirely mistaken, and on being cross-examined might
admit his mistake. He is not heard at all.
Surely no man is to be convicted and deprived of his liberty on the certificate of an
inspector who does not go into the witnessbox. All those cases in which a certificate
is accepted by the court are matters of
formality; but certificates are not accepted
unless notice is given to the opposite side
in sufficient time to enable the opposition
to compare the certificate with the original
and ascertain whether it is right or not.
Then, if it is found that the certificate is
not right, notice is given to the person
who filed it to produce the inspector, and
he bas to do so. But I do not think any
legislation bas ever been passed in this
country allowing a man to be convicted on
a certificate.

JUNE 21, 1922
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman froni Hamilton say that the
defendant would not have the right to subpoena the inspector?
He
Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON:
would have the right, but his trial is onbefore he knows that the certificate is going
ta be produced.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But would the
trial go on without the defendant having a
chance to subpoena bis witness?
Why
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
should he have to subpoena the witness and
pay the expense of bringing bun to Toronto? It is a principle that no man shahl
be convicted unless he bas a chance to face
the witness. That is what be sbould do.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: He bas the
chance. He can subpoena.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Not at

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: What do you pro-pose?
Move
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
that it be struck out.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I move that
the clause be struck out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I bave not the
Act before nie; but I am inforrned that this
is taken froni the Explosives Act, which
has a simular clause. The Bill was drafted
by the Department of Justice, and I bave
just seen a statement froni Mr. Newcombe
that he was f ollowing the Explosives Act.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I desire to express
the saine opinion as I expressed this rnorning about a different Bill: I consider that
this is freak legislation. I can understand
a manufacturer being sujbject to clause 3,
but how is an innocent storekeeper going
to get from under that clause? Who can
tell by an eye examination whetber a match
is dangerous or not? If I buy a case of
matches and store theni somewbere, and
an inspector cornes along and decides that
those matches are dangerous, I amn penalize&. It seenis to nie that there is only one
place for legislation of that descr'iption,
and that is the was'te basket. It is ridicubous to put upon the statute book a ]aw that
would penalize innocent, people for having
in their possession sornething about which
they know nothing, and cannot possibly
know anything.

for the darnages-passeýd theni on. So the

and then go and sue Eddy's.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I arn entirely in

that I have just stated, I move that the

that it be read this day six months.
The Hon. the CHAIR MAN: The motion
is not in order. The honourable gentleman
niight move that the Conirnittee rise.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I move that the
Comniittee rise.
The motion was negatived.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Chairman, before the Bill is reported it rnay be necessary to make a sligbt ameadment of paragraph b, of the interpretation clause, owing
to the change that was made in the section.
It reads:
(b) "Inspector" means and Includes any person who is directed by the Minister to perforin any duties under this A4ct or any regulation nmade thereunder.
I think that should read:
('b) "Inspector" means and Ilonludes any person who le appointed to, perfori any duties
under this Act or any regulatior made thereunder.
Under section 5 as it originally stood the
Minister could niake the appointment. That
provision is changed so that the appointnment may be miade in another inanner. Section 5 read:
EDIT1ON

466

SENATE

The Minister may direct or appoint officers of
his Department, or any other person, to carry
out the provisions of this Act and of the regulations made thereunder.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I submit this
situation to the honourable gentleman. The
Insurance Department has an entire staff.
The Minister may give the duties of inspection to some of the inspectors in the Insurance Department. Apparently he appoints no one, but purely and 'simply increases the duties of the inspectors in his
Department and it seems to me that the
expression fits the case:
"Inspector" means and includes any person
who is directed by the Minister to perform any
duties under this Act or any regulation made
thereunder.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: It was not intended
to make any new appointments?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Then it was not necessary to change section 5 except to strike
out "or any other other person". If the
clear intention was that the Minister should
use for the purpose of performing any
duties under this Act or 'any regulation
made thereunder only officers who are
already in the Department, then the
amendment moved by the honourable
gentleman from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid)
is quite sufficient.
The Bill was reported.
CONSOLIDATED REVENUE
AUDIT BILL

AND

SECOND READING

lon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 57, an Act to amend
the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the first
section of this Bill deals with the registry
of bonds of deceased owners, and the manner in which the authenticity of the will
may be ascertained before the transmission of such bonds is registered in the
Finance Department. The second clause has
for its object the closing of the accounts for
the fiscal year on the lst day of April, and
the annulment of unused balances, in order
that payments made after the lst of April
on obligations incurred prior to that date
may be included in the succeeding year.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me that my honourable friend has overlooked making a statement as to a long
standing practice in Canada with reference
to balances unexpended at the end of the
fiscal year. For instance, Parliament makes
an appropriation for a particular purpose,
Hon. lMr. CALDER.

and a letter of credit may be issued based
upon that appropriation, the assmuption
being when the letter of credit is issued,
that it will stand good for the absorption
of the entire amount. Now, I observe that
the effect of this Bill will be that immediately the 31st of March is reached the appropriation will lapse, and that may result
in considerable embarrassment and complication, inasmuch as a fund may not be
obtainable to meet the particular obligations until Parliament again meets. I can
very well understand the desirability of
all accounts being closed sharply on the
31st of March, so that all the statements
may be concluded and made public; but it
seems to me that, inasmuch as we have
observed a certain practice for a long time
-I
fancy since Confederation-the proposal to eut off practically all unexpired
balances merits some thought and consideration as to how we should meet the
situation, particularly as Parliament invariably does not meet until the following
January or February.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is not that
covered by part of subsection 3 of the new
section 50:
Provided-

That is, after the lapse has taken place-ithat the Governor in Council may, by order

In council, direct that a new credit shall issue,
terminable not more than two months asfter the

end of the fiscal year, for an anount not exceeding the unexpended balance of any such
a4ppropriation for the purpose cnly of discharging any proper debt, or to meet any obligation properly incurred. which may be outstanding chargeable thereto.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has my
honourable friend the section that we repealed--subsection 2 of section 53.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am reading
the section which it is now proposed to substitute.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: By that
section we are repealing subsection 2 of
section 53 of the Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And substituting
what I am reading now. Does not that
cover it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
a little curious to know what the present
law is on the subject.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: All payments
made under the authority of such Order in
Council shall be included in the accounts
of the next following fiscal year, so I cannot see that my honourable friend is right

JUNE 21, 1922
in anticipating that any danger might
arise from the issuing of a letter of credit,
for the moment it lapses the Governor
in Council may revive it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may give the
explanation given by the Minister of Finance. He said:
Under our practice which has prevalled for a
long time, whi-le the fiscal year ends on'the
31st of March, a month is allowed for the preparation of accounts, and then there is provision
that a further allowance of time may be made
which, I regret to say, Is usually availed of.
The consequence is that there ia considerable
delay in the preparation and ultimately in the
publication of the accounts, and that acts upon
the date upon which we are able to commence
the business of Parliament. I think it would
be very heljpful if we could get the public accounts into better shape. We propose to adopt,
therefore, the English system, which is that the
accounts shall close on the 31st of March just
as they are. Any balances of appropriations
that have not been expended, or the paying out
of which has not been authorized, will lapse;
if there are any credits issued against which
cheques have not been -drawn, they, for the
tiane, will lapse, but provision is made that
such credits may be renewed and the expenditure charged against the expenditure of the
follow-ing year. The great point is to give the
officiais authority to close the accounts on the
31st of March.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
but how would they be renewed?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Council.

By Order in

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does my
honourable friend read from subsection 3?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, of section
2-the 5th line.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
As far as I can see, it simply makes a difference in the keeping of the accounts,
and makes it possible to close the accounts
promptly and sharply. We had them that
way once; then we used to allow a month
more, or maybe another month, so they
would run probably three months. Now the
accounts are to close on the 31st of March.
There are payments yet to be made, and
there are letters of credit issued. Those are
renewed by Order in Council. A contractor
does not have to wait until there is another
Session of Parliament. The payments are
made just regularly as under the old
system.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He will
have to come within the two months.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is long enough.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

CONSIDERED IN

WOMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 57, an
Act to amend the Consolidated Revenue and
Audit Act.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1-transmission of bonds
registered in the name of persons dying
domiciled abroad:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not prepared to say that the criticism
which I am about to advance need receive
any very serious 'attention, but may I
point out that in glancing over the Bill I
find no provision for any disputation which
may .take place on any of the documents
mentioned in the paragraphs a, b, and c.
Let us assume that litigation has been
started or that any doubt has been thrown
upon the act of the testator or the deceased. The will is duly acted upon at once
as to the registration of the bonds in question. It seems to me that there should be
a lapse of time before the filing of the instruments referred to, so as to permit of
the settlement of any doubt which may
have arisen as between the instrument itself and the beneficiaries or those interested in the winding-up of the estate. For
instan.ce, if those bonds are handed over at
once to the parties claiming to be the beneficiaries under any of these instruments, it
would then be too late to dispute any rights
which may be in question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Any question
of that kind would arise in the courts to
which application for probate has been
made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
but should not reasonable time be given for
notice to reach the parties interested who
may dispute the rights of those asserting
them? Let us assume that a will has
been proved, and that immediately probate
takes place. The will is at once forwarded
to the Department, and possession of the
bonds is given to those who assert their
rights under the will. There may be other
parties interested.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is so, but
those parties would know and they would
notify the Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let us
consider.
Authenticated copy of the probate of the will

of the deceased owner, or of letters of administraétion of hie estate.

It is very well known that letters of
administration are frequently issued with-

SENATE

468

out the court issuing them being seized of
all the circumstances, and such letters are
frequently withdrawn or cancelled' and new
letters issued to some one else.
Then, under paragraph b:
An authentie notarial copy of the will of the
deceased owner, if such will is in notarial form
according to the law of the province of Quebec.
Suppose that immediately a notarial
copy of that is secured it is lodged in the

Department of Finance and the bonds are
handed over. The next day there may be
some dispute as to the will or the rights
of the persons asserting them.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This is dealing only
with Dominion securities. In the case of
bonds belonging to an estate, the moment
letters of administration are granted the
administrator may pay them to the legatee.
There is no delay for that, and it would
not be practicable, I think, to provide for
any delay. It is for those who have rights
to assert them in time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They are presumed to know the law.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Suppose they have no notice of the death for
some two or three weeks.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Take other bonds.
We should not make a law which will work
differently in the case of Government
bonds than it does in the case of ordinary
bonds or bank stocks.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
would be recoverable, but here you practically place the cash in the hands of the
parties interested.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Take bonds and
securities payable to bearer. The moment
letters of administration are received, they
may pass away from the estate. It is for
the party who claims to have any rights
to protect his rights. We should not make
exceptional provisions with regard to
Dominion securities.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
agree entirely with my honourable friend
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique)
because provision is made by which the
bonds can be paid into court pending litigation or further investigation. But apparently, here, immediately the document is
presented to the Minister of Finance, even
though it represents $1,000,000, bonds
which are equivalent to cash are handed
over to the parties asserting their rights.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend mean that the protest of an
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

interested legatee would not receive consideration at the hands of the Department, and that he would have no means of
protecting himself as the holder of other
securities might, by applying for an injunction?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
dealing with the Crown, and the Crown
simply ignores the court. Again, the beneficiaries may have had no notice. They may
have been out of the country at the time

the death occurred; they may have been
out of the country at the time the will was
proved; they may have been out of the
country at the time letters of administration were issued. It seems to me that some
thirty days should elapse.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
that would be unreasonable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the
honourable

gentleman's

attention

to the

fact that the present enactment is simply
for the purpose of stating what documents
will justify the Department in transferring
the stock. That is all the amendment is
intended to cover. There may be regulations in the Department as to delay before

acting upon those documents after they
come in; but I take it for granted that the
point raised by my honourable friend could

not be dealt with under this clause. It
simply states what documents will be
accepted by the Department. Now, those

documents may come

from

anywhere-

Canada, England, Wales, the British Colonies; and I draw my honourable friend's

attention to the fact that it generally takes
a number of weeks for these documents to
be in a state to be transferred to the
Department of Finance. I am quite sure
that if we asked the Deputy Minister what
is the practice, we would find that the certificate of death and the will very seldom
reach the Department duly authenticated
within thirty days of the death.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed

That is the

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What is the object
of this legislation? Is it for statistical
purposes, for revenue, or what?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is to protect the fisheries, and to see that no one

being licensed to do salmon fishing.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Wlhy should not a
fisherman go outside the three-mile limit
to fish if he wants to? What is the object?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is to protect the salmon industry.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I suppose that the
United States bas similar ;provisions.
There is no reason why Canadians should
be kept within the threemile limit unless
we have international regulations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
what is the law in the United States. I
find here a statement from the Department which may be of some interest:
Our great difficulty is on the Pacifie Coast,
where we are -limiting the number of licenses
to Orientais. Outside the three-mile limit are
buying-boats from the United States, so that
it would be almost impossible for us to prove
intent on the part of a boat leaving a place
in Canada to fish outside. She could even leave
her equipment with the buying-bcat and show
no appearance of being prepared to fish for
salmon or havi.ng flshed, for sabmon when ln
territorial waters. Just yesterday a telegram
was received from the Chief Inspector stating
that he had seized 17 Japanese boats for fishing without licenses, presumably cutside territorial waters, and explaining thaL the Japanese
fishermen, had raised a -large sum of moniy and
were employing the best counsel they could get
in British Columbia to defend them, so that the
matteir is likely to be In the courts on the
strength of our existing regulation.

As the regulation does not seem to be
founded on the terms of the Act this
amendment is for the purpose of confirming that regulation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask my honourable friend what authority
the Parliament of Canada has to issue
licenses in extra-territorial waters?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or to endeavour
to prevent fishing there?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, or
ta endeavour to prevent fishing. I fancy the
offence really means departing from or
coming into a Canadian port. I can very
well understand our stretching our jurisdiction to making this an offence. The
issue of licenses to fish in extra-territorial
waters seems to me to be something enWhen
tirely beyond our jurisdiction.

he is familiar with what had become of
the subject we had taken up at that time.
I know it was seriously pointed out that
we could not engage in the matter of
adopting regulations of an effective character for aeronautics unless that extraterritorial jurisdiction was granted to us
under Imperial legislation. Owing to our
national status, we have not inherently
that authority.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have asked
the Clerk of the House if he could find any
trace either of a Bill or an Act of that
kind. I have been looking for it, but I
cannot find it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
there was an international convention that
dealt with the entire subject of establishing and defining lanes in mid-air for those
purposes; and I think the question arose
out of the subject which was presented and
discussed in that convention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have a clear
recollection of some measure being submitted to the House for the purpose of
giving extra-territorial effect to our
legislation, but what became of the Bill I
cannot remember.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: In any case it only
applied to Canadian subjects. You could
not pass legislation to prevent an American, say, from fishing outside the threemile limit.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Act at.
tempts to control the fishing outside as
well as inside the three-mile limit. The
jurisdiction of Canada does not go beyond
the three-mile limit; but power is taken
to impose upon Canadi-ans the obligation
of taking out licenses when they start on
fishing expeditions, whether inside or outside, with the intention of fishing for salmon or herring; so that the preparation
for fishing outside begins at home-within
the three-mile limit. In order to bring anyone under this Act, for violation of its
provisions, of course the Crown would have
to establish that he had committed the
offence of fishing, either inside or outside,
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Then, if honourable gentlemen will look
at subsection 2 they will see that(2) Failure to produce a licence issued pursuant to the provisions of The Fisheries Act,
1914, or any regulation made thereunder, shall
be deemed prima facie evidence of intent or
knowledge, when intenýt or knowledge is necessary to constitute an offence under this
section.

So that if a fisherman has gone on fish-

ing salmon or lobster, whether outside the
three-mile limit or inside, when he returns,
if he has not in hand a license, he has
violated this Act. Of course, if he goes
out and comes back with salmon or lobster
the case is clear. The first section only
speaks of his leaving with intent to fish
for salmon or lobster, or to cause another

to fish for salmon or lobster in the sea beyond the territorial waters of Canada, or

leaving or departing from any port in Canada; so that even if he comes back without
any fish, without any lobster or salmon, he
will be deemed to have violated the law
of Canada, because he has no license. He
may have gone beyond the three-mile limit
and fished for salmon and lobster, and
transferred
in wait.

to an American

buyer lying

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: The offence is the
leaving, not the fishing. You cannot penalize anybody for fishing, but they are
penalized for leaving or departing from any
place in Canada for the purpose of fishing, or for bringing up any lobster, or
salmon. I think that clears up the question of jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The offence is
committed entirely on Canadian territory:
it is the departure from a port with the
intent of fishing that makes the offence. Of

JUNE 21, 1922
course, you have to prove the intent, and
you may do that in different ways-by a
declaration, or by the kind of preparations
the man is making, or by the fisherman
coming back with salnon or lobster. But
I do not quite understand why the offence
is limited to fishing outside of the territorial waters of Canada. It seems to me
that the section should cover any offence
of that kind committed within the threemile limit as well as outside.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: f think my
honourable friend will find that the fishing within the three-mile limit has been
provided for under other clauses.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It seems to me
that this is discrimination against Canadian fishermen. This matter of the regulation of salmon fishing has been under
discussion for years on the Pacifie coast,
and the Fisheries Department, time after
time, has had different Commissions, and
there have been international Commissions.
Now, if this legislation passes, and a Canadian fisherman would get outside the threemile limitHon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is no discrimination; he can do that if be gets a
license.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: He can take a
license to fish outside the three-mile limit?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; be can take
a license and depart, and can fish outside
the three-mile limit.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I might
point out that we have always had to strain
our public imagination, so to speak, in
order to assume jurisdiction to deal with
cases of this kind. The question of extraterritorial jurisdiction has always been
more or less difficult, and my recollection
went back to a clause dealing with bigamy
in respect of a marriage entered into outside of Canada. Apparently the Parliament of Canada had to legislate as follows
to get over that difficulty:
No person shall be liable to be convicted of

bigamy in respect of having gone through the

form of narriage In a place nct In Canada,
unless such person, being a British subjeot
resident in Canada, leaves Canada with Intent
to go through such form of marriage.
That is to say, our jurisdiction would
extend only to residents of Canada, and
then apparently it would be essential to the
offence that there was an intent at the
time the parties left Canada to commit the
offence charged.

471

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I am not an expert
on fishing, but I would like to ask somebody who is expert whether anybody would
go outside the three-mile limit to fish for
lobsters, and, if he did so, whether he would
catch any.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman from Manitoba (Hon. Mr.
Bradbury) asked if this was not discriminating against Canadians. The question
prompts me to inform him that a very
large part of this trade on the western
coast is in the hands of foreigners, and it
is in order to try to reach them and cope
with their activity, and have them obey
the laws, that this Bill has been submitted.
An attempt was made in 1918 by an Order
in Council to cover this case, but it is
deemed necessary to have an amendment
to the Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend bas not answered the point I raised,
which I think is of considerable importance:
why limit the offence to the intent of fishing beyond the territorial limit? Why would
it not equally, and perhaps more, be an
offence to do so within the territorial limit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There are
proscriptions in the Act that cuver fishiinxg
within the three-mile limit.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Fishing wi.thin the
threemile limit is al regulated by the
Fisheries Act: no fisherman can fish without a license.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I am not
satisfied as regards that. Apparently this
is a new offence, altogether outside the
provisions of the Fisheries Act. Why exclude a Canadian in Canadian territory
from the operation of this amendment?
But this
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
amendment does not cover the same ground
at all; it simply cevers extra-territorial
waters, and apparently it has no other
purpose.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: The Fisheries Act
says that no person can fish for lobsters
without a license. That covers the threemile limit. That Act legisilates in regard
to fishing. There is a definitioin in this
Act legislating against preparation for fishing, or bringing intoi Canada fish from
beyond territorial waters without a license.
You could not regulate fishing outside of
territorial waters, and so this Act covers
that ground.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I suppose the
intention is to limit to some extent those

SENATE
who secure licenses, and I can see that if
legislation is passed in that way it will be
a gxeat protection to our Canadian fishermen as against foreigners.

70, an Act to amend The Fisheries Act,
1914, was rea-d the third tirne and passed.
BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE (for Hon. Mr. Dandurand) moved the second read.ing of Bill
107, an Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
He said: This Bill does not contain any
new principlei; it mereiy adds some new
acts of bankruptcy. In the Act as it
stands there is nothing to- cover such acts
of hankruptcy. The only case covered is
inability to meet liabilities at maturity,
and it is intended by this Bill to extend
the number of those acts. Otherwise the
Bill will'facihlitate the working of the Bankruptcy Act. I therefore move the second
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Might I ask whether
the reference in section 3 to old section 30
wilI have any effect on advances made
unde-r section 88.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It was intended,
when the Act was passed in 1919, to protect the assignment of debts, provided it
was made known by regis-tration. Under
the Act there have been fluctuating decisions between the East and West as te
whether all the goods were affected by the
Bili, and it is intended to make the practice
uniform. I will explain the Bill in detail
when we go into Committee.
Hon. Mr. REID: As I interpret this Bill,
it means that if a person should go into
insolvency under the Winding-up Act, that
Act would apply instead of the Bankruptcy
Act. That would be the interpretation I
would place on it. Now, I have had a little
experience in one case under the WindingUp Act, and my experience is that if a
uerson goes into insolvency under the WindH-on. Mr. ]BRADBUJRY.

ing-up Act, and there is an estate, 'by the
time it is wound up the lawyers have ail
the money and the creditors have nething.
Now, we have the Baekruptcy Act, and I
would like some lawyer to interpret this
clause. Dees this amendment mean that
if a person assigned under the Winding-up
Act, the bankruptcy preceedings would
then go on, or could the whole winding
Up of the estate be done under the Winding-up Act as well as if it had been under
the Bankruptcy Act?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
gentleman will find, if he refers to the
Statutes of 1920, that there was added a
provision hearing on that point. I wil
read a portion of it:
And where the debtor is a corporation as defined by this section, the Windin.--up Act, chapter one hundred and forty-four of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906, shall not, except
by leave of the Court, extend or app]y te It
notwithstanding anything in that Act contained,
but ail proeceedings instituted ulider that Act
before this Act cornes into force or afterwards,
by ieave cf the Court, may and shall be as lawfuily anci cffectualiy continýued uinder that Act
as if the provisions cf this paraýýraph had flot
been made.

Therefore, by virtue cf that provision,
the Insolvency Act does net apply te corporations. If they are insolvent the liquidation takes place under the Winding-up
Act, unless the judge directs nthprwise.
That is the law as passed in 1920.
The object cf the present Bihl is net te
change that, but merely te previde for cases
of joint stock companies which in the past
were in liquidation, and te permit the judge
te direct that such companies as were in
liquidatien hefere the passing ef the Act
he wound up under the Insolvency Act.
It gives retroactive effect te the Act in
that respect, applying te the winding up
of such cempanies the sarne provisiens as
mentioned in this Act.
Hen. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Take a
concrete case. A company begins to-merrew te be wound up under the Bankruptcy
Act.
Do I understand the honeurable
gentleman to say that this dees net allow
it te be taken frem under the Bankruptcy
Act and put under the Winding-up Act? I
think that is exactly what it does. I think
it null:fies, se far as a company is cencerned, ahi the Bankruptcy Act law. That
is clearly what is intended. It is, in effect,
a repeal ef the section the honourable
gentleman has read.
]5

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the amenduient
net intended te change the law.

473

JUNE 21, 1922
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: When we go into
Committee we can consider whether or not
it is advisable to amend the law as passed
in 1920; but the amendment as presented
in the Bill is not intended to chafige the
law at all; it is merely intended to apply
to companies which are already in liquidation this provision of the Act of 1920.
That is the whole purport of the amendment as printed in the Bill. However, we
can take up that question when the Bill is
in Committee.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I would
recommend that we send this Bill to a
special committee. It is a very important
matter to interfere with an Act which bas
been so thoroughly considered as this has,
and clause 4 is one that should be threshed
out very earefully. I think the clause that
we have now under consideration, section
2, will have this effect, that any person
may apply to the Court to take any company out of the Bankruptcy Act altogether,
and put it under the Winding-up Act. That
would be a disastrous thing, because there
is no end to proceedings under the Winding-up Act, and every person who is desirous of having the bankruptcy proceedings
protracted will do his best to get them
under the Winding-up Act, where the costs
are unlimited and there is no object in
hastening the closing of the affair. I ask
that honourable gentlemen send this to a
special committee, so that we may thoroughly understand it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have no objection
to the Bill being referred to a special committee, or the Committee on Banking and
Commerce might deal with it.
Hon.
right.

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

All

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I intend, honourable gentlemen, moving that the Loan
Companies' Act, the Insurance Act Amendment, and the Trust Act Amendment be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. So we may have to give that
Committee part of a day and perhaps an
evening to examine these Bills. It will be
time well spent.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Beique, the Bill
was referred to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
OPIUM AND NARCOTIC DRUG BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 137, an Act to amend
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, we heard
to-day a statement as to the danger of
the development of the sale of opium and
narcotics throughout this country. There
are two classes of dealers in these noxious
drugs, the licensed and the unlicensed.
The unlicensed may be subdivided into two
classes. There are those who are legally
authorized to sell without a license, namely,
the doctors, veterinary surgeons, and druggists. The doctors can sell only for medicinal purposes; likewise the veterinary surgeons and the dentists; and the druggists
can dispense such drugs only under prescription or written order from the doctor
and the veterinary surgeon. I said there
were two classes of dealers, the licensed
and the unlicensed. The purpose of this Bill
is to readh the unlicensed, illegal trafficers
There are' some who
W'ho sell to minors.
do not sell to minors. The penalty prescribed is fine and imprisonment. It used
to be fine or imiprison-ment.
An additional clause has been suggested,
and the other Chamber has accepted it: if
the culprits are aliens they shall be deported, and all persons selling to minors
may be lashed. Such persons shall be given
a summary trial, and there shall be no
appeal on fact. But, in declaring that
there shall be no appeal on fact, the Bill
contains an error made unintentionally
by covering an appeal on questions of law.
I will move to restore the right of appeal
on questions of law by an amendment to
the Bill when we go into Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I have read over
this Bill and personally I approve of it,
with one exception, and that is an exception that I took to the same measure when
it was brought before us the last time. If
the honourable leader of the Government
will look at section 3 he will find this provision:

Yes.

Any constable or other peace oflicer who has
reasonable cause to suspect that any drug la
kept or concealed for any purpose contrary to
this Act, In any dwelling-house, store, shop,
warehouse,-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because the
work can be done more satisfactorily around
the table than in a general discussion here.

And various other placessearch by day or night any such Vlace
-rnay
for such drug....

Hon.

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

474

SENATE

When this clause came up before I objected to the inclusion of a dwelling-house.
I did not think it was right to authotize
any constable by law to break into a man's
house at any time of day or night on the
pilea that he might find some opium or
cocaine in that house.
The provision, I
think, is rather too serious to a<liow it to
pass in its present form, and when the
Bill goes to Committee I intend moving that
"dwelling-house" be stricken out of the
section.
There is no difficulty about a conttable getting a search warrant for any of
these cases, and I cannot see any reason
why he should have to !break into an ordinary dwelling-house in the middlle of the
night, or why persons should be liable to be
waked up by having their house entered
by a constable whether he has or ha's not
reasonable grounds for going there. I do
Lot know whom the constable would have
to convince that he ha-d reasonable grounds:
the section does not say. The probahility
is that all he would have to give as an excuse is: "Weli, I thought that perhaps
there might be something in there."
If
the seaýr'eh could not be done by day as well
as by night the clause would not be so objectionable, but for an officer to have the
1ight to enter anybody's house at any time
in the twenty-four hours, without the parties living in the house having anything
except his bare word to assure them that
th's man was really a peace officer or constable, means that there is nothing to prevent a man who wanted to burglarize the
house from impersonating a peace officer,
breaking into the bouse in the middle of the
night, and going through it on the plea
that he was searching for drugs.
I do
not think that that should be allowed.
I
quite approve of everything possible being
done in the way of putting an end to the
illicit sale of narcotic drugs and doing away
with all the effects.
I quite appreciate
the very bad results that follow everywhere
in the wake of such sale, and I am desirous
of doing anything possible to end that; but
i think we should draw the line somewhere.
I know that the people following that pursuit are what might be called outlaws; they
are in a way perhaps outside the law; but
the public are not outlaws, and under this
section the public are treated as if they
were. That is what I object to.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: My objection to this Bill is to subsection 2 of section
2, which does away with the right of appeal.
There are three classes of people dealt with.
The case of a person who sells or gives
Hon. IMr. DANIEL.

drugs to a minor comes before a court
on an indictment. I have no objection to
that. That is perfectly proper. But in this
subsection there is a provision which states
that any person dealing in drugs,
-shall be guil'ty of a criminal offence and shall
be liable upon indictment to imprisonment for
any term not exceeding seven ycars, or upon
summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars and costs and not less than
two hundred dollars and costs, and to imprisonment for any term not exceeding eighteen
months and not less than six months.

And in addition the judge may order a
whipping. I have no objection to any Act
to tighten up on the traffic in narcotic drugs.
I think the people on the Pacifie coast are
the ones who are more particularly affected
by this Act. But you have done a most
radical thing in taking away the right
of appeal, and I think that provision is most
objectionable. I will give you a concrete
case. I know of a city in Saskatchewan
where the city police and the Mounted
Police were not acting in very great harmony. The enforcement of the Narcotic
Drug Act was there, as I suppose it is all
over Canada, under the control of the
Mounted Police. They had a Chinaman who
was really acting as a stool-pigeon and informer for them. The city police wanted to
get that man. This stool-pigeon of the
Mounted Police was arrested in his own
house, and was convicted by a magistrate
of having opium in his possession. He protested his absolute innocence, and the
Mounted Police always contended that he
was innocent and improperly convicted. He
appealed to the District Court Judge, who
held that "a plant had been put up on him
by someone," and acquitted him. That may
be an extreme case, but even a Chinaman
bas as much right to have his liberty protected as anyone else. It is because of the
extreme penalties that are allowed to be
given by a magistrate, without the right
of appeal, that I take objection. You
will find nothing in the Criminal Code
enabling a magistrate to impose such extreme penalties without the right of appeal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
other prohibitory laws?

What about

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I do not
know of any as severe as that. Under the
Liquor Act the right of appeal is taken
away in certain cases, but the punishment
is not anything like as severe as this,
and whipping is not possible.

I am not

objecting to a man being whipped if he has
been found guilty and his conviction has

JUNE 21, 1922
been, sustained upon appeal. 1 do not
want to make any improper reflections upon the judicature of Canada-I do not mean
the Sueperior Court land County 'Court
benches-but every one knows that there
are police inagistrates, and other people
who exercise the power of police magistrates, two justices of the peace sitting
together, who adjudicate on cases in la way
that does not at ail satisfy the legai. profession or the public, and 1 say this is
giving them an absoiuteiy unheard of power.
I suggest that the leader of the Government ought to reconsider this portion of the
Bill.
Perhaps it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
wouid be illuminating to honourable gentlemen who think the provisions of the Biill
somewhiat severe to know the extent of the
practices that fail under the penalty clause
of the Act as it stands on the statute book
to-day. I have some statistics that I will
read to the House.
The total convictions under the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act for the year ending
December 3lst are as foiiows: Nova
Scotia, 2; New Brunswick, 29; Quebec, 332
maies, 20 females; Ontario, 306 maies, 6
females; Manitoba, 23 maies, 13 females;
Saskatchewan, 162 maies, 8 females;
Alberta, 147 maies, 15 femaies; British
Columbia, 764 males, 37 femaies. That is
a total of 1,864. 1,572 out of those 1,864
were fined; 202 were convicted without the
option of a fine, and 90 received deferred
sentence.
Now I wiil give the figures by races:
British American, 468; French,-that, I
suppose is a French extraction-138;Russian, 10; German, 1; Austrian, 1;Italian, il; Norwegian, 1; Spanish, 2;
Jewish, 20; ;Chinese, 1,211 and Japanese,
1.
For being in possession of opium there
were 140 sentences imposed: cocaine, 35;
morphine, 13; drugs not specified, 162.
There were 104 convictions for smoking
opium; for selling narcotic drugs, 72; for
dispensing narcotic drugs, 3; keeping
opium dens, 69; frequenting opium dens,
260.
The motion was agreed to, and the B-i
was read the second time.
OONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 137, an
Act to amend the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act.

Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ask that Mr.
Cowan of the Department may corne within
the House.
On section 1-deaiing in drugs:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can
my honourabie friend say what those
particular drugs are?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Cocaine or
any saîts or compounds thereof; morphine
or any saits or compounds thereof; opium
or its preparations, or any opium aikaloids,
or derivitives or saits, or preparations of
opium alkaloids or their derivitives;
eucaine, or any saits or compound& thereof.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should
like to know what restrictions are placed
upon the importation of these products
into Canada. Whiie 1 cannot speak with
authority on the subject, it seems to me
that the evil very largeiy lies in the aimost
indiscriminate importation of these drugs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are
imported under individual licenses for each
shipment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
seems to me to be subject to, criticism. We
are practicaily deaiing in -a general
iicensing system for these drugs instead of
the Government taking over to itseif the
entire power, as it shouid, particuiariy
when such devastation is sweeping across
Canada as the growth of the abuse of these
drugs. So long as the Government wMl
issue licenses to those who choose to make
application to bring them in, so long shail
we be confronted with the evils we are
legisiating against Session after Session.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is there .any
limit to these licenses?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
what I should like to find out, because this
evil shouid be stricken at its source instead of these drugs being permitted in the
country under a licensing system. Under
our own system we should entirely control
the regulation; then the Government wouid
be responsibie, and couid exercise proper
restrictions.
I amn inHon.ý A!r. DANDURAND:
f ormed fhat the importation has been coinpleteiy controiied, with the exception of
the illicit importation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 110w is
it controlled?

476

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under the
form of license issued the following results
have been obtained. The importation of
cocaine in 1919 were 12,333 ounces.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Brought
in by how many persons? That is the
main thing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot tell
my honourable friend at the moment, but
if the honourable gentleman will listen to
these figures, as to importation, I think he
will be quite satisfied with the results
obtained:
Cocaine, 12,333 ounces in 1919; 6,968
ounces in 1920; 3,310 ounces in 1921; and
for the fiscal year ending 1922 the figures
are still further cut down to 2,952 ounces.
My honourable friend will from that see
that there has been a drop from 1919 to
1922 of from 12,333 ounces to 2,952 ounces.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is this
cutting down due to the act of the Government or is it due to a less consumption
of the drug?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The DepartmEnt insists upon the reduction.

Now, I take the importation of morphine.
In 1919 there were 30,087 ounces; in 1920,
28,128 ounces; in 1921, 12,124 ounces; for
the year ending 1922, 8,774 ounces.
Crude opium imported in 1919 amounted
to 34,263 pounds; in 1920 to 13,626 pounds;
in 1921 to 2,953 pounds; in 1922, to 1,700
pounds.

From these figures honourable gentlemen
will see what a drop there has been since
1919.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend favour the House by
telling us what system of supervision is
exercised by the Department in controlling
the importation of all drugs?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
A statement
is exacted from the applicant showing the
need for this drug in Canada, or in the district. The Department must be satisfied
that there is a legitimate demand for the
entry of the drugs that are asked for
under the license which is sought.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I suppose what
they actually do in practice is to take a
district and make an allowance for that
district. When they have come up to that
allowance, then they issue no more licenses.
Is that it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Department watches over the requirements of the
Sir JAMES LOUCHEED.

trade, and must be satisfied before issuing
a license that it is necessary at the moment to import the amount asked for.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I understood
the honourable gentleman to state that less
drugs were being imported from year to
year.
Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
legitimate channels.

Througl

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Yes, in a lega.
manner. The fact is, nevertheless, that
the practice of using these drugs and the
amount used from the Atlantic to the Pacific is increasing enormously every year.
It should be ascertained how this large
importation of drugs is being carried on.
There is no question that the use of narcotic drugs in Canada is increasing to a
very large extent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed that last year drugs to the value of
about $250,000 were seized. It is very
difficult to discover the illicit entry and use
of those drugs, but the legislation which

curbing of this trade.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like the honourable gentleman to tell me the rate of
duty on morphine and cocaine previous to
1919, and what it is now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Fifteen per
cent preferential, and 171 per cent general
tariff.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to know
if there has been any tariff change since
1917?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Are the impor.
ters mainly wholesale druggists, or people
specially and only dealing in these narcotie's?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Very few retailers have obtained licenses; they are
generally wholesale

druggists

or

manu-

facturers' agents.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What happens
in the case of an individual asking for a
license for himself?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There are
four classes of individuals that can import
dentists, and veterinary sur-doctors,
geons, under license, and the others.

JUNE 21, 1922
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can
niy honourable friend say in what way
other nations or states or governments
control the importation of these drugs?
The United
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
States noçw are simply working to obtain
data as to the amount required for legitimate purposes, and they are working upon
regulations, but they are far iess advanced than we are.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the suggestion made by the honourable leader on the
other side of the Huse is in' the right
direction-that the best way, if practicable, would be for the Government to
take a monopoly of the sale of that class
of goods. 0f course, I can easily imagine
that tbat may not be practicable. It
might require the opening of too many
agencies for the purpose; but we may
have to corne to that. It would surely be
the best means.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I might say that
last year the Government had under consideration, and I stili think they should
-onsider, the advisability of taking over a
inonopoly of importing these narcotic
drugs. It is an exceedingly difficuit iaw
to administer. I can imagine that one
reason for the falling off in the quantities
brought in legitimately is that which has
been pointed out-that the law bas bren
very well administered during the last two
or three years. On the other hand, I
rather incline to believe the staternerit
made by one honourable gentleman behind
nme, that there is just as large a quantity of these drugs coming in illegally today as there was under the old law, and
probably more. But under the iaw as now
administered every one w'ho is given a
license to import these drugs is required
to show how he disposes of every ounce:
he must show that very cleairly; and foliowing up that provision in the law the
quantity imported legaliy has been very
well traced. But, although, the law aif it
now stands is very well administered, the
Government nxight consider the question
of taking into their own hands ail importations. These articles are different from
others, and 1 think, in the interesta of the
state and of our citizens generally, no
harm could be done if the Government had
a monopoly of that kind.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would like to inquire if there is any provision to penalize
druggists who purchase otherwise than

from. the licensed importer? If there is
nothing in the law we râould have something to cover that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Every licensee
is obliged to make a monVhly return of what
he lias, and the amount that bas been imported is follo'wed fro-m week to week, and
the Departmnert is absoJiutely au fait as to
what there is in. the han&~ of the llicenseeas;
but the difficulty is to trace what cornes, in
illegaliy. We had comnients n>pon the difficulty of preventing liquor f rom fiowin'g into
one province from anotlher.
Here we are
ýacing the importation of a drug whieh
cc.mes in rnuch smaller volume, and the
difficulty is not only to prevent that illicit
importation, but to foiw it.
The Dominion Police bas been very active in helping the Department in the administration of
this Iaw.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOST'ERAs a matter of fact, how many individuai
licenses are there in Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The licenses
issued last year weTe as follolws: For importation, 186; for export, 34; for wholesale druggists, 112; for retail druggists
licensed to manufacture, 57.
Hbon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentl1 eman lias not answered my question.
I
suggest that the best way would be to penaiize any druggist who 'buys any of Vhose
goods except from licensed -importers.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: OstenFibly that Is the on-ly source from which he
can get the goods.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But what is illegally
imported is solld to the druggist.
Evidently it cannot be sold to anybody else.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is al
hrouglt in illicitly.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is peddled to doctors.
Hon. Sir JAMEtS LOUGHEED: Oh, no,
it is the operators that we are trying to
get at.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If a druggist
buys it illegally, be is viclating the law, and
lie 'bides it. If lie buys it regularl'y, he is
obligod to keep a record of wbat he does
ituy, and if he fails to, do so hè is liable,
upon suRn1mary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and costs, or impri.sonment
for one year.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: He must also

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Are there any
limits as to the ports of entry for that
drug?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By Order in
Council of the 2nd of May, 1920, it is decreed that any drug or drugs mentioned in
the schedule to the Act may be imported or
entered at any of the following Canadian
customs ports:-St. Jdhn, N.B.; Halifax,
N.S.; Quebec, Q.; Montreal, Q.; Ottawa,
Kingston, Toronto, Hamilton, Windsor,
WValkerville, London, Ont; Winnipeg, Man.,

import or enter any of those drugs through
any other port or place in Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has the
Department attempted to estimate the proportion of illicit drugs to those legitimately
imported?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is impossible to estimate, but there is an impression
in the Department that -as much comes in
illicitly as legitimately.

police officer can go to the drug store and

has to keep a record of his sales showing
the date of sale, the quantity, the name of
the drug, the form in which it was sold, the
rame of the purchaser, the profession of
the purchaser, the address of the purchaser, and, when given on prescription,
the name and address of the physician, veterinary surgeon, or dentist, and the signature of the person making the entry.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I was not aware of

at all. We knew that, but we could not
prove it.
There are

Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-power of police officer to
search for drugs:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would ask for a
reading of the original section 7 which this
section proposes to repeal.

Section 7 of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the present Act is as follows:
If it be proved upon oath before any magistrate that there is reasonable cause to suspect
that any drug is kept or concealed for any purpose contrary to this Act in any dwelling-house,
store, shor, warehouse, outhouse, garden, yard,
vessels or other place, such magistrate may
grant a warrant to search by day or night any
such place for such drug, and if such drug Is
there found, to bring it before hilm.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is the clause
which we put in when it was before the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: After a very
long discussion.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Yes, and the matUnder
ter was very thoroughly debated.
these circumstances, instead of moving to

leave out the word "dwelling-house" I
think it would be better to keep the old
clause. There the constable has to satisfy
the magistrate that there is a real reason
to suspect any of those places, and he would
then get authority to visit then either
by day or by night.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will simply
read the reason which has prompted the
Department in asking for this amendment:

JUNE 21, 1922
The Amnendment to section 7 of the Act la for
the PurPOse of einpowering the police to search
for opium and their narcotics without the necessity of first having to obtain a search warrant, so that they may be In position to take
prompt and efficient action at ail tinles. At thec
presen-t time the police are very greatly handicapped In dealing with this traffic, as in inany
instances where they receive information that
drugs are being kept or concealed ini a certain
building, or belng transported by auto or other
vehicle, they are powerless to act until flrst obalnga search warramt from the niagistrate
e)r Justice of the ]Peace, and in most cases time
is a very important factor, as it ls the customi
of these drug traffickers to keep shiftlng these
drugs from one place to ano-ther for the purpose
of eluding the police. It so happens that in many
cases the police have to act on s Sun day, a
statutory holiday, a Saturday afternoon, or at
night, and it is a very difficult Inatter to locate
a niagistrate or a justice of the peaee to obtain
a search warrant, anýd in many cases in certain parts of the country the police are miles
from the nmagistrate or justice of the peace,
whlch rnakes it practically Impossible to obtain
a search warrant on which to talce action with
a view to interceptlng the illicit shipment of
these drugs.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I may say that an
attempt was mnade to put the saine sort of
a clause into a similar Bill before the
United States Congress, and the Senate
would flot permit that clause to go in,' for
the very reasons that I have given here today. You cannot say that the use of narcotic drugs is of any greater extent in the
Dominion of Canada than in the United
States; that it is of any greater extent on
the Pacifie coast of Canada than on the
Pacific coast cities of the United States;
or that we are any better acquainted with
or have any greater knowledge of the use
of these drugs in Canada than they have
on the Pacific coast cities in the United
States. Therefore, if the United States
Senate thought that it was inimical to the
liberty of the ordinary public in that country, I think the samne rule and the saine
argument would apply absolutely to the
people and the general public of the Domninion of Canada. I think that it is giving
too much liberty of action to any peace officer or constable to allow him to enter any
dwelling-house at any time of the day or
night. These officers have authority to
search every part of a man's premises-to
dig up his garden, to excavate his cellar, to
do anything they can think of to get after
these drugs; and now the Government
wants to give them authority to enter a
private house at any time in the whole
twenty-four hours; breaking in if they cannot get in peaceably, and the unfortunate
owner, who may be just as innocent as 11is
Honour the Chairman here, has to put up
with that sort of thing.
At six o'clock the Committee took recess.

The Committee resumed at 8 o'clock.
On section 3-power of peace officer to
search for drugs:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Mr. ýChairman, at 6

United !States 'Serrate had refused to legislate in the way we are being asked to legislate to-niglht.
Right Hon. ýSir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: On the s-ane siùbjet,
that of narcotie drugs; and they refused
because Vhey considerecd that to give an
ordinary ipolice constable Ipower to go, into
nny manIs hcu.se at any time of day or night
was an infraction of the rights of tihe
ordinary people of tlie country to which.

1 want to eniphasize tbat.
Il sucb la the
condition of things in the United; States, I
amn quite sure that a sirnilar condition exists in this tountry, and the rights o-f the
people of Canada should be conserved to at
least as great an extent as are the ràIghts
of the people orf the United States.
I would lîke the honourable gentciman
who Tepresents the Government ini this
Ohamiber to give us now, if he can, a single
instance in *çhich justice has been foiled
since the last Session of Paxrliament up to
the present day on, account of poqlice constables being required to, get a search warrýant before be'ing aqlowed te enter a dwelling-house at the night time. Will the hionourable gentlemnan, if hie bhas a single instance at his disposiai, let us have it to-night
so that w3 may see w1here we standý?
Hion. 'Mr. DANDURAND: I amn informed
that the Department has received correspondence which affirïned that the police
were thrwarted in their endeavours to get
at the cuiprïts by the fact that they happened to have no warrant and a magistrats
or justice of the peace was nut at hand.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 'Then, I think that
under the circumstances the least the
Department could do is to lay that correspondence before the members of the
Senate, who are asked to change the law.
We have nothing wbatever to go uponnotbing to show that there is any emergency
in this, respect. A Bill is simply sent down,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the hionourable gentlemen tell me p3articularly

SENATE
a warrant, or to the enitry without a
warrant of a dwe'inig-house or residence
rather than a shotp or warehouse?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: My objection is confined largely to the word "dwelling-house."
I do not think that should be included.
Moreover, if the honourable gentleman wiH
read the section carefully he will find that
there is really no reason for it, even in the

case of British Columbia coast towns, where
I -am told, Chinese largely live in their

stores or in connection with their stores.

The section says:
If

the Chinaman lives in a shack alongside his
store, the words " other place" are quite
sufficient to enable the officer to nab him
there.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That would be his
dwe'lling-house.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think that if we
just omit the word "dwellinig-house" we
shall then conserve the -liberty of ordinary
law-abiding citizens, whidh is not conserved
in this secition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am ready te
vccept that suggestion, and move to strike
out the word "dwelling-house."
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: All right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I observe
that if the words "or other place" are
left in they would include a dwelling-house.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Not as a regular
dwelling-house.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
you had better keep those words in.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
the words "other place" would permit entry
into a dwelling-house.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Might not a covert be made in the woods?
That is another place, but it is not a store or
shop or anything of that kind. If you
struck out the words "other place" you
might very much hamper officers in their
work. For my own part I have not the
But
least objection to "dwelling-house".
I am not going to labour the question. If
the honourable leader of the Government
assents to striking out the words I wil.1
not carry it any further.
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Provided that if it be proved upon oath before
any magistrate that there is reasonable cause to
suspect that any drug is kept or concealed for
any purpose contrary to this Ac in any dwelling-house, such magistrate may grant a warrant to search by .day or night any such place
for such drug, and, if such drug is there found,
to bring it before him.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

That is all right.

The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Section 3 as amended was agreed to.

In any dwelling-house, store, shop, warehouse,
outhouse, garden, yard, vessel, or other place.

What more doyou want than 'that?

Then I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to move to add to clause 7 this proviso:

On section 4-possession of opium pipes,
opium lamps, or other device without permit
forbidden:
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Is there not another device which is now
coming to be very commonly used in the
shape of a needle for injecting the opiate
Is not this used by these traders

and vandals of society quite commronly; and
is not the use becoming more common in
assemblies and other places? If so, why
should not that be brought under this
clause, to make it unlawful for any person
to have it without a permit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The difficulty
is that the instruments is used for very
many other purposes-legal purposes-and,
although the Department bas had this
matter in mind, it bas not yet felt that it
could with any sense of propriety prohibit
the possession of such an instrument.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not want to go any farther than the
Department deems is wise.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-no appeals:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, it was in connection with this
section that I made some observations when
the Bill was in its second reading. I am
moving that this clause be struck out. I
am not objecting to the provision in the
case of offences against minors, but only

clause be struck out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Can my
honourable friend say why this clause bas
been inserted? Has there been an abuse

JUNE 21, 1922
of appeals from convictions upon sunary
hearing, and if so, to what extent?
Hon. Mr DANDURAND:
In a large
majority of cases the accused files an
appeal, either in order to obtain suflicient
delay to enable hrmn to find the sum which
he has to psy as a penalty, or in order to
postpone bis imprisonnient if condemned to
serve a termn in jail. In both cases the
accused hopes that his solicitor will find
irregularities in the wording of the charge,
or in the sentence, or in other procedure,
through which he might obtain bis discharge. As an illustration it might be
nientioned that out of 76 cases inscribed
for appeal, 60 at least were cases whe-re
the appellant had been condemned by the
Lower Court for having been found in possession of drugs, such as cocaine, morphine, or opium, or for having sold or
purchased drugs, or for having visited
places where such drugs are supplied.
I may say that the right of appeal from
conviction for keeping a disorderly bouse
bas been stricken out of tbe Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I sbould. like to
second the motion made by the bonourable
gentleman from. Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby). 1 look upon this section as aimply monstrous.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the honourable gentleman, would allow me to state
that I intend to move a proviso, perbaps
he would not feel that the section was so
objectionable. The proviso, is as follows:
Provided, however, that notwithstanding thé
pyovigions of subsection 2 of section 769 of the
Criminal 'Code, section 761 of the Criminal Code
In aaLy case to which this Act applies shall
continue to apply In full force anLa elleet to, ail
latents and purposes as if this sectron had not
been passed.
This reserves the rigbt of appeal on a
stated case.
lîon. bMr. MeMEANS: 'What is the
mneaning of this Bill? and wbat' is the
meaning of striking out the right of appe4l
from a summary conviction? if the larger
offence is establisbed, there la no appeal.
I am ashamed to say tbat the Dominion
of Canada is about the only place in the
cîvilised world wbere appeals in criminal
cases are not 4llowed. There is, however,
ia the Criminal Code a provision thgt a
man may appeal from a summnary conviction. That, 1 take it, is wbiere a conviction

men are appointed as magistrates and
justices of tbe peace wbo know notbing
about law, and wbo are entirely ignorant
of procedure and of the laws of evidence.
Yet you put it into the power of tbose
iridividuais to give judgment, and you Say:
"Wbatever you say goes; there shall be
no appeal from you under any circumstances." *The people wbo dësigned the
Criminal Code apparently had tbese gentlemen in view, because the only class of
judges from wbom they did allow a'n appeal
were the justices of the peace or the police
magistrates. Now you increase the penalty,
and the greater the penalty the greater
should be the rigbt of the individual to
appeal. This, as I understand it, is, not for
the off ence of peddling d1rugs, or giving
darugs to minors, 'but that of not keeping
a record of the drugs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg the
bonourable gentleman's pardon:. it covers
the dealings of peddlers.
Hon. Mr. MeMEAN S. I may be wrong,
and if I arn I sbould be corrected. Let us
see wbat it does say.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Any offence

two offençes under tbe Act. Âny honourable gentleman in this House who bas
practised law, and many of them bave,
knows that the bardest court to, go before
is the court of a justice of tbe peace or a
police magistrate. You can go before the
Privy Counicil or the Supreme Court of
Canada, and tbey will listen to you, but
a magistrate says: "Tbis is a lawyer coming up h.ere; I bave to watch bise: be is
going to put it over me." You cannot tel]

Hon. Mr. PLANTA: Re wants to dispense justice.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Yes, as tbe
bonourable gentleman says, be wants te
dispense justice. I know of 4 case in my
own expérience in whicb a justice of the
peace sent a man up for trial for using
abusive language, to a cow. Tbat case is
on record. As A very young man I once

that I was from Winnipeg, and he
handed me the Consolidated Statutes of
Manitoba and said: "If you can show me
anything in these statutes that says that
I have to show you the information, I will.
If you can't, I won't."
So here we have increased penalties,
with a refusal of the right to appeal from
a justice of the peace or a magistrate. I
cannot nnderstand who are the franers of
this Act. The greater the penalty the
greater the danger in which the subject
stands, and the greater his right to appeal.

of the peace or a magistrate for not keeping a record. That is the law as I understand it. The case of supplying drugs to
minors does not go before a police magistrate or a justice of the peace. I am not
opposed to this Bill.
I would vote for
almost anything to suppress this traffic, but
I think it is exceediig the limit to say that
when a man makes a slip and does not keep a
record he shall go before a justice of the
peace or a police magistrate, who may
sentence him to eighteen months in gaol,
or a fine of $2,000, and have no right of
appeal.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: May I add
just a word or two more. Under subsection 2 of section 5 of the Act any physician
or veterinary surgeon or dentist who prescribes any narcotic drug except for medieinal purposes is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of not more than $1,000
and costs and not less than $200, and to
imprisonment for a terni not exceeding 18
months, or to both fine and imprisonment.
I think it is rather hard to put a medical
practitioner in a position to have a charge
laid against him of supplying a narcotic
drug, and making him liable to trial before
an ordinary J.P., and to be sent to jail or
fined $1,000 for a terni not exceeding 18
months, without giving him any right of
appeal. Surcly that is taking undue liberties with gentlemen who ought to be men
of position. If the conviction is right in
the first instance, why should it not be
sustained on appeal?

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think possibly the
best way to deal with this matter would be
to increase the security to be given for the
exercise of the right of appeal. Make it
more difficult to lodge an appeal; exact a
deposit or something of that kind.

There are conditions in some parts of the

Bill, subsection 2a says:
Any person who manufactures, imports, exports, sells or distributes any drug and neglects
or refuses to keep the record required by any
regulations made by the said Minister, or
neglects or refuses to produce such record for
inspection at the request of any peace officer
or any person authorized to inspect the sane
by the said Minister, shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shal be liable upon summary
conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and
costs and not less than $200 and costs, or to
imprisonment for any term not exceeding
eighteen months, or to both fine and imprisonment.

I would like to impress upon the leader
of the Government the fact that this
information may be laid before a justice
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Out of 76 cases inscribed for appeal, 60 of
then at least were cases where the appellant
had been condeomned by the Lower Court for
having been found in possession of drugs, such
as: cocaine, morphine or opium, or for having
sold or purchased drugs, or for having visited
places where such drugs are supplied.
In most cases the charge was upheld. The
accused files an appeal, either in order to obtain
sufticient delay to enable him to find the sum
which hie has to pay as a penalty, or in order
to postpone his imprisonment in cases where he
is condemned to serve a term in jail. in both
cases the accused hopes that his solicitor will
find irregularities in the wording of the charge,

arguments of lawyers on technicalities.

may be given the right to appeal by means of
a stated case on a point of law. If the magistrate is convinced that the point under discussien should be decided by a Court of Appeal,
he will then grant a stated case. In cases
where he refuses the application, his decision
should be final.
I believe, sir, that you would render an immense service to the community and to our
province, if you were to make the law as
severe as possible against those engaged in this
ignominious trade.
If it should be known that the decision of the
Police Court is final, I feel sure that the illicit
drug traffic rwould receive 'a severe setback.
Personally, I would be without pity for the
vendors, traffickers, and distributors of drugs,
but I would show some synipathy for the unfortunate drug addicts. They are sick people
whom it would be preferable te allow to be
treated at some institution other than the
prison.
Above, sir, are the suggestions which came
te my mind during these last fitteen days.

This is a translation of a French letter.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Let us look at
the statement made by the leader of the
Government. One man, a judge, writes a
letter and makes a statement. No other
judge is consulted. One man alone sends
information to the Government, and. it is
read to this House without the writer
being here so that we could cross-examine
him or make inquiries of him. Things
have come to a pretty pass when the House
of Commons and the Senate must be guided
by the individual opinion of a judge in
Montreal or in any other place. Let us
dissect the letter which the honourable gentleman has just read. It states that drugs
are being furnished to young people, which
is a very heinous offence. But what does
this section say? It says that those who
fail to keep a record shall be punished. It
is a very simple matter for any gentleman
who has an opinion upon one thing or
another to write to the Minister of Justice
and say so-and-so. But we are asked to
take away one of the most sacred rights of
the people of this country-the right to
appeal from a conviction by a police magistrate or a justice of the peace. What is
the injustice in that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why
should not my honour'able friend limit this
section to vendors of drugs instead of permitting it to extend to licensees and those
who fail to keep a record? The chief offence
which the Act has in contemplation is the
illicit vending of these drugs. I venture
to say that the appeals which my honourable friend referred to were those of the
vendors of drugs who were not licensees.
S-31h

These licensees, presumably, are professional men, men of some standing in the
community, to whom the Government issues
licenses for professiional purposes. These
shotld be treated differently, it seems to
me, from the other class. There is no
reason why the appeal> should not be taken
away from the illicit vendor. Furthermore,
if my honourable friend should want to
restrict appeals, even in the case of
licensees, he might take into consideration
the advisability of an application being
made either to a district judge or to a
judge of the King's Bench for leave to
appeal, which would doubtless be given if
there were any grounds for it. But there
should be some discrimination, and some
intelligent distinction drawn between the
different parties involved.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I must say that
the letter just read by my honourable
friend does not bring very much conviction
to me, because it deals with the police
court of Montreal, which is presided over
by men of great training and long experience, who are surrounded by officers
whose daily business is to deal with
those cases.
But that is a condition
which in almost any other part of the
country would not be found. In Montreal,
Toronto, and Win4ipeg the men who have
to deal with these things are experienced,
and the objections which are heard from the
honourable gentleman who proposes the
amendment are not at all answered. I am
not going to vote for any provision which
takes away the right of appeal especially
in a case of this kind, where«the offence may
be a mere neglect or omission on the part
of the druggist, but which calls for a terrific
punishment, without right of appeal by the
accused.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: It is proper to bring
the witnesses before a police magistrate,
and then the Court of appeal is in a position to deal with the matter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
There is no
objection to the magistrate taking evidence,
but it is not taken as fully as it would be
in the superior court.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: In all cases tried
before a magistrate the evidence is taken
and signed by the witness.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: It is not so in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: On the question of
taking away the right of appeal in criminal
cases, the tendency in the old country, the

484

SENATE

United States, and all the colonies is not
only not to take it away, but rather to
grant it where it is not now allowed. In the
discussions on this question each Session
for the last three years it was shown'that
appeals are allowed on questions of fact in
al.1 criminal cases in the countries named,
and those countries are advancing in the
direction of enlarging appeals. We appear
to be going in the opposite direction, setting ourselves contrary to the world-wide
movement in this matter. I think the point
made by the honourable member for
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) should be
considered, that when the judge wrote the
letter that has been read he was dealing
with a situation altogether different from
that covered by this section. Not only
in Western Canada but all through the
Dominion, magistrates are appointed who
have had no experience at all in dealing
with cases of this kind. They are often
men of only ordinary education, and not
lawyers; and, while they may desire to do
justice, practicali lawyers know that in
many cases their decisions are absolutely
absurd. Therefore a man convicted under
this Act and having imposed on him. the
penalties it provides should have the right
to appeal, else we would put a premium
upon ignorance. In a case of this kind,
where a man's honour and freedom are involved, surely he should have a right to
appeal, especially when his case was not
tried before a trained judge, a man with
legal attainments, or a jury. These sections
have been placed in the Code because the
framers of that Code realized that there
were officers of courts wlo had no legal
training, and therefore should not try those
cases, but who did so After al.1, who is
hurt by an appeal? Is it not far better that
a number of guilty men should escape than
that one innocent man should be convicted?
Let us suppose that a man makes the best
defence he can before a magistrate,
but that the magistrate, through some
ignorance of the law, or oversight,
or because he does not understand how
to weigh evidence, convicts, having made
up his mind that the police officers must
be right, that the effence is a terrible
crime, and that that is the only way to
prove his standing in matters of reform
and morals, and all that sort of thing.
There are hundreds of cases of that kind.
Suppose that the magistrate unjustly convicts a man on insufficient evidence, or that
he does not weigh the evidence properly,
and he imposes the heavy penalties menHon. Mr. GIRROIR.

tioned in this Act, what chance has the
party convicted? Absolutely none; the decision is final; he never can get away from
it; he is treated as a criminal, sent to jail
and punished. If he had a right to appeal
he would have an opportunity to get further evidence, and if found innocent the
charge would be dismissed, and who would
lose by it? I think the community as a
whole would gain. On the other hand,
suppose that a man is guilty, and he appeals from the conviction to a higher court,
if the evidence on which he was found guilty
is found sufficient would the higher court
reverse that? Not at all. But the right of
appeal is a second chance to an innocent man
to prove his innocence, and it does not give
a criminal any better chance to evade justice, because the greater knowledge of the
higher court doubly ensures his conviction.
Of course, this right of appeal would throw
more work on the judges, but, after all,
I do not think we should be concerned with
them so much as to give every reasonable
opportunity for appeal to a man who may
not have had a fair trial, so that he could
seek for justice in a higher court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am disposed
to accept the suggestion of the honourable
leader of the Conservative party, who
thinks we should make a distinction between the trafficker in drugs and the
licensee who may be condemned for having violated some special obligation placed
on him concerning registration, keeping a
record, etc. I move to limit section 10A so
that it will read as follows:
Section 749 to 760, inclusive, of the Criminal
Code shall not apply to any conviction, order or
proceedings in respect of any offence under
paragraph e of subsection 2 of sEction 5A of
this Act.

That is, the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, chapter 31 of 11 George V, which
reads:
Any person who has in his possession without
lawful authority, or manufactures, sells, gives
away or distributes any drug without first ohtaining a license from the Minister.

This would limit the refusal of an appeal

on facts only to that clause.

If this carries

I will move my proviso restoring the right
of appeal in a stated case.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: My entire objection to this Act is that you leave it
within the scope of a justice of the peace
or magistrate to impose this very extreme
penalty without any right of appeal. In
the course of some remarks I made at the
beginning of this Session I endeavoured
to point out that Canada to-day is the

JUNE 21, 1922
on]y country in the civilized world in
which there is no appeal in criminal matters on questions of fact. The Criminal
Code lays it down that you cannot appeal on a question of fact where you have
a trial by jury or by indictmnent or before
a judge. In such cases there is no appeal
whatever; but it is also, provided that
on a summary conviction before a justice
of the peace or a police magistrate there
is a right to, appeal to the court immediately above. This is the only class of case
that I know of, except those under the
Canada Temperance Act and the case of
disorderly houses, in which an attempt is
being made to take away the right of appeal. If we had a judîciary throughout
Canada that we could rely upon in matters of this kind 1 would have no objection whatsoever. The honeurable member
from Ottawa <Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has
spoken about a judge in Montreal, evidently a mnan of great experience, who
deals with those cases and knows ail about
them. But go up through Western Canada, in the country districts, and outside
of the city of Winnipeg I do flot know oi
one lawyer in that western country.who
has been appointed justice of the peace or
police magistrate, except it may be Regina. Yet you put in the hands of those
maen the legal authority to send a man to
jail for eighteen months, or fine hlm $2,000,
and you absolutely say he cannot appeal
frorn that. It may be that the Criminal
Code is right in saying you shall fot
appeal on a question of fact from the decision of any jury or any judge; but I
think this Bill is absolutely wrong. In
England since 1908 there have been crimmnal appeais not only on questions of fact
but on questions of sentence. We have not
that right in Canýada, but, in my opinion
we ought to have it. I have had some experZ-ence in the trial of criminal matters,
and 1 say it is wrong to give to a justice
of the peace in some small town such
authority that he can send a man down for
18 months and fine him $2,000, and to, take
away the right of appeal. The evil goes
even further than that, for its underlying
principhe is to put a premium on injustice.
When you say to a mnan, "There is
no appeal from your decision; you are
clothed with full autherity," is he
then going to be careful? Will he
say, "I miust consider this matter very
closely"? No; but when you say to, hlm,
"There is an appeal from your judgment," what is the effect? He says, "I
mxust look into this matter very carefully,

because they have power te carry it te
appeal, and they will appeal." I do not
know anything that has more influence
with any judge who tries a case than the
knowledge that somebody is over him, and
that there is a right of appeal frem. him.
that will prevent him from doing injustice. Henourable gentlemen who have
read the newspapers in the hast two or
three days must have noticed an item in
the Ottawa Citizen stating that a magistrate in the county of Russell, adjoining
the city of Ottawa, had sent a maxn to
penitentiary for 15 years for taking a
horse and buggy f rom a church and driving it to the next town. That is all there
was to it. He was arrested and convicted
of stealing the horse and buggy. Apparently hie was not a thief, or hie would net
have driven to the next town; but the
magistrate convicted that man and sent
him down for 15 years. Yet there was no
appeal whatever in such a case until this
honourable body within the last two years
passed an amendment te the criminal law
providing that a sentence of that kind
might be appealed. Is this House going
to empower justices of the peace and police
magistrates to shut such a man up? Shall
we practically say, " There shail be no appeal from, your judgment; give it te him;
I
soak it to him; do anything you 'ike."
do not care who the magistrate is; hie may
be the best man in the country; but if you
clothe him with such authority, and allow
no appeal from his judgment, so that nobody can review anything that hie does,
lie is a different man. But if he is hiable
to have his sentences reviewed hie will bie
more careful in *dealing with his cases. I
do not believe it is right, or British justice, to clothe any magistrate or justice ef
the peace with such authority that no man
can appeal from, it, in a case of keeping
drugs or any other. You may make the
penalty as strong as you like; you can
provide whipping, if you please; but do
not take away from any indivîdual the
right to appeal from, the decisien of a
justice of the peace.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I want to say
a word or two in connection with this
matter, because I arn just as strongly in
f avour of appeals in criminal cases as the
honeurable member f rom Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans); and if I were te allow
this question te, pass now without saying
anything, 1 might be met in future -with
the statement that I allnwed certain
legishation to, go through and said nothing
about it. Now, what is the situation?

SENATE
What rights are we taking away? Under
section 749 of the Criminal Code it is
provided:
Unless it is otherwise provided in any special
Act un-der which a conviction takes plac e or an
order is made by a justice for th~e payment off
mney, or ,dismiissing an informnation or cornplaint, any person who thinks hirrself aggrieved
by any such conviction or order or dismissal,
the prosecutor or* cornplainant, as well as the
defandant, may appeal.-

Now you are taking away that right.
Section 752 provides that where an appeal
is taken from a sumamary conviction, "the
court appealed to shall try, and shall be
the absolute judge, as well of the facts as
of the law in respect to such conviction
or order."
Then here is the clause
which answers the question that was
askeýd a few moments ago:
Any off the parties to an appeal may eaul witnesses and a'dduce evidence, whether such witnesses were called or evidence adduced at the
hearrng before the justice or not, either as to
the credibility off any witness, or as to any
other fact material to the inquiry.

That is what you are going to take away
by passing this section. A man has no
redress, nor has the Crown any redress.
It works both ways. I know of two cases
within the last few months in which the
Crown appealed. The magistrate had dismissed the charges which were laid under
the Ialand Revenue Act, and appeals were
taken to the county *Judge. In each case the
county judge reversed the magistrate's decision aad fiaed the party who hard not
been convicted by the magistrate. So you
wiIl observe that you are taking away not
only from the subject but also lfrom the
Crowa the right of appeal.
Go just a stop further. We have heard
a great deal about the enforcement of law
in the province of Ontario and the rights
of individuals under the Ontario Temperance Act, yet we find that even under that
Act, rigorous as is the enforcement of it,
there is a right of appeal to the county
Judge, and the county judges of the various
counities, hear appeals.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: \Vill My hoa,
ourable friend permit me to ask him a
question? Does my honourable friead say

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
sion?

This last Ses-

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, it was before this last Session. I know of appeals
which were taken. So the right exists.
Then go a step further. A man may be
sued ia one of our Ontario courts, say in
the division court, for $200. He bas a right
of appeal, not to a single judge, but to five
judges sittiag ia Toronto as the Court of
A,ýppeal, where a matter involving, say,
tromn $200 to $400 is in dispute. In that
instance the trial takes place before a
county judge.
Ia a case where you are
going to take away the right of the subject
and probably imprison him, he is tried before a magistrate and convicted.
There is this to be said further, se, far
as the magistrates are conceraed. We ahl
know that the Coveraiment employ certain
men to, work up these cases. The Mounted
Police la the various provinces are the enforcers of the law with regard to drugs.
They go to a magistrate. Before the warrant is issued the magistrate thoroughly
understands the case, and la aine cases
out of ten hie is su prejudiceýd that it is a
miere mockery of the administration of just ice to try a man before a magistrate under
such circumstances.
That is a well-known
fact, and 1 venture to say that any lawyer
who is accustomed to practise la these
courts knows quite well that this statenient is correct. So you are depriving men
of a right, the loss of which may mean
the loss not only of their liberty, but also
(A their moaey and standing.
I arn thesefore very strongly la favour
of the right of appeal existing. We should
not do away with it sîmply because the

Departmeat or the officers eagaged la enforcing these laws desire to make them
more drastic and to make surer of a conviction in every case.

MITTEE-THIRD READING

IN COM-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 147, an Act to amend
the Currency Act, 1910.
He said: Under the Act respecting the
currency our silver coins are required ta
have a certain standard of fineness; out of
every 1,000 parts 800 are required ta be of
pure siilver.
That, in the language of the
mint, is called a "remedy"; for the sake
uf convenience I will call it the margin of
safety.
That margin of safety is at present fixed at 4 points; that is ta say, if there
should be a departure of more than 4 points
from the standard, the currency would not
be lawful. It has been found, in the experience of the mint, that this limitation,
though they :have not in any case violated
it is a rather severe one, and they ask
that the margin be made 6 points instead
of 4. Once a year there is a part of the
coins made wh'ich is known as the trial of
the pyx, and if these coins did not conform
exactly to the standard there would 'be a
very embarrassing situation.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time, considered in
Committee, reported, read the third time
and passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

SECOND READING

Hon Mr. DANDURAND moved the seccnd reading of Bill 146, an Act ta amend

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I am
moving the second reading of this Bill wiýth
the understanding that we may examine
the Bill more minutely in Committee.
I
can hardly give any more information regarding it than is contained in the Bill

The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Barnard in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would ask
the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw
ta explain this Bill.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: There are three
sections in the Bill. The first is an amend-

ment of an amendment that was made ta
the original Bill last Session. In the Bill
as originally introduced "officers" was defined; that is, an officer who could be retired under this law was defined as a persan
who received an annual salary. Last year
the definition was extended sa as to include
persons who were employed continuously
and receive'd a daily, weekly, or monthly
salary.
It was intended at that time ta
cover all persans in the Government service
who were employed continuously. It would
seem that there are certain persans who
are employed at an hourly rate of wage,
and as a consequence those responsible for
the administration of the law suggest that
it should be made applicable ta them as
well.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will the honourable gentleman name some of those
employees?

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHlEED: I do
not like to oppose the principle iavolved in
this section, and yet it seems ta nie that it
merits very consideraoble thougýht. The
Government is a very large employer of
labour by the heur. The tendency nowadays is for the Governnient to enter upon
maliy undertakings instead af letting them
by contract ta contractors who ernplay
workmen by the hour. This means that
we are ado.pting a principle by which the
Government -not only eventually but nuw
will assume an obligation to superannuate
ev.entually everyone who askg for it. This
mnust neoessarily entail a very heavy
burden in future upon the Gavernment. 1

into aur activities until naw we have

very much at sea as to what this will caver.
At the sanie time, we should nat thaughtlessly enter upon anything without knowing what it invalves--how many employees
and how rnuch maney.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable frlend name any other case?
Hlon. Sir JAMES ]LOUGHEED: 1 arn
not poeing as an autharity; 1 arn asking
for ineorrnation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I quite agree
that we should nat pension anyone who
is employed for an hour or two houirs a
day unless ho is permanent. I understood
irorn the honaurable gentleman from.
Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Calder) that that was
the case.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Do these eniplayees employed by the hour in that way
pay anything towards the Superannuation
Fund?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

No.

The Act as

it now stands is applicable ta "any officer,

clerk, or ather emiployee who is empioyed
ini the public service and who receives a
zýtated annual salary, and te any officer,
clerk or ernployee in the said service who
has been continually employed fron year
ta year, for a portion af each year."1 The
other Chamber insisted upon that provision going in the law last year. That is ta
say, there are certain eniployees, for
examplé, sessianal clerks, some ai whom,
have been employed tbwenty or thirty years.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Seasonal ernploryees an canais, and s0 on.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, "or who,
having been continuausly employeïd receive
a daily, weekly or nionthly rate af wage
or salary, but sqhall not include any persan
appainted for a temporary purpose ar any
persan whose duties do noV require constant
attention."
1 should like ta point out as well that
w-hen we had this measure up for consideration lest year it was thought that
that definition of the persans who might
ho entitled ta came under the Act would net
be sufficient, and we put in a further provision. 1 think this is alI that is necessary
ta caver any other class that should be
brought undýer the law, and, instead af
carrying through this amendinent I think
that we might leave the law just as it
stands. That further provision is:
If In the opinion of the Civil 'FervOe Comnmission the provisions of the Att should be
made applicable ta any officer, clerk or ernpioyee, not inciuded under paragraph (b)--

190

SENATE

That is what I have just read.
-the Commission shaHl report the same to the
Governor in Council, setting forth the circumstances and the reasons therefor and in the
event of the Governor in Council approving
sucli report. such officer, clerlç or enmployee may
be retired as provided by this Aac.

It seems to me it ia much better to leave
the law just as it stands, and if it found
that there is any clerk, whether working
on an hourly wage or not, who the Commission think should be brought under the
law, their view can be reported to the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable friend tell me whether the distinction
between a tomporary employee and a permanent employee is stili recognized?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In my day the
charwomen and mechanics and labourers
in the Public Works Department were al
on what was called the temporary list, and
at that time it would not have been thought
that they were entitled to a pension. But
niy honourable friend says that this is to
give the people a right to a pension.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: A great proportion
of those formerly called temporary employees are now permanent employees, but
there are stili temporary employees. For
instance, if there is a snowstorm a gang of
men may be employed to dlean the snow off
the walks.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is that the line
of demarcation?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Ail the other employees have been brought under the Civil
Service Act and tho Classification provided
for by that Act, and they have become permanent employees with very f ew exceptions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The charwomen
employed here, for instance, are permanent
employees.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would think so,
yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDJURAND: In order that
the bouse may have ai the information
before it which the other Chamber had, I
will read a memorandum which was in the
banda of the Minister. It is as follows:
As subsection 1 (b) of the act n0W stands,
provision lias been made to retire employees
receiving daily, weekly or -nonthly rates of
wages, but no pýrovis!on has been made for an
employee receix ing an hourly rate. This5 is obviously an oversiglit and lias resuicd in anomalies.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So far we are
not very much enlightened.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
that is very enlightening.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It continues:
As the act now stands it is posqible for the
Civil Service Commission to recommend for
retirement under its ter-ns, hourly rate employees by invoking subsection 2 of section 1 of
the act as amended, i.e. in each case making a
special case to be reported before council. This
clsss of employee covers those mn now drawing prevailing rates, but who, up to May of
1920, for many years' service were paid on a
salary scale.
On the other hand hourly etnployees who
are employed seasonaliy may be reported for
retirement under sub-section 1 (b) of the sot,
therehy creating an anomaly, in that, without
any special report, an hourly rate seasonal employee may be retired, whereas, an hourly rate
vearly em2ployee may be retired only by invoking subsoe'tion 2 of setion 1 and therehy
mnaking a special case of it. To correct this
anomaly it is recommended that the wor-d
"hotirly' be inserted in subsection (b) of section 1, between "receives" anti "daily".

As I have no knowledge whatever of
the operation of the Act, this is Greek to
me, but I hope the honourable gentleman
fromn Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Calder) bas now
more light than he had before I read this
memorandum, and that he may see his
way to accepting the Bill as it is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Limited
as mny honourable friend's light may be,
can ho see a gleani through this paragrapbi:
This class of employee covers thnse men now
drawing prevailing rates, but who, nip to May
of 1920, for many years' service were paid on a
salary scale.*

What is the distinction?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is an hourly
wage. Certain persons employed in the
Public Works Department were on an annual saiary. Since the classification passed
by the Civil Service Commission and approved by the Covernment, these people
are paid an hourly wage based upon the
current wage in the community. If 1 am
not mistaken, that took place about a year
ago. A year or so ago, when they were on
an annual salary, they could be retired
under the provision of the law, and many
of those people, old in the service, are still
there and cannot be retired under the law
as it stands, because the method of payment ba% been chianged.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Doos the honourable gentleman thînk that this will bo
at lcast harmless?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is my view, s0
long as the administration of the law is

491

JUNE 21, 1922
carrhed out properiy. Then, as pointed out
in that memorandum, there is power under
the haw to deal w1th those cases. The
Civil Service Commission, in the case of
an employee not covered by the general
provisions of the law, bas a right to, report
the facts. and the circumstances to the Governor in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why
should we not leave it at that?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite so. That
is the way the section reads:
'The Civil service Commission shail, inmediateiy atter the passing of this Act, and after
consultation with the deputy heads, prepare and
submit to the Governor In Council a report
upon ail officers of the age of 66 years and over,
and ail such officers, who are not reported to
be rendering good and efficient service for the
remuneration that is being paid them shall be
retired from. the public service.

But, so far as this flouse is concerned,
I do not think we could take the benefit
of this with regard to our own eniployees.
We are not a deputy head.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh,
yes, we are.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And, what is
more, we appoint our own employees with.
out any reference whatever to the Governor General in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is, the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister
is the Speaker and the Deputy Minister
is the Çlerk.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Where do you
find that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In
the Civil Service Act. We are the whole
machinery.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-retirement extended to officers over as well as under 65 and made
retroactive to July 1, 1920:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Under the haw as
it originaily stood when it first came into
operation,-the Civil Service Commission was
required immediately to review the cases of
alpersons over 65 years of age, and to, report as to whether or not they should be
retained in the service. That was two
years ago, and that work bas been carried out; so the section is no longer operative. The next section went on to state
that in the case of ahi persons under 65
years of age the Governor in Council
rnight direct the Civil Service Commission

to inquire as to, whether or flot they should
remain in the .service. This amendment
proposes that the second subsection should
read:
The Civil Service Commission shall, when
requested by the Governor in Counicil, and after
consultation with the depu'ty hcads prepare and
subinit to the Governor in CounciU for approvai
the names of ail officers who, being either under or over 65 years of age--

and so on. This is because the cases of
some persons who were 64 years of age
two years ago were flot reviewed, and no'w
they are 66. In order to ýbe able to deal
wi»th their cases the second subsection is
amended.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported.
THIRD READING
Bill 146, an Act to amend the Public Service Retirement Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 92, an
Act to anxend the Dominion Elections Act.
Hon. Mr. McMeans in the Chair.
On Section 1-change of elector's residence before general elections not ground
for disqualification:
Hon. Mr. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
when this Bill was before the bouse a
few days ago, I raised the point that if it
passed in its present form we would be
going back to the situation which existed
many years ago, when bribery and corruption were caused by bringing people
living outside an electoral district into it.
This Bill allows those who may have left
a constituency to return to it and to vote
in the district in which their names appear.
The present Act does, not allow that, and I
think it is fair to ail parties as it now
It is with regret that I ýsee the
stands.
Election Act being changed now so tbat
it wiil give opportunity for such practices
as were carried on for many years, and
which I think we ail regret. If it is the
wish of the Government to enlarge the
franchise, I .think we should go farther
and provide that every person who) is <yn
the voters' iist iný any constituency,
and who is rightly entitled to vote

SENATE
in that constituency, if he bas gone
to some other constituency, should also
have a right to vote even if he had stayed
;onger than two months.
I therefore move
to add the following as. subseetion 3:
3. If the name of any voter is or. the voters'
list of the district in which he previously resided, and conditions prevent him from having
his name placed on the voters' list in the district in which he is resident at the date of poiling, lie may cast his vote in th, constituency
where his name is inscribed on the voters' list.

In other words, if the list has been conpleted and is ready for the election, and the
man who was res'ident at the time was put
on'the list and would be entitled to vote in
that constituency, if he bas ýmoved to the
adjoining constituency, even though for a
longer time than two months, he should
have the right to vote if you are going to
allow those to vote who have moved from
the constituency.
Even with this amendrnent, candidates of
all parties would be in the position that
they would have to bring 'voters from outside; if they are on the list they are conpelled to bring them, and some one must
pay those voters' expenses, and probably
for their time.
This would result as it
did in the past, in many cases, in bribery,
perjury and so on.
That has been elimin-.ted for the last fifteeen or twenty years,
and every Government, so far, up to the
present tiime, bas resisted that.
I understand that this Bill was urged by
some members as .intended mostly for
cities, where many electors move from one
part to another. 'In those cities there are
several electoral districts, and it was
claimed that many voters would be .deprived
of voting.
That may be true; it is as
fair for one as it is for another; but in
rural districts also we have some diffi-

culty.
From my own constituency I know
that numbers have moved, some only across
the line into another constituency, others
a few miles axvay, and I am sure they
would have had to be brought back if that
bad been the law.
It 'has been suggested that as this amendment was intended for cities, it should be
applied only to cities.
For instance, the
(lause, as amended, might read, as fol-

lcWc:
(2) At a general election, any person who
would have been qualified to vote in an electoral
district situated in a municipali'y where there
is more than one electoral district, If he had
continued to reside therein, sha
remain so
qualified to vote in such ele-toral district
although he within two months imfnediately preceding the date of the issue of the writ changed
his place of residence from such electoral district to another within the same riunicipality.
Hon. Mr. REID.

If this Bill is intended for cities only,
then I think we should limit it to then; but
that would hardly be fair, though it would
avoid a great deal of the possibility of
bribery and corruption in the future.
I
thin'k every honourable memiber of this
House, espec'ially those who have had exrerience in elections, will admit that for the
last 15 or 20 years we -have had very little
trouble in election contests, as eoncerns
bribery and corruption, which were caused
by what I have mentioned.ý
Therefore,
while I do not wish to try to block the Bill
in any way, I want to get what I
believe would be fair and just, and have
our elections carried on in a pure way in
the future. They have been much better
in the last few years than they were previously. Therefore I make this motion, and
leave the House to vote on it; but, before
giving final consideration to it I would ask
the leader of the Government to delay the
Bil. till another Session, and consider the
few remarks I have made; and perhaps,
after consulting his colleagues, he would
decide whether there might not be some
way of changing this Bill so as to mec'
at least in part, the objections I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps the bonourable gentleman might accept this suggestion.
During the last election there
were people who had no vote because they
had moved from one electoral district to
another. It was then suggested by some
lawyers that the law be amended so that
a man would vote where be resided on
polling day, but he would have to produce a
certificate fron the returning officer that
te was entitled to vote, and that certificate
vould be handed in to the returning officer
in the electoral district where he then
resided, and where he was about to vote.
The returning officer would then give him
permission, as he would to any resident
to vote at such polling place as the returning officer thought proper. He would vote
on the returning officer's ordinary permit.
That would obviate the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. REID: That would meet my
objections at once, because the voter would
not have to be brought back to the othe'
constituency. If he had a certificate from
the returning officer or from the judgeHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The returning
officer.
Hon. Mr. REID: Or the judge who prepared and signed the lists; that would be

JUNE 21, 1922
the best way. If the voter had a certificate
fromn him to vote in the constituency in
which he resided at that time, it would
mneet ail objections, because then he could
flot corne back to vote in his original constituency, but would have to vote wherie he
was on election day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The plan suggýested to -me was that the returning officer
where the elector had the vote wouid give
him a certificate that he was entitied to
vote there, and the returning officer where
hle was then residing would give hirn a
permit to vote at a certain poi,-say number 19 or .20.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have had a good
deai of experience in the making of iists,
and I think the worst point of that suggestion is that the voter wouid not have
any guarantee that his narne would not
be stricken off the iist in the section from
which he had moved, and consequentiy he
rnight not be able to get snch a certificate.
There is a condition here which. ought to be
remedied if possible, and I want to make
a suggestion. The prinetple of the Eiection Act to-day is that a man or a wornan
shall vote in the district in which he or she
is residing at the time of the election, and
I thînk that is a good principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But the iaw
says, for the two months preceding.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes, I understand:
1 wiil corne to that. This amendment reverses that principle altogether, and intreduces the absentee voter. Now, it seems
te me the whole difficulty arises ont of
fixing the time from which you figure ont
the qualification of the voter. That is to
say, he must have resided in that district
two months previous to the date of the
issue of the writ. I do net see any reason
why that date should be accepted as an
arbitrary date for the purpose of fixing
the qualification of the voter. Voters' liats
in cities and towns are made up and are
being revised until about two weeks before
the election. Why could flot the law be
amended so as to enable a person to vote
where he or uhe had resided) for two
months previous te the day upon which he
or site applied te be registered? That
would, I think, practieaiiy eut out 90 per
cent of the dlfficulty, if not more; se that,
if I lived in Ottawa, say, and in two
nionths ail but two weeks I moved to
Montreal, I could get on the list in
Mentreal. Revision of the list begins about
sixty days before electien day, but if you

ff9i

examine the law you wiil find that there
are opportunities, to appiy right up until
within two weeks in towns and citiez; s0
that, as 1 *understand it, I can go any time
within two weeks before the election day
and appl'y to have my namne put on the iist.
I wouid have been there two months bel ore
the day I applied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the
iaw at present.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: No, you must be
a resident for two months. before the
date of the issue of the 'writ.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You wouid
shorten the time during which one wouid
have to acquire residence.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: No, I think my
honourable friend is mistaken. The law
says that you must have resided in the
district--ordinariiy
resided-for
twa
months previous to the date of the issue
of the writ of election. As the writ of
election is issued very neariy two months
before election day, that puts a man two
months back from the election day, and
then two months further; that is, four
months. Now, if I see this matter correctly,
by saying that he must reside for oniy two
months previous to the day on which he
applies for iregistration, you carry him
forward the two months, ebccept about
two wejeks. In a country district he could
be put on the list on the day of election,
so that ail he would have to do wouid be
to reside there two months previous te
.election day. I amn making that suggestion to my honourabie friend, because I
think that it may work out in that way,
and at the same time preserve the principle
of the election iaw; that is, to vote in the
district in which you reside.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn
not aware whether my honourable friend
has in mind the crîticism which I made
on this Bill when it wss before us a f ew
days ago, and which I think was not
appreciated by the House at that tume.
Possibly the House may net appreciate it to.-night, but I can illustrate it more clearly than I did then.
I advanced the argument that this Bill
proposed quaiifying a man te vote in twe
districts. It permits him to move eut of
one district into a new district, which wili
bring hlm within the Dominion Elections
Act, section 29, paragraph c, qualifying
him to vote if he resides for at ieast two
-months immediateiy preceding the issue of
the wrist of election.

SENATE
This Bill provides that he can go back
to his original district, and he is qualified
to vote there if he has within two months
immediately preceding the date of the
issue of the writ changed his place of residence from such electoral district to another. That is to say, he is qualified in
both. Now, let me illustrate this by dates.
The writs for the election issue on the lst
of January. On the lst of November he
moved to his new district, and he lived in
that new district during November and
December. He has qualified himself to
vote in that district by living within that
district those two months. He possibly
may vote and if he is an enthusiastic supporter of the present Government I have
no doubt he would vote in that district.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or of the
Opposition.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He
then may go back to the district from
which he moved, and he comes within a
clause embodied in this Bill qualifying him
to vote in the district from which he has
left, because the reading is:
Within the two months 'mmediatc3 preceding
the date of the issue of the writ. changed bis
place of residence from such electoral district
to another.

Now, the law knows no fraction of a
day, and consequently he is within the two
months, and therefore he is qualified in
both places. Surely it is not intended
that he should acquire a new qualification
by residing two months in a new district,
and at the same time be permitted to
go back to the district which be had left
and vote in that district. He is entitled
to only one vote, but he has the qualification to vote-and if he is not a man of
sensitive political morals he is going to
exercise his vote-in both.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend is confounding the date of the election with the date of the issue of the writ.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Both
qualifications are based upon the issue of
the writ, and the language is the same.
Let me read again:
Has ord:narily resided in Canda for
twelve months, and in the electcral
wherein such person seeks to vot, for
two months immediately preceding the
the writ of election.

at least
district
at least
issue of

Now, this is the same thingTwo months immediately preced.ng the date
of the issue of the writ.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The person would
have had to live in the county in November
and December.
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
writ is issued on the lst of January, he
would have moved into the new district
in November.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But it would
count the same in the new district.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: He cannot qualify
in both constituencies.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I contend that be can. I cannot see the distinction.
Subsection 1 and 2 of section 1 were
agreed to.
The Hon. The CHAIRMAN: The honourable gentleman from Prescott (Hon.
Mr. Reid) moves:
That the following be added as subsection 3:
"If the name of any voter is cn the voters'
list of a district in which he previously resided
and conditions prevent aim fro- having his
name placed on the voters' list 'n the district
in which he is resident at the date of polling,
he may cast his vote in the constituency where
his name is inscribed on the voters' list."

Shall this amendment carry?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I have
just read the proposed subsection, and it
does not seem to me that it adds much to
subsection 2. If it goes to the House of
Commons, they may take their choice, but
it seems to me it is on the same lines as
subsection 2.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Subsection 3, I
take it, simply illustrates the way in which
subsection 2 is to work out. That is all it
does.
Hon. Mr. REID: It goes further than
that. Instead of limiting the period to
two months, it gives the right to vote to
any person who has been away longer than
two months if le was legally on the voters'
list of the constituency in which be formerly
resided.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I can give the Committee a case exactly in point, in which
an elector was deprived of his vote just
under such circumstances. In the last election I ran there was a gentleman who had
been a resident of St. John, but he moved
to Fredericton. He was too late to get his
name on the list in Fredericton; so he
thought he would come down to St. John
to vote. When he came there he found that,
not being a resident, he could not vote.
As he had come down to vote against me,
I shed no tears. But under the amendment

495

JUNE 21, 1922
offered by the honourable gentleman from
Prescott, if it had been in force, this man
would have been entitled to vote in St. John,
where his name was on the list.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am not quite sure
as to the value of the amendment, but I am
inclined to accept it, because it may be useful in the country.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes, that is right.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If the Commons see
any objection to itHon. Mr. DANDURAND: They will say
so.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Reid was agreed to.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has my
honourable friend given some thought to
the point raised the other night, that this
Bill is not an amendment to subsection 2?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. I interviewed the Electoral Officer, Mr. Biggar,
and he said that those clauses were being
repealed purposely as being now of no use.
The preamble and the titie were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported as amended.

LOAN COMPANIES BILL
SEOOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 59, an Act to amend
the Loan Companies Act, 1914.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the
Loan Companies Bill has for its main object the restriction of investment powers
and the increase of the power to take deposits. Loan Companies could receive deposits up to an amount equal to their capital.
That limit is now being removed by this
Bill, but a limit is fixed as to the total
liabilities of those companies to the publie:
it is fixed at four times their capital and
reserve.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What was it before?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was equal
to the amount of their capital. One of the
other principal modifications of the Act is

the obligation upon those çompanies to
maintain a local reserve of 20 per cent of
their deposits.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
TRUST COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 60, an Act to amend
the Trust Companies' Act, 1914.
He said: The main objects of this Bill are
to restrict further the investment powers of
trust companies, both as to the trust moneys
they hold and as to their own funds, and
to provide for the appraisement of the real
estate that they hold.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I would ask the honourable gentleman in what direction the investment of the funds is being restricted,
and what is the object of the restriction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill will
go to the Banking and Commerce Committee, of which my honourable friend is
a member, and he will have an opportunity
to obtain the explanation there.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have been
asked particularly to call attention to this
fact. Trust companies that have Federal
charters are by this Bill restrained from
doing certain things that companies like
the Royal Trust Company in Montreal,
operating under a provincial charter, are
allowed to do. This does not gestrain
those provincial trust companies from
doing certain thingsHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the consequence is that you are now taking away
rights formerly enjoyed by Federal trust
companies in which people have invested
their money. There would be only one
thing for those Federal companies to do,
namely, to abandon their Federal charter
and take out a provincial charter. But
this would cause them a great deal of disturbance and trouble. I am pointing this
out only by way of warning to the Banking and Commerce Committee. We should
give. notice to the parties who are interested, so that they may have opportunity to be heard.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend's position is equivalent to

On section 2-prescription:
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:- When this
Bill was in the other Chamber, someone
asked if the time provided for bringing
an action against the Crown, after two
years, was long enough. The Minister,
who had no information at hand, and who
was looking i vain for a memorandum
from the Department, said, "Well, I have
no objection to making it five years," and
it was made five years. Now I find here
a memorandu-m from Mr. Newconibe. We
had asked the Department of Justice if it
was flot an innovation to use the words:
"No action shahl be brought against His
Majesty the King represented by bis Government of Canada." He answered justifying the expression, but he added:
The draft with regard to the flve years is
not mine. My suggested term wae two Years,
and I thought if there were to be five years delaY
before the dissolution the people entitled were
very likely to lose the benefit of It. These dissolutions, In order to serve the purpose Intended, should be made as early as possibule.
I am inclined to take the view of the
Deputy Minister of Justice who drafted
the Bill, and to restore the two-year
period.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Oh, no.
S-32

497

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: Well, I submit it to the gentlemen of the Senate.
I am simply explaining that five years
seems to me to be too long.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, five years is
not too long. It may take a long time for
peophe whose property is taken in their
absence to know that it bas been taken.
The Crown may take tbe property wvhile
tbe people are in Europe or in the antipodes, and have no opportunity of knowing that it lias been taken. I tbink five
years is little enough. As between subject and subject, it would be eitber ten,
twenty or Virty years.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I was
particularly struck with tbe element of
delay, wbicb was strongly urged in the
Gommons. It was pointed out that the
property would become dqpreciated in
value and fail into disrepair if the Crown
couhd not enter at once and take possession.
That was urged as a reason why the time
sbould be sbort. It is quite apparent that
provision could be made permitting the
Crown to take possession of the prorerty,
and to keep it in repair and maintain it,
and cbarge that up against tbe property.
Tbat is wbat sbould be done. Non-repair of tbe property sbould not be an element in entirehy ousting tbe possible tithe
of those wbo might bave an interest in
it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Under the haw in
tbe province of Quebee, tbe Crown would be
entitled to be repaid before returning tbe
property.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Such a
provision couhd be inserted in tbe Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would bave
no objection to sending tbis Bihl to tbe Committee on Banking and Commerce, and asking Mr. Newcombe to come and defend it.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

ME4T AND CANNED FOODS BILL
OONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Danduranýd, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 150,
an Act to amend The Meat and Canned.
Foods Act.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have asked
the senior rnernfber for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) to take charge of this Bill in
C ommittee.
I would like to recognize the
,ight honourable member in future as the
junior member for Ottawa.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Thank you.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The first purpose
of the Act is to put this work iinder the
administration of the Departmen-t of Marine
and Fisheries.
Forrnerly it was adtministered by the Departmnent, of Agriculture.

The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the
inspection of fish canning estaiblishmnents
ini order to insure that tbey are kept and
operated in a sanitary manner.
It also
provides that the raw -material shaîl he
subject to inspection during the w'hole process of preparation and packing; tbat the
cans shall contain the specified weight; and
that on the labels shaîl be shown a truc description of the contents; the weight, the
name of the packer and the place of packing.
It further specifies certain requirenients for imported canned fish and shell
fish.
The experýience of its operation in
recent years bas made it clear to the Departrnent, and to the canners, that sorne of
its sections require amenifing and others repealing, more especially those dealing with
the canning of lobsters.
A draft of the
proposed amendments was submitted to a
meeting of the Lobster Canners' Association held recently at Moncton, N.B., at
which an officer of the Department was
present.
After full and free discussion
the draft, as it now appears in the form of
this Bui, was unanimously agreed to as
practicable and comprehensive.
A draft
)vas also suýbmitted to the salmon canners
of British Columbia.
Sorne minor changes
were su'ggested by them, and these are enibodied in the Bill.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3, new section 12C-unsound
fish and shell fish hiable to confiscation:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The explanation
of this is that section 12C of the Act, which
iz to be ýrepealed, provides for the seizure

JUNE 21, 1922
of unsound fish or sheil fish ýbefore packing,
but does flot make any provision for so
dealing with unsound fish or sheil fish when
in the cans.
As fish and sheil fish found
ta be unsound prior to canning are amply
provided for in section 12B of the Act, this
amendment to section 12'C is intended to
cover unsound goods in cans.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4, new section 12D-cans to
be of five standard sizes:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This amendment
to section 12D of the Act is jntended to
deflniteiy fix the size of eac'h of the five
sizes of cans at -present iegalized; also to
empower inspectin.g officers to seize and
bold iight weight cans, pending a ýdecision
as to their disposai.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6-imported oanned fish to be
]abelled:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What authority inspects the imported fish?
Is it the Customs?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; special inEpectors ap.pointed under this Act.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Are they appointed
a,' the port of importation?
Are the cans
that are imported f rom outside countries
irispected?
If they are inspected at ail,
1 suppose it is at the point of entry.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
This is oniy as to labels, flot as to quaiity of the fish.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The inspection is
miade by the inspectors appointed under
the Act, and acting under regulations made
by the Department.
I presume those regulistions would indicate just what my honourable friend wants as to locality, etc., but
that would .be part of the regulations.
Section 6 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to, and the Bill was reported without,
amendment.

any explanation.

Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: I might

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, because I intend to move against it.
Hon. Mr'. WATSON: What is the Bill
for?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It pro-.
poses repealing a clause in the Criminal
Code which was put in the Code by the
Minister of Justice at the last Session of
Parliament, simply limiting the tîme for
actions being brought against frauds deal-

ing with scrip. The Criminal Code had
provided a limitation of actions in almost
every conceivable offence, except this particular ciass of case, and last Session, at
the instance of the Minister of Justice, a
limitation of tbree years was put upon
this class of offence, and it was thus included amongst the most serious classes of
offences committed.
An entirely false
interpretation has been placed upon it.
Some proceedings have been taken in the
city of Edmonton against a well-known
resident, wbo was alleged to have committed a fraud toucbing scrip some 'twenty
years ago.

500

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What was the
fraud?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
charge was of having secured some scrip
from a half-breed. Apparently, when this
clause was passed it was not retroactive
at all, and would only have operation from
the date when it was passed, and could
only go back three years. The provincial
Government, apparently, dropped the prosecution of the case, and the Minister of
Justice himself said in the Commons, when
it came up yesterday, that the statute was
not retroactive. At page 3328 he said:
Sir Lomer Gouin: I have looked over the
record regarding this matter. The question was
put to the officers of my Departrnent, and over
their signatures they have given it as their
opinion that the statuts of 1921 had no retroactive effect. That is aIso my opinion. As to the
Secord case, which was mentioned, it was commenced before the Bill was introduced, passed,
and sanctioned.
I would consider that this
amendment would not affect that case.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
pass it?

Why did they

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose it was simply because the member for
Edmonton, who is apparently one of the
Progressive members of Parliament, regarded this as a factor in his election. He
argued that this legislation was passed
purposely to pretvent prosecution in the
Secord case, and based his argument upon
the allegation that the Government of last
year, for the purpo'se of assisting a wealthy
citizen, had legislated in a special way for
his relief, whereas it will be observed that
such is not the case at all.
Now, in the last Session, after receiving from the Minister of Justice a letter
touching the criminal law amendments
that were before us, I likewise received a
letter from the Parliamentary Counseil,
reading as follows:
Memorandum for Sir James Lougheed.
The Minister of Justice would lika the enclosed
amendment made to the Crimina' Code when it
is being considered in Committee by the Senate.
It would come in after clause 24 of the Bill,
page 9, line 6.
The object of the clause is to p:ovide a prescription of three years with respect to any
offence relating to the location of land issued
by half-breed script. It is urged that there were
a good many irregularities amounting to fraud
and perjury in connection with the location of
these lands, and parties are raking up these
frauds for the purpose of blackmaling. If this
clause passes any such prosecution would be
proscribed ass the offences were committed a
long time ago.
Francis I. Gisborne.
31st May, 1920.
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

That means that the proceedings were
not then started. Now, the only case that
we know of was the Secord case, which
was started, but which was not affected at
all by this leg'islation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Started when?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before
the Bill was erver introduced. That is
what the Minister of Justice himseilf states.
Now, the amendment to. the Criminal Code
reads as follows:
24A. Paragraph (a) of section eleven hundred and forty of the said Act is amended by
adding thereto the following sub-paragraph:
(iv) Any offence relating to or arising out of
the location of land which was paid for in
whole or in part by script or was granted upon
certificates issued to half-bre ds *n connection
with the extinguishment of Indian title.

That is to say, 1140 of the Crirminal

Code deals with prosecution for crime, ancl
fixes a limitation of time for action, thus:
After the expiration of three years from the
time of its commission, if such offence be-

and it recites the following offences in the
three sub-paragraphs immediately preceding the new sub-paragraph iv, which I have
just read: treason, treasonable offence, and
offences reliating te fraudulent marking of
merchandise. These classes of cases are
the most serious in the Criminal Code.
This offence bas been included in the list,
and the longest limitation has been given
to this particular class of case. It was in
the public interest that a limitation should
be placed upon this class of offence, because it was clearly omitted from the
Criminal Code. As honourable gentlemen
know, almost every class of case has been
severally mentioned in the Criminal Code
under 1140 except this class of offence,
and this had been overlooked.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This was net
known at that time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
may be the case; but it would certainly be
an abuse of justice if parties were now
permitted to go back tlwenty years, owing
to the absence of a limitation in this class
cf prescription, and prosecute those who
would not be able to secure evidence that
must necessarily have disappeared some
time ago. For instance, in the Secord case,
the Provincial Government making the
prosecution, withdrew the proceedings. No
injustice would be done the parties who
entered the prosecution, because they could
recover in the civil courts if a fraud had
been committed. The right to recovery
still exists, because a man can not take
advantage of his own fraud. I am there-

to the Bill in error, and that the name of
the horiourable gentleman from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Harmer) appears on the record
as that of the Senator who was in charge
of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Wait until you
get the real culprit.

the House again.
The motion was agreed to, and the Order

Paper for the first sitting to-morrow.
PENNY BANK BILL
SEOOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 148, an Act to amend
the Penny Bank Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill is to enable a Penny
Bank to leave a proportion, not exceeding
one-half, of deposits received elsewhere than
at the place where the chief office of the
Bank is situated, on deposit in such chartered Banks or other financial institutions
as the Minister of Finance may designate.
The Penny Bank of Toronto, whichwas
incorporated by Letters Patent in 1904,
appears to be the only institution which
has been formed under the provisions of
the Penny Bank Act. The Act and the proposed amendment are, of course, of general
application.
The officers of the Penny Bank of Toronto state that the business has grown
largely and covers not only Toronto but
numerous points throughout the country.
In handling the business outside of Toronto they must rely upon the good offices
of a chartered bank or other financial institution which is willing to act as agent
for the Penny Bank. To facilitate this
outside business the officers state that they
could seclire closer co-operation and a
keener interest in the extension of their
work if they were permitted to leave a
part of their deposits with each Bank
which acts for them.
By section 25 of the Act a Penny Bank
may hold five per cent of deposits, for the
purpose of paying withdrawals.
All
moneys received on deposit in excess of

501

such amount must, under the Act as it
now stands, be deposited in a Government
Savings Bank or a Post Office Savings
Bank whence they can be withdrawn only
as stated below.
Subsection 2 of the Bill is necessary to
make other parts of the Act conforn with
the proposed amendment and covers withdrawals under section 26 for the payment
of working expenses or the augmenting of
the gurantee fund, for which purpose a portion of the interest may be used. By subsection 2 of section 26 moneys may be withdrawn to pay withdrawals by depositors in
the Penny Bank. By Chapter 11 of the
Statutes of 1917 the Bank mày also make
withdrawals for investing in such bonds,
etc. of the Dominion as the Minister may
approve.
The Bill is restricted to moneys "received on deposit elsewhere than at the
place where the chief office of the Bank is
situated". Section 7 of the Act requires
the letters patent to declare "(c) the place,
being a place in Canada, where the chief
office of the Bank is to be situate."
By section 37, as amended by Chapter 11
of the statutes of 1917, the bank is required to transmit to the Minister of Finance statements showing the condition and
business of the Bank on the last day of
June in each year, ver-ified by oath of specified officials.
The Manager of the Penny Bank advises
that deposits made by school children in the
Penny Bank outside of Toronto are received by a chartered bank and put to the
credit of the Penny Bank. Withdrawals of
these deposits made by the children are
charged against the same account. The
account is closed out every month by a
draft forwarded to the Head Office at
Toronto. There is at present about $300,000 on deposit from centres other than
the Head Office.
The Head Office maintains a staff of
thirteen persons which handles all the
business resulting from 50,000 individual
accounts of the Toronto school children,
in addition to Head Office work.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
do the deposits amount to?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have the
last statement of the directors. I have,
however, been wondering how this can be
a Government measure, and by whom it
was introduced in the House of Commons.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is it
under a charter issued under the Bank
Act?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Chapter 31 of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On the Sth of
November, 1921, Mr. Lockhart Gordon,
President, said that the deposits for the
past year had increased from $606,404, to
$731,000, an increase of $125,000, or more
than 20 per cent during the year.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is the amendment of subsection 2 of section 35 because
of the work that is entailed? Perhaps I
had better read the section we are now
amending:
All moneys received on depost and on hand
at any time in excess of such amnount-

That is, the amount stated above-shall be deposited by the Bank in a Government Saving Bank or in a Post Office Saving
to the credit of the Bank.

STATEMENT AND DISCUSSION

01 i the Orders of the Day:
Honourabie
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I beg leave te refer to a statement of the honourabie Senator fromn Welland (H1on. Mr. Robertson), the ex-Minister of Labour, as to the cost of a special
train fromn Ottawa te Toronto. The honcurable Senator gave the cost as $800
I wrote to the Deputy
oi thereabouts.
Minister of Railways to ask hlm his opinion as to these figures, and here is the
letter from Major Bell:
I ar nl receipt of your commu'I'cation relative to Senator Robertson's statement in the
Senate in regard to the payment of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company's account of
$1,423.00 for the carrying of caztain men te
Toronto.
Senator Robertson Is mistaken in his statement. The Canadian National Railways would
have furnishefi a special train fnr the carrYing
of these men at the same rate as the Canadian
Pacific }tailway carriefi themn on their regular
train, but in consideratioti of furnIshing a
apecial train they wokild have required a
guarantee of $3.00 per mile for the special, and
If the collections from tickets had fallen under
this amounýt, thea the Government would have
had 'te make up the difference, but if the collections from tickets had been In Lxcess of the
minimum guarantee, they would have hafi to
pay the larger amount, so, that the only difference would have been that they would have,
possibly, had a little quicker despUtch.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In repiy te
the honeurable leader of the Government's
remarks, 1 may observe that had the Gevernment purchased one ticket cevering one
theuýsand or one hundred men, as the case
may be, they would have found that the
resuit would have been what 1 have indicated. Furthermore, the justification advanced for sending those men back te Torente via the Canadian Pacifie was that the
Canadian National did not have a train
leaving here until one o'clock. I would
point eut again that the Canadian Pacifie
tTain was a local train, stopping at al
points between here and Toronto, and
reached Teronto only a short time ahead of
the Canadian National train, and that there
was contributed te the Canadian Pacific
Railway the sum of $1,422, which it might
have been expected would have been riirected in another chanýnel by the Government, who owned the other railway. I have

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, 1 would like te ask for some information from the henourable leader of the

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, since this question bas corne up, I
would like to bring to the attention of the
honourable leader of the Government another phase of it.
I do not think the
explanation about using the Canadian Pacifie Railway train instead of the Governnment train is very convincing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under ordinary circumstances I would condenin this.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I arn very glad to
hear my honourable friend say that, because ail over the country, frorn the Atlantic to the Pacific, there is thousands and
tens of thousands of dollars' worth of work
being handed over by the Governmexit to
the Canadian Pacific Railway Comnpany,
that could be just as well given to the railroads that we have to keep up anyway.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Hear, hear. That
is right.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I will flot add anything to what bas been said in regard to
the returning of those soldiers. I agree
with what bas been said about work and
the desirability of doing everything possible
and reasonable for the returned soldiers,
but I want to say this, that that rnob-for
that was the proper word for theniHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, nxo.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: -dîd not deserve
very much consideration; and I will tell my
honourable friend why. The Prime Minister asked them, time and again to, give
their naines and their regirnental numbers.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: And their records.

50

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: And their records,
or at least sufficient information to enable
the Government to get their records, and
they refused point blank to do it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: When he had
first refused point blank to meet them.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: He did not refuse
point blank to rneet them.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He dîd meet
thern.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: They refused te
give their naines, and they refused to give
their regîmental numbers whereby the
Government could have found out whether
these men were entitled to further consideration or flot. I doubt very rnuch that
they were ail returned soldiers.
They
may have been, or they xnay not have been
-who knows? If they would give their
naines and regirnental numbers, it would
have been found out how they had been
treated, and whether they were deserving
of further consideration or not. I arn the
last man who would complain of treating
our returned soldiers well, but there cornes
a limit. They were out of work, and I
venture to say that if they were like many
others out of work in the large cities,
work was the very last thing they wanted.
I remember that a year or two ago there
was a parade of over two thousand men in
the city of Toronto calling for work or
bread. They left their naines. The next
day a firm wanted to get four hundred
men to go to work. Do you th.ink they
could get theni out of that two tbousand?
They could not get two hundred out of
that number. It was not work those men
wanted, unless they were given about a
dollar an hour and six-hour day, and the
privilege to stay in the cities so that they
could go to the picture shows every night.
The whole labour situation in Canada is
on a wrong basis, and until the men get
down to the right basis and are willing to
do a fair day's work for a good day's
pay, we shall neyer have any satisfaction
and there will not be rnuch success in any
line of business in this country.
But what I particularly desired to do
was to emphasize the idea that the Governrnent ýhould be more careful in seeing
that their officials who, have it in their
power to handle the busineas should give
that business to the Government road and
not to the Canadian Pacifie Railway. Like
my honourable friend from Kings and AI-

bert (Hon. Mr. Fowler), ever since the
Government has taken hold of these roads
I have by precept and example tried to induce my friends, as far as possible, whea
they can do so conveniently, to make use
of the Government road rather than the
Canadian Pacifie. The Canadian Pacifie
is all right. It does not need to worry.
It is making big dividends, paying its
shareholders 10 per cent, while we are trking a deficit of many millions each year.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is under private ownership.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It was private
ownership that brought these railroads to
the position they are in-not Governnent
ownership. Who put the Canadian Northern on the rocks? Who put the Grand
Trunk on the rocks? Both of them were
private corporations, and my honourable
friend and many of his colleagues are
wanting to give the Government railroads
back to private corporations and let the
Government retain all the liabilities.
Surely.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is what my
honourable friend wants to -do. Now,
honourable gentlemen, we are going to
incur a very serious loss; but I believe
as firmly as I stand here that under
proper management, under decent management-not as good as private management, but under decent Government management-we shall incur much less loss in
connection
with our
railroads
than
we would by handing them over to
the
C. P. R., or any other private
company.
No matter who they are,
the C. P. R. would be behind them.
We
can get ordinary, decent Government management. You have not got it now, not
by any manner of means, and you will
not get it until there is a general cleanup on the railway situation. I know of
towns in the West in which the two railroads, the C.P.R. and the Government line,
are concerned, and where for the same
amount of work the Government road is
using three, four or five times the number
of men, the number of engines and the
amount of other equipment that the C.P.R.
is using. The Canadian National is doing
less work than the C.P.R. is 'doing with
one-third the number of men.

Saskatoon.
That applies all

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then may I
ask my honourable friend a question? His
statement is so astonishing and, in my
opinion, so incorrect, that I would ask him
to be specific and show us the cases. In
answer to the honourable gentleman from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), I
may say that in Saskatoon at the present
time the Canadian National does four
times the business that the Canadian
Pacifie does; consequently it requires more
men.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I think my honourable friend is very much mistakenHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not mistaken.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:-if he says that
the Government road at Saskatoon does
four times as much business as the C.P.R.
I say he is very much mistaken in that
statement. I did not mention Saskatoon
or any other place, but if the Government
would hold an investigation to ascertain
what it is costing in different places to do
the work on the Government railroads, it
would be easily proven that the statement
I made is perfectly correct.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It cannot be,
because the conditions under which the
employees on both railroads are working
are identical. In each case the agreements and the rates of pay are the same,
for they were arranged by the Railway
War Board, which had on it representatives from both those railroads. The cost
of doing a specific piece of work is practically the same on both railroads in every
instance.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Will my honourable friend say that the Government does
not have more men at a given place to do
the same amount of work as is done by the
C.P.R.? Will my honourable friend say
that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do say that,
west of Montreal.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Then my honourable friend is absolutely wrong. Let me
give him an instance. In a little town

SENATE
at Ottawa of the Canadian manufacturers
of matches and other people interested,
where the question of the proposed legislation had been discussed, and the conclusions
were fairly agreeable to the meeting. At
that meeting the Eddy Company was represented by Mr. Wood. On May 18, a
letter was addressed to Mr. Wood, as well
as to other parties, with a copy of the Bill
which is now before us for third reading.
There had been no suggestion of modification, and the Bill was proceeded with. The
day after this Bill had gone into Committee
and passed there, Mr. Finlayson received
a communication from the E. B. Eddy Company. I do not know that it is necessary
to read that letter, because, instead of
taking the third reading of the Bill, I intend to ask that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, which will meet to-morrow, so that
parties may be heard. These gentlemen
will appear before that Committee to make
representations which concern their own
interest. This may not deter Parliament
from proceeding with its work of controlling the importation and manufacture of
matches, but as this is a new departure it
may be well to give all parties a chance to
be heard. I therefore move that the Bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce for consideration
and report.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point
out to the honourable leader of the Government that he has to make the motion for
the third reading, and some other honourable gentleman may make the motion that
the third reading be not now proceeded
with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move the
third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move that the Bill
be not now read the third time, but that
it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me unfortunate that this Bill should
have been introduced at so late an hour in
the Session, dealing as it does with a very
important industry, and possibly affecting
very seriously the interests of the manufacturers of matches. If this Chamber
stands for anything it stands for caution
in the matter of protecting important interests against hasty legislation. While I
have no doubt that the principle of the
Bill is very meritorious, and should receive every recognition and every attention,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

yet, if a favourable opportunity does not
present itself, when it goes to the Banking
and Commerce Committee, for giving mature consideration to so important a question, I hope the Committee will not consider it incumbent upon them to deal hastily
with the Bill. Apparently a serious misapprehension has existed as to the alleged
agreement of the match manufacturers te
the proposals in the Bill. It now turns out
that the Eddy Company, which is the
largest manufacturer of matches in Canada, is very much opposed to it, and claims
to have always opposed it. The impression seems to have gained ground in the
Insurance Department that the manufacturers were favourable; but the Insurance
Department and the match manufacturers
seem to be diametrically opposed to each
other. I would therefore suggest to the
Government that, in dealing with this Bill,
they should keep in view the fact that ve
are within probably a couple of days of
the prorogation of Parliament, and, if there
is any material objection to the passage of
the Bill this Session, it should be held over
till the next Session of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. REID: In raising this question
the other day, I did so merely in order to
give any industry that might be interested
an opportunity of protecting itself before
the Committee. As far as the Bill is concerned, I am in favour of the principle,
but there is another class that may possibly be affected, that is, the importers;
so that every opportunity should be given
to every person and every industry that
might be affected in case the Bill passes.
If the Bi-Il goes before the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, it will
be absolutely impossible to bring people
from long distances to give their views
as to how it would affect their industry.
As far as the Eddy Company is concerned,
the reference to the Committee would be
quite satisfactory, for its representatives
could attend on a few hours' notice; but
how about people who may be at the other
end of Canada? They have just as much
right to be protected as those who are
here and able to be present. I would therefore suggest that before the Committee on
Banking and Commerce reaches a final decision the Government should ascertain
what corporations or industries would be
affected by importations of matches, and
give them equal rights to be present, and,
if it is impossible for them to attend, surely
the present law would stand good for a few
months until the House meets again, and in

JUNE 22, 1922

the meantime they would have an opportunity to go through the Bill and study it.

CANADA TEMPERANCE BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
will report after hearing the parties. I
think my honourable friend will be satisfied, after the Bill has gone to that Committee, that there are very few match
manufacturers in Canada: the list is very
short. At all events, that Committee wil
deal with it and make its report.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand,
the Senate went into Committee on Bi!l
132, an Act to amend the Canada Temperance Act.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-upon receipt of Order of
Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the Governor in Council may issue proclamation:
Hon. Mr. GREEN: I have an amendment to move to that. In the prohibition
provinces there are vested interests that
have some rights to protection. Under this
section as it now stands it will be possible
for Orders in Council to be passed immediately, which would practically mean the
confiscation of the various stocks that are
now held by the exporters in those provinces. Those stocks were purchased by
those people under the law, they were
stored there under the law, and were being
dealt with under the law. I move:
That at the end of section 157 the following proviso be added:
Providing that such Order in Council shall
not be passed Prior to the first day of January,
1923.
If this amendment is added to that particular section it will give the dealers an
opportunity to get rid of their stocks, and
prevent those stocks from being practically
confiscated.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: In the absence of the
honourable member for St. John (Hon.
Mr. Thorne), and at his request, and with
the permission of the House, I would like
to read a -telegram which he received
yesterday dealing with this matter:

Hon. Mr. BLACK: There is one feature
of this Bill that seems to me a very pronounced restraint on trade. The Bill is
said to be satisfactory to the manufacturers and to the Insurance Department.
There are two other
classes, however, who are interested in this legislation
-the
wholesalers, who distribute the
matches to the retail trade, and the retailers themselves.
If this legislation is
passed, as it now appears, it wil.1 impose
an additional tax and another restraint
on the wholesale and retail trade of the
country. Inspection, according to this Bill,
means that if the retailer or the wholesaler has in his warehouse a large stock
of matches, the inspector may come around
and condemn those matches, subject the
dealer to a fine, and put him to considerable
loss, and he -has no means whatever to
protect himself.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would ask how it
could be possible, if this man observed the
law, that he could have matches condemned.
If he had contraband matches, I could
understand.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Suppose he had ten
thousand cases of matches brought in before
this Bill went into effect. These ten thousand cases would carry his warehouse for
12 months. There are only two places
where inspection should be held: where
they are manufactured and, in the case of
imported matches, at the port of entry.
If
you
impose
additional
responsibility on the wholesalers and retailers,
they pass that on to the consumer, and
if this Bill goes through as it is now, it
simply means an additional burden wil
be placed on the consumers of Canada.
The trade of Canada to-day is subjected to
enough, and more than enough burdens,
in the way of taxation, on its ability to do
business.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.

legger of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have heard
the amendment of the honourable gentleman from British Columbia (Hon. Mr.
Creen), and I recognize that there is a
certain merit in giving some time to the
owners of liquor in Saskatchewan to dispose of their stocks or to transfer them
elsewhere. But I should like to hear from
the representatives of Saskatchewan in this
Chamber as to the length of the delay
which would be satisfactory to them and
to the people of the province.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I agree with the leadér of the Government that in a matter of this kind our
action should not be too drastic, and that
a reasonable time should be given to the
owners to dispose of liquor brought in under the law. But the request of the person
who sent the telegram which has just been
read, asking for a year or at least nine
months, is, to my mind, altogether unreasonable. My idea, speaking on behalf of
the people of the province of Saskatchewan, is that three months would be ample
time to allow these people to dispose of their
stocks.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Thirty days.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Possibly three
months would be too long, but I am not
disposed to be unreasonable.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: They could not
absorb it all in three months.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Oh, there are a
lot of thirsty people in that country.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: So far as I have been
able to learn, there is a unanimity of opinion in the Province of Saskatchewan on
this question. There are no two opinions.
Everybody in the province knows that
these so-called export houses are little less
than headquarters for bootlegging in the
province, and for the running of whisky
into the United States. Every newspaper
in the province, so far as I am aware, has
been condemning the condition of affairs
which has existed and still exists there, and
is advocating a restriction such as is called
for in this legislation. I do not think the
suggestion to give them nine months in
which to dispose of their stock of liquor
would meet with public approval. I think
three months is ample; in fact, I would
restrict them to a shorter period than three
months, because I am satisfied that the best
Hon. Mr. CURRY.

sentiment of the province is practically
unanimous in desiring to have these exporting houses wiped out of existence-and the
sooner that is done the better pleased every
one will be.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I should like to ask one or two questions.
In the first place, what is the legal status
cf the liquor which is now in the province
of Saskatchewan that would call for this
Chamber exercising some caution and care
along the line of protecting vested rights
:n property? The second question is: How
is it proposed that these people shall get
rid of the amount of liquor that is there
if they are given three months, or
six months, or nine months, or a year to
dispose of it? Is it that we want to give
them the opportunity of sending that liquor
into the United States, where there is a
general prohibition of the entrance of intoxicating liquors through the customs
houses on the border? Or is it that we
wish to make it harder for the United States
authorities to carry out the will of the
people of that country by putting these resources for violating their law close on
their borders, and keeping them there for
nine months, six months, three months, or
for a single month? Or is it, perhaps so
that the owners shall have six months in
which, through bootlegging operations, to
carry on the distribution of that liquor
amongst the people of Saskatchewan, who
have repeatedly stated that they do not
want it, and who have asked us to aid
them in getting rid of it? I think we
ought to answer those questions before we
make a change in this Bill.
Then, I have this other suggestion. The
people whose interests are most at stake
are right in the province of Saskatchewan
-the legislature and the authorities there.
They, I think, are the best judges as to
what should be done with the liquor which
is there now; liquor which came there
against their will, and is kept there against
their wishes; and which, if this extension
is given, will remain there against their
wishes to trouble them for another series
of months. These are questions which I
think we must decide for ourselves before
we give these opportunities.
I have followed the discussion in the
lower House, where the matter was brought
up and fully discussed; and the proposition
vhich was acceded to-and, I think, acceded to without an adverse vote-was to
let the people of Saskatchewan decide for
themselves. I am in favour of letting them
decide for themselves, and letting the Bill

remain exactly as it is. We must not
have too much commerce with vested interests in a bad cause.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Is it not a fact
that the Saskatchewan Government has
power to confiscate this liquor?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why have they
not done it?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That is what I
want to know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not believe for one moment that the Saskatchewan Government has the right to confiscate that liquor. In answer to the query
of the right honourable gentleman the
junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) I may say that I
believe the liquor is there legally, although
a certain part of it, and perhaps the whole
of it, may have entered Saskatchewan
when the importers knew they were importing it in violation of an Act that was
to be, in anticipation of an Act that either
had been or was to be voted upon. But
from conversations which I have had with
the Department of Justice I have come to
the conclusion that the liquor which is
there and which would be covered by this
amendment has a certain legal status and
is protected by the law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: By what lawThe law of the Province or the law of the
Dominion?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By the law of
the Province.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should
like to ask my honourable friend a question.
He is familiar with the Quebec Liquor Act.
As I understand it, the legislature of the
Province of Quebec took possession of the
stocks of liquor in that Province by giving
compensation therefor. That involved, I
should say, the exercise of a power by
which they could confiscate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Expropriate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was coming to that point. The Province of Saskatchewan could pass a law to take that liquor
and pay for it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or not pay for
it at all.

the right to do what was done in the Province of Quebec, namely, to compensate
the holders of the liquor at a price to be
fixed by them, knowing the real value.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That implies that they want the stuff. Do
they?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
the law of Saskatchewan befoTe me, but
I am sure the law allows the entry of
liquor in-to that Province for medicinal and,
manufacturing purposes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask niy honourable friend who spoke a
moment ago (Hon. Mr. Laird), if there is
not a vendor system in the Province of
Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am inclined to
agree e'ntirely with the right honourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George E,
Foster) about this matter. The Province
has the authority to deal with this. It is
not clear to meï that these people are there
legally at all. I will assume for the pur,pose of the argument that they are there
iegally. The province has absolute power
to take that liquor, expropriate, confiscate,
or destroy it. The authorities there know
best whether these people are there legall;
they are the best! judges of that. I think
the province alone ou'ght to deal with this
thing. We have no business to deal with
it. If the provincial authorities feel that
they are carrying out the wishes of the
great majority of the people of the Provinceý in destroying this liquor, I do not
.see why they should not have the right to
do it without compensation.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: If they have
full power, why are we dealing with it?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not want
to.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
leader of the Opposition asked the leader
of the Government if he was familiar with
the law in the Province of Quebec. I may
say that a case practically analogous to
the one existing in Saskatchewan existed
in the City of Quebec. Some whisky of a

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If they

allowe'd the owners a certain number orf
months or weeks to export that liquor
from the province of Quebee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Pos,sibly into Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Very possibly.
Now, the right honourable gentleman has
asked: "What are they going to do? Bootlegging, and so on?" Not necessarily. It
is much easier for Brittish Colunbia to get
liquor from Saskatchewan than it is to
(bri-ng it across the ocean. The Govern,ment of Saskatchewan could very well con.demn that liquor, which means to expropriate it and pay the owners for i-t-but
not pay them a profit-as the Province
of Quebec has done. The Province of
5Quebec appointed auditors, and they went
to anyone who had liquor and saiýd: "What
did you pay for it and what duty did
you pay on it?" The owner of the liquor
-then had to produce his books showing
what he had paid. No interest and no profits were allowed. He was silmply placed
in the same position that he would have
been in if he had never bought it. But in
the case of the liquor in the citiy of Quebec,
the Commission decided, on the recommendation of the Attorney General of the
province, to give the owners a certain time
to export. Where they sent it to, I do not
know. The same thing applies now in
Saskatchewan. Give these people a reasonable time in which tb sell the liquor to
British Columbia, or forsooth, if it is good,
to send it back to Quebec.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I was going to say
that if honourable gentlemen would
read the sections of the Bill, they would
probably be better informed as to what it
proposes. These liquor houses cannot be
put out of business unless two things are
done. First, the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council of the province must pass an Order
in Council requesting the Federal authoriThere

The provinýcial

Order in Council one month, or two months,
or for whatever time they desire. Then,
that Order in Council having been passed,
upon its receipt by the Federai authorities the Federal Government may pass an
Order in Council bringing the law into
effect. They have the option of exteýnding
the time also, and I have no doubt that they
would give a reasonable time for the parties interested to dispose of the liquor which
they have in stock.
The question has arisen as to where this

wan can handle it, directly or through a
Commission which must exist for the purpose of supplying druggists and other
people entitled to purchase liquor.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I was coming to that.
Under our system in Saskatchewan, as I
understand it, an official vendor has been
appointed whose business it is to supply
the drug stores and those entitled under
the Act to purchase liquor, and it will be
possible for the export houses to dispose
of their liquor stocks within the province,
to this official vendor, who is entitled to
receive and entitled to sell it. Now, it is
not for the people of Saskatchewan, who
have had to put up with this incubus for
several years, to suggest what should become of this liquor. The law provides
means whereby it can be disposed of, and
restrictions by which it cannot, and it is
for those who are interested to get rid of
it in a manner which appears to them
best and in compliance with the laws of
the country. The point I am trying to
make is that, according to section 157,
ample provision is made for giving the
interested parties due notice before this
law can come into effect, so that they may
make whatever arrangements they think
necessary to dispose of their stock in any
manner which may appear to them proper.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Does not the
honourable gentleman think that three
months would be rather a short period in
which to dispose of it in such a limited
market as that provided by drug stores
and persons requiring it for sacramental
use.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I can answer that
question by saying that there was in the
Province of Saskatchewan a time when
the dispensary system was abolished, and
no difficulty was then found in getting rid
of all the liquor that was in stock, in the
hands of dealers. No delay was claimed,
and the liquor in store at the time was
all disposed of without any injustice being
done to anybody.

liquor is where the liquor can be taken in
bond, and the Excise department of the
Dominion, as I understand, grants no
license if the warehouse does not take
bonding privileges, which means that the
liquor is put in there and the duty is paid
on it as it is taken out. Numerous other
houses out there have sprung up. Like
Topsy, they just grew. The legislature of
Saskatchewan passed an Act at its last
Session proposing, not a license, but a tax
on the liquor export house of $5,000 a
year. Prior to that there was a tax of
$2,000, I think. The municipalities in Saskatchewan, where export houses are now
located are imposing taxes on them, and
those taxes are being contested in the
courts at the present time.
Coming back to where I started, I think
we can trust the legislature of Saskatchewan as representing the people of that
province. We can trust the Government
and the Assembly, as representing public
sentiment in Saskatchewan, to deal with
the question in a manner which will be

this question entirely to the province, and

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Mr. GREEN: Honourable gentlemen, I do not want any wrong impression
to exist in the minds of honourable members as to my position on this question. In
the first place, it is my belief that those
people are there legally. If there is a
bonded warehouse in the province of Saskatchewan, it was bonded under a license
from the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. REID: And at the request ofHon. Mr. GREEN: And at the request,
I was going to say, of the province. I know
that, because, so far as British Columbia
is concerned, to my certain knowledge
there were requests made to the Dominion
for the establishment of bonded warehouses there, and the reply in every case
was that it was necessary first to obtain
the consent of the province. For a year or
two there were no licenses issued, because
the consent of the province was not forthcoming. Then a change came over the
scene, and certain persons secured the
consent of the province, and then secured
a license from the Dominion.
What I
desire to point out is that those people
are there legally. I have no desire in the
world to protect the bootleggers or to have
anything to do with people who are encouraging bootleggers. I said before, and
I repeat, that these people are there
legally. They have money invested, and
they are entitled to protection. They are
there at least, with the consent of the
Federal authorities and with the permission of the provincial authorities. It has
been shown here to-day how narrow are
the channels through which they can legally
dispose of their goods. It is admitted that
there are only certain channels. In addition
to those mentioned, there is the channel of
the foreign markets. They cannot sell their
liquor in British Columbia, because British
Columbia has already imported and is
importing direct the liquor she wants. I
presume they cannot sell in Quebec. They
might ship to Mexico or the Orient or
somewhere else.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: Or to Bermuda.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: To Bermuda and
other countries. They had a legal means
or opportunity of getting rid of this liquor.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They could not
sell in Bermuda.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: They have a legal
means of getting rid of these liquors outside of Canada. All I am urging is that,
as they are legally there, and as there is
no present opportunity for them to get rid
S-33i

of these liquors quickly, they be given a
fair and reasonable time in which to dispose of their stocks.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I would like to ask my honourable friend
one question. It is this. Is there any
disability which, under the emergent circumstances, would prevent these people
from shipping what they have in Saskatchewan either to British Columbia or to
Quebec and holding it there for as long as
they liked, an.d making such disposition of
it as they deem proper?
Hon. Mr. GREEN: If this Bill passes
in its entirety, they certainly cannot ship
it to British Columbia.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But if the Bill passes, it takes a certain
time to get two Orders in Coundil passed
and the Bill made operative, even though
there is an endeavour to facilitate it as
much as possible; but it would not take
them a week to ship all that they have,
either to British Columbia or to the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They must find
a purchaser.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then they would have all the time they
wanted to find a purchaser.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: Where are they going
to place it when they get it into British
Columbia? They would have no warehouse
there or any other place in which to put
it. They cannot get a bonded warehouse
there without the consent of the proviñce,
which they are not likely to obtain. Moreever, what have these men done in investing their money that they should be
forced at a moment's notice to take a
course of action such as the right honourable gentleman suggests?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I wish to correct a
wrong impression of the honourable gentleman from Kootenay (Hon. Mr. Green)
when he states that those people hold
bonded warehouse licenses from the Federal Government, and that the warehouses
were bonded on request of the provincial
government. I want to inform this House
that for a number of years the provincial
government have steadily and absolutely
refused to request the Federal Government
to issue these licenses, and there has been
an impasse between the two Goverrments
on that question. The Federal Government have refused to give the bonded license
because the Provincial Government would

516

SENATE

never ask for it, and the Provincial Government has religiously refused to ask
the Federal Government to issue such
licenses.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How did they get
them?
Hon. Mr. REID: The honourable gentleman states that in Saskatchewan there
are to-day at least one or two bonded
warehouses.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Two.
Hon. Mr. REID: If there are two bonded
warehouses on license issued by the Dominion Government, they exist now at the
request or with the consent of the Saskatchewan Government. If they are in
existence now it is because the local government has not requested the cancellation of the licenses, which are continued
from year to year. The liquor has been
shipped there; it must have been shipped
from Montreal; and it is in store there;
and surely, until the licenses expire on
the lst of January next, the parties who
have sent the liquor and stored it legally
should have an opportunity to get rid
of it.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The honourable gentleman who has just spoken is under a
wrong impression. The two licenses to
which he is referring are licenses issued
by the Federal Government to the official vendors, who legally supply the drug
stores and others entitled under the law
to receive it. But we are discussing now
the question of those export houses. They,
I repeat, have not a license from the
Federal Government, and the reason is
that the Provincial Government has always refused to request it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Have they a
provincial license?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I do not think they
have a provincial license. They pay taxes
to the Provincial Government.
lHon. Mr. PARDEE: And the Provincial Government recognizes them.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I would like to
say just one word with reference to those
export houses in Saskatchewan. When this
law first came into force I was myself approached by some Winnipeg friends who
wanted an export house in Saskatchewan.
I approached the Dominion Government to
secure a license. I was told by the Government at that time that they would issue
no license except at the request of the
Saskatchewan Government, and it was a
Hon.

Mr. LAIRD.

very short time afterwards that these
people secured their license; and I presume
secured it after getting the consent or
request of the Saskatchewan Government.
I am satisfied that was the law, and I am
satisfied it is the law to-day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Sure.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I hold, in connection with this question-and I am no
friend of the bootlegger-that the Saskatchewan Government has the power, if it
wants to exercise it, and the onus ought to
be placed on the Provincial Government
and not upon this House. I think the Saskatchewan Government is shirking its
duty. In view of that fact, I feel that this
House could very well afford to say to the
Saskatchewan Government: "If you do not
want this liquor, confiscate it.
You are
collecting a license fee from it; you are
legalizing it by doing that."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think we should
hear from the member from Moosejaw
(Hon. Mr. Calder).
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: You will hear
from the member for Sussex 'now. I am
opposed to prohibition and have always
been opposed to prohibition, because I do
not think it is in the best interests of the
country. At the same time, if there is any

For instance,

it may be transported through those prohibition provinces.

The condition

On the Orýders of the Day:
Hon.
Mr. DONNEL*LY:
Honourable
gentlemen, before the Orders of the Day
are ,proceeded with, I desire to call the
attention of the Government to a despatch
in this morning's Ottawa Citizen, which is
as follows:
London, June 21.-Rep1ying to a question
asked in the House of Commons yesterday, Sir
A. Gritrith-Boscawen, minister of agriculture,
saîd lie wvas aware tliat it was estlmated that
200,000 head cf cattle would be imported from
Canada at once if the present precautions regarding

were established in Great B3ritaýn. Probgbly

I am quite sure that we would not have to

THE OFFICIAL DEBATES
THE FRENCH VERSION

Hon RUFUS POPE: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to call the attention of
this House to the fact that yesterday,
when I wa.s searching for copies of Hansard, in the French Canadian language,
'I discovered that I could not get one. I
was told-I do not know whether correctly
or not-that about twenty-five copies are
published. In the district from which I
corne, at least 75 per cent of the peop'le are
French, and I have always taken occasion
to send copies of Hansard to certain persons who I thought would be interested.
I know of no reason why we in the province
of Quebec, where there are 65 counties,
should not be furnished with more than
twenty-five copies of the French edition
cf Hansard. The two languages are supposed to stand on an equality, and I for
one feel -that in justice to us and the
people we represent, we ought to be able
to obtain as many copies of the French
version of Hansard as we may desire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will take
up this matter with the Debates Committee, which I suppose should deal with it.
If it belongs to another Committee, I will
draw the Committee's attention to the fact
that too small a number of French copies
,f Hansard are allotted to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

My honourable friend will allow me to

correct an expression which he used. He
said that he had been looking for a FrenchCanadian copy. There is one official language besides English in this country: it
is the French language, which is common
to France and to its old colony in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: For the information of honourable gentlemen, I may say
that this morning I took the liberty of calling the attention of the Chairman of the
Debates Committee to this matter. I wrote
him a letter, which I suppose he has not
yet received.
I think that if the Debates
Committee, after discussion, would simply
request the Editorial Committee to supply
two or three hundred additional copies to
the Distribution Office, the matter would
be settled.
Hon. Mr. POPE:
In reply to the correction which the honourable leader of the
Covernment made, I may say that, technically, I presume he is right, but in our

province of Quebec we recognize only one

Canadian language, and that is the French
Canadian.
Hon.

CANADA

TEMPERANCE BILL

FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 132, an Act to amend the Canada
TEmperance Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 3-importation of intoxicating
liquor in certain cases:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I move the
adoption of subsection 1 of new section 163.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Honourable gentlemen, I am inclined to think that there is

a certain amount of opposition to this
measure, judging from the debate which
took place on the second reading. For my
part, I do not wish to go over the ground
I then covered; but I intend to vote against
this subsection,

and, in fact, the whole

Part V of the Bill, for the reason I have
already stated, that is to say, that the

JUNE 22, 1922
clauses are flot asked for by the people of
the province of British Columbia or by the
province cf Quebec. I move that the whole
qf Part V be struck out.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Mr. Chairman,
1 understand that we, are discussing the
whole of Part V. I think that part might
be adopted if it were amended in some
nhthe first place, 1 was glad to
respects.
observe this morning, in the discussion on
this Bill, that we were desirous of giving
the various provinces the absolute right
to deal with the liquor question, and facil.'
ities to deal with it as they saw fit. New,
I have a clause which is, I think,
in line with giving local provincial option
to the various provinces, and I really believe that any sincere friend of temperance
shjuld be glad to propose or second the
amendment which. I arn about to read. We
know that this question is a very live one,
and if we desire to stop the bad effects of
alcoholic or intoxicating liquors, the thing
to do is to prohibit their manufacture, and
that is what I propose.
Ilowever, before proceeding to discuss
that point, and since we are in Committee,
it niay be apropos to deal with the whole
question. The other day the right honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) said
that some provinces were making money
out of the liquor or wine traffic, and that
these provinces, instead of taxing their
people, found it much easier to obtain revenue from that traffic. I resent that statement so far as our province is concerned,
because the purpose of our law is to pro-.
mote temperance. It has been so, framed
that the prîce of what might be called really
intoxicating liquor, such as Scotch whisky,
is almost prohibitive to any one desiring
to purchase it. It is $4, $4.50, even
$5 a bottie, which means between 40 and
50 cents a drink. Well, there have not been
many and there will not be many who wi]I
pay that price; and since our law has been
in force, I arn very glad to declare in this
House-and I hope rny voice wîll reach
beyond the walls of this Chamber-that
there bas been practically no drunkennesa in
the province of Quebec. The price is prohibitive. On the other hand, there is the
use of beer. Why, one could not possibly
get intoxicated with it if one tried.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
before he is drunk.

A man is full

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is suggested
by the honourable member £romn Portage
la Prairie that the man is full before he is

drunk. I think that is perfectly correct.
One could not possibly drink enough of
this light beer to becorne intoxîcated. He
would becorne sîck at his stornach first.
As to the use of wine we have only to
go to the Good Book to learn that the firat
miracle that Our Lord performed was at
the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee. What
was His first miracle perforrned in the
thirtieth year of His life? He changed
water into wine-not a small quantity, but
the contents of three vases, each containing
two or three firkins, whatever that measure
is.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Three barrels.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The water was
in atone vases such as the Jews used for
purifying themselves, and if you can purify
yourself in any other way than in a bath
I do not know how. So there were three
bathfuls at that wedding feast.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
were heavy drinkers.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: His Mother, the
Blessed Virgin, was present at that feast.
Our Saviour was there with his disciples,
and after a while bis Virgin Mother came
to, himi and said: "My son, they have no
more wine to drink." 1 am speaking by
the Good Book. Then He said: "Fi up
those three large atone vases." And he
transformed that water into wine.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
are doing that to-day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN *(reading): "The
ruler of the feast (who in modern times
would be called the butler) went to the
bridegroom snd saith unto him, Every man
at the beginning doth set forth good wine,
and when men have well drunk, then that
which is worse, but thou hast kept the
good wine until now."
Hon. Mr. WATSON: They do not know
what they are drinking.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN (reading): "This
was indeed better wine than the firat."
Now, that is fmom the Good Book, and 1
do not like to see people smiling, even
laughing, when I amn quoting the Bible.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
must be a new version.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no; that is
absolutely accomding to the text.
Then, for sacramental purposes, as
everybody knows, use is made of hread and
wine-wine that contains no water. Look
at the Psalms. In Psalm. 104, the lSth

SENATE
verse, what do you find? "Wine maketh
The Latin is:
gl.ad the heart of man."
" Vinum bonum lætificat cor hominis." " Le
bon vin nous met la joie dans le cœur."
With those examples, coming from on high,
we cannot say that wine can possibly be
detrimental.
I would recommend the reading of an
article which has been written by the Prime
Minister of our province. I will quote only
the last five lines of it:
Even if promoted by prohibit onists, whose
sincerity of purpose cannot be questioned, any
agitation aiming at Federal prohibition will be
highly resented in the province of Quebec. In
order te better resist such warrar.ted attempts
all should keep well in mind the statement of
Abraham Lincoln in the prohibition controversy
in 1840.

I see before me my honourable friend
from Mille Iles (Hon. Mr. David), who has
heard our late leader Sir Wilfrid Laurier
state many a time that he considered Abraham Lincoln to be the greatest statesman
and one of the best Christians America ever
saw; and what does Abraham Lincoln say?
Prohibition wil. work great injury to the
cause of temperance. It is a species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the
bounds of reason, in that it atteites to control
inan's appetite by leg:slation and makes a crime
out of things tiat are not crimes. A prohibition
law strikes a blow at the very principles on
which our Government was founded.

ýSo much for Abraham Lincoln and his
opinion. Now, in order to live up to this
and to show that we are all in favour of
giving the provinces absolute, free control
of this liquor question, I would move as
the first clause of -Part V:
Upon the receipt by the Secretary of State of
Canada of a duly certifled copy of an order
of the Lieutenant Governor in Council of a
province praying that local option be granted
to a province to prohibit the manufacture of
intoxicating liquor in a province, the Governor
in Council may by proclamation published in
the Canada Gazette declare that such province
is granted local provincial option to prohibit
the manufacture of intoxicating liquor in that
province.

If we want to destroy the effect, let us
destroy the cause. The cause is manufacture. There is one province in which, I
suppose ever since Confederation and
before, most of the liquor bas been manuI do not know that there is

Is there any district in

where it is legally manufactured?
I do
not know that there is even one. I do not
suppose that there is one in British Columbia. Therefore the province that bas been
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

agitating-and it is the banner province
of this country-is the very province from
which this evil is supposed to corne. I really
believe that my right honourable friend
from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) should propose this amendment,
and if he does I will second it. If he will
not, perhaps the honourable member from
Goderich (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) would move
it. He was trying only the other day to
make life very uninteresting for young
people.
Surely there must be in this
House some sincere friend of temperance,
some one who would prohibit the manufacture of whisky.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: In Quebec.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: All the distilleries
are in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I ask honourable
gentlemen across the way, and honourable
gentlemen on this side too, is there in this
House no friend of temperance who will
move this?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Move it yourself.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman second it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is another motion before the Committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am told there
is another motion.
Therefore this will
have to stand. I will move it later.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The honourable
gentleman can then make another speech.

Hon. Mr. BIEQUE: That would not be

It is not necessary to move an
amendment that it be not adopted. We
need only vote on the motion.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The motion is

Barnard) that the whole of Part V be

JUNE 22, 1922
I have had occasion to state that the
principle which has been followed by Parliament in the last few years was to respect the freedom of each province to legislate for itself on the liquor business. Parliament has stated that where a province
was deficient in its power to carry out its
own procedure or method of dealing with
the question, the Dominion would come to
its help. That was done in many instances
during the last parliament. This part of
the Bill has for its object practically the
implementing of provincial legislation.
British Columbia and Quebec have declared that they would adopt what I think
was known up to two years ago as the
Gottenburg system of control by the state
of the liquor business and the dispensing
of liquor to the people. This bas been the
action officially taken by the legislature
of British Columbia and the legislature of
Quebec. It is supposed to be the will of
the people of those two provinces.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
I hear the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
negative to that affirmation. I think
there can be no negative against my affirmation that the legislature of a province
speaks for that province; and it speaks
for the province so long as the law which
it enacts remains on its statute book.
British Columbia bas, through its legislature, adopted a certain Act; Quebec bas
done likewise. Now, are we to go behind
the power granted those legislatures and
ask by what authority they have enacted
such legislation? I believe that we canUntil British Columbia or Quebec
not.
changes its policy at a general election,
we must take for granted that the policy
enacted by those legislatures bas behind
it the will and endorsation of the people.
Now, British Columbia and Quebec have
decided that the contrbl and sale of liquor
shall be exercised direct by the Government of the province, or through an officer or a Commission; that no license
shall be given except under certain conditions; and they are desirous of retaining control of this business. Control, of
course, means monopoly, and since they
declare in favour of that monopoly, I think
we are simply standing on a principle that
bas governed this Parliament during recent years: "Let your will be carried
out."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Does control mean
monopoly?
In this inHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stance the province of British Columbia

and the province of Quebec claim the sole
right to the sale of liquor in those provinces.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
too.

In my province,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the other
provinces as well have been practically
taking control of the liquor business. But
British Columbia and Quebec have gone
further: they have declared that they
would sell liquor under certain limitations
and conditions to the people of those
provinces. In order to maintain control,
and carry out their legislation, they ask
that the Federal Parliament come to their
help and declare that when, by an Order
in Council, a province expresses its desire
that nobody in the province but the Government or a Commission or an agent
specially named be entitled to import, the
importation shall be restricted to the province or to a Commission or other agency
set up by provincial legislative enactment. This is the will and the desire of
those two provinces. They have a monopoly of the sale of liquor, and they desire
that we should help them in preventing individuals from purchasing outside liquor.
We have heard, and we shall hear again,
the statement that this is limiting the
liberty of the subject. The answer has
been made that there are very few restrictive legislative enactments that do not
limit the liberty of the subject. I recogI have always
nize that personally.
bought my wines direct from France; but
under the Quebec Act, if we pass this
legislation, I shall be obliged to ask the
provincial Commission to kindly fill that
order for me. I may pay a little more,
but I shall be ready to join, and all good
citizens in the province of Quebec are
ready to help in trying to make a success
of the legislation which bas been voted by

restricted in the freedom we have heretofore enjoyed, but I do not see why we
should not be ready at all times to make
some individual sacrifices in order to obtain better results in the community.
As my Honourable friend to my left
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said, the effort in
the province of Quebec is to increase temperance, to remove abuses. It is an experiment, as is that being carried out by
British Columbia. In the matter of dispensing liquor to the people, we are still
in the experimental stage throughout the
The Federal Government bas
world.

SENATE

stated that it would allow the provinces
to experiment with any method which they
might desire to adopt.
Other provinces are proceeding on other
lines. Quebec and British Columbia have
adopted a certain system. Is there anything
wrong in giving those provinces the right
to conduct their own affairs, and to apply
to this question of the liquor traffic their
own principles, systems, or doctrines? I
think that the experiment that is being
carried out in Quebec, which I know better
than I know what is going on in British
Columbia, is a most interesting one, and
I would be very sorry to see anything
done that would prevent the experiment
from having free scope.
It may be alleged that in a year or two,
if we do not give those provinces the
powers which British Columbia, for example, is asking for, the system will break
down because we did not provide the
necessary implementing powers. The same
result may follow our withholding these
powers from the province of Quebec. I do
not know that, nor do I know to what
extent this legislation will help them; but
they are asking that we allow them to control the importation of liquor, and to limit
it to those whom the legislature has decided
should have the control of that business.
For that reason I hope that the amendment of my honourable friend will not be
accepted.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Will the honourable
gentleman tell me whether the province of
Quebec joins with the province of British
Columbia in demanding that the liquor that
is being imported by the Government shall
not pay any import duty?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You cannot speak
for our province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: T have not
seen any such demand from the province
of Quebec, and I have not heard that the
province of British Columbia was asking
for that authority.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Surely the honourable gentleman knows that the province of
British Columbia has had his Government
in court to establish that very point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But what bas
that to do with the present legislation?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: It will have a good
deal to do with the legislation if we are
asked to give authority to two provinces
to escape this amount of federal taxation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are not
doing it under this Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: No, we are not
doing it under this Act, but I think that is
a fair question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not suppose that the Federal Government will
allow liquor to enter without paying d'uty.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Privy Council will say that.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, as the honourable gentleman says, the Privy Council will
say that, if any Government is permitted
the sole right to import liquor, or to import
anything else for that matter. If the Privy
Council establishes, in the case which is
now open, and which I believe is on appeal,
that a province is not liable for duty on
liquor imported by its government, the
effect will be very important indeed. It
bas a very serious bearing on the legislation which we are now asked to pass.
While a question of this kind is pending,
and while the issue is in the balance, and
we do not know whether this liquor is to be
duty free or not, we are asked in effect to
confer on two great provinces the right to
abolish import duties on ail the liquor
which they may bring in fer public consumption.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We are not
asked in virtue of this amendment.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I am not surprised
at honourable gentlemen saying no. It
seems almost incredible that the Government should bring forward legislation of
this kind under the circumstances; but
I say yes, there is no doubt about it whatever.
The honourable gentleman who
leads the House told us he did not know
that British Columbia was putting forward this question; yet British Columbia
bas had a suit in the Exchequer Court to
establish this very point, and of course if
British Columbia obtains a verdict in that
litigation, Quebec will have the advantage
of it.
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainlv.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: It seems to me that
it is a most important thing to have a
distinct agreement with the province of
British Columbia and with the province
of Quebec, before we confer on them the
sole monopoly of importation, that they
will abandon any pretence of bringing in
the liquor free of duty.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
nember is evidently under a misapprehen-

JUNE 22, 1922
sion that the Province of British Columbia
may have raised the question as to
whether the Dominion of Canada .can levy
a tax on importations made by the province because the importation is made by
the Crown; but this Bill is not dealing at
at all with that. The only question under
this Bill is as to whether the provinces
shall be given autonomy as regards dealing with liquor. One province may be
in favour of prohibition; another province
may be in favour of limited prohibition or
some other system; and I think that if
we follow the course that has been heretofore laid down we should supplement for
each province the power which is necessary to give effect to the will of that province. I am sure we all listened with a
great deal of interest and a great deal
of pleasure to the admirable speech made
two or three days ago by the right honourable member for Ottawa
(Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster). In the first part of
his speech the right honourable member
showed the importance of supplementing
legislation as far as necessary to give
effect to the will of each province on a
question of that kind, and he went to the
extent of saying that if it were necessary
to amend the constitution he would be in
favour of doing sq. Well, we are not
called upon to amend the constitution in
any shape or form. We have a constitution under which the power is divided;
the jurisdiction to deal with this matter
rests partly with the provinces and partly
with the Dominion; and I do not care what
province it is, I would give to any of the
other provinces to-morrow what I would
give to Quebec to-day. The honourable
leader on the other side of the House will
remember that when the province of Ontario was in question, when it wanted to
have from this Parliament the necessary
power to supplement its own legislation, I
supported the Government Bill that gave
that power. Now, what I did for the
province of Ontario I hope every honourable member of this House will do for the
province of Quebec and for the province
of British Columbia.
It bas been argued that it may not be
necessary to give power to the provinces
to prevent importation by individuals.
Let me say what bas been the policy of
the province of Quebec. It was stated
that the will of the people had not been
ascertained.
Speaking for Quebec province, I say the will of the people bas

been ascertained in this way. There was
a referendum for the purpose of ascertaining whether the people wanted absolute prohibition or wanted the sale of beer
and wine, and by a tremendous majority
the will of the people was asserted in
favour of the sale of beer and wine. The
Government of Quebec then decided to
abolish the bar, and to limit the number of licenses to some 25 in the province of Quebec-licenses to houses that
would be allowed to sell liquors to the retailer. But the Government found that
that was insufficient, as the province became a field for bootleggers for the United
States and for other provinces. It was
then that the Government decided that it
would go to the extent of taking hold of the
liquor trade, and of removing the interest
from all other parties. I remember perfectly well when in the city of Montreal. we
had as many as 600 licensed taverns. This
meant an army of 600 men who were interested in debauching their friends and as
many other people as they could, in order
to make a living by the distribution of
their goods. The Government decided to
do away with that, and authorized sale only
by a single Commission composed of parties
who had no interest at all at stake. While
there is a profit, it is only for the benefit of
the 'Government and the community at
large. It was said that this might be a
monopoly for a political party; but, speaking for the province of Quebec, I can affirma
without any fear of contradiction that boith
parties are agreed, the Opposition as well
as the party in power, that this is the
best law for the province, and it is supported by all parties there.
Now, how is the money applied? By
expending some $6,000,000 for good roads;
by subscribing for universities over $3,000,000 in one year; by distributing very large
amounts for education, for colonization, for
agriculture, for charity and hospitals, and
for various other public pur:poses. Only
the other day the local Government subscribed $150,000 for a sanitarium in the
city of Montreal; and that was the third
sanitarium which was subsidized or created
by the province of Quebec.
This power is necessary because, if
individuals are allowed to import, the province of Quebec will not be able to give
effect to the will of the people, and it will
create all kinds of disorder. If 'I am
allowed to import 25 or 50 cases, how will
the Government be able to follow the distribution of those 25 or 50 cases?
It will be done by hundreds or thousands

SENATE
of people in the province, and it will be the
source of ail kinds of disorder, and will reestablish the conditions to which I have
referred. Therefore I hope that honourable
gentlemen will ponder very seriously upon
this question. It is a question to which
we should attach the greatest importance.
We may be in favour of prohibition; we
al, I hope, are in favour of temperance;
but we are not agreed upon the best means
of promoting it. I think I may say without
fear of contradiction that I know a large
number of men in the province of Quebec
who have spent their lives in temperance
work who approve the legislation that has
been adopted by that province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Or do they

know that in Montreal-I cannot speak for
any other city-Judge Lafontaine and
Bishop Farthing, who have for twenty-five
years or more given a large amount of
their time to promoting temperance, approve of the law as passed by the Government.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Will my honourable friend allow me to ask
him a question? I want to get at what I
do not quite understand yet. The Government appoints a Commission which buys
and sells ail the liquor. That is the idea
first. That Commission sells to whom-to
licen-ed wholesalers?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
themselves through agents.

No, they sell
There are no

The Commission
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
desire, in order to be able to control the
quantity of liquor imported into the province, to be the only importer; and the
Commission appoint agents or employees
who are paid regular salaries: they have
no interest at aIl in the sales. So the Government controls not only the quantity that
is imported, but the quantity that is sold
and also the quality of the liquor. It is
sold only in a certain number of houses,
which are limited to the number required
to answer the demands that are made, and
no one can buy more than one bottle a day.
Of course, there are bars and restaurants
in which wine and beer can be sold.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Just on that point, may I ask about how
many retaliers there are in the province?
Hon. Mr. BEIOUE.

Hon. Mr. WILSON:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am sure we are
ail desirous of doing what is fair. I am
speaking for the province of Quebec, because I am aware of conditions there. I
do not attempt to speak for the province of
British Columbia; but I say advisedly and
without fear of contradiction that the Government of the province of Quebec is
desirous of promoting temperance. That
is their object and that has been their
object. The Prime Minister is as good a
temperance man as any man can be: but
the Government has to consult the opinion
and the wish of the people. It was felt that
if the Government tried to impose prohibition, the law would not be obeyed, because,
rightly or wrongly, public opinion was not
prepared for it, and it was thought that a
bad quality of spirits would be manufactured everywhere in the province. The
Government took the only means left at its
disposal, not for the object of making
money, but for the purpose of promoting
temperance.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is only within

What we have to decide, honourable gentleimen, is whetheir we in Vhis House shahl
lake the. resiponsi'bility of refusing wbat
the province of Québec dee.ms necessary to
give effect te, this legisl'ation in favour of

Will my bonHon. Mr,. BAR NARD:
ourable friend pardon me? The, leader of
the House told us yesterday that the province of Quebec is not asking for this'that it is solely a request from the Governnment of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. CAJSGRAIN: The province of
Québe~c is net asking for it because, baving
taken the bull by the horns, it is acting on
it. If the honourable 'gentleman goes to
31ontreal he can cable across to have 1,000
cases of Scotch whisky sent to, bîm. They
will be sent to Montreal, 'Where they will

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If my honourable
friend is correct, that nobody can import
except the Government, wbat do tbey want
this legislation for in tbe province of
Quebec?
This Commission
Honi. Mr. BEIQUE:
has to assert rights which I as a lawyer
de net think they posses-s. Il they ddd flot
assert tbem there would be leaks everywhere, and they would be unable to give
effect to the will of the people of the province, and it is my duty as a member of
this House to try to seoure for them the
powers which are necessary to, give effect

to the texnperance system *which bas been
adoptied.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Stri-pped of ail its
camouflage, witb wbich it has 'been pretty
well surrounded by the honourable gentleman who bas just taken bis seat, this legislation is asked for sirnply for the purpose
of creating in those two provinces what
might be called a Crown monopoly, and of
depriving tbe people of those provinces of
their natural right to import for tbemselves.
In what inHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ferior position would they be te th-at of
the 'bonourable gentleman 'living in Sussex,
New Bruns!wick, or in any municipality in
Ontario?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: If they are in no
worse or no different position, what do they
want this legislation for? Tbey only want
this legisîntion because in the province of
British Columbia and in the province of
Quebec the Governments desire a monopoly
of tbe sale of liquor.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Absolutely correct.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is the real
reason, the whole reason, and the sole
reason. Then, why not face the music?
Wby ail this talk about temperance? It
is to get some unwary temperance men to
vote for this. That is all it is done for, of
course, and the eulogy of the 'bonourable
gentleman from «Montreal (Hon. Mr.' Béique) on the subject of the riglit bonourable
the junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) was to get a good
temperance man like him to vote in favour
of it. To come down to solid, bard facts,
the situation is that the province of British
Columbia and the province of Québec want
te have a monopoly of the liquor business.
Hon.' Mr. CASGRAIN: That is true.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Wby? To make
more money. That is the reason. It is
not in tbe interest of temperance.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: It is in the interest
of increasing their revenues. Read tbe
speeches of the Finance Ministers at tbe
opening Sessions of tbe respective Houses.
They boast of the amount of money tbey
bave made.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: $9,000,000.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I am net opposed
to tbe legisiation of tbose provinces; I am

SENATE

528

not opposed to those provinces carrying on
the sale of liquor under Government inspection and control, but I am in favour of
the liberty of the subject to import for his
own use from any market in which he can
buy cheapest. That is the whole thing I
stand for. I am opposed to Crown monopolies.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Would the honourable gentleman be disposed to vote in
favour of giving the prohibitory power
to any province that desired to establish
prohibition?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No, I would not
be in favour of giving a Crown monopoly
to any province.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Would the honourable gentleman be in favour of giving the
necessary power for the application of
local option? If a municipality wanted to
prohibit the use of liquor, would the
honourable gentleman favour that?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I certainly would
not. I am not in favour of prohibition at
all, in any shape or form. I am in favour
of proper regulations-and I can speak
on this matter impartially, because I am
not a drinking man myself. I approve of
the Quebec Act, also the British Columbia
Act, but I stop at that. I say that the
individual who desires to import liquor
for his own use should not be deprived of
that right. The only reason why either
of these provinces desires to deprive him
of that right is because they wish te retain themselves all the profit there is in
the business. That is the whole thing,
and when honourable gentlemen attempt
to put it on the ground of the desire for
temperance among the people, I say it is
mere camouflage and not true at all.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman remember that it is absolutely necessary to have a monopoly? If
everybody is allowed to import liquor, what
is the Commission going to do? If I can
import all I want, would I buy from the
Commission at a higher price?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:

That is it exactly.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then I can ask
my neighbours to my house and they can
come in and drink as much as they like.
It is a good thing we are a sober people in
the province of Quebec; in other provinces,
where they are not as sober as we are,
what would happen?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: During the last
twelve months the consumption of liquor
Hon. Mr. FOWLER.

in the provinc of Quebec bas diminished
50 per cent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Here is what our
law bas accomplished.

In an article by the

Prime Minister of Quebec 'he quotes the
New York Evening World, which sent
Mr. Buchanan Fife to observe the situation.

Mr. Fife states in his paper that prohibition
hasAbalished the saloon;
Practically killed the business of bootlegging;
Redueed drunlkenness about 75 per cent;
Placed beer within reach of those who want
it by the glass;
Subrnitted to chernical analysis ail spiritu'us
liquor so that their purity might be guaranteed
to the purchaser;

I nay say that it is Dr. Milton Hersey,

of McGill University, who examines all the
liquor, and if any liquor is found defective
it is returned to those who sold it. When
tley took over the stock that was in the
province, all of it that was not exactly up
to standard was simply set aside and those
who hel.d it got no money for it.
Provided

violations of

The Commissioner acts very much like
the Czar of Russia used to act: imprisons
people first and tries them afterwards to

see whether they s.hould be in prison or not.
Created its own police department to enforce
the law.

The system is working very well indeed.
I had the privilege of saying in this House
the other day that a man cannot carry any
liquor across the street from his own house
without being arrested, and if he bas liquor
in an automobile, even if it is a beautiful
imousine costing thousands of dollars, it
may be stopped and he may be arrested.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: All that has nothing to do with depriving a person of his
natural right te import liquor for his own
use-not to give or sell it to his neighbour
or anybody else, but to import for his own
use. It comes down to this, that the sole
thing that these two provinces desire is a
Crown monopoly. That I am against every
time. In regard to my honourable friend's
statement of what may happen to a man
who violates the law, the honourable gentleman is, to use a common expression, talking
through his hat. Under the 1aw as it
stands a man has a right to apply to a
court, and that is a right which we are trying to take away by this legislation. The
Commissioner could not prevent a man from
exercising that right.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, he does.

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: He could not under
the law.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: He does by force.
I do not; know how it is done, whether by
law or not.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I had always understood that you people in Quebec were a lawabidingpeople, but you must be the most
lawless if your authorities act in defiance
cf the law. I 'cannot believe that to be true.
I thinc 'the honourable gentleman is misstating the facts.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I have been iistening
to some of my colleagues froni the province
of Quebec endeavouring to, convey to this
honourable body an idea of the position of
affairs, in that province.. I have neyer
listened to more extravagant language and
misrepresentation of facts than I have
heard on the floor of this House this afterroon with regard to the situation in the
province of Quebec. We neyer had any
bootlegging in Quehec, or any cause for
bootlegging, until we had that law. It is
useless to say that it has done away with
bootlegging. It has created bootlegging.
Now it is the duty of the Administration
to destroy if they can the evil they have
createl., It did not exist until it was
brought in under this legislation. As for
the removal of intoxication, there is no use
in telling that to me. My honourable friend
froin De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) may
]ve a secluded life. He may not mix with
I
the people as I do.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Honourable gentlemen thoroughly appreciate what I say. I
offer myself as-what do you caîl it?-as
exhibit No. 1, in regard to, that. I know
the habits of our people in the province
of Quebec. We in that province are not a
drunken outfit; but il you want to make
a popular appeal in the country constituencies of Quebec, you should go and ask
for the return of the old tavern, and you
will see many election changes in the constituencies in that province. It has been
stated to-day that there are 35 or 40
places where liquor may be legitimately
placed. That is ail rright. My home* is
sixteen miles froni Sherbrooke; it is 20
miles froni Scotstown; it is 50 miles ta
Lake Megantic; and so on. We are in a
prohibition county-in
a
Scott Act
county; therefore we cannot have any
dispensaries. We have to go to, the city of
Sherbrooke. I might have to go a long distance, even to obtain liquor for medicinal
S-34

52ý

purposes. And do you tell me that our
people in ail that district to which 1 have
just referred do not have drinks? Is there
a sane man who believes that the people
living there by the thousands have not a
thing to drink? Why, the idea is absolutely preposterous. Anybody with the
slightest regard for the reputation of the
province of Quebec would flot dare to
stand up in this House and make a statement of that kind. If he did, not only
would he be attempting to, mislead this
House and the country, but he would not
be doing justice to himself as an honourable member of this House in niaking such
a statement with regard to, Quebec.
Moreover, we have in our province
something that appears under that legislation. It is the home-brew business. We
have in the province of Quebec more illicit
stilîs than you, honourable gentlemen,
have of hairs on your head-or than you
had even before you shed any. Everywhere throughout the length and breadth
of that province there aire illicit stilis. I
mix with those people, and I taste the
stuif sometimes when I cannot; get anytbing else. I am talking by the f acts, and
I think it is the duty of honourable members of this House to talk by the facts,
for we do not have to lookc to the electorate to be returned to Parliament. The
people of Canada expect honourable gentlemen who speak in this House to speak
by the facts, and to speak fearlessly of
conditions as they exist.
As to the effort of the Government of
the province of Quebec, I do not desire
to speak disparagingly, but as to the
statenient that that effort up to date has
been a success, I must say that I regret
exceedingly that such is not the case.
Quite true, I neyer voted for prohibitiion.
I did not vote for it in the county which
I represent, which is a prohibition county.
I did flot when the Scott Act was put
into force, and why? Because I have lived
ail my life near the international boundairy
line £romi Maine to, New York and have
travelled across that line thousands of
tinies into prohibition States, and I have
neyer found a state that could prohibit. Everyone of theni had their
places where yo-u could go and get
What you wanted. And they have been
trying out prohibition for fifty years.
What. do you do with prohibition? You
increase the use of drugs. The drug habit
in' Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont
has been intensified by the hypocritical
efforts put forward there for prohibition,

REVISED EDITION

and I fear the introduction of the drug
system into the province to which I belong. In those counties of the Eastern
Townships that have made their effort at
so-called prohibition-I do not care to
name them, but you can find them out by
looking at the statutes-if you go amongst
the people, you will find that the drug
habit is increasing just as it is across in
Vermont, New Hampshire, etc. Under
these circumstances I can never see my
way clear to vote for prohibition. I never
saw a law that could prohibit. You cannot make people good by legislation. You
must exercise moral suasion; you must
have recourse to intensified education; the
example must be provided at home. Home
life has been destroyed in many parts of
our country. It has been broken up by
those efforts to make young people so much
better than the old people were when they
were young.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, if I may be permitted, I want to resume the matter of business that I introduced ialf an hour ago.
I was not
joking when I suggested to the honourable gentleman who leads the House that
the effect of this Bill, giving a monopoly
to two provinces to import liquor, may
be the gift to them of a very substantial
portion of the revenue of Canada. I do
think that before we go on with this
measure we should have a distinct understanding with those two Governments that
if they are to get this monopoly they must
pay the duty on the liquor just the same
as private importers would. As I said
when I was up before, this matter has been
challenged by the Government of British
Columbia in a suit in the Exchequer Court.
That suit, while it bas passed through the
Exchequer Court, is not yet determined,
because an appeal is pending. That, of
course, is a matter of common knowledge
to every member of the Government and
is known to the Government of the Province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow me to ask him a question? In what respect will this legislation affect the right of the province of
British Columbia, or the right of the province of Quebec, in the matter?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: If the honourable
gentleman had permitted me to proceed
I was about to
show
what
this
bas to do with the question. I was at
the point when the honourable gentleman
Hon. Mr. POPE.

rose. The effect is this. When a province
comes to this Government for a very valuable consideration, that is an opportune
time for the Government to make terms
with it. We have already heard that the
province of Quebec now has a monopoly
of import-that under the law, as she asserts it, none but herself can import. Then
the question naturally arises, what has
Quebec to get out of this legislation, which
Quebec did not ask for, as we are told,
but seemingly very gladly accepts? If
she is to get freedom from Customs duty
on all the imports of liquor, that is a most
valuable consideration.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
gentleman will allow me to say that in
Quebec it is not the Government that is
importing: it is a Commission. Therefore,
that would not apply at all.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is the Government just the same.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I would not like
to express an opinion on law against the
honourable gentleman, but I would say this,
that the condition in British Columbia is
precisely the same. It is a Commission
that is importing there; yet the Attorney
General of the province of British Columbia thought it worth while in the Exchequer
Court to declare that his Commission was
entitled to import liquor without any payment of duty. It seems to me only a
businesslike precaution to take, to say to
these governments: "If we give you this
valuable monopoly and secure it by legislation, you must on your part undertake to
waive any claim which you think you may
have to bring this in free of duty." As I
see it, we would be most closely questioned
by our constituents if we were to go back
after the close of this session and tell
them that we had put a stiff excise tax
on every cup of chocolate and on every
stick of candy that anyone bought in Canada, and that at the same session we have
absolved the two greatest importers of
liquors in Canada from the necessity of
paying any Customs duties.
I may say at this point that the Finance
Minister has recognized the question that
may be raised by those Governments, and
has provided for it in legislation now before
Parliament in connection with the Sales
Tax. He bas taken the precaution to put in
his statute the express provision that the
Sales Tax is payable on the very liquor
which we are discussing this afternoon. If
it is worth while for the Finance Minister to

JUNE 22, 1922
take that precaution with respect to the
Sales Tax, surely it is worth while for
Parliament to take a similar precaution in
respect to the larger question of Customs
duties.
Before I sit down I wish to say that, s0
far as British Columbia is concerned, this
is not a matter of prohibition at all.
British Columbia has not voted for prohibition and is not asking for it. So far
as the province of British Columbia is concerned, it is a matter of revenue onlyhow many dollars' profit the Government
of British Columbia can get out of the
sale of liquor, which the people of British
Columbia desire them to seIl. So there is
no prohibition sentiment in this. With us
it is not a question as to the morality or
immorality of selling liquor; it is simply a
matter of business regulation for any
authority that we give to that province
or any other province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have followed
my honourable friend very dlosely to hear
an answer to the question which I put
to hlma. I asked him Vhs question: in
what respect will the rights of the province of British Columbia or the rights
of the province of Quebec be -affected by
anything we m*ay do here by this legisiation? Whether the provinces are or are not
obliged to pay customs duties on liquors
imported by them is a matter which depends entirely and exclusively on the constitution as it exists to-day-I mean the
Confederation Act? My honourable friend
wîll admit that we cannot amend the
British North America Act. Being an
Imperial Act it can be amended only by
the Imperial Parhiament. That being the
case, no niatter what we do to-day, the
right of the province, whi.ch is now before
the courts, cannot possibly be affected.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
cannot niy honourable friend appreciate the
distinction between the province bringing in
an article which it dlaimis is duty free and
the individual bringing in such an article?
The individual would have te pay duty,
and by this Regisiation you ask us to prevent the individual froni bringing it in,
thus throwing thle whole importation into
the hands of the province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not at
ail the point I was discussing.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: In answer to the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Belcourt),
my suggestion is that we should take this
S-84à

opportunity of securing ourselves by saying to -those two provinces: "We will not
give you th.is business concession unless you
concede our right to coilect duty, which we
think we have anyhow, but which you may
successfuily dispute; we will flot make the
concession unless you admit your obligation to pay duty."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Undess I misunderstood the honourable gentleman, bie
based his argument largely on the ground
that what we are doing to-day would prejudice Briti8h Columbia in the exercise of
its rights, which are now being considered
b1y the courts.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
the honourable gentleman will deny that.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I did not attempt tu.
say that at ail.
Hon. Mr. ýGIRROIR: The point that 1
wish to raise and discuss, in the hope that
I may obtain some information wiîth regard
to it, is this. So far as the discussion has
gone, the Hou-se believes that this Bill, the
first part of it relating to the exportation
of liquors, and the second part to the importation of liquors, will apply only to the
provinces of Quebec and British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are general provisions.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: What struck me ail
through the discussion was that no other
.provinces were mentioned. It appeared to
bie the opinion of everybody that it was
for only a couple of provinces that this
legisiation had been passed. Honourable
gentlemen must surely forget that besides
the province of Quebec there are other
provinces in the Dominion that are doing
a liquor business.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: There is no province mentioned in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: No, that is what 1
am trying to make out. But the argument
ail through, was that these provinces were
seeking to get special privileges by virtue
of this legisiation.
There is in the Province of Ontario a
Government which is selling liquor through
ibs vendors. It is true that the regulations
respecting the sale of intexicating liquors
are somewhat different in the province of
Ontario froni those in the province of
Nevertheless it cannot be conQuebec.

oni

SENATE

tradicted that the province of Ontario is
selling liquor, or has appointed vendors to
sell it. In order to obtain liquor in the
province of Ontario, all you have to do is
to go to a doctor and get your prescription,
and you will obtain all the liquor you want.
You have to pay for it in Ontario, just as
you pay for it in Quebec, but you can get it
if you can get your prescription; and I do
not think it is very difficult in the good
old province of Ontario to convince your
doctor that sometimes you need a little
stimulant.
In the province of New Brunswick practically the same law obtains. The Government of New Brunswick is selling liquor
and pocketing the profits. It has its vendors. The doctors make out the prescriptions, and the man who wants a drink gets
it just as he does in Quebec.
In the province of Nova Scotia, the province from which I come, the municipalities
are doing a rushing liquor business. I
have before me the Act relating to the sale
of liquor in the province of Nova Scotia.
It says:
In any municipality in which Part I of this
Act is in force, the council for such municipality
may appoint one or more suitable persons, to
be called vendons, who shall keep and sell such
liquors, other than ethyl alcohol, as are required
for medicinal, sacramental,
mechanical
or
manufacturing purposes.

So that in a different way there are
other provinces besides those which have
Leen m ntioned in the debate that engage
ii the liquor traffic. As I pointed out, the
only difference is the manner in which
zhey retail their liquor. The provinces of
Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
do not want anybody to import liquor into
those provinces except their Governments
antd municipalities; and the way they prevent the individual from importing is that
they take the liquor away from the man
who im-ports, and impose a very heavy fine.
Therefor it seems to me that it is far
better to have legislation enalbling those
provinces to prevent liquor from coming
into them than to take the chance of getting it away from the man who bas imported it. It seems to me that this is sane
egislation for you are not only helping
the province of Quebec but every other
province in the Dominion to carry out the
law which it has in force. The municipalities of Nova Scotia are importing
liquor, and they are selling it broadcast. I
say advisedly, broadcast, because any
physician can give a prescription; and in
order to maintain their monoply, as in Ontario, their statute says than any person
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR.

found in possession of liquor without a
vendor's stamp on it is punished, and the
liquor is taken away from him.
Now,
surely any reasonable man will say that
the proper way to preserve that monoply,
if you like to call it that, which the province of Ontario wants for the sale of
liquor, and other provinces want and are
striving to maintain, is to prevent individuals from importing liquor into those provinces-not by taking liquor from then
after they have imported it, and after they
have broken the law.
If I wanted good
whisky, I would send to Scotland for a case;
but when I would go to the Custom bouse to
get the liquor, if it had not the vendor's
stamp it would be taken away from me.
I think that is a very foolish law. The
proper way would be not to allow a man
to import it at all.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I want to correct
an impression which I think the leader of
the House erroneously made. In the course
of his reniarks he inferred that the people
of the province of Quebec and of the province of British Columbia wanted this
legislation. He told us yesterday in explicit
terms-and bas not said anything to the
contrary to-day-that the province of Quebec had not asked for this legislation, and i
presume that that statement stands and is
correct-that is to say, that they have
sufficient safeguards under their provincial
statute, and they do not need any further
legislation from this Parliament.
So far as British Columbia is concerned,
I am of opinion that the people of that
province do not want this legislation. It
is true that a member of the Government
of British Columbia bas come down here
and asked the Federal Government to
strenghten his hands in the making of
money out of this particular business by
passing this legislation, but the whole history of the legislation leading up to the
present local situation out there shows that
the people of British Columbia do not and
never did intend or wish to give up their
right to private importation. In the old
Prohibition Act, which was repealed when
the present Liquor Control Act was brought
into operation, there was an express clause
stating in the most explicit terms that
nothing in the Act should prevent the right
of importation by the individual for his
own use in his own home. Subsequently a
referendum was taken, and the only question
put to the public upon which to vote was:
"Are you in favour of the present Prohibition Act, or the sale by the Government in
sealed packages?" It was on that question

JUNE 22, 1922
that the people voted, and upon the vote
being taken the legisiature of British
Columbia passed the Act which is at present in force, called the Liquor Control Act.
In passing that Act they anticipated and
contemplated that there stili would be
private importation, because under section
55 they provided that if anybody does import he shall do so and pay a tax. So that
the only way you can say the people of
British Columbia have spoken is through
the legislature. What xnay be the individual opinion of certain members of the
Government out there le another thing alto-gether. Therefore I say that this argument
has to, some extent proceeded on a wrong
assumption, because as a matter of fact I
believe when the vote is taken on this
amendment most of the members of this
House from the province of British Columbia will be totally against this prohibition.
If that is the case, and if the people
of the province of Quebec do flot want this
legisiation, and.we are the only two provinces which are affected by it, then I eay
there is no object in passing it, and the
legisiation should not pass. My honourable
friend fro'm Nova Scotia who has just
spoken <Hon. Mr. Girroir) seems to think
that ail the province are on the same footing with regard to this proposed Act, but
that is not so. You already have the prohibition of importation under Part III of
the Doherty Act into provinces which have
prohibition. This legisiation is designed to
apply only to provinces which have a system of Government control and sale of
liquor for beverage purposes, and it is possible that those words ought to be inserted in
the clause if it is going through, in order
to make that definition clear. For these
reasons I arn strongly of the opinion that
this legislation should flot pass.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to say a
f ew words as to how this legisiation might
interfere with the province of Ontario. I
want to submit this question for consideration by the legal gentlemen of this House.
It has struck me that perhaps this Act, if
passed, might affect the revenues of the
Dominion so far as the province of Ontario
and other provinces are concerned. That
struck nie after hearing the statement of
the honourable menmber for New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor), that our present tariff legislation imposes a duty on
ahl liquors imported into this country,
whether by private individuals or by the

Governnient.
passed a law prohibiting it from coming in,
and that law does not interfere with the

Dominion Act. Now we are putting on the
statute another special act which says:
-intoxicating liquor which has béen purchased

by or on behalf of, and which Is consîgned to
Hia Majesty or the Executive Government of
the Province Into 'whtch It Is belng imported,
sent, taken or transported; or any Board, Commission., officer of other Governmental agency
which, by the lWçs of the province, la vested
with the right of seiling Intoxicatlng liquors.

Now, I' understand that this Act. is intended to prohlbit the transportation of
-liquor from one province to another; but it
struck me that there might be an interpretation put on that, to, the effect that the
Parliament of Canada had by this special
Act consented that the provinces or local

governments or commissions under theim,
would have the right to import. If this
could be in any way interpreted like that
or a case going to the Privy Council, or if
at any future time there might be a question of law in it, I would ask whetber it
would not be advisable to provide that if
they did import liquor, it should be subject
tc, payment of durties in accordance with
the general tariff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wili draw
the attention of the Department of Justice
to the point raised hby the honourable gentlleman from New Westminster and discussed
by the honourable ex-'Minister of Railways.
We may vote upon this amendment of my
hionourable friend from Victoria, and if that
part of the Bill is maintained, the right to
prohibit, we will adjourn further consideration of the Bill, so that I may be able to
consuit with the Department of Justice.
In answer to the statement of iy honourable friend from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) that his province does not clearly
express a wish in favour of this legisîntion,
I may say that it is somewhat diff6cult; for
this Parhiament; to go beyond the desires of
the legisiature and the executive. Now, I
have in my hand a telegrarn from the Attc.rney General of British Columbia which
expresses a desire tbiat this Bill be passed.
It says:
This Province needs the Passage of the Bill
to attain a sembiance of clean administration of
the liquor law. We are flot Interested In the
money end of the business except as a necessary incidentai. Wili treat êxpo--t houses fairiy. In the event of Bill passing, monopoiy will
not be used to Increase prices; on contrary, we
are now reducing prices downward, and doing
our utmost to that end.

This is signed "A. M. Manson."

Barnard was negatived.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It bas been suggested to me that an amendment should

brewers and distillers duly licensed by the
Dominion Government.
An amendment
was handed to me, but upon consideration I have come to the conclusion that it
is not properly worded, and would suggest that the proviso stand.
The proviso to paragraph c of subsection 2 of new section 163, section 3, stands.
Subsections 3 and 4 of new section 163
of section 3 was agreed to.
On subsection 5 of new section 163 of
section 3-Governor in Council may issue

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I submit that
my amendment would fit in here perfectly
and would be germane. There would be
another proclamation saying that the province bad local option.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It has.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is to prohibit the manufacture. I thought I made
myself clear enough before. I move now
my amendment as paragraph a:
(a) That upon receipt by the Secretary of
State of a duly certified copy an order of the
Lieutenant Governor in Council of any province praying that local option be granted to
the province to prohibit the manufacture of intoxicating liquors in the province, the Governor
in Couneil may, by prodlamation publ-ished in
the Canada Gazette, declare that quch province
is granted local provincial option to prohibit
the manufacture of intox'icating liquors in that
province.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I call attention to
the marginal note of section 157, which
states:
Upon receipt of order of Lieutenant Governor
in Council, the Governor in Council may issue
proclamation.
Then, section

158:

Upon such prohibitoin coming into force no
person other than a brewer or distiller shall,
be licensed by the Government of Canada for
the manufacture of spirituous fermented or
other liquors shall keep or have 'n his possession or control intoxicating liquors for sale in
or exportation of such province, noî shall any
such person export intoxicating liquors out of
such province.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That bas nothing
to do with my amendment at all. I say
they should not be allowed to manufacture.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not see what
the amendment of the honourable gentleman would lead to.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the honour.
able gentleman will lend me his ear foi

enough.
We want to destroy the evil
effects of alcohol. To destroy the effectget rid of the cause. The cause is the
manufacture. If the province of Ontario,
for instance, does not want the manufacture carried on within the province, with
this on the statute book the Prime Minister can send down here an Order in
Council asking this Government to issue
a proclamation granting them the right to
suppress the manufacture of liquor in the
province.
I think that is plain enough.
There are none so deaf as those who will
not hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The result
would be that distilling would be prohibited
in the country, but importation would not.
It seems to me that we cannot touch one
without touching the other. So long as we
maintain the principle that each province
is to be the judge of its own legislation, the

JUNE 22, 1922
situation as to the distilling or importation
should remain as it is.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is no
allusion to importation; it is just the manufacture. If the province does not desire
to have manufacturing, surely if we respect provincial autonofmy we will give it
that right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Upon hearing
the amendment read, I was inclined to look
upon it with more or less a want of
seriousness; but when I read it, it does not
appear to me to be so inconsistent. I
think it is worthy of consideration. This
is merely along.the lines, I take it, of the
policy which we have adopted of giving the
provinces the right to determine just
what sort of thing they are going to have.
This merely provides, as I take it, that if
the people of any province should declare
that they want local option, and that they
do not want it interfered with by reason
of the Dominion Government issuing a
license to a brewer or distiller within that
province, a license to manufacture in the
province will not be granted. Upon serious
reflection, it does not seem to be inconsistent, to me at all events, with the manner
in which we have been dealing with this
subject.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Why not include
importation?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Miake one for
yourself.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It has been dealt
with by the other provisions of the Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Can this Parliament
decide to prevent the manufacture in a
province? It is not within the powers of
this Parliament at all.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is within the
power of this Parliament to decree that the
Government shall not issue a license.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But what I am calling attention to is the question of whether
it is within the power of any province
to decide that manufacturing shall be
prohibited.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no. They get
a license from the Dominion Government to
manufacture.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Is it not in the
power of the province to prohibit the
manufacture?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, sir, not
according to the advice I got to-day from
one of the good lawyers in Toronto.

535

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: So long as the province has not prohibited the manufacture,
the Dominion may license the brewers; but

prevent the manufacture.

is not germane; but, assuming that it were,
that would not interfere with the Dominion
Government issuing licenses under the
authority of the Act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I would like to
find out whether a distiller can manufacture
liquor of any kind without a Feideral,
license.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is not that the
answer? If the Federal Government bas
in its hands the power to prevent the
manufacture of spirits by refusing to
issue a license, it seems to me quite clear
that the right to prohibit the manufacture
is in the hands of the Federal Government. LIike my honourable friend, I am
not prepared to say that the amendment
suggested is very much out of the way.
If a province wants to prevent importation, it is to prevent the sale. If manufacturing is continued in a province and
the boundaries are closed, it seems to me
that that is not the very best means of
getting a dry territory. The liquer is
prevented from coming through the doors,
but it is manufactured in the kitchen.
The people get home brew; they do not
get the foreign liquors, which they might
prefer, and which might be more palatable;
I really

do not know, being absolutely opposed
to prohibition, whether the best method
is not to allow the people who really want
bone-dry prohibition to get it. If they
want to try it on themselves I think it
only fair to give them all the means,
complete and perfect, to make their territory absolutely bone-dry; and if you give
them the right to prevent importation, I
do not see that you can logically refuse
them the right to prevent the manufacture.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Casgrain was negatived: yeas, 14; nays,

New section 164 of section 3 was agreed

SENATE

On the preamble:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to suggest a clause which would be section 4 of
the Bill, and which would read as follows:
The provisions of sections 157. 158 and 163
shall no-t apply to any sale, pur base, delivery
or transport into, through, or out of a province
of any intoxicating liquor authorised by or
under any provincial law, order or regulation.

Honourable gentlemen will remember
that, when we were discussing subsection
b of section 158, I proposed something
very much of the same nature. The object of the clause is to protect the physician, the chemist, the veterinary surgeon,
and the manufacturer, who has obtained
from the provincial authority the right
to purchase and have delivered to him intoxicating liquors, either for medical, sacramental, or manufacturing purposes.
There are permits of that kind issued, and
unless we have a provision of this kind
that would be prohibited.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Probably that had better go with the
others for thinking over. I should like to
see about how far it goes.

cil to advance the sum of $1,500,000 to the
Quebec Harbour Commission to enable it
to carry on the construction of such terminal facilities as may be necessary to equip
properly the port of Quebec. The Bill is
in accord with the form of Act that for a
number of years we have tbeen passing to
cover such cases. The Financing of the
Harbour Commissions
bas been done
through the Government, which bas taken
the debentures of these corporations and
has advanced out of the public treasury
the amounts of which they have been in
need, under Acts of Parliament. I have
Jooked at this Bill, and at the one which
follows, concerning the Port of Montreal,
and I find, them to have been drafted in the
same manner as all Acts for a similar purpose.
Hon. Sir. JAMES LOUGHEED: Can
my 'honourable friend give the House any
information as to whether the interest bas
been paid upon the $8,000,000 of debentures referred to in clause 8 of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, I can
inform my honourable friend. The interest
on those debentures has not been paid. In
fact, debentures which the Government of
Canada has received from many ports,
with the exception of the port of Montreai,
have been in a similar position; the interest has not been paid. I asked the
Minister of Marine to furnish me with a
-tatement covering those advances by the
Government of Canada to all the ports, because I expected that such a question would
he put to me. If my honourable friend
needa the answer before we vote the second
reading, I will postpone the motion for the
second reading, because I should have had
that information at hand.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest that we suspend the study of the
Bill, and that the Committee rise and report progress and ask leave to sit again,
so that we may have an oportunity of
examining the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend wiIl see that the proposed amendment does not authorize anything that the
provincial law will not authorize. Nothing
would be perimissible that is not permissible under the provincial law.

Hon, Mr. BEAUBIEN.

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I wanted to
have the record before me. I will have it
to-.morrow. I know Vbaît information has
been furnished the Government as to the
needs of the port, but I amn not ready ta
speak at this mioment regarding the details
of those 'needs. I will ask tha't the motion
for the secoiid reading of this Bill be postponed until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend, whilst he is securing the information requested by the honourable
gentleman from Calgary (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed), at the same time ascertain, if
the memorandum. does not contain the informnation, whether this amount of $1,500,00OG
to be advanced is for new work, or in payment of work already done, and for which
debentures may have been [issued? In
ather words, would that $1,500,000 be applied to doing something more at the port
of Quebec, or would it be applied simply to
paying for some of those bonds that have
been issued?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My information is that it is for new work.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Perhaps we
might be informed definitely.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think the
Department has prepared a detailed statement of the iniprovements which it is desired to carry out by means of this vote.
I will have that detailed. statement.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Aiso; 'will my honourable friend add what
is the estimate or anticipation of business
and revenues which would probably make
such an added expenditure remunerative?
I bave -no objection to the putting of money
into large ports like that, to equip tbem if
there is any reasonable expectatian that the
investment will end in gathering business
to that port to make it remunerative, but
the expenditure nlay not be advisable if it il
only increasing the debt to the Dominion,
and if no payment has been made of interest due in the past, and if there may be
no increased revenues in the future, to
make the harbour self-supporting, and
there is also the dificulty of competition
with the port of Montreal. We ought to
have reasonable assurance that the money
will be economically profitable.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: When the hon-.
ourable leader of the House is bringing
down that information, would he specify
what proportion of this $1,500,000 it is intended to spend on new work and what

amount on repairs to work already completed? My understanding is that a considerable portion of the money -is to be
expended -on repairs to the harbour. Voting money for new work, if it il necessary
and advisable, is ail right, but if I arn
rightly informed, the Harbour Commissioners ought to be able, out of the receipts
of the harbour, to look after any repairs
that are necessary ta piers, and wharves,
or general repairs. I shaîl be glad if my
honourable friend wiil bring down that information.
1 have no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
official data before me, but it seems that
latterly the port of Quebec bas shown far
greater activity than in the past. A committee of the Senate was appointed during
the Session to consider the possibility of
developing trade at the port of Quebec.
The Transcontinental ends there, and I amn
in hopes that, independently of what may
be proposed under this Act, the port of
Quebec will before long came into its own;
that trade will flow directly to it £rom the

of Montreal will soon be overcrowded, and
it seems ta me that before long trade might
find its way a hlittle below Montreal and
strike Three Rivers and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Would the Minister also get information as to bow the
obtained-wbetber by side
revenue -is
wharfage, or top wharfage, or botb? I
tbink that in Montreal tbe wbole revenue
il obtained from top wharfage. I tbink
tbat tbey charge no side wharfage at ail.
The Minister might ascertain and let us
know about tbat, and the amount of
revenue obtaîned.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I will.
Could the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Minister tell us ta what extent present
facilities at Quebec are utilized? Are there
not to-day mucb greater facilities than
bave yet been made use of?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There seem ta
be considerable facilities at the present
time, but I do not know what this intended
expenditure will caver. I hope to be in a
position ta answer my hanaurable friend
to-morrow.
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is it not true
that the existing facilities have neyer been
operated ta their capacity since they were
constructed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would not
like ta answer at the moment. I have an

SENATE
impression, but I would rather withhold
any statement.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
a very safe position to take.
The motion for the second reading of
the Bill was withdrawn, and placed on the
Order Paper for to-morrow.
FERTILIZERS BILL.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE moved the second
reading of Bill 149, an Act to regulate the
sale of agricultural fertillizers.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill is the outcome of the work of the
Committee of the House of Commons on
Agriculture and the result of con.ultation
with the manufacturers of fertilizers and
users of fertilizers, represented by the leading agricultural associations. From the
reading that I have been able to make of
the Bill, it appears to have been well considered. When we take it up section by
section we shall be able, if desired, to give
the reasons for each clause.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Béique, the Senate
went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Proudfoot in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-definitions:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Technical words or
terms that appear in the text of the Bill are
here defined. The definitions were for the
most part made by the technical officers of
the Department, and concurred in at a
joint conference composed of three representatives of fertilizer manufacturers,
three of fertilizer users, and three agricultural chemists; and, finally, the definitions have been approved by Mr. Gisborne,
Parliamentary Counsel. This applies also
to most of the Bill. The whole Bill has
been considered by those different bodies
and approved.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-registration of brand; application for registration; fees:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is there the registration fee paid every year or only once?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
It is the fees for renewal.
Hon

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There are fees for
renewal, and there are fees paid on the
registration.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
The fees for renewal are the same as the
original.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 to 8, inclusive, were agreed
to.
On section 9-powers of Minister.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It will be noticed
there thatThe Minister shall have power,to appoint an advisory board which may at
his request prepare and recommend to him such
regulations as it is of opinion should be established under this Act;

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Does this advisory board carry any salary?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, only the travelling expenses.
The board is composed of
three representatives from each of the
different bodies mentioned.
Sections 9 and 10 were agreed to.
On section 11-inspectors:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: These clauses are
practically the same as in the old Act.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
With reference to inspectors, what about
their payment? Are they paid out of fees?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, they are paid
out of fees fixed by the regulation.
Sections 11 to 16, both included were
agreed to.
On section 17-appointments:
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
There will have to be some clause here
to bring these appointments under the
Civil Service Act, such as was introduced
in yesterday's discussion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The objection
taken yesterday was to the fact that the
Minister would do so, but here there is no
power taken by anyone, so that the general
law applies.
Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20 were agreed
to.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would like to revert to section 15. I move that the word
"fertilizer " in the fourth line be replaced
by the word "package." I drew the attention of the officers of the Department to
this, and they approved of the change.

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It
seems to me unreasonable that a man
should be prosecuted if he retains a package unopened, as he has no knowledge of
the contents. If he is an innocent holder
of those packages, he should not be prosecuted until he has guilty knowledge of the
character of the fertilizer. He might possibly put in a stock that would carry him
through several years. Because he warehouses them without a knowledge of the
contents, why should he be liable for
prosecution?
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Why should not
the seller of bulk fertilizer have the same
protection as is afforded to the seller of
package fertilizer?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I 'have this memorandum on section 14:
This Includes the same principie se was pro-vided in the Seed Control Act of 1911 and
the Feeding SBtuifs Act of 1920. In admlniaterlng
these laws it la occasionally found that the retail seller is under the financial control or
domination of the manufacturer or wholeêale
seller, and ls disposed to act In collusion. It la
usually found that the retail seller ia In part
blaxns.ble. Where the retail seller la willlng to
disclose the na.ine of the person from whomn he
purchased in good faith he la lnvarisably given
the privilege, In ooinpany with the Inspector,
of calling upon the local maglstrate and under
oath making the statement as prescribed ini titis
clause, which statenient la necessary to the
Inispector In order that he may proceed agalnst
the manufacturer or Importer.

It will be seen that the clause has been
fully considered, and as it is dealing with
a technical matter we do flot interfere.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Under section 15
we find that an innocent purchaser who
in good faith holds package fertilizer in
his possession for sale, without knowing
the contents, is protected. Why is there
a special clause for hlm, and not for the
man who buys hulk fertilizer in good
faith?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: He would be protected by having his recourse at law against
the manufacturer, who m.ight lose his license.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: According to the
provisions in section 4 the purchaser in
good faith of bulk fertilizer is in a very
different position f rom the purchaser and
seller of the package, and I do not see why
there should be any difference.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I will not ask for
the thîrd reading of the Bill, but I wifl
cal] the attention of the Department to
that.

Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I do not think
the aniendment proposed by Hon. Mr.
Béique is necessary, because, although not
very apt language is used, it is an ex ression that would be employed by the man on
the street, and when it -says in line 18 that
" it was neither opened nor the state of the
fertilizer altered while it was in his possession," it would mean that the package
had not been opened and examined.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I suggest that we
leave that.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I would like to ask if
sections 3, 4 and 5 apply to every individual
who buys fertilizer and redistributes it?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have this note:
The Fertilisers Act, 1909, provlded for the
registration of each brand of fertilizer and also
the licensing of each brand of fertilizer by the
manufacturer. Tlue fee for the former was3 two
dollars and for the latter elght, sixteen and
twenty-four dollars, according as it contained
one. two or three of the foliowing substances,
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potaeh. Ia this
buSf an enideavor ls made to siinplify the systemn of control by adoptin.g the plan that la in
the Feeding Stuifs
vogue underthe fertilizer laws of Act, and la now
mfflt states and
comnmon to
countries, so that jnstead of having the dual
systeni as heretofore we will have each brand
under full control by the process of registration
aloune. It la belleved that this more simple systemn wlll reduce the cost of administration.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: In New Brunswick
fertilizer is very largely used; the phosphates and various ingredients are bought
by carload and distributed by the fartmers
themselves to other farmers

in the com-

munity. Does the provision for fees apply
The farmers are reailIy

manufacturer&, because they buy the nitrogen and other ingredients and mix them.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: When a farmer buys
the different ingredients and mixes them he

would not *be called on to psy any fees.
Only the manufacturer would be so called
on.

Hon. Mr. BETjCOURT: And the manufacturer only pays a fee for the registra-

tion of bis brand, not for selling.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move that the
Committee rise and report progress.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before the motion is carried may I delay the House for
two minutes? I want to express my congratulations to the Government upon having brought down this mensure, which is one
that I look upon as being of very great importancêý to Canada. For many years I
have thought that the question of selling

540

SENATE

and distributing and encouraging the use of
fertilizers was of great interest to, this
country. There are many parts of Canada
where fertile tracts of land have been cultivated for perhaps two centuries or more,
and which have neyer seen any real fertilizer. Some of those lands are stili productive, but the time has corne when we
must adopt European methods and use
fertilizers in larger quantities than we have
done in the past. We must follow the example of France and England, and encourage our people to use fertilizers in a large
way. I hope this measure will be followed
by others of a similar nature. I hope in
tnie to see Canada encouraging, by means
of large grants, the manufacture and distribution of fertilizers throughiout the country. We have in our water-powers great
facilities for manufacturing artificial fertilizers more cheaply than anyone else in
the world, and the Government ought to
try to induce people to corne here to manufacture theni, so that we can get thern
much cheaper than we are getting theni
at present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my hon-ourable friend any data as to the extent to
auhich they are used?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, but I know
that they are used to a much greater extent
in En-gland, France, and the United States
than in Canada. In the southern States of

the American Union fertilizers are manufactured and used in large quanities. I
do not know that this is so, in the northern

part of the Union; 1 do not think that in
the New England States, for instance, they

are used to a very large degree. But, as I
have said, I think this is one of the thingsthe Government ought to consider very seriouqly, for the reason that agriculture is our
n'ost important industry, and because the

products of the fanm are the things that we
must look tu tu help us out of the frightful
financial situation in which we find ourselves to-day.

The motion of Hon. Mr. Béique was
agreed to, and progress was reported.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'c]ock.

The Bill was dropped.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
FURTHEH CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 93, an Act to amend the Criniinal

Code.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Farrell in the Chair.

On the proposed section 15:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This

is

a

new clause. I will read the section as it
stands in the statutes so that honourable
gentlemen may understand what we are
amýending. The section in the Act reads

as follows:
AL common betting house is a house, office.
roomn or other place(b) opened, keýpt or used for the purpose of
any money or valuable thing being received by
or on behailf of any such person as aforesaid, as
or for the ronsideration,
(i) for any assurance or undertaking, express
or implied, to pay or give thereafter any money
or valuable thing on any eveot or contingency
of or relating to any horse, race or other rare,
fight, gamne or sport, or-

It is proposed to amend this by striking
out the words "as or for the consideration"~
and by repealing sub-paragraph i thereof
and substituting therefor the following:
(1) all or any part of which money or valuable thing or its equivalent is to be paid or
given to any other person on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse rare or
other race, fight, gamne or sport; or
Hon. Mn. PARDEE:
amendnient?

Then, what is the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I miay say that
it is quite technical. The honounable gentleman froni Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) was in consultation to-day with
the Law Clerk of the House, with the Panliamentary Counsel, and with a brilliant
memben of the legal fnaternity in the
House of Commons, and, after examining the
text and looking for a bettenment, they came
to the conclusion, in view of the decision
of the police magistrate in Winnipeg, that
this would cover the case which it is intended to rover. I think that the honourable gentleman from Sussex (Hon. Mr.
Fowler) and the honourable gentleman
fron Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staun,ton) have devised another amendment to
effort more sunely the purpose of the
amendment. So 1 will content myseîf with
moving this one, and will agree to the

JUNE 22, 192251
honourable gentleman fromn Sussex moving his amendment afterwards.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I suggest to the
leader of the Government that he strike
out the words "horse race or other" in the
second last line.
The amendment auggested by my honourable friend reads:
(0) any homse race or other race, flght, game
or sport ; or...

I would ask honourable gen-tlemen to
follow me closely. The objection in that
is the objection to the words " horse-race
or other." Horse racing and betting on
horse racing have been the subject of
specîfic legisiation. In 1910, as honourable gentlemen will probably remember,
there was in the House of Gommons a
very long discussion on what was then
called the Miller Bill. The Statutes of
1910 contain special and very de:finite provisions, under this section and section 235,
with. regard to betting on 'horse racing. In
1912 there were some amendments to that
special legisiation, which honourable gentlemen will find in chapter 19 of the
Statutes of that year. I need flot trouble
honourable members with all the details.
The last time the matter came up wa$ in
1920, two years ago, when Parliament
adopted, in addition to the safeguards and
requirements
of those provisions,
a
schedule.
The amounts collectable at
races was determîned by schedule entitling
people running races to a percentage of 7
per cent up to $20,000, 6 per cent uj to
$30,000, and so on. Now, if you leave in
the amendment proposed by the honourable leader of the Government the words
"borse race" you are legislating on this
matter of horse racing in a way which will
actually defeat the specific legislation
which bas been enacted in regard to horseracing. 1 amn simply suggesting that the
words "horse race" be taken out of 'tbis
amendment. As I say, there wlll be a
conflict, but in any case it is wholly unnecessary to include those words for the
purposes my honourable friend bas in
view. As I understand it, this Bill, especially the section before us, aims at the
people who have organized that metbod
of betting in regard to basebail and other
games.

541

thing in a specific way, entirely different
fromn the way in which horse racing has
been deait with. You do not want to
affect the legislation which is on the
statute book, and bas been for twelve
yea'rs, with regard to horse racing. I
say, if you put the words "horse race" in
this paragraph you are going to legislate
against the provisions affecting horseracing, whicb are specific provisions, entirely different; froni, and in fact conflicting
witb, the provision now proposed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to put a question to my bonourable friend.
Does bie dlaim that the legislation to
wbich hie has alluded bas completely or
partially replaced the enactment of section
227, which covers betting on borse-races?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If legislation
which bas been enacted by special Acts
renders clause 227 uselesa, would bie move
to modify it by striking, out the words
"horse race," even if I were not moving
the present amendment?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. Tbat is
tbe position I take.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wbile
my bonourable friend is on bis feet perbaps *he would deal with tbis feature.
I understand the intention is not to restrict tbe offence to betting on horseracing, but the language of the section,
it seems to me, would be interpreted as
restricting the offence to that.
(1) All or any part of which rnoney or valuable tbing or its equivaIent ls to be paid or
given to any other person on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse race or
other race, fight, game or sport.

Guessing con-

The off ence is lirnited in that way.
It
seems to me that tbis is narrowing tbe
operation of tbe clause and the purpose
wbicb my honourable friend bas in view.
Why sbould the off ence be described in
that way?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will flot
narrow the clause if in reality tbe saine
offence bas been dealt witb by subsequent
legislation. However, I have put a question to my bonourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt). In amending tbis legislation I
would not; like to see an offence uncovered
which tbis clause was deenied to cover.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: People wbo induce others to guess or bet on basebali
gaines. That is dealing witb a specific

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps I migbt
put tbe case in another way. You have
the Criminal Code, which at tbe time it
was passed contained the enactment wbich

tests.

542

SENATE

my honourable friend read a moment ago,
prohibiting betting on horse-races. That
was modified so as to make such betting
permissible under certain conditions and
requirements, in 1910. That legisiation
was continued in 1912 with additional requirements. Again in 1920 further conditions were imposed upon race courses.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Without this
amendment?
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: Without that
clause being amended. Now, if you reenact the original clause of the Criminal
Code in the manner proposed, you are
practically repealîng the legislation of
1910, the legisiation of 1912, and that of
1920 with regard to horse racing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Could
there not be a proviso inserted there, that
this is not to have any effect upon that
particular legislation? It seems to me
that would be the way to do it. That is
to say, if the Act as it is at present wi.ll
not cover the class of offences referred to
by the honourable leader of the Government, then it seems to me a proviso might.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The simplest
way would be what I have suggested,
namely, to strike out the words "horseracing." The clause would then read:
Ail or any part of wht-ch money or valuabie
thing or its eçjuivalent is to be paid or given
to any other person on any event or contingency of or relating to any race, fight, game
or sport.

Then my honourable friend has ahl he
wants. What he is aiming at is not horseracing at aIl. He admits that he does flot
want to touch that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
offence may be created and a horse-race
may be the subject of it.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Yes.
You can
guess on a horse-race as well as on a
basebaîl game.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why
can you not say "any kind of race, game
or sport"?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my amendment carnies, this is the way it will read:
Relating to any race, flght, game or sport.
There is a second reason why my amendment ought to carry.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You
might say, "any race by man or animal."
Then you would cover it.
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But there is no
restriction to that at alI. Then, if you
look at subsection 2, you will find that
that addition is wholly unnecessary, because subsection 2 covers alI that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) desires to cover:
Subsection twa of section two hundred and

thirty-five of the said Act as Pnacted by chapter

forty-three of the Statutes of 1920,-

The statute I have referred to
amended by inserting the words: 'between
-is
no t more than tan individuals" after the wordis
"'any bets" Jn the eighth Uine thercof.

That subsection 2, it seema to me, amply
and fully covers just what my honourable
friend wants to cover. What I arn con-cerned about is this. I am quite clear in
my own mind that any legislation enacted
now with regard to horse racing is going
to have the effeet of repealing those specific
provisions which were made in the years
I have mentioned, with regard to horseracing.
Hon. Sýr JAME'S LOUGHEED: Unless
we specifi ýally provide against that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that is not
dýone here.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
Can you not do
tha t?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Why
not insert that proviso?

Hon. Mr. WATSON: You are trying to
Ftop guessing contests.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am afraid I
cannot suggest anything better, or in fact
anyýthing else.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
The honourable
leader of the Opposition suggegts that you
can exempt horse-racing. (an you not do
that?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, as I understand, you are propusing
to amend the Criminal Code in order to
cover the cases of newspapersHon. Mr. WATSON:
coIîtests.

Those

guessing

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: f wish to bring
before the Committee an amendmient that
is proposed by my honourable friend from
Hamilton (lion. Mr. Lynich-Staunton), who
has in conjunction with the Law Clerk gone
N
ery carefully into this matter. We have
here an amendment that I think will cover
it.

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But is it an
amendment to follow this one?
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: This is an amendment to section 16, paragraph g of subsection 1 of sectifon 235 of the Crimiinal
Code. In section 235, as it stands to-day,
paragraph g says:
(g) Advertlses, prints, publishefi. exhibits, or

posta up
to bet...

any offer, Inwivtatlon, or Inducement

This proposed amendment says:
Section 16, paragraph g of subsection 1 of
section 235 Is hereiby repealed and the follo'wing substituted therefor:
(g) Advertlses,
prints, pulflshes, exhibits,
posta up, or otherwise gives notice of any offer,
invitation or Induicement to bet on, to guesa or
to foretel] the resuit of ,any contest; or,

The word "contest" covers everytthing.
Hon. Sir JAMES ýLOUGHEED: That
seemns to meet the situation. You could
isay, "game or contest."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: "Contest" is the
all-embracing word, it seeis, to me. Howcver, I have no dbje<stion to adding "game."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suppose the elemen± orf contest enters into any
game.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Yes, the esisential
part of the game is the contest.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I suggest that
the word "game" be put in there.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I do not see any
objection to pufrting in the words "gaine or
roltest." This certainly will cover the
case in point, reg'arding those adveritising
contests.
Hon. Sir JAMES IjOUGHEED: Yes, I
prefer that amendment to the one moved
by the honouralble letader of the Governnient.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: But we want this
one too.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That would
not be necessary.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
Would that be
necessary if this one is adeipted?
Hon. Sir JAME'S LOUGHEED: What
duoes my honourable friend, (Hon. Mr. Danduranýd) think of the aniendment nioved by
the honourable gentleman froin Kings and
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) ? My honourable friend has followed this matter very
closely, I suppose. Arn 1 to understand that
the Criminal Code did not apply to the
3roceedings instituted against the offences
charged, on the ground that the Co-de only

made provision against betting and not
uginst guessing? That, I understand, is
the feature involved. If the Code had
made the saine provision against guessmrg as against betting, 'wbuld not the Code
'have been sufficien'tly coinprehensive to have
met the situation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The scheme
which is being workedHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, I
know the scheme.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -in corne of
the provinces in the West je somewhat as
follows. The newspaper sells for 5 cents
and the coupon on which to make the guess
is thus secured. That ie sent in with 25
cents, and the person making the nearest
guese gets 50 per cent of the prize xnoney;
the second prize is. 30 per cent; the third
20 per cent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: So the
guessing je the element againet which we
have to legisiate.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: An information was laid before Sir Hugh John Macdonald under sections 227 and 228 of the
Code, but he held on the English cases that
there was no offence.
It would appear fri
the décisions that it ls
not a lottery, because kI<ll la ueed, differentiating It frorn a niera sweepstake or drawlng
from a bat. The Orown Preseciitor therefore laid
the information under the betting section, and
two unes of defence were wjed. The first defence was that in Regina versus Hobbs it was
not rnoney paid on the contlngency of a gaine
but on the contlngency of a drawlng. My opinion
ls that this distinction was not-sou nd, althougb
the magistrate se feund.

I think the language of our section 227
would cover the offence.
The other defence arose urder section 235,
subsection 2, as amendýed In 1920 Dy chapter 43,
section 6. il you refer te those sections yen wil
fim4 that sections 227 and 228 do net extent to
any person or association by reason of is or
their becomlng the custodian or deposltory o~f
any money. preperty or valuable tbing staked
or to be pald to the wlnn-er cf any bet, or of a
private bet betwaen individuals net engaged in
any way ln a business of bettlng. Theraifore, If
this la a bat, ais I arn lncllned tu thmnk It ls, the
deposltory, nainaly tha ]Bulletin and other
papars, WOUldI not be cevered by tiie Act. There
la a question in the case of Regina versus
Torrltt that even If1 these transactions de net
amDunt to bets there stUl Wou l be an offence;but it la a vary doubtfnl Peint. It le 8o doubtful
that It seeins that tbiis la a case where thera
shonld be an. amendmant to the Code. The
menace is a serions oe and sbould ha attended
to.

So, after consultation with the honourable gentleman from Kings and Albert
(Hon. Mr. Fowler) and the honourable

SENATE
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton), I thought that I would persist
in the two amendments of which I had
given notice, and that the third one would
supplement and strengthen them.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I think that the point raised by the
honourable member from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) is well taken. By implication the section of the criminal law to
which the honourable leader of the Government referred was repealed by the Statute of 1920. I agree with the suggestion
made by the honourable leader of the other
side of the House. The best course in
order to cover what the honourable niember from Ottawa has in mind would be
to add this to the clause proposed:
Nothing in this section shall apply to the
operation on any race course as authorized by
section 6 of Chapter 43 of the Statutes of 1920.

That would make it very clear.

That the following be

"15. (1) Paragraph (b) of subsection one of
section two hundred and twenty-seven of the
said Act is amended by striking out the words
as or for the consideration in the third line
thereof, and by repealing subparagraph (i)
thereof and substituting therefor the following:'(i) ala or any part of which money or valuable thing or its equivalent is to be paid or
given to any other person on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse race or
other race, fight, gai-ne or sport; or'"

The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have finished with that section of the Code. I am

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move that the following be added:

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not quite

I have been trying to follow it with the
statute and with the clause as it appears
in the discussion in the Debates of the
Senate, page 502. I do not understand
where it comes in or how it is going to
affect the force of the section.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is a further extension of the amendment the honourable
leader of the Government bas made. It

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I wouid like to
find out how far-reaching this amendanent
is. There is a great deal of advertising in
the forin of taking a certain word, or words,
such as " underwear," "'brick factory,"
" medicine," and so on, and the advertisement might say, " Who oan make a verse?"
or "Who can make the best line?" or, "Who
can write the most intelligent piece of
advertiýsingl" or, "Who can take this group
of words and letters and put thein in the
best shape?" Does this amendment cut out
ail the advertising of that nature ?-because
it is done ýby everybody and everywhere..
If this is going to cut out ail gaifnes of
chance or skill or guessing, no premium of
any nature could bie offered in a newspaper.
It will bie pretty hard to, write any kind
of an advertisement if this is going to cut
out every kind of coxnpetition and guessing.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: That is the trouble
with ail legisiation of this kind.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: It is a most dangerous attack on -legitimate'advertising, and
I think it should be gone on wiýth pyretty
carefully.
Hon. Mr. BELCOtJRT: After ail, what
is the difference between the case my honourable friend puts and the 'case of a magazine proprietor offering to pay a prize of
$500 for the best draina or for the lest
essay on a given subject?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
not a guessing contest. I was going to
make this comment yesterday, that my
honourable friend in introducing this
subject referred to the offence baving been
committed by newspapers. I do not understand that to bie the case. This off ence ha
been created by propaganda sheets issued
primarily for the purpose of working
this scheme or fraud upon the public. Il
amn unaware of any reputabie papers having taken it up, and I thînk if reference,
is made to the literature that has been
issued it will be seen that that literature
was not issued by any newspapers. These
publications do not assume to be nevvspapers: they are simply propaganda sheets,
that is ail.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: The newspapers

which they offer a trip to Europe, or a trip
ta France, or an automobile, for conteEts of

tainly attacks that. Saine of the largest

newspapers in Canada have increased their
circulation by just such methods.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
if they are gambling projects they shonld
be suppressed, 1 do flot care how reputable
the paper that promotes theni.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: If it is gainbiing, yes; but that is flot gambling; yet
here they say no gaines of chance, no
games of skili, no contests of any kind. If
you are going to make a crime of a contest
of any kind, that would bie serious.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the inevîtable resuit of legisiation of this kind;
when you want to do something good, you
are likely to do at the saine turne something
seriously detrimental or worse.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: It is well to leave
it alone.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We can adopt
these amendments and not take the third
reading tili to-morrow, so that we shall
have plenty of turne to examine theni.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Will the honourable
gentleman tell us what this amendment
really means, and read the section as it
will bie if the amendinent passes, so that we
shall know what we are doing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 235
says:
Efvery person is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to one year's imprisonment, and to
a fine flot exceeding one, thousand dollars, who(a) uses or knowingly ahlows any part of
any preinises under his control to be used for

Then there are these exceptions:
2. The provisions of this section and oif sections 227 and 228 shall not extenwi to any person or association by reason off his or their

Order.

The preamble was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Before the Bill is
reported, I should like to suggest that it be
reprinted before coming up for a third reading. I doubt very much whether there is a
man in this House who knows exactly what
the Bill means. I am free to confess that
I do not. I doubt if any honourable gentleman in this House could give us a synopsis
of the amendments which have been made.
While I am on my feet, I should like
to say that in the amendments of the
Criminal Code that come here from the
Commons we find some of the most remarkable things the mind of man could
devise. I have no objection whatever to
proper amendments to the Criminal Code;
but very often the great trouble with the
amendments coming to this House from the
House of Commons is that they do not tend
in the least to minimize the evils they are
intended to minimize, but only make confusion worse confounded, with the result
that the evils become very much worse than
they were supposed to be. I think we ought
te treat amendments to the Criminal Code
sanely, and should give each one of them
the consideration which it deserves. To
do as we have done to-night, put through
amendments holus bolus without realizing
what they mean, is not, I think, doing
justice either to the Code or to ourselves;
I think we should thoroughly understand
them before they are put in force.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will ask the
Clerk to see that the Bill is reprinted with
the amendments made in this House before
the third reading is taken.
I should like to add a word on the matter
of amendments which come to this Chamber
from the House of Commons. There have
been numerous comments in years past in
the press upon the dissent of this Chamber
from amendments made to the Criminal
Code by the House of Commons. They have

JUNE 22, 1922
failed te notice the fact that very many
important amendments were made in hils
House and were later presented to the
flouse of Commons. There has not been
one word of comment upon them. In the
present instance I have been looking up the
reports of the Debates of the flouse of Comnmens to find some explanation of-, or some
discussion or light upon, those amendments,
and in very many instances there was only
the word: "Carried." The Commons is a
Chamber consisting ef 235 members, and it
seerns only natural tfat some queries should
be made in regard to the necessity of the

brought in, preposed and carried; then it is
sent te the Senate. I think the prss, before criticising the action of the Senate,
could well afford to take the Debates of the
Senate and those of the flouse of Commons
for the last few years and compare them,
and see what the Senate has done. If they
did this, I think they would commend the
thorough discussions that have taken place
in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Is the honourable gentleman going to leave the Bll
in Committee? I fancy that when we see
the Bill printed we shahl be satisfied, and
that there wilh be no necessity te recommit
it; but I would suggest leaving it in Cernrnittee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it is urged,
we can leave it in Comrnittee, but if it is
reported we can recommit it if it seems
necessary.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Wind it ail up
now.
The Bihl was reported as amended.

The Hon. the CHAIRM AN: The discussion is on that motion. It does not have
to be moved again; it bas flot yet been
put.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend moved to strike eut section 5.
That section had the effeet of taking away
the right of appeal not only on a legal
point, but also on a question of fact. My
honourable friend the leader to the left
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) suggested that
we limit the right of appeal to cases which
do net concern traffickers in drugs. 1 have
in niy hand an amendment which I should
like to submit to the Chamber as a substitute clause. It reads as f ollows:
Except In cases tried before two justices of
the peace, sections 749 to 760 inclusive, and
subseet ion 2 of section 769 of the Criminal
Code, shall fot apply to any conviction, order
or proceedings in respect of any offence under
paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of section 5A
of this Act.

I think that will meet the objections of
my honourable friend from Manitoba
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) and my honourable
friend from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), who claimed that citizens could
be condemned by justices of the peace
who had no experience, and that there
was no right of appeal. What the Department has more especially in view is the
curbing of the activities o? the traffickers
in drugs in the large cities like Toronto
and Montreal, and they are urging that
we should deprive of the right of appeal
ail traffickers in drugs who are condemned

new draft, persons condemned by two justices of the peace will have the f ull right
of appeal on the facts as well as on the
law. 0f course, I know niy honourable
friend from Manitoba (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) desires to enlarge the right of
appeal and is reluctant to restrict it. But
here we are face to face with people who
are inflicting a real injury upon the coinmunity by this traffic in drugs; and in
view of the fact that they have been deprived of the right of appeal, it is certain that the magistrates and judges in
the large cities will be very careful in
condemning them to the severe punishment provided by the Act.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honourable
gentleman's explanation is rather mystifying te me. 1 do not quite understand it.
I desire te say that se far as I arn concerned the traffiçker in drugs will get no
synipathy; but if I read the Bill aright, At

Mr. DANDURAND: That is by

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes. The Act
provides the punishment, and if he has
been tried upon an indictrnent, there is
no appeal upon the question of fact. But
when it cornes to the man whe is not keep-

ing proper records, and who is tried by a
police magistrate or by two justices of

that there is a right of appeal.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 have no

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It must net enlarge the jurisdiction of men who are not
professional men and who are ignorant
and net accustomed to trying cases, and

Hon. '.\I. GREEN:

Honourable gentle-

mien, I tînt snmewhat diffident about entering- into a dehate on this particular subject.

JUNE 22, 1922
as it is l.argely a matter which those who
are learned in the law are better able to
debate. I do not dlaim to have any particular knowledge of the law, but if I understand the amendment that is now proposed
by the honourable leader of the Government, it is that the appeal applies only
when two justices of the peace hear the
case. Perhaps the honourable gentleman
does not know-or if he does perhaps he
forgets-the conditions in some of the provinces other than that in which he resides.
ln the province of British Columbia, in the
outlying districts, there are many stipendiary magistrates who havq neyer had
any training in the law. However, if a
police magistrate has not heen appointed,
or if the police magistrate does not happen
to be actually sitting, in any of the small
towns in British Columbia, the statute
gîves the Mayor of the town the right and
authority to sit as a stipendiary magistrate to deal out justice in that particular
place. These men are not lawyers; they
are not learned in the law; they know
nothing of it. If you are going simply to
mnake it apply where the case is tried
before two justices of the peace, you might
just as well leave it as it was before, because a great many of the cases in those
outlying districts are tried by men who are
not lawyers, and, while justice is almost
gways given, because the judgment is
based upon common sense, yet it is a
serious matter when a man's liberty is in
question. Like my honourable frîend from
Winnipeg <Hon. Mr. McMeans), I have no
sympathy for the particular class of
offenders aimed at. I amn just as desirous
as anybody in this Chamber to see that they
are punished. But when it comes to a
man's liberty, he should have the right to
appeal unless bis case is tried by some
court that is absolutely competent.
This wil

have to be considered later.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He will be

26th of May last by the Congress of the
United States contains the following
clause:
<e) Any allen wbo at any time after bis
entry is convicted under subdivision (b) shall,
upon the termination of the imprisonment lmposed by the Court upon such conviction and
upon warrant issued by the Secretary or
Lýabour, be taken into custody and deported
in accordance wlth the provisions of sections
19 and 20 of the Act of February 5th, 1917,
entitied "An Act to regulate the immigration
of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in,
the UnLteid States," or provisions of law hereafter enacted which are amendatory of, or in
substitution for, such sections.

The off ence would .be importing or trafflcking in drugs. I move the adoption of
section 6.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Before we pass
this section I would like to ascertain fromn
the honourable leader of the Government
whether or not it is fully intended that the
Court is to have no option. As. the clause
reads, it provides that any alien who

Would it flot be very much better to
leave it to the trial judge to say whetber
the man sbould be deported or flot? H1e
may be convicted of an offence for which
even the Immigration Department would
not think it fair to deport bim. In this
clause there is no option. The trial judge
bas really notbing to do with it. I think
it would be very much better to leave some
discretion to the trial judge. 1 discussed
this very question with one of our high
court judges recently, and bis opinion was
that the court sbould have discretion in
the matter and if at the termination of the

tbe man should be deported be sbould 50

man came before me. I xvould take into
consideration that tbis man, after serving

give him only two years in penitentiary
because we want to get rid of such a man

consideration of tbe case, and I migbt consider that be ougbt to get seven years. On
the other hand, if this country could get rid

only three months. I think tbere sbould ho
in tbe clause some guidance to the judge,
so tbat the judge may order that the convicted alien shahl be depor'ted.

JUNE 22, 1922
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps the point
might be met by this suggestion: leave in
the statute the provision that the convicted
alien shall be deported, but add the words,
" unless the trial judge for some reason in
his discretion thinks he should not be."
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That would be
better.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That would
cover the case. It would cover every contingency.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would the trial
judge have discretion to override the provisions of the Immigration Act?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: When the convicted alien has served his sentence and has
been kept in custody, to be delivered to
the immigration authorities, then the immigration authorities would be the only
tribunal that would have power to administer that law, would they not?
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: No. If you
made it a provision of this Bill that the
convicted :alien shall be deported, then you
can impose any condition or provide for the
exercise of any discretion which you may
think proper. It is true that the actual
deportation of the man would be carried
out by the Immigration Department, but
an order of the Court would be binding on
the Department.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not think
that the last statement is borne out by the
vording of this statute. It says:
be kept in custody and deported in accordance
with section 43 of the Immigration Act.

I understand from a reading of this section not that the man is handed over to
the Immigration Department, but that he
is deported in accordance with the terms of
the Immigration Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Who is to deport hin? That is not provided for here.
There should be a statement that the convicted alien should be handed ever to the
Immigration Department to be deported
according to the terms of the Imnigration
Act.
Hon. Mr BELCOURT: I have not the
Eection before me, nor can I remember to
have read it lately, but my impression is
that the section referred to by my honourable friend is that which determines the
manner of carrying out the sentence of de-

portation. So if we provide that the convicted alien shall be deported unless the
trial judge for some reason or dther thinks
he should not be, then the section of the
Immigration Act would be fully effective
and the man would be deported in the manner provided for in it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I am going to
move an amendment to that s&tion, to add
at the end the words just mentioned by the
¾onourable member from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt)-to add alfter the words,
"be kept in custody and deported in accordance with section 43 of the Immigration
Act," the following words: "unless the trial
judge shall otherwise order." I think those
are the words the honourable gentleman
used.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: Do I understand it
would be opitional with the magistrate
whether or not the convicted alien should
be deported?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: I would not do that.
Some magistrates may be very easily influenced.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have no desire
to move an amendment. I am merely suggesting this as a way out of the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I desire slimply to
make this statement-and probably the
honourable member from Ottawa will agree
with it. I do not like a penalty over-riding
the judge's discretion. The clause says the
convicted alien shall be deported even if he
is sent to penitentiary for seven years and
ordered to be whipped. No matter what becomes nf him, he must he deported.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: After he serves
his sentence.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But there may be
circumstances in which he cannot be deported.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would not the
judge exercise his discretion in the very
contingency of which my honourable friend
speaks?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes, if you so
provide.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is what I
am suggesting.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: To say that, no
matter what occurs, the convicted alien
must be deported, looks to me to be a poor
way of dealing with the matter.

persons who are aliens, and are found
guilty of trafficking in these narcotic
drugs. I doubt very much if there should
be any discretion left to the authorities.
Those persons have been found guilty of
doing those things which we want to have
stopped in Canada, and I do not think
the Court should have any discretion. I
think those persons, if they are aliens,
should be deported at once, or immediately
after their term of imprisonment bas been
carried out. This crime is very much
worse than other crimes for which persons
are deported.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The point I
raised, and on which I would like to be
clear, is this: bas any judge authority to
express such an opinion or make such a
ruling? Aliens are deported under the
terms of the Immigration Act, which is
administered by the Immigration Department. If a man is committed for a crime,
tried and found guilty, and serves his
sentence in Canada, and if the crime bas
been such that the immigration officials beHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Suppose a man

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I doubt very much
the advisability of adding those words.
The Immigration Act sets forth very
clearly the classes of persons to be deported; those are all set out in detail. For
example, a woman comes across from the
United -States, she is convicted of being
a prostitute, and without any question
the Immigration authorities may deport
her. I understand we are dealing with
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: They are not aliens,
but if they deal in these drugs and are
caught, I would denaturalize them and deport them, and I would like to see this
amendment go that far.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Draw the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The advantage of this clause being maintained intact
is to deter those people from dealing in

JUNE 22, 1922
drugs. Over 50 per cent of thxase men
convicted of dealing in narcotics on the
Pacific coast are aliens, and it seems to me
that we should maintain as stern a clause
as possible. There is not any great danger
that such an event may happen as that
mentioned by my honourable friend froin
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique)-that we
would desire to retain the prisoner in orde'r
to put him on trial on some more grievous
charge. 1 think that, concurrently with
any sentence pronounced against him under
this Act, hie would be tried on the more
grievous charge.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is conceivable
that the two offences might have been comnmitted almost concurrently. For instance,
a constable who has information that this
m~an had been guilty of trafficking in drugs
goes to arrest hini, and the alien takes a
revolver and shoots the constable.
You
would not deport that fellow: you would
hang him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but hie
would first be put on trial for murder.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If a man is an
alien, and is going to be deported, I do
flot see why hie should be kept in penitentiary for seven years at the expense of
the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under this
clause the judge may save so niuch expense
to the country by condemning hlmi to a f ew

Mr. Robertson).
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
honourable gentlemen, I move:
That the Bill be flot now read a second time,
but be read th-is day three months.

I made an explanation of this niatter
to the Chaniber the other evening when it

554

SENATE

came up, but, owing to a number of honourable gentlemen being absent, I may be
pardoned if I to some extent repeat what
I then said. Under section 1140 of the Criminal Code there are lengthy provisions dealing with the limitation of criminal actions.
In that section I think almost every conceivable criminal offence is specifically
mentioned, except the particular offence
which is the subject-matter of this Bill. It
has always been the policy of the law, particularly the Criminal law, to fix a limit of
time within which criminal actions should
be brought against individuals. It is apparent upon a mere statement of the fact
that after a period of years evidence disappears-both witnesses and documents;
hence the policy of the law, not only under
our judicial system, but under every other,
to limit the time within which action should
be brought.
Consequently the period of
time fixed under this section for the most
serious offences, including treason, is three
years.
In 1921 it was pointed out to the Minister
of Justice,by one of the members representing the province of Alberta, that the Criminal Code did not provide a limitation of
time in regard to offences in connection
with the location of land for which half1,reed scrip had been issued, and it was
pointed out that, owing to a conflict of conditions which had arisen, actions had been
or would be brought against certain individuals based on facts that had happened
twenty years ago.
Of course, it is quite
apparent to honourable gentlemen that any
man might be called upon to face a criminal
charge based upon such facts, and might
find himself utterly unable to produce witnesses, documents or other evidence successfully to defend himself.
Hence it was
thought that this condition of affairs afforded a means of successfully carrying out
blackmail hy which even reputable citizens
might suffer seriously. When the Minister
of Justice in 1921, the Hon. Mr. Doherty,
sent to this Chamber his Bill amending the
Criminal Code, the Parliamentary Counsel,
Mr. Gisiborne, at the same time sent me a
letter reading as follows:
The Minister of Justice would like the enclosed amendment made to the Criminal Code
when it is being considered in Committee by the
Senate. It would come in after clause 24 of
the Bill, page 9, line 6.

The Parliamentary Counsel, who is absolutely disinterested, makes this statement
in the letter to me:
The objeet of the clause is to provide a
prescritption of three years with respect to any
offence reilating to the location of land issued
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

by hatfbreed scrip.
It is urged that there
were a good many irregularities amounting to
fraud and perjury in connection with the locat!on of these lands, and parties are raking up
these frauds for the purpose of blackmailing.
If this clause passes any such prosecution would
be prescribed, as the offences were committed
a long time ago.

The paragraph which Mr. Gisborne
enclosed to me reads as follows:
24

A. Paragraph (a) cf section eleven hundred and forty of the said Act is amended bys
adding thereto the following sub-paragraph:
(iv) Any offence relating to or arising out
of the location of land whicn was paid for in
whole or in part by scrip or was granted upon
certificates is'sued to halfbreeds in connection
with the extinguishment of Indian titie.

That is to say, offences of this character
rot prosecuted within three years after
their commission would be prescrlibed. This
vas passed without any hesitation by Parl:ament; but afterwards attention was
directed to the fact that a reputable citizen
of Edmonton h-ad been arrested and was
bceing prosecuted for this very offence, on
fa1 cts alleged to have taken place some twenty years ago. This legislation, honourable
gentlemen, was not made retroactive.
If
honourable gentlemen will keep that in view,
they will see the desirability of placing this
upon the statute book.
It was not made
retroactive; it did not extend back to that
particular case; it did not touch any cases
which had existed previous to its passage.
But immediately it was passed, the provincial government, or whoever was prosecuting Mr. Secord, dropped the case, and
was afterwards alleged that the Prime
vt
Minister, then Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
who, by the way, vas in England at the
time, and knew nothing about it, was playing into the hands of Mr. Secord in
having this legislation passed. I likewise
was charged with the offence of being
a party to this proceeding.
I had never
come in contact with Mr. Secord in this
matter directly or indirectly up to that time,
and from that time until this morning, when
I received a telegram .from him, I never
had any communication with him, either
directly or indirectly.
During the last
election, however, this charge was made
,gainst the late Government, and the
changes were rung upon it in every possible
manrner.
The Progressive party, triumphantly, I might say, went through the
province of Alberta, charging the then
Prime Minister and myself with playing
into the hands of the big interests and with
upssing legislation for the purpose of protecting aileged criminals.

of money on it, and he would put a proviso
in the agreement that the balance of the
money would be paid when the owner of

In many cases these half-breeds lived four
or five or six hundred miles from the
land office, and it' was a matter of very
considerable expense to bring them in, and
it is reported that in a good many cases

the tîtie to common lands of bands, which
mlay b 'e granted for land acquired for an
Indian who is being enfranchised. I move
the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: This Indian question is apparently becoming somewhat
&cute, and it is rather important.- The Indians, particularly those belonging to the
Six Nations, have an idea that they are not
subjects of this country at ail. They dlaim
to be allies and not subjects, and thereforýe flot subject to the laws of this country. They are at present, as they have
bcen for some time, defying the Depar.tnient and the Government and everybody
connected therewith. Now, the sooner they
are taught that they are not allies of Canada, but subjects of Canada, and that they
are Canadian citizens so far as the moderate kind of citizenship they 'have, without
the franchise, is concerned, the better, because we do not want any sueh anomaly
in this country. We have troubles enough
about our immigration, without having contention with our aboriginal inhabitants. It
seems to me that the Indian Department
has not handled, those people with sufficient
Iirmness. There was a statute passed for
the purpose of enfranchising them, giving
themn a chance to become citizens if they
were dîsposed to take advantage of it.
Many Indians desired to take advantage of
it, but in the bands the opposition was sa
streng that an Indian who, wanted to be
enfranchised could not do se; he was boycotted, various difficulties .being thrown in
bis way. Under the Act I think it was required that there should be one or more
Indians as sponsors for the person w'ho
wanted to be enfranchised; but no one dared
to sign the petition necessary for them to
heceme enfranchised, because they were
terrorized. That is the condition now, and
it seems to me that any legislation tending
towards easing up on those people makes
themn think that they are masters of the
situation, that they *have got the Governaient scared, and that the Goverument dare
flot go on. Now, 1 want the Minister to
understand th-at some of us at least aire in
faveur of using the strong arm, if necessary, in order to make those people understand that they are subjiectis of Canada,
and net, as they arrogantly dlaim, allies.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I fully
cencur in what my honourable friend from
Kings and Albert <Hon. Mr. Fowler) has
said. It seems to me to be very essential that
authority should be asserted in regard to
any law that we put upon the statute book.
Immediately we recede fromn any position

557

taken, where, either 'by experiment or otherwise, satisfactory resuits having been obtained, such action will be accepted as a
sign of our being intimidated by the unreasonable attitude which irresponsible part7es have taken touching Indian administration. It seems to me that the law of
1920, which we -are not altogether repealing, but wh'ich we are weakening, was a
very salutary statute. The policy of that
law was that ýthe Government, of whom
the Indians are the wards, would determine whether an Indian should be enfranchised or not. The Department of Indian
Affaîrs is the best judge, fromn the machinery w'hich it bas, and which is constantly
in motion, to deterniine this important question. We cannot assume that for ail time
to come the Indians must neces'sarily be
wards of the nation. In course of t-ime,
and at no distant period, they must become
selfsustain-ing. We know t-hat very large
sections of the people of Canada were at
one time aboriginal inhabitants of Canada,
and oecupied a position analogous to the
present wards of the nation-the Indians
who oecupy many of our reserves. The
whole trend of treatment by the Government of the Indian-s of Canada 'bas been
to make the Indian self.'sustaining. Because of this fact the policy of the Canadian Government 'bas been far 'superior to
that of the United States. While that country bas had very serious trouble with its
Inidian population, there is prohably no
Lianch of the public service of Canada that
has been productive of, fore satisfactory
results than the policy pursued iby 'the
Canadian Government since Confederation.
We have always proceeded on the assumption that the Indian could be made a citizen
of Canada; that he cou-Id be so educated
as, to be able 'to disch-arge ail the tresponsibilities of citizenship. We have continuously
pursued that policy ulp te the present, and
thousands of Indians are to-day ýamongst
the citizens of Canada, dischar.ging their
duties most satisfactorily. Now it is, proposed te recede fraim the position that we
took in 1920 to permit the Indians to participate in the council to determine whether
or not an Indian shoucld. be enfranchised.
My own impression is that there will be
vigorous and systeimatie opposition to any
action taken by this Board for the enfranchisement of the Indian. Upon every
reserve there aire always a certain number
of restless and klissatisfied spirits who
will atteimpt to make trouble and wil1 oppose the Governmient's policy of iplacing
the Indian upon a self-supporting hasis.
They want to continue in the position of

SENATE
wards of the nation; they want to be supported by the state for all time; and if we
give recognition to that spirit of dependence on the Government, we shall never
be able to -develop our administration of
Indian affairs to that stage at which we
shall fina'lly solve the Indian problems of
Canada by absorbing the Indian population on the basis of citizenship.
I therefore regret that the Government
has seen fit to depart from the policy which
we embodied in the Act of 1920. I had
some experience in administering this Act
as Superintendent General of Indian
Affairs, and I found it to work out most
satisfactorily. During the period that I
occupied that office I was unaware of any
case which, upon investigation, should have
caused us any concern as to the Act not
fulfilling al the objects which we had in
view. It seems to me that, as it was a step
forward' towards making the Indian selfsupporting, we shouild give it a longer trial
than it bas had, namely, since its passage
a year an a half ago.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What change does this really make in the
past policy?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It proposes that a representative of the band
shall be upon this Board. This representative of the band on the Board will be
constantly importuned by the Indians of
the band who are opposed to enfranchisement, and his usefulness wiil be marred
by the pressure that wiill be brought to
bear upon him, and it wil'l be constantly a
source of dissatisfaction to the Indian that
his views do not prevail.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There was' a Board before?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, of
the Indian Department; that is to say, of
thc Government. The Government determined whether a man should be enfranchised or not. If this Bill becomes law,
there will, in my judgment, be set in motion a species of terrorism, which wi'll injuriously affeit the carrying out of this
policy.
There is another criticism which might
be made, in regard to clause 2 of the Bill,
and perhaps my honou-rable friend will
give the louse some information upon it.
It is proposed that the Indian settlers shall
have all the advantages of the Soldiers'
Settlement Act of 1919. That seems to me
to be extending paternalisr to a deigree
that we should scarcely go. The Indians
upon many of the reserves are in fairly
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

good positions, and it is a question whether
we should extend such generous treatment
to any but the returned soldiers. It involves an advance of a very substantial,
amount of money. I am not prepared to
believe that the results would beï as satisfactory in the case of the Indians as they
have been in the case of the returneid
soldiers, because you are -dealing with an
entirely different type of man. Why the
Government should assume financiall obligations of this kind, in addition to those
already assumed in connection with the
administration of Indian affairs in Canada, I do not understand. I doubt that
this ýassumption of obligation will be satisfactory.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Is that assistance granted to an Indian who
has not been a soldier?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Who has not served?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
the way I read the section.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend is in error.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
read the section?
The Deputy Suýperintendent General may acquire for a settler who is an Indian, land as
well without as wi-thin an Indian reserve, and
shall have authority to set apart for such
settler a portion oif the common lands of the
band without the consent of the council of the
band. In the event of land being so acquired
or set a-part on an In-dian reserve, the Deputy
Superintendent ýGeneral shall have power to take
tRhe said land as security for any advances made
to such settler, and the provisions of The
Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, shahl, as far as
appltoable, apply te such transactions.

That is apparently to be exteinded to all
Indian settlers. Quiteý a number of Indians
did join the forces duriýng the Great War
and were sent to the front and discharged
thei'r duties most gallantly. Upon their
return to Canada they werre given all the
advantages which were given to the other
retutned soldiers. I think several hundred of those young men werre located upo.n
Indian lands, and all the advantages of
the Soldier Settlement Act of 1919 were
extended to them, and I believe, with satisfactory resuits. I am not at the moment
prepared to speak definitely, but without
further thought my inclination is decidedly against our externding this Act to all
the Indian population of Canada. My
honourable friend, I think, did not make
any reference to this subject, and as it is

JUNE 23, 1922
one which wil'l involve probably millions of
dollars, and is of such importance, it is
desirable that we give it full consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I think that Canada bas reason
to be proud of its treatment of the Indians.
In my early years the situation of the
Indians and the treatment of the Indians
in the United States called for the strietures of< many people outside of that
country, and generally the treatment of
the Indians on this side of the line was
highly commended when a comparison was
made between the two systems applied to
the Indians of North America. Paternalism
has perhaps been displayed, but I think
we should not criticize our Governments
of the past for the gentle, paternal way in
which they have treated the Indians. We
have had peace among them generally.
There have been very few occasions *hen
they have shown discontent or excitement,
or where any trouble has appeared among
them.
Strange to say, the Indians generally
seem to be opposed to their own enfranchisement. They are slow in claiming
Canadian citizenship.
They resent any
action on the part of the Government to
enfranchise them against their will, and
they ask that the band be left intactthat no Indian be forced out of'the band
if he is not seeking the privilege of citizenship. The Indians have been constantly
protesting against any idea of breaking
up the bands. They claim their autonomy.
It seems to me that that is an encomium
on Canada's treatment of them, that they
want to remain ùnder the tutorship of the
Federal authorities.
My honourable friend (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) himself moved in this House
some amendments to the Act under which
compulsory enfranchisement might be applied to the Indians. The purpose of this
proposed legislation is to enable us to retrace our steps. My honourable friend
thinks that the Indians should not even
have a voice in the tribunal or commission
which would pass upon a request for enfranchisement. I am not surprised that
my honourable friend bas so short a memory; but I pardon him for being in error
on this point. The tribunal of which the
Indian would be a member was created by
my honourable friend himself. I have before me the Act which we passed. Section
107, which my honourable friend himself
moved in this Chamber, reads as follows:
(1) The Superintendent Genera: may appoint
a Board to consist of two officers of the Department of Indian Affairs and a member of the

Band to whioh tihe Indian or Indians under
investtgation belongs, to make enquiry
and
report as to the fitness of any Ind an or Indians
to be enfranchised. The Indian member of
the
Board shall be nominated by the Council of the
Band, within thirty days after the date of
notice having been given to the ocuncil, and
in
default of such nomination, the appointment shall
be made by the Superintendent General. In
the
course of such enquiry it shall be the
the Board to take into consideration andduty of
report
upon tie attitude of any such Indian towards
his enfranchisement, which attitude shall be a
factor in determining the question ef fitness.
Such report shall contain a description of
the
land occupied by each Indian, the amount
thereof and the improvements thereon, the
names,
ages and sex of every Indian whose initerests it
is anticipated will be affected and such
other
Information as the Superintendent
General nay
direct such Board to obtain.

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: How does the
honourable gentleman reconcile that with
the treaties that have been made with the
Indians in this country?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not
know; I do not remember on what grounds
they resisted this legislation. I know they
did resist it. They petitioned both branches
of Parliament, and in the face of their
pressing demands we appointed a Committee of the Senate to hear them. I sat
in that Committee. They made various
representations. ' Did they claim the right
to retain their autonomy under treaties
signed by Canada? I know that they
claimed that they had obtained from the
Imperial autharities at the time, assurances which should protect them against
the legislation which it was sought to introduce. Whatever may have been their
representations, the Department was of
opinion that it should obtain the right
to enfranchise the Indians against their
will. Now I am informed that, although
this power was given to the Department,
not one Indian was enfranchised under
this Act; that is to say, the mnachinery
which my honourable friend-that is,
which the Government, or, let us say, the
Department of Indian Affairs-had sought
was never put into operation. The present Minister of the Interior met the Six
Nation IndiansHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does
my honourable friend say that there have
been no enfranchisements of Indians since
the passage of this Act?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Of course there
have been.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
have been many of which I have persona]
knowledge.

SENATE

Hon Mr. DANDURAND: I got my information by reading the statement made
by the Minister in the other Chamber. I
have no direct memorandum on the point,
but I see at page 3302 of the Hansard
that when this Bill was before the other
House Mr. Stewart said:
I agree with some part of what my right hon.
friend (Mr. Meighen) has said, but not with
ail of it. So far as I can ascertain, no Indian
has been enfranchised under the Compuisory
Enfranchisement Act passed last Session.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Compulsory
Act, yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I refer
to enfranchisement under whatever law
is upon the statute book. We put any
number of them through.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The statement of the Minister is that under this
Compulsory Act, which my honourable
friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) asked
us to pass in this Chamber, there was not
one Indian enfranchised. So the right to
force an Indian to become a free citizen
of this country bas not been utilized since
this Act was placed on the statute book.
I was proceeding to say that the Minister of the Interior met the Six Nation
Indians, who belonged to the east of Canada, and after smoking the calumet-the
pipe of peace-the Minister deemed it
proper to abandon his right to initiate
the enfranchisement of the Indian. He
has moved for an addition to clause 107.
Honourable gentlemen will have noticed
that section 107 provided:
The Su:perintendent General may appoint a
Board to consist of two officers of the Department of Indian Affairs and a member of the
Band to which the Indian or Indians under investigation bellongs, to make inquiries...

So it was he who had the initiative.
The proposed legislation reads:
Upon the application of an Indian of any
band, or upon the application of a band on a
vote of a tnajority of the male members of such
band of the full age of twenty-one years at
a meeting or council thereof summoned for that
puriose, according to the rules of the band and
held in the presence of the Superintendent General or of an officer duly authorized to attend
council, by thc Gaovernor in Council or
succ
by the Superintendent Generat, a B ard may
be appointed by the Superintendent General to
eonsist of two officers of the Department of
lInditan Affairs and a member of the band.

Then the rest of the section as it is now.
So I think I was stating the situation
fairly when I said that instead of the
Superintendent General setting in motion
the machinery for the enfranchisement of
Indians, it will be the Indian himself, or
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

a majority of the Band, who will ask for
that privilege, if it be one, and then the
Superintendent General will set the machinery in motion. That is all there is
in this section.
I may say that this change is proposed
at the request of the Indians of the East.
I observe that the Minister of the -Interior
has expressed his intention of visiting the
western bands or tribes, and having conference with them this summer. I think
we are all interested in satisfying the first
occupants of the soil, and applying to them
a treatment which they will accept without demur.
from Kingsfriend
My honourable
Albert (Hon. Mr. Fowler) thought that
we should show the strong arm. My conviction is that by conciliation we may attain the same results in a happier way.
The Department, under the direction of
my honourable friend (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed), did not apply the Act. It has
not been tested. The reason given by the
Minister of the Interior for leaving the
Act inoperative was that there was a
violent protest on the part of the Indians.
Another method is suggested, and that is
the one embodied in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it not a fact
that the Indians do not want to be enfranchised, because, forsooth, they will have
to pay taxes, and may be called upon under
conscription. Is it not a fact that so long
as they are not enfranchised they will not
be conscripted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say that my honourable friend has explained just now what he did not explain
in introducing the Bill. This destroys the
legislation passed in 1920; it practically
wipes out the Board which we appointedHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -and it
places the matter entirely in the hands
This is a retrograde and
of the Indians.
reactionary step.
If you leave it to the
Indians to decide whether they are going
to become enfranchised and become citizens, they vill of course say that they prefer to remain wards of the State. They
will remain in the condition in which they
are to-day, you will not he able to introduce any educational system among them.
If the Government ever hopes to make anything of the Indians of Canada, it will have
to assume the initiation of whatever steps
may be necessary to place them in the same
position as the other citizens of Canada.

JUNE 23, 1922
I am somewhat familiar with the development of the Indian population in the West,
and I could point out to honourable gentlemen many Indians who, less than a generation ago, went about the streets with a
blanket around them, but who to-day,
through the Government impressing upon
them the necessity of their assuming all
the responsibilities of citizenship, are developing all their faculties in the discharge of those responsibilities, and are a
credit to Canada.
But now we are dropping the legislation which was so largely discussed in 1920,
and which was, I say, successfully enforced. I disagree with my honourable
friend when he says that it was never
enforced. I know that many cases of enfranchisement came up under that legislation; and, although many cases were passed
through Council, there never was a case
passed in which it was not established beyond peradventure that no injustice was
being done to the Indians. The attitude of
the Government is too well known for
any one to believe that the Government of
Canada would enforce upon our Indian
population any injustice by reason of the
policy whicb was carried out of placing
them in a self-sustaining position.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend has asked for some information as to the second clause. I may say,
before I pass to the second clause, that I
find the principal grievance of the Indians
against being forced to take their enfranchisement was that the Superintendent or
Deputy Superintendent could naine any
Indian, enfranchise him against his will,
have him take his share of the band money
and land, and place him in a position in
which he might subsequently sell the land
to a white man if he so desired, thereby
breaking up the reserve.
As to the second clause. The statute
reads as follows:
The Deputy Superinten.dent General may acquire for a settler who is an Irdian, land as
well without as within an Indian reserve, and
shall have authority to grant to such settler a
location ticket for common lands of the band
without the consent of a Coui±cil of the band,-

That is the legislation my honourable
friend was defending a moment ago. It
goes on:
in the event of land being acqueired or
-and
provided for such settler in an Indian reserve,
the Deputy Srperintendent Genera] shall have
the power to take security as provided by the
Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, and to exercise all
otherwise lawfu rights and powers with respect
to such lands, notwithistanding any provisions of
the Indian Act to the contrary.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But, as I understand the .reading, that
does not give the Deputy Superintendent

to make any advances out of the Consolidated Reveinue Fund of Canada and
take security for the repayment of interest
and principal. He may take security, but
there is no authority for an advance, is

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It says:
And in the event of land being acquired or

the Deputy Superintendent General shall have
power to take security as provided by the Soidier Settlement Act.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is a different thing.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is a location of land.

What

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am referring to section 197 of the said Act, as
enacted by chapter 56 of the Statutes of
1919, first Session. The amendment which
is now proposed reads as follows:
The Deputy Superintendent Gneral may acquire for a settier who is an Indian, land as
well without as within an Indian reserve, and
shall have authority te set apart for such settler a portion of the common lands of the band
without the consent of the council of the band.
In the event of land being so acquired or set
apart on an Indian Reserve, the Deputy Superinten'dent shall have power to take the said
lard as security for any advances made to such
settier, and the [provisions of the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, shall, as far as applicable,

The Soldier Settlement Act, which is
mentioned in the clause now in the statute,
should govern the transaction. That is
the condition stated in the Act.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Perhaps the advancel is made out of the
proportion of the band's funds that would
come to him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are entitled to land and to money.

simply because the Minister of the Interior

BILL
1N COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 149, an Act to regulate the sale of

Agricultural Fertilizers.-Hon. Mr. Béique.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If I arn not mistaken, this Bill bas been considered, with
the exception of clause 15, which was reserved. There was a suggestion mnade by
the honourable gentleman from Antigonish
(Hon. Mr. Girroir), who bas gone to the
trouble of redrafting the first part of
clause 15. I have submitted this draft to
the officer of the Department, who bas
accepted it. I will read the clause as it will
be when amended:
Any person accused of se5ling, offering, exposing or holding in his possession for sale any
fertilizer which does not comply with the requiremnents of this Act or of ar.y regulation
thereunder, who proves tihat the fex-tilizer respecting which action is taken was bought by
hi1m directly within one year froir, a manufa-turer or mnerchant domiciled in Canada, that
i f oontained in a package gaid package was not
olpened, and whether contained irn a package
or flot. tihat the state of the fertilizer was not
altered while it was in his possession, and tihat
he had no reason to believe that the said fertilizer did net comply with the provisions of this
Act,-

JUNE 23, 1922And so on. The rest of the clause remains as it is. 1 move, that the clause be
amended as suggested.
The preamble a'nd titie were agreed to,
and the Bill was reported as amended.

Canada, who pay nothing to enter the contest, and only the winnerýs gain an adlvantage, 1 cannot see anything wro'ng in that.
1 therefore propose that section 14 (d) be
amended by adding after the words "chance

That would protect the giving of any
kind of ,presenjts, premiuins, bonuses, or
prizes, and al1so legitimate advertising,
where no gambling takes place, because no
money or other valuable consideration is
put up. I arn at presenct offering a couple
of scholarships in that way, and I consider
that 1 amn a phî'lanthropîst, and not a
scoundrel. Many prizes are offered where
there is no money paid. For instance, you
offer a trip for the solution of a problein,
and no one pays to compete, and no one
loses when he does not win. The gambling
element cernes in when people pay s0 rnuch
for a coupon, andi those who do not get
prizes lose something. The paragraph as
it reads is too drastic.

was;

In which the contestant or competitor pays
money or other valuable consideration.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me that if no gain changes hands between the two active participants, namely,
the one who disposes of the good's and the
other who may receive the advantage, the
transaction should not 'be prohi-bited.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Take the case of the
newspaper contest.
Those who are conresting for the prizes go out and solicit subscriptions and get thousands of dollars in
subscriptions, which they hand over to the
newspapers.
Hon. Sir JAMES ýLOUGHEED: But it

Can you dispose

Hon. Mr. MeDONALD: No gain enters
there at ail. You cannot dispose of property by any game in which the contestant
pays money. That sort of thing is done in
Louisiana; but I am speaking of a different
case. The amendment I have proposed is
clear and fair.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am quite satisified with the armendment proposed by
the honourable gentleman from Sheldiac
(Hon. Mr. McDonald), except as to the
words "mixed chance and skill." I think
those words should not be in the statute
at all, and if we are logical we shall st·rike
them out of paragraph d. Yesterday we
struck out of paragraph e words which are
similar: "or other games of chance, or
mîixed chance and skili." I now propose
as a sub-amendment that the words "or
mixed chance and skill" be elininated
from paragraph d of section 14.
The
reason which I gave, and which I may be
permitted to repeat, is this, that it is a
very unsafe and uncertain thing to give
to a justice of the peace the power to determine upon any game or mode which is
a mixtu;re of chance and skill.
In my
opinion, it would take a trained Iegal mind,
a man of considerable experience on the
Bench, to determine where chance ends
and skill begins, or vice versa. I think it
is a very dangerous power to give to a
judge, especially one who in this instance
is very likely to be a justice of the peace.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
On the other hand, does not my honourable friend see the difficulty in eliminating
those words when it comes to a contention
as to whether it is a game of chance or
not?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I should -think a lawyer could very easily
put up a fine argument in almost any case,
that this was. not a game of chance-that
skill was the main factor.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of course, that
would all be before the court even if those
words were s.truck out. My right honourable friend wiH; follow this closely:
Disposes of any goods, wares, or merchandise
any game or mode of chance.

Hon. Mr. CURRY: Should you not have
in it the word "purchaser?"

1

Hon. Mr. McDONALD: "In which the
contestant, competitor, or purchaser."
I
am quite willing to put in that word.

The question of chance would be before
the court, and the argument which my
right honourable friend puts in the mouth
of the able lawyer would no doubt be made.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: A man
cannot be a purchaser unless he pays.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD:
I think the
original amendment covers it: "in which
the contestant or competitor pays -money
or other valuable consideration."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suggest that the honourable gentleman see
the Law Clerk, and that we dea'l with this
to-morrow.
ion. Mr. CALDER.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But if these words remain in, the answer
could be made by the judge or the opposing lawyer: "It is true that there may be
a bit of skill in the game, but! it is mixed
vith chance; consequently there are opportunities for abuses."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
anything more convincing could be said
in support of my theory than the words

JUNE 23, 1922
of my right honourable friend. To segregate the chance from the skill would necessarily take a trained legal mind. It is a
very difficult thing to do. I am sure that
my right honourable friend, as well as myself, would have great difficulty in determining where the chance began or ended
in a given case. But if you have the word
"chance" still in the section, the whole
question is left open.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The objection that
is made to the honourable gentleman's suggestion is that it may be contended that
it was not merely chance, but a mixture

elimination of the words as suggested the
object of the clause would be defeated.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, it would not.
The judge who hears the case will have to
determine whether it is chance or not. We
do not intend to punish skill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will the
honourable gentleman be good enough to
read the clause as he proposes it?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
(d) Disposes of any goods, wares or merchandise by any game or mode of chance.

And I propose the elimination of the
words, "or mixed chance and skill", because
the object of this clause is not to punish
skill; it is to prevent lotteries, or games
or modes of chance, and the magistrate
who hears the case will have ultimately to
decide whether or not it is a game or mode
of chance. If there is an element of skill
in it, and if we leave in those words, it will
be for the magistrate to decide which element of the mixture predominates, whether
it is the chance or the skill.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I would withdraw my amendment if the amendment
proposed by the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) is carried,
because it covers my point. In the next
paragraph (e) we eliminated yesterday the
words "or mixed chance and skill". Why
should we not do likewise with this paraThe object is to eliminate the

gambling.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is the gambling
part we are after.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
now the memorandum which I had before
me, but I believe that if those words are
taken out we may as well strike out paragraph e completely.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not at all. The
whole thing is there.

565

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My recollection is that the form of the amendment
was to cover the game of mixed chance
and skill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If I remember
correctly, the honourable gentleman, in referring the other day to a memorandum in
his possession, intimated that the prosecution of a particular case had failed because
of the existence of a doubt as to whether
the case in point was chance or skill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You do not want
a conviction in a case of that kind. Surely
that is not what is wanted.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The purpose of
this legislation was to remedy the defect
or difficulty that was found in a particular
case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
it should be remedied.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I understand the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa objects to the words "chance and skill"; he
says the magistrate will not be able to
distinguish between them. Why not leave
them both in? Then the magistrate will not
have to distinguish.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think the paragraph is workable as it is.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: We are making
a law against betting.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand the
Department of Justice had in mind specific
practices that were to be guarded against,
and these practices cannot be reached because it can be contended that they involve partly chance and partly skill. That
was the purport of the memorandum read
by the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). If that is so, the amendment
proposed would entirely defeat the object
of the Bill; the Department of Justice
could not achieve its purpose at all. It
may be objectionable to touch skill, but if
it bas to be touched in order to reach
certain parties we shall have to touch it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suggest to my honourable friend that he consult the Department of Justice, and we can
then deal with the question. We are not
making any headway.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate on the motion for the third reading
of the Bill was adjourned.
OPIUM AND NARCOTIC DRUG BILL
FURTHER

MONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 137. an Act to amend the Opium

SENATE
and Narcotie Drug Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
On section 5-no appeals:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Hon. Mr.
Willoughby moves, seconded by Hon. Mr.
MeMeans, that this section be struck out.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand moves in amendment
to substitute for 10A the following:
10A. Except in cases tried before two justices
of the peace, sections seven hundred and fortynine to seven hundred and sixty, inclusive, and
subsection two of section seven hundred and
sixty-nine of the Criminal Code shal not apply
to any conviiction, order or proceedingis in
respect of any offence under paragraph (e) of
subsection two of section 5A of this Act.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I do not quite
understand what would be the effect of
that amendment. The motion is to strike
out the clause.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If this clause is
struck out, then there is no appeal?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There will be
appeal from decisions of justices of the
peace.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I mean, if
the amendment proposed by the honourable
gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) is carried. Its object is to
give an appeal in all cases; and if it is
carried, it will limit the appeals to certain
cases.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will not
limit the appeal on points of law; but it
will limit the appeal on points of fact,
except in cases tried before justices of the
peace.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
cases are tried by justices of the peace
there will be appeal allowed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In
other cases not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: In Ontario
a police magistrate has the same jurisdiction as two justices of the peace. Is it
contended that if a trial takes place before
a police magistrate, the amendment which
the honourable gentleman has nmoved will
have effect, that is, that there will be no
appeal from his decision?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There will be
no appeal on questions of fact.
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: There will
still be an appeal on a question of law?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There will.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Then, am I
correct in understanding that the amendment takes the place of subsection 10A
as it appears here?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, it is a
substitute clause.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not certain,
but I do not think you can get a stated
case in some of the provinces when the trial
has taken place before two justices of the
peace or a magistrate. If that is so, there
will be no appeal whatever.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amendment specifically allows an appeal.
It
says:
Except in cases tried before two justices of
the peace, sections 749 to 760, inclusive, and
subselction 2 of section 769 of the Criminal
Code shall not apply to any conviction, order,
or proceedings in respect of any offence under
paragraph e of subsection 2 of section 5A of
this Act.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend does not quite understand the point.
He says that whilst there will be no appeal
on the facts there will be an appeal by
way of a stated case, if the case bas been
tried before two justices of the peace or a
police magistrate. I do not think there is
any possibility of getting a stated case
from two justices of the peace or a police
magistrate.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: There is an appeal
to the county judge.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That would be saying that the criminal law is insufficient,
because the purport of the amendment is
not to amend the law, except in regard to
judgments rendered by magistrates.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Justices of the
peace are sometimes called magistrates. In
Ontario the power of a police magistrate
is equal to that 'of two justices of the peace,
so we have to make a distinction between
magistrates and justices of the peace.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I must say that I
do not like this provision at all. I think
the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) and also the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) stated the conditions that
exist in Western Canada. We have out
there, in towns like Battleford, Moosomin
and Yorkton, magistrates two of whom will
sit upon these cases. In very many in-

of Canada bas always provided a right to

568

SENATE

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The amendment reads:
Except in cases tried before two justices of
the peace.
That is really not applicable to ninetenths of the cases that may be tried in
the province of Ontario. In the larger
places in Ontario the cases are tried before police magistrates, and this would cut
out any appeal from them. In my opinion,
cases which come under this Act should
be allowed to stand in just tne same position as other cases, and that the appeals
coming under sections 749 ta 76) should
be permitted. Why should we make this
Act different from the ordinary law of the
land? Surely people who may be convicted
under this law should have the same rights
that other people have. As I pointed out
when this matter was up before, you not
only cut out the right of appeal of the
accused, but also of the Crown. I think
you should leave the clause out.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand was negatived: yeas, 17; nays,

THIRD READING

Bill 137, an Act to amend the Opium

CANADA TEMPERANCE ACT
FURTHER CONiSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
AND REPORTED

Th Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 132, An Act to amend the Canada
Temperance Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved that the
following be added as section 4:
That the provisions of sections 157, 158 and

163 shall not agppily to any sale, purchase,
deýlivery, or transport into, througih or out of
the province of any intoxicating liquor authorized by or under any provincial law, order or
regulation.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Perhaps my honourable friend will just
tell us what would happen if that were not
moved.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What would happen would ibe this, that no one could either
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

import or export intoxicating liquor or
carry it through the province for medical
or sacramental purposes, as it would be
an offence under this Act to do so. It is
in order to get over that difficulty that I
am moving this amendment.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But section 157 bas relation to export only
-nothing
else.
Simply, after certain
things have taken place, it forbids the
export.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to guard
against that. Suppose a distiller in Ontario
wishes to export to some other province
intoxicating liquor for medical or sacramental purposes, we surely do not want to
prevent that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But section
157, which we are enacting, declares that
it does not apply to brewers and distillers.
It distinctly says "other than brewers and
distillers".
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be so.
I did not take that meaning. The other
one is section 158; that would prevent the
carrying of intoxicating liquor through the

Province for the purposes I have stated.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then clearly it does not touch 157?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It may not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not think it would touch 158 either, because
this section deals exclusively with liquor for
exportation, the intention being that it
should remain in the province, and only be
handed over to the carrier. That is to say,
it is brought into the province for purposes of exportation, and it remains undisturbed until it is delivered to the carrier
for transportation out of the province. So
it seems to me that this is not the class of
liquor which my honourable friend may
have in view.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend means that the people I have in mind
need no protection?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The general law covers the purpose my honourable
friend bas in view. This Bill deals only
with two provinces-British Columbia and
Quebec. Provision is already made as to
the other ýprovinces. These are importation clauses, and they only affect those two
provinces.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend think that the provisions of this
Act have no application whatever except

JUNE 28, 1922
to importing into or exporting out of the
province?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, tbat is
ail.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And it would not
in any way affect the sale or disposai of
intoxicating liquor as permitted by the
different provinces?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; that
is already provided for.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 think that is
right. I withdraw the amendmnent.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Belcourt was

Hon. Mr. PARDEE: I fbeg to move the

so may be done. In the opinion of a great
many people, that would contemplate a
measure of confiscation of tbe liquor that
is already now stored-and legally stored,
I take it-In theprovince of Saskatchewan.
In order to avoid that, and in view of the
fact that thoselipeople, as I judge from the
discussions I have heard in this House, have
liquor legally in. their possession, I think it
is only rîght that we should name some certain time in order that they niay have a
chance of disposing 0f that liquor prior to
the time when the Order in'Council cornes
into force.
My amendment gives tbree
inonths to those people ýwho have liquor
stored in their expert warehouses to dispose
Somnething was said bere
f that liquor.
to the effect that any extension granted to
those people to dispose of that liquor would
mean that bootlegging iwould rua rampant.
Against that contention it appears to me
that unless such time is givea to those
jeople-who, II repeat, have this liquor
1egally in their possession under the laws
of the province--it .will mean that, if there
is to be an attempted confiscation of that
liquor, those people who, ne<w hold it will take
very good pains to get rid of -it locally before the time when the Order in Council is
passed; that it will be stored through the
whole prtvinee, and that thereby bootlegging will be given very rn-uch of a lift, inrtead of the obnoxious practice ;being

stopped.. If we give those people the right
to dispose of tbis liquor within the time
stated, enablinig them to seil it in Europe
or in other miarkets where it is purchasabie,
we wuruld )be doing not only justice to the
province of Saskatchewan, but also to the
men who are making the application, and
saying that their rights are being prejudiced by an Order in 'Council 'bein-g passed

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Has my honourable friend verified the statement nmade in
fhis House, that the provincial government
has received money from these vendors by
way of license and tax?
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: No,'but that is as I
uaderstand it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: While
it is not unreasonable that a period should

provides, that:
The Governor in Council may by Order in

narned in such Order.

That is to say, you bave -suspended the

say that the Order in Council in question

that would appeal to the judigment 0f this
House.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUiRT: That might bie
considerably worse; the Order in Councîl
m.îght not be passed for three months.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In any
jvent, if we suspend the operation of this
measure for three months, the Governmemt
need nlot necessarily bring it into operation
for a year. 'They bave full discretion, under this language, to embody in, that Order
in Council such time as nxay seem wise to
them to bring the 'Order in -Council into
coperation.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: It bas been repeatedil stated' on the floor of this House
that this wa-s the will of the province of
Saskatchewan. If that is so, can it be
possible that the Giovernor in Council would
practically flout the will of -the people of

570

SENATE

that province as expresso through an
application from their own Government
for bringing into force this very provision?
It appears to me that the people, through
the- Govern.ment, arel speaking, and no
Government here would attempt, nor we>uld
the Qovernor in Council, to hold Up SUCli
an application, but woudld immediately give
them the relieff they ask for.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
answer to that is that by circuimscribing
the, time we are flouting the will of the
people of Saskatchewan, if there is anything in that.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: No, not at ail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me this Act can scarcely be made sub.iect to any abuse. In the first (place, the
initiative .must be taken by the Provincial
Government, and until the Lieutenant-Governor -asks for this prohibition to be into
force the, export warehouses in those provinces will reniain undisturbed. In the
next place, the fullest discretion is given
to the. Governor General in Council as to
the tume when the Order in Council adopting the prohibition shail be put into force.
In addition to that you propose adding
three months to those other two discretions
that' may be exercised, one by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and the other by
the Governor in Council. But it seems Wo
,me that, if my bonourable friend would
say that the three months' period should
be fixed by the Order in Council, Vhat
would be sufficient.

Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: They were heard.
They had no objection to the draft regulations wbich were prepared by the Department, after consultation with them and
ail the interested parties, but they were
jealous of their entire liberty and desirous
of preventing the principle of regulation
from being adopted at ail; but the Committee came to the conclusion that Parliament had already, four or five years ago,
adopted a Bill regarding a certain kind
of matchesHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: White

He said: This legiclation je a forward
step and will give much greater control
to the Department of Finance. The inspection of these companies will afford considerable added security to the public and
will mean as much control as that which is
exercised over *insurance companies.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That may be very true, but what strikei
me as peculiar is this. The Senate sends a

Bill to a Committee; the Committee makes
its report, and, without its being allowed
to lie on the Table for a single sitting, we
are asked to vote upon it. Not a single one
of us knows what is in it, except honourable members who have been in the Committee. That is a speedy way of passing

rnany members of the Senate have made
their engagements for to-morrow. The

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps rny
honourable friend will give us an idea of
how rnuch work remains to be done in the

accordingly with respect to our own sittings.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable

will be possible or not to have prorogation on Monday or Tuesday. The Government measures will ail be through the

this evening.
Hon. Mr. BELýCOURT: Does it ail depend on that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 see
no particular reason, honourable gentlemen,
why we should recklessly hasten through
the public business because the House of
Commons is approaching the termination
of its business. It is only reasonable that
we take adequate time, after the House of
Commons gets through its business, to
deal with the matters which corne before
the Senate. If we try to keep pace with
them, to march step by step with them, it
will simply mean that for ail tine we

in taking a holiday to-morrow, in the last
days of the Session. I am flot; asking that
the House sit on Sunday.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
the whole of next week before us. I am
not finding fault with the Government,
but we must be given sufficient; time to consider our business properly, and, as my
honourable friend did not give any intimation that to-morrow would be taken, engagements have been made, and very properly so, by honourable members who
thought they would be at liberty to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Senate
has not been overworked these last two or
three months.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We have made
up for it in the hast three or four days.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We must
also remember that the whole budget is

SENATE

a unique position. So strongly marked is
his personality that he is to-day acclaimed as the most popular personage in the
Empire to which we belong. His visit to
the different British Dominions is regarded generally by British subjects as
being one of the most interesting events in
the experience of the Royal Family. He
bas not only evoked feelings of loyalty and
patriotism, but has also struck a note of
the deepest sentiment in every part of the
Empire that he has visited. Though the
possessions of the Crown lie on every sea
and extend to all parts of the civilized
world, yet those distant and widely
separated parts, those outlying posts of
Empire, have been strengthened in their
loyalty to the Empire by the visit of bis
Royal Highness.
I need not refer to the gallantry of
His Royal Highness in the late Great
War. There was no soldier who participated in those battles of the Empire in
France and Flanders who conducted himself more gallantly or with greater bravery
than, his Royal Highnes's. He did not seek
to protect himself in any way by the position which he occupied as a member of the
reigning family of Great Britain. He
courted danger and established for himself
a reputation of gallantry and courage not
exceeded by any soldier in the Empire.
I know of no member of the Royal
Family who bas exhibited in greater
degree the peculiarly democratic spirit of
the times than has the Prince of Wales.
Wherever he bas gone he bas mingled
freely with the people. He bas not regarded himself as one who should be
isolated from the sympathies and touch of
the common people, but bas gone in and out
amongst them. He bas, indeed, regarded
himself as practically one of the people
of the Empire in bis communication with
them. I trust that the reigning King may
be long spared to fill the position which
he so worthily occupies to-day as head of
the State of which we are a part; but
when the time comes for him to lay down
the sceptre, I am satisfied that, if His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales shall
be then living and shall enter upon the
important duties and great responsibilities
of state which will then be bis lot, there
will be in the history of Great Britain no
more popular monarch gracing the throne
of this great Empire than His Royal
Highness the present Prince of Wales.

CANADA TEMPERANCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 132, An Act to amend the
Canada Temperance Act.
He said: I asked that the third reading
be not taken before this morning, because
I wanted to examine into the question
raised by the honourable Senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor).
The
dlaim made by the British Columbia Government was that, inasmuch as the Crown.
in the right of the province of British Columbia, was directly importing liquor to be
sold in the province, it was free from Customs duties, and the honourable gentleman
stated that that dlaim was before the
Exchequer Court of Canada. 1 find that
chapter 15 of the statutes of 1917 contains
the affirmation by this Parliament of the
right to levy Customs duties upon goods
imported by the Crown, whether in the
right of the Dominion of Canada or of
the Provinces. The section reads as follows:
(3) The rates and duties of Customs lmposed by this Act or the Customs Tariff or any

575

other law relating to the Customs,, as well as
the rates and duties of customs heretofore imposed -by any Customs Act or Customs Tariff
or any laW relatlng to the C.ustoins enacted and
In force at any tMme since the fIrst day of
July, one thousand eight hundred and sixtyseven , shall be binding, and are declared and
shall be deemed to have been aiways blnding
upon and payable by Ris Majesty, in respect of
any goods which may be hereaiter or have been
heretofore imported by or for Ris Majesty,
whether in the right of Ris Majesty's Government of Canada or His Majesty's Government of
any province of 'Canada, and whether or not the
goods so imported belonged at thù time of lmportation to Ris Majesty; and any and ail suoh
Acts as aforesaid shall be construed and Interpreted as if the rates and dutiep of Customs
aforesaid were and are by rzxPress words
charged upon and made Payable by His
Majesty: Provided, however, that nothing hereIn contalned is intended to impose or to declare
the im~position of any tax u.pon, or to makre or
to declare hiable to taxation, any property behngoing to Ris .Majesty eithe'r In the right of
Canada or of a province.

0f course, a distinction was made beween the taxation of property belonging
-o the provinces and the right to levy duties
in goods importeçi by the provinces. I quite
recognize that the affirmation of that right
by the Parliament of Canada does not
judicial]y settie the point raised by the
Province of British Columbia, and which
may be raised by the other provinces. But,
snice that right is challenged, and since
the Bill now before us provîdes for limiting the importation of liquor into the provinces, it follows that, if the contention
raised by British Columbia was upheld,
we should be deprived of the right to
levy Customs duties upon the goods imported by that province, which would in
consequence have a monopoly of the importation of such goods. Therefore I think
it is 'but just that we add to this Bill the
following clause, as subsection 7 of section
163:
(7) 7 Nothwithstanding the provisions of
paragraph a of subsection 2 of section 163 of
this Part,
Whenever the authority of the Parliament
of 'Canada to impose any rate or duty of Customs in re!ýpect of any goods imported by or
for Ris Majesty in the right of His Majesty's
Government of any province of Canada, or the
authority of His Majesty's Government of
Canada to collect such rate or duty, is denied
by Ris 7dajesty's Government of that province,
the Gorvernor in Council may by proclamation
Published in The Canada Gazette(a) refuse to deolare the prohibitions of subsection 1 of this section to be in force In that
province; or,
(b) in the case of those Prohibitions havlng
been 'brought Into force in that province, revoke the proclamation bringing them into force
t'herein, in which case those prohibitions shail
cease to ha In force therin, or suspend the
aperation of those prohibitions for such time,
and from time to time, as the Governor In
Council thlnks proper.

away and play this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend's duty is to remain with
us.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
particularly as he is such an apostle of
temperance.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But I insist on
my right: I gave the first notice of amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend's amendment may come in due
time. We will dispose of this one now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have right of
way. Why should I lose ny right of way?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I move, in amendment to the amendment, that section 3
be stricken out.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, it seens to me that
the reasonable course to take is this. This
is a Government Bill. Let the Government finish its Bill, and complete it with
the assent of the Senate in the way it desires, and when it is a completed Bill, on
the motion for third reading my honourable friend from British Columbia can
move that it be not now read the third
time, and his amendment would then come
in. In the sane way my honourable
friend from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) could move his amendment. But
I think we ought to have the completed
will of the Government expressed in the
Bill before we come to the amendments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point
out that the motion was made by Hon.
Mr. Dandurand, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Watson, that the Bill be now read the
third time.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
He surely does not want it read the third
time before it is completed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The amendment was moved by Hon. Mr. Pardee.
The proHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cedure is to move the third reading, and
Hon. Mr. Pardee moves that the Bill be
not now read the third time, and submits
the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think the
regular procedure would be, the leader of
the Government having moved the third
reading, and the Hon. Mr. Pardee having
moved an amendment, that the honourable
member for Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
should propose his sub-amendment, and
we should vote on that, and then vote on
the amendment to the main motion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And
particularly because if the sub-amendment
is carried, it would render unnecessary
the other.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I now beg, honourable gentlemen, to move in amendment
that section 3 be struck out. That section
embodies Part V, which includes the amendment of the honourable gentleman from
Lambton (Hon. Mr. Pardee). If my proposed amendment carries, his amendment
goes by the wall.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point
out to the honourable gentleman that that
is not an amendment to the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I submit that
it is, Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman from Lambton is to add a new section
to Part V. Section 3 is the section which
brings the whole of Part V into effect, and
if section 3 goes out iny honourable friend's
amendment goes with it.
The whole
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the second part of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Exactly.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: After the
House has disposed of the amendment of
the honourable gentleman from Lambton
(Hon. Mr. Pardee), the honourable gentleman can move his amendment.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Pardee was agreed to.

JUNE 24, 1922
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
Now, Mr.
Speaker, I move that the Bill not now
r ai the third time, but that section 3 be
struck out. That is the part which deals
with the prohibition of importation into
provinces which have a system of Government control of the sale of liquor for
beverage purposes. I do not think there
:s any necessity to discuss the matter further, as it has already been discussed very
fully.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The amendment
does not cover the first part of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: No, it does not
tcuch 'that.
The Senate -d-ivided on the proposed
amendment of Hon. Mr. Barnard, and the
same was agreed to on the fol.lowing division:

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I now move my
amendment:
That the Bill be not now read the third time,
but that It be amended by adding the following:
Upon the receipt by the Secretary of State
of Canada of a duly certified copy of an order
of the Lieutenant-Governor In Council of any
province praying that local option he granted to
a province to prohibit the manufacture of in-

toxicating liquor in a province the Governor
in Council may by proclamation published in
the Canada Gazette declare that such province
in granted local provincial option to prohibit the
manufacture of intoxicating liquor In that province.

That will come after section 162.
Nothing could be clearer than that. It
simply means that nothing can be done
except on thé initiative of a province.
Take Saskatchewan, for instance. We
have heard! -a great deal about the will of
the people in favour of prohibition in that
province. Well, any one to-day.can go to
the proper department and get a license
to erect a distillery in the province of
Saskatchewan.
I defy contradiction of
that statehment. If I am wrong, I want to
oe corrected. Is that what the members
from Saskatchewan want? If they vote for
this amendment, the minute the Government of Saskatchewan notifies the Federal
Government in the proper way of its intention to have local prohibition of the manufacture of liquor in that province, no
distilleries can be ereted in that province.
It is up to the members from Saskatchewan, particularly the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willougly),
who takes a particular interest in this
question, to say whether they want the
manufaicture. They have had enough
trouble with these warehouses which they
have spoken about. Who put them there?
They are licensed by the Federal Government. The question I had on the Order
Paper yesterday had the same effect.
Bonded warehouses for the export of intoxicating liquor were' licensed during the
past year against the protest of our province. It is not right.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It is not right.
This was at the request of the Saskatchewan Government.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What would you
think, honourable gentlemen, of a municipal council who voted against a by-law
giving that council the option to prohibit
houses of prostitution or bawdy houses in
their district? What would you think of
their sincerity or virtue if they said:
"We will not agree to .that action"? Yet
we are in a similar position. What would
you think of that municipal council if the
explanation was: "We do not use these
places ourselves: we keep them for
strangers"? I would like to know what is
the difference between such a council and
a province which manufactures something
it does not want to drink, but manufactures
it for strangers-for export?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It is nothing like that
in Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No question of
filthy lucre should enter into this matter.
This is a question of principle. The Government of the various provinces will, no
doubt, deal properly with such interests
as at present exist, if there are any.
I will not take up the time of this House,
but I would remind honourable gentlemen:
"qui facit per alium facit per se"-which
simply means that what you do by another
If by your ' vote
you do yourself.
to-day you perpetuate the manufacture in
the various provinces, nolens volens, so
far as the provinces are concernedl, then
you are in exactly the same position as
the people who are making the whisky,
because you are doing it through their
agency. When -the records are looked up
in the future, it will be seen that in the
year 1922, in the month of June, one man
had the courage to rise in his place in this
House and say: You may vote for the
manufacture of liquor or you may not, but

you must remember one thing: you cannot serve God and Mammon at the same
time. You can no longer fold your arms
and say you are for prohibition if you
perpetuate the manufacture of wh-i#ky. It
is for honourable members of this House
now to show who are the real friends of

temperance.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I would draw my honourable friend's attention to his resolution. I am, of course,
as everyone knows, in favour of the prohibition of importation, manufacture, and sale
of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes. My honourable friend's resolution,
I think, goes too far. He would prevent
the manufacture of alcohol in this country for the thousand and one other purposes, including motive power, for which it
is necessary now and will be more necessary in the future. I think he ought to

limit his amendment by inserting

after

the word "manufacture" in the third line
the words "for beverage purposes".
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

I accept that.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And then, in the last line, before "manu-

facture", strike out the word "the" and
substitute the word "such".
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
accept those amendments.

Certainly.

I

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, I second the motion of my honourable
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

friend from De Launadière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain), and I do it cheerfully, because
the Province of Nova Scotia already prohibits the distillation and also the sale of
intoxicating liquor. We cannot expect other
provinces to rise immediately to the high
standard in morals and ethics of the province of Nova Scotia. However, I hope
that the result shown in the province of
Nova Scotia will induce other provinces to
adopt its policy.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend who introduced this amendment is, I think, going
a little more rapidly than the policy of the
Federal Government would warrant in connection with prohibition legislation.
I
think it has been the custom of the Federal
Government to endeavor to enact such
enabling legislation as was necessary to
give effect to the expressed will of the
people in the various provinces.
This

amendment is a step in advance of that,
as it indicates, to the people of the province
what the Federal Government is prepared
to do. In other words, it invites them to
take a particular line of action. I do not
object to my honourable friend raising his
voice in this House, or anywhere else that
he sees fit, to endeavour to concentrate as

far as possible the industrial activity of
Canada in his native province.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Shame! Shame!
I rise to a point of order. The honourable
gentleman has no right to attribute motives, and especially motives that are absolutely false-no right; and I ask for
your ruling, Mr. Speaker.
Let the honourable gentleman read the rules. None
of that! None of that!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honour gives his ruling-

Before His

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Wait a moment.
You cannot speak until then.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was going
to make a statement. I simply stated that
I had no objection to my honourable friend
doing such a thing. If he thinks he is not
doing it, then I have nothing more to say
about it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have no objection to the former part of the resolution.
But there is one part to which I cannot
assent, and it is this.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I sat down
in anticipation of the Speaker giving a
ruling on the point of order. I had not
finished.

JUNE 24, 1922
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Let the Chair
rule.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I understand
the honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) to say that he did
not impute motives to the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Very well. Then
let him not do it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am seriously
of the opinion, honourable gentlemen, that
it is not becoming in the Fderal Parliament to pass legislation which, in any case,
certainly invites public opinion to take a
certain view of a question, in anticipation
of asking the Federal Governinent to enact
legislation of this kind. I think that,
while it is a matter that should probably
be given serious consideration by this
House at any time that a province may ask
for such power, yet until such a request is
received from a province, it is unbecoming
in the Federal Parliament and unnecessary
for us to go to this extent.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I rise to say that I canfiot give a
silent vote on this motion. I am not against
the former part of the motion, but the
motion implies the power of the Federal
Parliament to deal with the prohibition of
the manufacture of intoxicating liquor in
a province. That is not within the four
corners of the constitution. I claim-and I
think it cannot be disputed-that it is the
privilege of a province to prohibit or to
allow the manufacture of liquor. The
Government of Canada has no power at
all in that respect. The moment that a
province permits the manufacture of
liquor, then the Parliament of 'Canada
has the right to issue a license and compel
the manufacturer to take a license, for
the purpose of raising revenue. But as far
as the manufacture of liquor is concerned,
that is within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the province. Therefore, these words should
be struck out: "to prohibit the manufacture of intoxicating liquor in that
province." It is the province alone that can
prohibit that.
Hon. Mr. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
there is another phase of this question
that I. should like to present before the vote
is taken. I do so because there is a distillery in. the constituency in which I live.
As I understand this amendment, if it
were carried the province could then pass
an Order in Council asking that the prohibition of manufacture in that particular
province be granted.
S-371

57î

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Not by Order
in Council.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The option only.
Hon. Mr. REID: They would ask this
Government, and the Government here
would pass the Order in Council if they
so desired.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Giving them the
option.
Hon. Mr. REID: Giving them the option.
The question at once arises: if you do
that, is it fair to prohibit, or close out and
destroy, an industry without compensation? The jurisdiction is entirely under the
Dominion Parliament. Suppose the province
->f Ontario were to ask the Dominion.
Government to prohibit the manufacture?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is not it.
Hon. Mr. REID: Well, I have just read'
the amendment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: iThis Government simply grants the option; then
Ontario can do as it chooses. If it finds
that it is costing too much money, and it
would sooner have the moneyHon. Mr. REID: Admitting the position.
taken by the honourable gentleman, the
question of compensation then comes up.
Those industries were established under
the laws of the Dominion of Canada, and
if we give the province that power it
might refuse to compensate. And what
would be the result? Take the province of
Ontario. There is in my constituency a
distilling industry in which every dollar
of the owners is invested. There are at
Belleville millions of dollars invested in
a similar industry there. There is in
Toronto another large industry. There is
one at Waterloo, and one at Windsor, or
Walkerville. Are we going to give up our
right in regard to industries that have
been honestly operating under our laws,
and give to the province, as suggested by
my honourable friend in moving his
amendment, power to wipe out those industries without any compensation whatever? I am satisfied that, if you give that
right to a province and the people must
compensate for these industries, they will
not be so anxious to pass an Order in Council to wipe them out.
Another point in connection with this
matter. What harm, are those industries
doing to a particular province? In the province of Ontario we have several very
large industries now manufacturing alcoholic liquors. Not one dollar's worth of

580

SENATE

their product is used in that province, except such as they sell direct to the provincial authorities for sale and disposal in the
province. Some of those industries are
running at their full capacity, and the
whole of their product is sold to countries
whose laws permit the use of alcoholic
liquors. These industries manufacture from
the products of our own country. The
Walker people, for instance, manufacture
rye whisky from corn. I am satisfied that
95 per cent of the corn they use is grown
right in the vicinity of Windsor.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: In Essex county.
Hon. Mr. REID: There is no reason why
that market for the farmers in that district should not be allowed to continue. The
honourable gentleman wants to destroy the
industry of the Walker people, who are
manufacturing there and shipping their
product abroad. I say that if any action is
to be taken by Parliament in the way of
giving the province the right to wipe out
those industries, then we should protect the
people who have their money invested in
them, by insisting that they be compensated, or else the Federal Government
should retain its power and assume the
responsibility for wiping out the industries
and compensating their owners.
lonHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ourable gentlemen, there is a question here
that has been raised by the honourable
member from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique), and it is a very important one.
I must say that it had always appeared to
me that the Dominion, and only the Dominion, had power to prohibit; and yet,
when one thinks of it, if the province has
not power to prohibit the manufacture of
liquor, then the Province has no power to
prohibit anything, because there is nothing peculiar about liquor in commerce any
more than about starch, or about boots, or
shoes, or anything else. Where in the
British North America Act is the right to
prohibit given to the Dominion? I would
be glad if the mover of this amendment,
whether he is sincere in his motion or not,
would point that out. If the Dominion had
the power to prohibit, then it would have the
power to prohibit all over the Dominion,
not in one province only; because the Dominion cannot prevent one province from
trading in certain articles and allow another province to trade in them. This is
not a question of temperance; this is a

question of trade.
of Canada say that all the wheat of
Canada shall be a monopoly in the province of Saskatchewan and that no other
Hon. Mr. REID.

province shall grow wheat?
Or that no
province but Quebec shall grow hay?
That is what the principle of this amendment comes down to. The Federal Parliament must prohibit either in the whole
Dominion or not at all. So my honourable
friend may find, if this amendment is
passed, that he will not get his bottle in
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am asked a
question by the honourable gentleman. He
evidently bas not read the thingHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes, I
did read it.
if
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -because,
ho bas read it, with his legal acumen he
would have made out a better case than
ho bas done. In the very first place, by
my amendment, it is not the Dominion
Government that prohibits.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes,
it is.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I see the honourable gentleman bas not read it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
the honourable gentleman bas had that
motion put into his hands and bas not
read it himself. It says the Dominion, at
the request of the province, will prohibit
it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no. The
motion was not put into my bands.
Although I am only a land surveyor, I
drafted it on this desk without showing
it to anybody. Very often amendments are
turned down; so I decided that this should
be my own. It is so clear that he who runs

province, if it likes, may ask this
Government to give it the option either to
have prohibition or not to have it. The
province may leave conditions as they are,
or it may change them. The honourable
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) knows that. Then what
does this Government do? It simply delegates its powers. I have obtained legal
opinion on this point, and I say that this
Government bas a right to delegate some
of its powers to a province.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
gentlemen,Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to say
just a word. What the honourable gentleman sitting at my right wants is thisHon. Mr. BENNETT: Does he want it?

581

JUNE 24, 1922
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -that, in any
province where prohibition is desired and
is in force, there should be no license
issued for the distilling of alcohol except
for such purposes as are properly exempted, as stated by my right honourable
friend opposite (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster). I agree with those who object
to this proposed amendment, that it goes
further. I do not think it is open to this
Parliament to declare that any province
which has accepted prohibition shall have
it. I agree with the honourable gentleman
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) and
the honourable gentlemin- from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), that it has not
the power to grant or to refuse prohibition,
but we can declare that in any province
which has adopted prohibition no license
shall be issued to brewers or distillers. I
think this amendiment can be changed to
cover that ground, and that ground only,
and thus not be open to the objection which

to cover the narrow limits of medical, sacramental or industrial purposes, as it is
only consistent that that should be done.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is perfectly well

manufacturing beer containing alcohol exceeding a certain quantity, and its right to
do that has not been and cannot be chalTf the legislature of the province

a legislature the manufacture of alcohol is
prohibited, the Dominion Parliament has the
power to require, for the purpose of revenue, that the manufacture be under
license; but it has no power to declare as
to whether alcohol shall be manufactured
or not.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I think it would
'be more consistent if the honourable gentleman had framed his amendment so that
the province of Quebec could manufacture

very inconsistent that, although a province
bas a liquor aw, yet it is bound by the law

of the Dominion Parliament to go to other
countries to purchase its liquor.

If

Saskatche'wan 'Government or any other
provincial government wants temperance
it has a perfect right to it, and, according
to what I know and have heard of the constitution of this country, only the Fedleral
Government has a right to interfere with
imports or exports of liquor.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 93, an Act to amend
the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I move that this
Bill be not now read for the third time,
but be amended by adding to paragraph
d of section 14, the following words after
the word "skill":
which the contestant or competitor pays
-in
money or other valuable consideration.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to that amendment.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It seems to me
that the addition of those words does not
mean anything, and that it is going to spoil
the section as it stands. The amendment
in paragraph d is clear and precisq as it
is, and to my mind the addition of these
words would do away with any value there
may he in the section.
The amendHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment would add to paragraph d, so that
the section would then read:
tSubsection one of section two hundred and
thirty-six of the said Act is amended by inserting the following fparagraph, immediately
after paragraph (c) thereof:"or (d) disposes of any goods, wares or merchandise by any game or mode of chance or
mixed chance and skill in which the contestant
or competitor pays money of other valuable
consideration.

Even if that amendment were not there
it would seem to be implied, at all events
it would in practice be implied, that the
one who would dispose of any goods, wares
or merohandise by any game or mode of
chance, or mixed chance and skill, would
draw some consideration therefrom. His
only objeot would be to obtain a gain
through some game or mode of chance.
So that, with those words added, we would
only be defining more exactly what a party
who would fall under this Act would aim
to do, namely, to get money or other valuable consideration. That is Why I have no
objection to adding those words. They do
not disturb the economy of the Act; they
simply express the fact that the amendment is limited to a game of chance or
skill in which the participant pays money,
because it has been alleged that there were
many advertising schemes in which the participants were net asked to give any money.
The object is to except from the operation of this clause advertising schemes in
which no immediate money return is asked
from the participants in the scheme.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I quite understand that, but it seems to me that the
added words are not applicable to that particular section, and that if you add those
words you do away with the value of the
paragraph.
Hýon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I fail
to appreciate the contention of my honourable friend from Huron (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot). The reasons advanced by the mover
of the amendment appeal to me as creating
a situation which should be protected.
For instance, a business man may dispose
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

of any of his goods so long as he does not
receive money from a game of chance or
a contest whidh he may invite. The essential evil of the present situation, as disclosed in a case mentioned by my honourable friend the leader of the Government, is this, that certain fraudulent devices are placed upon the market by which
their active promoters become the recipients of substantial sums of money, as
they induce the public to enclose with their
guesses, or with their participation in the
device, a certain sum of money. If several
hundreds or several thousands, or even a
greater number, should participate in devices of that kind, the House can understand what a very large accumulation
might proceed from that source. But what
evil could corne from our ýallowing a reputable newspaper to say, "We will give a
trip to Europe to those of our subscribers,
who make a certain guess correctly,"
so long as they do not receive any money
from it?-for that is the evil. It seems to
me it would not be right to invade such
spheres where money does not pass.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But they are
getting consideration.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Where
is the wrong? No gambling propensity is
exercised by reason thereof. If no money
is staked upon the contest, it seems to me
no evil arises. The essence of the offence
is that theý fraud presupposes a large contribution of money from the participants,
and the object is to stop those fraudulent
devices to secure money in that way.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
McDonald was agreed to.

wharf, as do the present floating fenders, except
in case of severe storms of easterly wind, when
they may become mieplaced or be carried away,
thus allowing the vessel to come in contact
with the wharf and be liable to injury. It is
to avoid this contingency and to make this berth
as secure as possible under all conditions, that it
is consIdered advisable to replace the floating
fenders by a fixed one for a length sufficient for
one vessel's Iberth.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For the purpose of obtaining information, may J inquire of the leader of the Government as
to the reason or necessity for departing
from what I think has always been the
custom of Parliament, to vote such sums
of money as are required to carry on the
public business for the period of the fiscal
year succeeding the Session of Parliament.
I understood him to say that this money
would be expended over a period of three
years. I think it would be interesting to
the House if the honourable gentleman
would tell us why that was thought necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will look at the Bill he will
find that it is not a vote of money, but
that it is simply an authorization to the
Harbour Commissioners of Quebec to issue
debentures, in order to raise that amount
of money, and th9t the debentures will
only be issued as the actual need occurs.
These debentures will be taken up by the
Finance Department when the Marine Department, which has the control of these
works, has authorized them or is satisfied
that the expenditure is necessary in order
to carry on the operations for which it is
sought to issue the debentures.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Notwithstanding that, these debentures are guaranteed
by the Government through the Department of Finance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They are
taken up; it is the Finance Department
that advances the money.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, I understand that, and that therefore Parliament
is now asked to approve appropriations
of money to be expended through the Quebec Harbour Commission for a period extending over three years. My honourable
friend perhaps may recall that when this
Bill was introduced the other day I asked
for certain information, namely, to what
extent the present facilities for the handling
of traffic through the port of Quebec were
utilized or whether they had been utilized up
to the present time. If they have, I
think it would be interesting to the House
to have more detailed information of the
necessity of spending the amount referred
to, particularly No. 2, for the extension of
lion. Mr. DANDURAND.

walls, and so on, for the accomodation of
more ships.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend that no farther back
than last week there were transatlantic
steamships which were unable to get
berths because all facilities were in use
at the time. I myself a few weeks ago saw
a considerable line of transatlantie steamers
waiting. There were two C.P.R. steamers
of the largest type, and two of the White
Star Line, I think, although my recollection is not clear on that point. Many of
the ships that come up to Montreal are
obliged to stop at Quebec, and two of those
ships that came in could not be accommodated because the facilities where they
could have berthed were already occupied.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, I have a very unpleasant duty to
perform, but, as I believe it is my duty,
I will do it, even if I make enemies. I
draw the attention of this House to item
No. 17: Parc St. Charles Company. It
will be within recollection of the right
honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) that there was a
big row about this very item in the other
House last year, and that the then Minister of Justice was compelled, if I remember correctly, to drop it. Am I right in
that?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
No, not quite. If my honourable friend
will allow me to explainHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Leaving all the anterior circumstances
aside, it is known, I suppose, to both sides
of the House that there was a claim, that
there was an arbitration, and that there
was a resultant judgment given, and consequently a liability established. An item
was put in the Estimates to cover that
amount. That was in the later days of
the Session, just before prorogation, and
when the item came to be discussed in the
House the present Speaker of the House
of Commons made the statement that the
money which was supposed to come from
that vote had already been expended in
the Yamaska election, that the same
should never have been allowed, and that
it would be a public scandal to allow it
to pass. Upon which the leader of the
Government immediately rose, and said
that under such an allegation made by a
member of Parliament he would strike out
the vote, but that he would also make pro-

JUNE 24, 1922
vision by which, either before a judge or
a comanissioner-and it was a judge-an
investigation should be held into the whole
thing, and that the member making the
accusation or any other person who wished
to support it would be able to appear to
establish the fraud or the wrong if there
was one; he would not allow the item to
pass until such an investigation had been
made. It was dropped. The court was
constituted, but the accuser in the House
of Commons refused to appear before the
court, saying, I believe, that he would prefer to go before a Committee of the
House. The court met, but there were
no accusers and there was no case tried.
There it remains. It appears that the
present Government purpose paying it.
No. I beg
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my right honourable friend's pardon.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I withdraw that and let what I have
staied go as my explanation to my honourable friend.
The details
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the projected expenditure of $1,500,000
came from the Quebec Harbour Commissioners themselves. Since the question is
raised, I desire to state that the situation
is ýat this moment a somewhat difficult
one. The question was brought up last
year, and is now raised again. Parliament is confronted with a judgment, which
has been confirmed by an arbitration which
took place, respecting the claim of persons
who represented that they had suffered
damages by the dredging in the St. Charles
river. An arbitrator was appointed and
a report was made, which was homologated or confirmed by the -court, and the
Quebec Harbour Commissioners, I understand, are paying interest on the amount
of the judgment. They have not been able
to pay the amount, because they have not
the money. If the items mentioned in this
statement pass unchallenged, I take it for
granted that, provided the necessary
authorization is ôbtained from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, that
judgment will be discharged.
What is the
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
amount?
$51,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And some odd
dollars.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As a member
of Parliament I should oppose the payment of this sum if we could avoid paying
it-il the matter could4 be reopened in

some way or other. My objection goes
back to the inception of the claim. My
grievance is against the Harbour Commissioners of Quebec and against the Department of Marine and Fisheries if the
Department has anything to do with the
matter, or any control over the Harbour
Commissioners' actions. The Government
decided to dredge the mouth of the St.
Charles river, just below the city of
Quebec, where the water at high tide
covers considerable low-lying land to the
right of the mouth of the St. Charles river,
and renders the land absolutely useless.
My grievance is that the Harbour Commissioners, or the Department of Marine
and Fisheries did not approach the owners
of those lands that are submerged at every
tide by-how many feet of water?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Twenty feet of
water at high tide.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -by ten or
fifteen feet of water, and ask them if they
would agree to allow the dredging on part
of the land that came to albout the centre of
the river, in order that when a retaining
wall were erected, thousands of feet
or hundred's of acres of land, \which
were not then worth one cent a foot, might
become valuable. Any man in ordinary
business would have done that. The idea
of spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars to dkredge a shallow river where the
tide covers nine-tenths of the land on both
sides, and' espeicially to the right, for perhaps a mile, and laying themselves open to
a claim for damages when the effect of
these works was to enhance the value of
the lands for the future, passes my comI have not yet had an explanprehension.
ation of the absence of forethought in starting dredging operations at that place without taking the natural precaution of saying to the owners: "Will you give us free

nel?
putting up walls and making valuable tens
of thousands of feet of land that are now
I may say that,
absolutely worthless."
speaking with a certain sense of responsibility, as representing the Government, I
will not allow that amount to be paid until
the Department o'f Justice has declared that
we are confronted with the obligation of
paying the amount and there is no possibility of shaking off that responsibility.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
But my honourable friend will see that that

is exactly what was done. That is exactly

586

SENATE

what the Department had concluded
that we were up against-the fact that it
was an award; that it was an award which
was approved by a judge; and that that
money was due and should be paid.
The
Department of Justic does not need to be
consulted by my honourable friend. The
Department of Justice is on record on that
very question, and its record is that that
was something due, no matter what were
the anterior circumstances.
They had
nothing to do with the claim as it then
appeared.
That was the condition then,
and it is the same now.
But the matter
became one of public notoriety.
It was
ventilated in the House of Commons, in
which an absolutely definite, unqualified
charge was made 'by one of the most important members of the Liberal party. The
charge was that this was a fraudulent
transaction, and that it was meant to meet
the expenses of a party election; that the
money had already been spent in Yamaska
and the reimbursement was to come from
that vote.
Now, before this guaranteed
vote of $1,500,000 is paid, it is necessary,
I think, that that charge should at least be
disproved.
It is not fair.
We must play
fairly, one party with another, and it is
not fair that the party now out of power
should be left under that implication and
charge, and no attempt be made either
to prove it or disprove it, and that therrnoney
should be paid in the meantime. I think
my honourable friend should conduct an investigation and disprove that charge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.
My honourable friend vill realize that the charge
was made in the other Chamber and that it
was not made by myself.
So I was not au
fait.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But my honourable friend is standing for
the Government here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but I
may say that that item ap-peared in a
special su.pplementary vote in the closing
hours of last Session, and that the honourable gentleman who objected when he saw
that item going through at that time was
informed that the Department of Marine
and Fisheries had strenuously refused up
to that moment to pay the amount or consent to its being paid. I think that some
one did ask for a copy of the record to be
laid on the Table of the House. I do not
remember whether the Government complied with the motion and deposited the record or not. However, I think the record
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

will bear out my statement that the Department of Marine and Fisheries persistently refused to pay the amount, and that
explains why the judgment rendered a year
or two before had never been paid.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I presume that at the worst, or at the best
-whichever you may call it-if the present Government pay that sum of money,
they thereby deny that there was any
truth or substance in the charge made
in the last days of the last Parliament.
Surely the present Government would not
pay $50,000 or $60,000 for the purpose
of debauching an electorate. Consequently,
if the money is paid by my honourable
friend or his Government, after what bas
taken place, it will be a complete exoneration on the part of the present Government of the parties charged, as they were
charged during the last hours of last
Session.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Honourable
gentlemen, I was Chairman of the Harbour Commission at the time that this
award was made, and I think it is due to
myself to give to this House a few words
of explanation. The .dredging was not
done by the Commission of which I was
Chairman; it was done by the former Commission, ýheaded by Sir William Price.
During the time I was Chairman, and, I
think, prior to that, a claim was put in by
the St. Charles Park Company-I think
that is the name of the firm.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: La Compagnie
du Parc St. Charles.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: And with my
colleagues I refused to entertain the
claim until such time as an action was
taken in court against the Commission.
When this was done our legal advisers
looked into the matter.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is the
trouble.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: The claim
was for some 350,000 feet of land.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: For 384,000 feet.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Well, 384,000. I have not the papers before me.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have them.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Yes, my
honourable friend bas them, and he wiii
correct me if I an not absolutely right. I
did not say 350,000; I said about 350,000.
We went to the best legal advisers we had
in Quebec, and finally it was decided that,

JUNE 24, 1922
as the damage, at most, could be but a
trifle, we ought not to enter into a long
judicial contest. In a previous case between the Harbour Commission and some
shore lot owners, the Government, through
the Department of Marine and Fisheries,
had absolutely declined to interfere and
told the Comniissioners that these were
cases for them to settie. The case I have
in- mind took place, I think, under the
previous Government, the Laurier administration. My honourable friend will,
no doubt, find that in the correspondence.
The Commission therefore decided to reMany namnes were

the arbitration, unfortunately, 1 was taken.very ill; in f act, I was given up by the
doctors at that time.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It was enough
to make anybody sick.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: While I was
on my sickbed a further dlaim was put
in by the claimants for some 250,000 feet,
increasing the amount of the dlaim to
nearly double. One may prefer to settie
a small dlaim by arbitration rather than
go into a long litigation in court, but if
the dlaim is a very large one airbitration
may be refused. Our attorney objected to
the dlaim being increased, but he was ruled
out by the judge, who alluwed the increased
dlaim for alnmost double to, be put in- then
hie gave judgment against the Commission,
and, instead of it being for 380,000 feet
of land, which was the only dlaim we entertained for the arbitration, the judgment
was for almost double, because the amount
claimed *was increased after the contract.
It was only after I had resumed my duties
as Chairman of the Commission that 1
learned of this. Had I been made aware of
this at the. time, I should have refused to
go on with the arbitration for an increased
claim.
We consulted our attorneys, who were
of opinion that we would have to pay for
the first amount claimed, but not for the
amount as increased. We therefore took
up the matter wiVh the Marine Depart-

587

ment; but the law officers in that Department, or in the Department of Justice,
were of a different opinion from our attorneys: tbey advised that the fact that the
dlaim was increased in spite of our attorneys' objections, invalidated the whole procedure. Our attorneys in Quebec advised
us that if we took action to have the whole
award nullified we would be likely to lose
in Court-that it would be much better for
our Commission to effect a settiement on
the basis of the first amount claimed. The
Department of Marine and Fisheries took
the case out of our hands and we, of course,
could not then make a settlement with the
claimants. I was of opinion that we could
have settled on the basis of the first amount
claimed. The authorities in Ottawa, however, differed, and took the case away from
our Commission, and put it in the hands of
their own lawyer, Mr. Lafieur. In the
court of first instance the Marine Department -lost. They went to appeal, and lost
again. I do not remember exactly whether
the case went as far as the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, and they
won in every Court against the Harbour
Commission.
,Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: They went
to every Court and lost because our attorneys in Quebec claimed that they dîd not
go the right way about it. Instead of
admitting the award on the first clainm, they
asked that the whole award be thrown out.
In so far as the Quebec Harbour Commission was concerned. I arn sure I need not
tell this House that, neither directly nor
indirectly, was there any question of conspiracy or dishonesty in this case, as was
suggested in the other Houise. I fought
the case as bard as I could along with my
colleagues, and we waited until an action
was taken in the Superior Court against
us before we took any action whatever;
in fact, we did not even answer the first
demand. Now, it is up to, the Government
to settle this case in the best way they can.
It was taken out of our hands at a time
when, I think, we could have settled for
about haîf the amount.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This looks very
much like a real comic opera. This land
is a mudbank covered with 15 or 20 feet
of water at high tide. 11have sailed over
it nearly every day in the summer-time
during my youth. The titie came down
f rom the Kings of France who gave it to
the Jesuit Fathers, and they were not
very particular about limits in those days.

588

SENATE

They said: "You can have four leagues
deep; that will take you up to where the
mountains are in the north, and you will
start, not from this little river Lairet,
but you will start a little farther up,
and go down to the Beauport river, and
that will be the northern boundary of your
property." That was in the year 1626. They
did not think that title was good; so in
1637 there was some affirmation and some
increase in the land, and in 1651 there
was another deal, always with the Jesuits.
While the Jesuits were in possession they
sold to one Jean Trefle Rottat. I may
say that I spent the greater part of last
night studying these documents, at the
request of somebody. This Rottat is the
author of all the titles: he starts the line
of title. When he bought from the Jesuits
he bought no beach lots; he bought riparian
rights; he bought what we call utility
rights-the right to use the water to sail
on or to pass over or to fish in, but not
any proprietary
right to the bottom.
However, the bit of land seems to me to
be a sort of a mud'bank. I believe the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance),
who was Chairman of the Harbour Commissioners at the time, became very sick,
and I absolve him or the Commissioners,
or Sir William Price, of any wrong; but
the matter got into the law courts on the
question of title, and one bright day they
said, "Let us have an arbitration about
this." The arbitration went on for three
or four months, and then the claimants
asked for delay, and they raised the ante.
They were asking $96,000 for this mudbank. It was not worth 5 cents. Nobody
would have it. They never paid a cent of
taxes on it. They raised the ante from
334,000 feet to just about double. The
mudbank is big, and it is in the river;
you can call it as large as you like. What
we should have in the first place is a
survey to define the boundaries. In our
province we get two or three surveyors to
do that, for they must be defined with
great precision. That is the first thing to
be done. Some say-and it is on the record-that land is not even located where
the expropriation took place.
I know
Judge Cyrias Pelletier, a most lovable
man, but they seem to have put it all over
him; and, mark you, honourable gentlemen,
in all the litigation there was never any
adjudication on the merits of the case. All
the litigation was on the question whether
the award should be maintained or not.
Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
If
the
arbitration was final.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, that was
the only thing. Judge Brodeur says: "The
price is preposterous, but you do not submit that to us." Here are the Harbour
Commissioners represented by their lawyers, who go to court with the lawyers of
the claimant company, and after the claimants raised the ante and doubled the area
of the site, and so on, the Ha1bour Commissioners still say that the case s:hould go on.
They should have said:
"If you want to
raise the ante and double the area that we
have to expropriate, we will not have
anything to do with it." But that was not
the position they took at all: they kept
right on telling their attorneys: "Get this
award from this man.'
Judge Pelletier
awarded $51,300 and some odd. I waded
through these documents the better part
of last night. I do not pretend to be a
lawyer in any way; I am a surveyor; but
it would be awfully hard for me to go and
mark the boundaries of this property, ard
I would have to be a much older man
before I would find where the property is
at all, although I am a land surveyor. I
defy anybody to go and find any boundaries on this property.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Does my
honourable friend say there was a reconsideration?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, I absolve
the Harbour Commissioners thoroughly,
and also Sir William Price, and the men
who were in office at the time of the sui t ,
and others who were in before that. The
matter was taken out of the Superior
Court; that is where the trouble is; then
they had an arbitration, and only went to
the Court to find out whether the arbitration was final or not. That question was
submitted to the Superior Court and the
Court of Appeal, and afterwards to the
Supreme Court. Naturally if two parties
agree to a final arbitration, you cannot get
that reversed unless there is something
wrong; but any wrong can be redressed
under the British constitution. They should
define the limits of that property, and if
the property is not where they say it is,
why should we pay the money?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What about
the Government?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the property

have to pay this money?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

said so.

same ingeniaus lawyer, and he will be able
ta find what is wrong. Sir Richard Cart*wright said in this House, in my hearing,
that a very great lawyer had said to him:
"That is my opinion, but if you had told
me you wanted samething else 1 could have
given yau equally good reasans the other
way." I am glad we have a categorical
promise by the leader of the Government
in this House that thîs money will not be
paid without some more information than
we now have, and that the limits will be
defined sa that we shahl know whether the
property is there or flot.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It has been stated
ail around that this land bas absolutely no
value. If that be sa, in what way do the
damages came in? The land was improved
by the dredging of a channel.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes, it has

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Then why would
any dlaim be made for damages if there
was fia damage done, but if, on the contrary, the land was improved?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do nat agree
very much with the idea that there is an
improvement, because anyone who is
familiar with the river knows that it is a
mile, or a mile and a half, fram the jetty
ta the shore. The file shows that boundaries
of thîs property are ta the north, nat ta
the south armn of the river St. Charles.
There is a delta between the twa little
channels, and as a matter of fact anybady
owning any riparian rights would stap at
the high-water. mark, and anything else
would be only rights of utility-the right
ta navigate or fish there, or put fisheries
in; and in the aid times of the Colany that
was the thing that was valued very much
by the farmers-the right ta put aut thase
long fisheries so as ta catch eels, etc., anid
some of themn drew a better revenue from
that than £rom the farms they had cleared.
They possessed riparian rights, but they
had fia right ta the bed or bottam of the
land. They say in this regard that even
the King of France had no right ta the
bottom of the river.
Hon. Mr. REID:- I rise ta ask the leader
of the Governmerit if, when we cansider
this matter in Committee, he will bring
dawn a statement. shawing the revenues
and expenditures of the Harbour Commission for the last five or six years, so that
we can discusa that also?

58ý

Hon. Mr. WATSON: Is there any revenue.
Han. Mr. REID: We wilI find that out.
I want to correct a statement made by the
honourable leader of the Government. He
led the House to believe that after ail the
dredging that was done in the St. Charles
river, there should have been a dyke buit
behind it, and more land made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: According to
the plans, I think it is intended that it shall
be sa.
Hon. Mr. REID: But the honaurable gentleman knaws that that was exactly what
was done-that the soil that was excavated
was disposed of in the way the honourable
gentleman states it shauld have been done.
It is not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
done yet.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes, it was done, and
I will eëplain. Ail the land made at that
time the dyke was built, fram where the
railway crosses, for a long distance and
across, was made with the dredging taken
out from under the water on the Limoilou
side.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It bas been
recovered?
Hon. Mr. REID: Reclaimed, and the
Government owns the land. In addition to
that, I might say that the land ahl the way
from the outer pier to the railway bridge
was reclaimed, and piers, built ail alang
there, and that was ail filied in by the soul
that was excavated from the river; so
that, as far as the dredging was concerned,
it was ail taken and put in ta reclaim the
land, first on the Limoilou side, and then
to make berths and wharves ail the way
from the railway clear down to where the
long pier in the river is built.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- But the honourable gentleman agrees with me that the
works have had the effect of giving value
to thousands of fest of land which remains with the owners.
Hon. Mr. REID: It bas given value ta
the land behind, but 1 have aiways been
under the impression that where Governments make improvemnents such as those
made by the Commission in Ottawa the
neighboring property is improved, and the
owners of it get the advantage. The Governmnent cannot buy ail the property because they improve it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, but those
people do not dlaima damages.

590

SENATE

Hon. Mr. REID: No, but this claim is
for damages for land taken by the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The land that
was under water.
Hon. Mr. REID: The land that was
under water, I admit, but the Government
intended, if they had gone on with this
work, to build a dyke and do further
dredging, and reclaim that land. I mention this matter only to show that what
the honourable leader of the Government
stated should have been done was done.
Another point, with reference to this
judgment that was mentioned, is that the
Government of the day put into the Estimates the amount awarded, so that it was
open for every one to see what it was for.
When there was any difficulty they did
what has always been done: they instructed the Justice Department to put
it in the Courts, and when judginent was
given by the Courts, even thoughi it did
not satisfy some of the ministers, it was
accepted, as it has always been the policy
of every Government to recognize the decisions of the courts. They insist on
private individuals doing that, and they
should do it as a Government. Unless the
Government admit that the statements of
the honourable gentleman who made those
charges are untrue, or unless they have
them investigated, I will oppose the vote
of this amount in every way, shape, and
form, until we have from the Government
an ackowledgment that they are recognizng what the highest courts in this country
say was just and right in so far as any
claims are concerned.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I agree absolutely with the honourable gentleman. I
think he is perfectly right in asking that
the information in reference to the Quebee
Harbour Commission's receipts and expenditures be brought down; but by way of
comparison you might add the harbours ot
St. John and Halifax.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until 3 p.m. this
day.

that I made this morning in referring to
the prohibition law of Quebec. I stated
that that province had prohibited the manufacture of 'beer, with the exception of that
containing only a given quantity of spirit.
On referring to the Quebec Act, I find
that this bas been done by refusing to
permit the sale.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is what I
told you.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But it is the exercise of the same power, and I have no doubt
that it is within the power of the legislature to prohibit the manufacture of beer
or spirits.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I accept your
apology.
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Before the
Orders of the Day are called, I would like
to rise on a question of privilege. This
morning I asked, seconded by the honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Roche), who rose in his place, that the
names be taken and entered in the Minutes,
and I was refused that request. Rule 52
says:
If two Senators require it, the "Contents" and
"Non-Contents" are entered upon the Minutes.

I would like to ask the Speaker of the
House on what authority I was refused.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I have to
apologise to the honourable gentleman, because I did not have the rule before me at
the moment, and I had always understood
that five Senators must require it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is no excuse. You should know your business.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
many are required?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

How

Two.

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend had had the privilege of
sitting in the other House for some time,
he would easily have understood how His
Honour the Speaker, who had that privilege, made the error. It is all the fault of
my honourable friend.

CORRECTION OF STATEMENT
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: With the leave of
the House I desire to correct a statement

Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The fact remains
that I was very anxious to have the names
recorded, and I was denied that privilege
when I was within the rules of the House.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
is the total deficit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
had an opportunity of adding the figures.
Hon. Mr. REID: May I also asic the
leader of the Government what is the total
amount that bas been advanced to the
Harbour Commissioners up ta the present
tinie?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The total expenditure nmade by the Quebec Harbaur
Conimissioners for harbour improvement
since the reorganized fanm (three inenbers oniy) was adopted in 1913 ta January
31, 1922, amounts ta $6,993,946.43. The
total amount authorized for advance on
boans ta the Comnissioners for harbour
improvements under thie different enabJing Acts is $7,000,000. With the above
expenditure the Conimissioners bave added
the foilowing ta the original harbour
facilities:-

59i

The dredging of a basin 800 to 1,000
feet in wîdth, 35 feet deep at low tide;
and the provision of new berthing space
by the widening and extension of the aid
Princes Louise Embankment for approximately 2,500 lineal feet.
The building of a new concrete grain
elevator of 2,000,000 'bushels capacity,
with power-house and generating plant
complete, and with two and four-beit conveyer galleries to the berths along the
new embankment.
The construction of new fireproof cargo
sheds 776 feet by 75 feet and 1,000 feet by
102 feet respectîveiy, fronting the embankment, their structure carrying the
tracks for operating four gantry cranes
for handling mixed cargo from or into the
sheds, and several travelling grain loaders
for spouting *grain frem the conveyer gaileries to the vess.el's hold.
Provisions of a railway yard, locomotives and other rolling stock, locomotive
repair and storage bouse, with tracks to
all berths and sidings.
A new ,three-storey cuit stone office
building housing the offices of the staff
of ail operating departmnents, and the
Coxnmissioners offices and board room.
Purchase of a large property known as
Indian Cove on the Lévis side of the harbour and the repairing of the old pier or
wharf thereon, somne 3,000 feet long, this
forming an excellent storage and repair
yard for floating plant and equipment
and materials, and the construction of
cribs for wharf building.
The provision of necessary dredging and
other plant, and dquipment, âinciuding
gantry and locomotive cranes and a floating crane of 50 tons capacity, with tugs,
scows, etc.
The rebuilding of shed No. 26 on pier
No. 1, provision of an elevated passenger
ianding space at shed No. 18, and office
quarters in freight sheds for use of shipping companies and customs officers; the
paving of wharf areas about sheds, and
the roadways, with concrete and brick and
shale blocks.
Hon. Mr. REID: I know the work that
has been done there, and I think the
amount expended, roughly $7,000,000, has,
been well expended. It bas made a good
harbour of Quebec, and bas given it facili'ties ta which it was entitled for many years
past, and which are required now. However, there is another question which the
honourable leader of the Government bas
not answered as plainly as I should like.
What 1 asked for was the actual amaunt of

SENATE
money received in connection with the harbour, and whether the expenditures were
the actual expenditures in connection with
the operation, or whether they included
also the interest advanced on the money.
For example, take the first item. The exI take it for
penditure was $239,728.
granted, knowing the work that has to be
done there in connection with operating
trains and vessels and dredges and so on,
that that merely represents the expenditure in connection with the operation, and
does not include the interest.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able gentleman is right.

The honour-

Hon. Mr. REID: If I am right in that
respect, the operation of the harbour work
is costing the country roughly the interest
on $7,000,000, or, in round numbers, about
$400,000 per annum, and when we advance
another $1,500,000, it will entail upon the
country a loss in interest of between $400,000 and $500,000 as well as the amount by
which the expenditures in connection with
the operation exceeds the receipts. I have
not added the figures but they would show
quite a deficit.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

$106,000.

Hon. Mr. REID: I want to mention that,
so that we shall fully understand the situation.
Another question I should like to ask
the honourable gentleman is this. I notice
in the press that the Harbour Commission
have very materially reduced the charges
in connection with the operation. With a
view to assisting the port of Quebec they
have abandoned fees such as are collected
at all other harbours. I have no objection whatever to that, so long as it is not
going to be a serious matter for the public,
who as a whole must pay any deficit. Has
the leader of the Government any idea of
how much more this will reduce the receipts-because it seems to me that the
items that are being reduced will very
seriously affect the revenues of that port.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may tell my
honourable friend that my information
does not go beyond his own-that I learned
only through the press that there had
been a reduction in some wharfage dues,
and comments were quoted from some news-8
papers as to the effect this would have.
I read that the answer given was that
the revenue might perhaps be decreased
for some time to come; but the idea was
that the policy would increase the traffic
Hon. Mr. REID.

and bring about a larger income before
long. That, in a few words, was what I
read as the answer.
Hon. Mr. REID: What I cannot understand is how it would increase the revenue.
You are cutting it off altogether.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would attract more trade.
Hon. Mr. REID: It may attract more
traffic through the port, but will not that
increase the expenditure in connection with
operation? If you double the traffic without
getting any revenue, of course you increase
the cost of operation. I have always understood that to increase business of any kind
takes a larger operating expenditure. If
you increase your revenues you will of
course have more profits; but if you double
the business and increase the cost of operation and then cut off your revenues, what
wili be the result? You will certainly increase the cost to the country. The country will have to pay, as I understand, not
only the $400,000 or $500,000 in interest
-not only the present losses, but another
$100,000 a year. What I desire the country to understand is that the policy the Government is adopting will mean a cost to
the country of probably $600,000 per annum for the operation of this harbour.
With regard to further construction, I
understand from the little experience I
have had that the present facilities of the
harbour are adequate. The elevator at
Quebec is not used to the extent of onehundredth of its capacity; therefore no
additional elevator accommodation is required. There are more berths for vessels at Quebec than are used now, or will
be used for some time to come, unless there
is other traffic in sight;and I cannot see that
the traffic will develop so quickly that the
Government ought to undertake immediately enlargements which would cost
.1,500,000, and add a lia'bility of from
$90,000 to $100,000 per annum in interest
alone, for all time to come. This is, to my
mind, one of the works that should be held
over by the Government until there is some
necessity for it. I would like to see the
harbour at Quebec do ten times its present
business, and if there is anything we can do
to increase it, we shall be glad to do it;
but I am satisfied that the expenditure intended under this vote is unnecessary. It
should not have been placed in the Estimates. The Government, in view of the
present financial situation, should not agree
to spend $1,500,900 in this way.

harbour of Québec is getting three or four
times more business than it is doing at the
present time.
Where is this dredging to be done? Before starting with the dredging you will

statement I made this morning, all the
d1redging that has been done up to the
present time was used to fill in. Dykes were
built, and berths were built, and all the
material was placed there, and it made
very valuable property for the Harbour
Commissioners and saved them from the
necessity of expropriating other property.
So the cost of doing that was money well
spent. The saine is true of the Limoilou
side. Now, this work should not be proceeded with at the present time, nor until
we decide on very much larger works, if
the time should come when the harbour
ought to be enlarged.
The next item is:
Quay Wall River St. Charles, $729,152.
This item is to cover the cost of continuing
the Louise Embankment Quay Wall in the River
St. Charles in a westerly direction for a length
of 600 feet, to make a junction with the lock
walls in River St. Charles.

I think that no honourable member of
this House who knows the situation could
at all justify extending that wall at the
present time. This is not at the front of
the river, where the Empresses land; it
is not around the several other berths that
have been made. This quay wall bas
been extended already from the main
wharf, where the Empresses land, away
up the St. Charles river. In my judgment it is doubtful that this quay wall
would be used for many years to come.
Betwen the main wharf and where this
would commence, there are quay walls
enough to take care of all the vessels that
will be required for some years. Quebec
already has the main wharf along the
river, where the Empresses land, and then
the other berths all along, away up to
within 600 feet of the Bridge. Surely
that is sufficient accommodation for years
to come. I venture to say that there has
not been a day since their completion that
Hon. Mr. REID.

every one of these berths has had one
vessel in it at one time; and every berth
that is there will accommodate not merely
one, but several vessels. So, if we are
not using the present capacity to any
great extent why should we start in to
complete the quay wall and do the dredging proposed. I see now that they want
the quay wall continued and the dredging
done to dump the material in behind this
quay wall and simply use it as has been
done with every single foot of material
that has ben dredged up to the present
time.
So I cannot see why the items of
$729,000 and $210,000 should be passed.
I think it is an almost criminal proceeding, with financial conditions as they exist, to pass these two items, which together
amount to nearly $1,000,000, and place on
this country a liability in perpetuity of
$60,000 per annum.
The next item is for elevator alterations.
0f course, no one could object to an item
of that kind. If there are any alterations
required in the machinery necessary for
the operation of the elevator they should
be made. The elevator should be kept in
the very best condition, so that any grain
that may be there, coming in or going
out, can be dealt with in the most
economical way.
The next item is: " Paving floor of shed
No. 26, $18,000.' A new floor is required.
Of course, that should be attended to.
The next item is: "Paving floor of shed
No. 19, and quay surface." That should
be done. That is for repairs.
This

should be done.
"Indian Cove, reconstruction of wharf,
$30,000." I believe that nothing ever
goes to that wharf at Indian Cove at all.
It was constructed and intended to be used
by the Transcontinental Railway. The

terminais, so that now aIl passenger and
freight traffic goes there, and the track
down to Champlain market is, 1 understand, used only for local passenger trafflc.
The wharf at Indian Cove will not be
used for a long while. Items 9, 10, il and
12 cover work and repairs which should
be done. Item 13 is a small one, and the
work should be done if necessary for
switches. As to item 14, no doubt the Commission feel that that is an improvement
or repairs, and that should be done. The
oil tank, item 15, is something that should
be done, as it is for the benefit of the
port and of navigation. Item 16 is for
repairs that should be done. As to item 17,

that when the Courts give a decision, even
though it is against my views, I must
accept it. Though I may not have always

they only put it before the arbitrators,
which is very different.
Hon. Mr. REID: As I understand, the
case was put before the court, and the
court decided. I would not object to that
except in this respect. When the item was
put in the Estimnates last year the present
Prime M inister and those associated with
him objected to it because of the statement
made by one of their supporters in whom
they had confidence, that he could prove
that the transaction was dishonest. I think
the Government of that day did right in
holding the item over until that was
zleared up. I think the present Government
should now assume the responsibility, for
they say that the statement made by that
honourable gentleman was not correct.
They were right in taking objection at that
time; but now I think it is up to them to
say that the charge was unfounded and,
they should not pay the award until the;
are in a position to give the House that
assurance. Regarding item 18, practically
the only vessels that can go into the basin
inside of the railway are smaîl fishing
vessels. Large vesels of any great depth
only get in at high tide, for two hours a
day. Therefore there is no necessity for
this work; and since the general works
were constructed we have had no demand
5-38à

595

for those piers. The late Government had
no demand of this kind from the Commission, and I do not see why we should
start in now and spend this large amount,
$125,000. In my judgment it is hardly fair
that such work should be proceeded with
at present. The last item, for Landing
stage and overhead passage at sheds,
covers 'work that I think should be done,
because, so far as the passenger traffic is
concerned, large vessels now go to Quebec
that cannot go to Montreal, and as time
goes on I believe their number will increase. The building of those sheds would
afford better facilities for landing and
examining passengers and getting them
away quickly. For the small amount involved I think work of that kind should
be proceeded with at once.
On the Quebec ýharbour we must of
course pay whatever deficit there may be.
There is no way of collecting the amount,
and the Dominion -Government must assume
it. So long as we are called upon to
pay the losses, amounting to $7,000,00,
surely works that are not required should
not be proceeded with now. I say deliberately that they will not be requiýred or used
for soine time, and they should not be
gone on with until the leader of the Government shows us that the present facilities are working up to their capacity. I
venture to say it is absolutely impossible
to show that at present.
Hon. Mr. CAS-GRAIN: Was it under
the honourable gentleman's Department
that those works were going on? I know
that the works on the river St. Charles
were started under the Laurier Government.
Hon. Mr. REID: The reason I have a
little better knowledge than others on this
matter is that it was necessary for me, in
connection with the Départment of Railways and Canais, to visit Québec at different times and take in the whole situation. In addition ta that, between 1913
and up ta and dluring the war period, I
assisted in carrying on Departments of
other Ministers when they were absent,
and in tha-t way I had te become intimate
with the situation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn very familiar with this matter, as Quebec is imy
native city, and I lived tjiere until I was
twenty-nine years af age. The mistake
was mnade under the Laurier administration when they agreed to construet a barrage on the St. Charles river. It had ne

SENATE

596

sense on God's earth. It meant that the
only drainage of the whole valley of the
river St. Charles was interfered with.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: That was
not undertaken by the Harbour Commission.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No. The river
St. Charles is the natural outlet for the
sewage of St. Roch and other places, and
some bright engineer-I do not name him,
though I know his name- advised a plan
by which the Government blocked the outlet of the river somewhere near the railway bridge, necessitating the construction of a collecting sewer by the city of
Quebec on the city side, costing a million
dollars, and on the Limoilou side, costing
another million. I repeatedly protested
against that to all our friends, and the)city
of Quebec protested. W!hyn Hon. Mr..
Monk was Minister of Public Works I went
to him and said: "There is no sense in this:
you are block.ing the outlet for the sewage
of Quebec and of the northern portion with
this barrage. Instead of holding back the
water to flood some land that somebody
wants to sell, you should dig and make
the sewerage better, and not compel the
city of Quebec to build those costly collecting sewers to take care of the sewage, costing as much as the property." But nothing
happened. When the Hon. Mr. Carvell was
Minister of Public Works, 'I went to him
and protested in the same way against the
blocking of the outlet of the river that was
carrying away the sewage of a city of

100,000 people.

He went down to Quebec,

and the matter was quiescent, as far as
I know. Why it should have dragged on
for eleven years tili another Administration came in I do not know: they were not
committed to that. I do not know whether
those works are going to be completed.
There is no stronger partizan of the Government than myself, I will admit, but I
cannot agree with them when they want
to block the river St. Charles, which is
the natural outlet of the sewage of Quebec.
I cannot imagine why they are dredging to
get there-which is what we are a9guing
about-and paying, or promising to pay
$51,000 for a mudbbank that is in the way
of their getting there. Governments come
and Governments go, but people who want
to get money out of the Government seem
to manage to get there.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: They go on for
ever.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They go on for
ever, as my honourable friend says, but I
say that barrage should be done away
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

with. My honourable friend the ex-Minister of Railways knows that I went to him
when he was Minister and begged him not
to spend any more money on Port Nelson
in Hudson Bay-and I was right, as following events proved.
Hon. Mr. REID: I want to say to the
honourable leader of the Government that
in my judgment they are simply proceeding
with the work that was part of the scheme
mentioned by the honourable member (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain), to get away up inside of
the railway bridge; then they were going
to make two dry-docks right alongside at
the railway bridge. Then, in order to let
vessels in at high tideHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Twice a day.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes; then they blocked
it. Those gates were there to keep the
water in, and all the time the water was
held there, St. Roch was being flooded,
and there was no possible way for the sewage to run out of St. Roch or Limoilou.
That portion of the work was withheld
for future development. I am satisfied
that if any Minister looked into that matter thoroughly he would prevent any further proceeding up to the other end, for
the moment you carry out that scheme and
block up the outlet, you will have to pay
St. Roch or the city of Quebec millions
of dollars for damages on account of their
having no sewer; and the same is true of
Limoilou. The other portion of the work
from the railway bridge to the berths in
the Louise basin, the building of the elevator, and providing other facilities, no one
can object to, as all those things were necessary and were well done.
So far as I am concerned, with the knowledge I have, I could not possibly vote for
this Bill in its present condition. I am in
favour of doing everything possible to keep
the Quebec harbour and its facilities right
up to date, and making it as good a port
as can be found, according to its requirements.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You could not
make it better than it is.
Hon. Mr. REID: No, you cannot. The
Harbour Commissioners did excellent work.
We are bound, because of the advances
which were made by the Dominion Government, and because we hold the bonds
against those works, to assume the annual
loss of interest on the amount advanced.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is like the
cost of St. John and Halifax har'bours.

JUNE 24, 1922
Hon. Mr. REID: I will corne to that in
n moment, and explain. There is no way to
get over any loss connected with theoperation
of the Quebec Hairbour except payment by
the Government; we must carry on; 'but I
object to going on with that great big
sehenie, or any portion of it, at the present
time.
I would ask the leader of the Government if he will flot lay this matter before
bis colleagues, and give it a little further
consideration, and see if they cannot strike
out or reduce the amount of at least some
of those items I have mentioned. If he
can do that we might let the Bill go through
with whatever is required for the repairs,
or whatever is necessary to carry on. If
he can do that I would like to see him do
it, and amend the Bill. If he cannot, I
amn sorry, but I shaîl have to cast my vote
against the whole Bill, because, as this is
a money Bill I understand we have no
power to reduce. If the Governiment will
not agree to do as I suggest I will have to
vote against the passing of the Bill in its
present form.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Perhaps the
House would like to hear froni somebody in
Quebec who knows something about that
port. I have not the items bef ore me, but
I iunderstand from (the newspapers in
Quebec that when this amount 'was put
in the Estimates by the Government, this
$1,500,000 was going to be spread over
five years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

to Quebec, and we do not know that vessels will not require a still greater depth in
two or three years from now.
Hon. Mr. (DANDURAND:

At what

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERENCE: Where it
was dredged ttowards, the Limoîlou sidie.
Wharves were bult to al-low a dredging of
40 feet, and the dredging was actually
done to 35 feet, with the intention of dredging to a greater depth if necessary. Now,
it mnight prove very serious to the port of
Quebec, should we rejuse to allow this
dredging to go on. In two or three years
ships with a greater draught may 'be comimg there. When the plans were made in

59-o

the first place, and the work on the building of those wharves began the understanding was that the channel would be
dredged to 40 feet, so the wharves were
built accordingly; but if you are going to
stop the dredging and say you will not go
deeper than 35 feet, you may defeat the
object for which the dredging was done and
for which the wiharves were built in the
first instance.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Have
you any reason to, expect vessels drawing
more than 35 feet?
Hon. Mr. L'ESPE RANCE: I can only
say the vessels are being built to-day drawing more water, and well-known naval
engineers will confirm what I say, because
I got this information from one of the most
eminent of themý who told me that ocean
ships to-day, in order to make more money,
must draw more water. Up tili now the
great mistake made in naval construction,
he tells me, bas been in building ships too
long for their draught; and, in order that
their full possibilities for carrying freight
at a low rate may be utilized, they must 'be
built so as to draw more water. We may
therefore assume that as tiimne goes on ships
will be built with an increased draught.
But even if that were not to happen within
the next two or three years, I know thiat
the channel wihere it was dredged accumulates sand every year by the di.scharge of
the river St. Charles, and therefore some
dredging must be done there every year:
next year, or within two years fro«n now, if
no dredging is done, it -may be filled up to
30 feet so that even the vessels coming
to-day would not be able to dock. 1 understand that the sums we are now called upon
to vote are to complete the works that
were approved when the harbour improvements were subTmitted and approved in the
first instance. They were to go on as far
as the mouth of the river St. Charles. This
has nothing whatever to do with the locks
and the dredging of the river St. Charles
which my honourable friend spoke of a
minute ago, because the Harbour Commissioners, when the -St. Charles projevt came
along, refused to have anything to do wýith
it, and told the Governnient: "You must
do this under a separate Department, because the Harbour Commissioners will not
assume this work."
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN:
want it.

They did not

SENATE
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: They may
flot have approved of it, but it bas nothing
to do with the present Bill.
Hon. Mr. REID: Oh, yes, it bas.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: No; as 1
heard the items read to the House to-day,
it bas notbing whatever to do with the
other project in the river ýSt. Charles. Lt
is simply to extend this wharf, which is
now about 4,000 feet in lengtb, for another
500 or 600 feet; and, while the dredging
is being done the filling in would go on,
and the land thus redeemed, would, I amn
sure, be worth more than the actual cost
of construction. For this reason, I think
the dredging sbould not be curtailed. Il
it is, a great injury will be done to the
port of Quebec. So before voting on the
matter every honourable gentleman in this
Chamber should give it bis careful considerat ion.
My bonourable friend bas very littie objection to the other items with tbe exception of the dlaim of the River St. Charles
Park Company. I have very littie more
to say in that regard.
My bonourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) spoke of a
conspiracy. That is an ominous word.
The decision to arbitrate was taken after
a great deal of consideration. My honourable friend is not a lawyer, but bie can
consuit lawyers. The arbitration was not
so mucb to decide who was the owner of
the land, as to, decide on the question of
damage. There was a case of tbe Harbour Commissioners against Dussault,
whîch went as far as the Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Another case.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Lt was a
similar case. I arn not a ]awyer, but
when I have to, take a decision upon a
legal point, I go to, the best legal advisers
I can get. That was the course taken in
this case. We cuiisulted Mr. Rivard, now
a judge in Quebec, Mr. Belly, who, was a
Minister in the late Government,' and who
I tbînk no one will say is not one of the
most eminent legal advisers in Quebec,
and Mr. Charles Smiîth, K.C. These gentlemen decided that this case was somewhat similar to the Dussault case, in which
the Privy Council had given judgment
against the Harbour Commissioners of
Quebec. I was afraid that if we went to
court we migbt have a judgment with very
heavy costs awarded against us.
There
was an arbitration, and, to my great surprise, for 1 could not see that much damage
had been done to the owners of these shore
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

lots, a large award was given against
us. Where was the conspiracy? I think
honourable gentlemen will admit that up
to that time the action taken by the Commission was perfectly fair and reasonable.
We went before a judge of the Superior
Court who had been considered one of the
best judges in Quebec. There is nothing
dishonest in that, nothing that looks like
conspiracy. I thought the award xvas unreasonable; and had it not been for the
fact that I was sick in bed at the time
and not expected to live, 1 would have
taken the case out of the Arbitration
Court the moment I heard that the dlaimants wished to increase their dlaim.
After the award, the matter was taken
up with the Government, and it was decided that the whole case should be contested in the courts of justice. Now, s0
far as the late Government is concerned,
where is the conspiracy? Lt went to a
higher court, and the court having adjudged against the Government, they submitted. I do not see any conspiracy there.
There may have been an error in judgment, but there was no conspiracy. I may
say that when I have had the management
of public funds, I have always taken more
care -than I do in the management of My
own. I gave this question serious consideration, and it was only wvhen a judge
of the Superior Court was selected as
arbitrator, that I accepted the arbitration.
If this was an error of judgment, I arn
quite willing to ta-ke my full share of the
responsibility.
But where was the conspiracy? The Minister of Marine and
Fisheries blamed us for entering into an
arbitration, and hie went to the courts and
fought the case, but lost. What else could
hie do then but pay the dlaim?
I amn only sorry that 'I cannot present
the case of the Harbour Commission of
Quebec in as clear language as my honourable friend could do it. I think it is a
very fair case. I have given the reasons
which, in my humble opinion, fully justify
the passing of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman said the question of deciding the
value of the titie wvas not submitted to
Judge Pelletier.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I did not say
that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Or, you submitted
the title?

BANKRUPTCY BILL
FURTHM~ CONSIDERED EN COMMITTEE

Hon:. Mr. BENNETT, by leave of the
House, presented the report of the Banking and Commerce Committee on Bill 107,
an Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Béique, the said
report, with the Bill, was referred to the
Committee of the Whole, and the Senate
went into Committee thereon.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If honourable gentlenmen will look at Bill 107, I will endeavour to make the points clear in as
short a time as possible.
Section 2 of the Bill reads as follows:
Moreover, an order of the court, whether
mnade heretofore or hereafter, granting leave to
extend or appiy to any such corporation the
Windin-g-up Act, sha.1 flot be invalid or subJect to any obJection 1»' reason only that the
corporation had previous1y made an assignment
und-er the provisions of this Act, or that proceedings in bankruptcy under this Act were at
the time pending against the corporation, and
in any such case the Provisions of the Windingup Act shall appy and prevail, and the bankruptcy proceedings shahl abats subject to such
disposition or the costs thereof to be made in
the winding-up proceedings as the Justice of the
case may require.

It will be noticed that this section refers
to orders of the court "'whether made heretofore or hereafter." Objection was taken
to the word "hereafter," so the word
"whether" and the words "'or hereafter">
were struck out.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: What is the
object of keeping the Winding-up Act in

SENATE
force at ail, now that we have in the Bankruptcy Act the provision for these assigninents?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Under the Windingup Act the machinery is provided for the
winding-up of the affairs of corporations,
and when the Bankruptcy Act was passed
it was intended to give power to the judge
to direct that the winding-up take place
under either the one or the other. The
new section was intended to cover two purposes: first, to make clear that the law
was intended to apply to cases of the past;
also to apply it for the future. The hionourable member from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) has taken very strong
objection to the clause in so far as it would
apply to future cases, because he dlaims
it would be the means of enormously increasing the cost. I do flot take responsibility for the amendment, but the Committee has agreed to it and so reports. The
honourable member for Hamilton may in a
few minutes state the reason why hie made
the objection.
The next clauseHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does the honourable gentleman not intend to dispose
of this first?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think it is better
to give an explanation of the amendments,
so that they niay bc better understood.
The next clause of the Bill is 4, on page
2, and deals with section 30 of the Act, on
assignments of book debts.
Under the
section as it appears in the statute book a
question arose as to whether the assign,ment was good in provinces where there is
no machinery for registration. There was
a difference of opinion as between the province of Ontario and the lower provinces.
In one case it was held that the assîgnment was good without registration; in
the other case it was held that the assignment was not good without registration.
Clause 30 as printed in the Bill is intended
to clear up that question, but an addition
is made in order that the clause may have
no retroactive effect. Either the assignments are legally binding or they are not.
If they are binding, the assignee should
have the benefit. If they are not binding,
the mass of creditors should have the benelit of the law. Therefore this subsection
was adopted by the Committee:
Section 30 of the said Act is further amended
by adding there to subsection 3 as follows:
(3) Subsection one of this section shall not
be deemned to ajp1y to any assignmen t of ex isting or future book debts ruade pr' or to the date
of its enactmnent, and any such aý,qgnnient shall
be subject to and governed by the provisions of
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

section 30 of this Act as enacted by chapter
seventeen of the Statutes of 1921.

The bearing of this amendment is merely
to prevent the clause having a retroactive

efYect.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Are we going
to deal with each clause as we go along,
and show the amendment made by the Committee? It strikes me that would be the
better way.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then take the first one.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-Winding-up Act to apply
in certain cases:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I object to this
clause. 1 think, now that we have a Bankruptcy Act, that al] procedings under
the Windîng-up Act should be done away
with. Every lawyer who has any experionce under the Winding-up Act knows perfectly well that it is a most expensive
Act under which to proceed. Under the
Bankruptcy Act proceedings the estate is
wound up quickly.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The object of the
amendment is to keep it under the Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 1 asked the
honourable gentleman a few moments ago
and understood from him that the Windingup Act would still be in effect.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not in cases
which are now being dealt with under the
Winding-up Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
amendment has put it the way the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) desires.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 1 did not understand the honourable gentleman's (Mr.
Béique's) explanation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not quite that
way. I think what my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Proudfoot) means to ask is,
why do you not take away f rom the Winding-up Act the cases which are now heing
wound up, as well as future cases? It does
not apply to cases now being dealt with.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
To
cases that are already under the Windingup Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is what the
honourable gentleman complains of.

JUNE 24, 1922
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No; I refer to
the future cases.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It is
now in the f orin which the honourable
gentleman desires.
Section 2 as amended was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-avoidance of general assignment of book debts; proviso that foregoing provisions not to apply where registration under a Provincial Act; further
cases where section 30 not to void assignments:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: What is the
amendment there? I have a strong impression that assignments of book debts which
are made bona fide should not be made
One can

readily understand why. I have a case in
point where the book debts were assigned
not very long prior to the assignment to
the trustee. Yet according to the section
as it reads such an assignment is voided.
I think protection should be given to a
bona fide assignment for a valuable consideration.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is a question which I discussed at some length in
the Committee and which 1 thought the
Committee was going to deal with. I understood that the point was left to tis
Committee to deal with, but I ansorry
Ithto find that it has not done s.
roughly ýagree with my honourable friend
You. declare void and invalid any assignment of existing or future book debts;
it. does not matter how long before the
bankruptcy such an assignment may have
been made. You can well conceive that today a merchant, in order to meet a temporary difficulty, may have borrowed frose
some person the sum of $1,000. He may
pull through and continue to carry on business for a year, two, three or four years
and then become bankrupt. The assignment whîch. the borrower made was bons,
fide and absolutely valid when it was made,
but because the person borrowing the
money becomes bankrupt four or five years
al!ter, that assignment is declared void. I
do not think that is fair. It la quite possible that the borrowing of the money has
enabled the merchant to pay ail his debts
and continue his business. It may have
been the salva'tion of the business carried
on by him. Why that should be condemned
I cannot see. I am sorry the Committee
did not deal with the question, because to
me it seems a serious one.

601

The CoinHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mittee discussed it at length and came to
the conclusion that the adoption of the
proposai would open the door to fraud.
Balancing the possible danger which my
honourabie friend sees with the great
danger of fraud being perpetrated by the
debtor against the creditors generally, the
Committee decided to leave the clause as
it is.
Hon. Mr. BETjCOURT: That is not my
understanding of the intention. My understanding is that this matter was to be
dealt with by the sub-committee-that it
was left with the sub-committee to be dealt
with. At ail events that has not been
done. Let us not waste turne, but let us
deal with it now. I suggest that the point
raised is one of considerable importance.
Honourable gentlemen wiil notice that by
this section an assigninent of existing or
future book debts in ail cases is made void
if it is followed by bankruptcy. The
bankruptcy may not take place for four
or five years alter the assigninent, yet that
assigninent, which was a'bsolutelyl valid
and perhaps beneficial to the creditors
generally at the time it was made, is declared to be void.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is irregular for
any honourable member of this House to
refer to what has taken place in Committee, but I have no objection in this
case. The honouhable member forgets
that he raised that question and the Coinmittee decided against hum. There was
nobody to support his contention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn not going
on that ground at aIl. The report is
before the Cornmittee of the Whole no'w.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I refer to the honourable gentleman's statement that the
cornrittee was to do a certain thing and
it has not been done.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn sorry if
I have hurt my honourable friend's feelings. Perhaps I should have said I
thought the sub-committee was going to
deal with the question.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: IThe honourable
gentleman raised the question and a vota
was taken on it. 0f course it is open to the
honourable gentleman to raise the question before this honourable House.

that. And I may say that I arn Vice-President of a Bank, and in advancing this
argument I arn speaking against the interest of the institution to which I belong;
for it is known that banks to a very large
extent take assignments of books debts.
But I want to show the motive of Parliament and to place before the House the
position as it appeared when the Bankruptcy Act was passed originally. I amn
quite sure that I speak within the recollection of the honourable leader on the other
side of the House and that hie will bear me
out in what I say. The question was discused at that time and it was contended
that in each province there should be a
means of registering assignments so that
they might be known to the public; that
it was unfair for a merchant buying goods
to get credit for large amounts on his
stock and on the assumption that hie was
possessed of hjs book debts, whereas he
had in fact parted with the main portion
of his assets; and that, therefore, only
assignments that were published by registration should be protected. That was the
ground upon which Parliament acted at
the time. A question arose as to whether
this provision was carried out or not, and
there was a difference of opinion in the
judgments to which I have already referred. The clause was therefore amended
as printed in the Bill, to cover the doubt
that existed. The proposed amendment,
however, affected past assignments, and
the secretary of the Banking Association
asked that this additional arnendment be
inserted in the Bill:
Subsection 1 of t!his section shall fot be
deemed to s.pply to any assignment of existing
or future ibook debts made prior to the date of
its enactment, and any such assignment shall
be subject to and governed by the provisions
of section 30 of ihis Act as enacted by Chapter
seventeen of the Statutes of 1921.

So you leave to the parties their rights
as they have existed before this Act is
passed. As to whether it is the desire of
Parliament to validate assignrnents of
book debts without registration, it is for
them to say.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My observation
has to do only with assignments iii the
future.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
This
section is not nearly so wide as some honourable rnembers seem to think. The first
subsection declares when an assignrnent
shail be void Then there are two provisos
which cut it down very much indeed. The
first proviso is that if there is a law in the
H-on. Mr. BEIQUE.

province requiring assignments to be registered like chattel rnortgages or deeds, then
any such assignnient which is registered in
accordance with that law is flot mnade void
under this section.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: If there is a
statute in any province providing that
assignnients of book debts shaîl be registered.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
is a law in sorne provinces; there is not
in Ontario. There are further clauses here
that ought to 'be looked at to find out the
extent of this matter. It is provided in the
last paragraph that:
Nothing in this section shall have effect so
as to render void any assignment of book
debts, due at the date of the asslgnment -

That is one; and
-from specifleid debtors, or of debts growing
due under specified contracts, or any assignment of book debts incIuded in a transfer of a
business made bona. fide and for value, or in
any authorized assignment.

All those provisos bring do'wn the enactment to cover only assîgnments of future
book debts. Then banks have a clause in
that document which they now get everybody to sign who borrows rnoney from them,
that aIl the debts you inay have between
now and the end of the world shail belong
to theru if you continue to owe them money.
You may not have any book debts at aIl
to-day; you lnay not have any for twenty
years from now; but if in twenty-one years
you are still. dealing with the bank and
you have book debts, that assignment
covers them. The banks bring it under
that case in England, Talby vs. OfficiaI
Receiver, where it was held that in the
assignment of book debts, a chose-mn-action,
as it is called, it is not necessary to specify
thern. So this enactrnent is only to prevent
a wîde assignment giving things which rnay
corne in future, and to rny mind it is a very
proper on1e, and does not take away the
rig4hts of a man who gets an assîgnment
on an existîng chose-mn-action-on an existing book debt-for money now advanced, or
,as security, or who gets an assignrnent,
in other words, covering anything that is
not now in existence but that may becorne
due before the assignment.
It appears to,
cover those drag-net assignments made to
the bank. The provisiion is flot nearly s0
wide as one might think. The honourable
gentleman frorn De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique) says that the representative of the
bank was there, and hie said: "I prefer that
this should flot be ipassed, but the -law in
some parts of the country has rendered it

JUNE 24, 1922
impossible for us to take asignmeflts, and if
you will legisiate I amn satisfled with this."
While the
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
subsection does limit the value of those
assigniments, yet it does not cover a broad
assignînent. As the proviso stands it is
absolutely necessary for you to give the
naine of the person who is the debtor, and
whose account is being assigned. It does
nlot coverIt
Hon. Mr. LYNCHýSTAUNTON:
does cover existing debts.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: For existing
debts at the preséit time you would have
to put in the naine of the debtor. My idea
is that we should have a clause similar te
this, and I move that the followi-ng words
be added after the word "assignment" in
subsection 1:
Provicled that the foreging subsection shall
flot apply to a bona fide assignment for valuable consicleration.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: No, let the
section stand with that previse in it.
But
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the previse is in there, and it is just the
saine as cancelling it. The only evil, if it
is an evil, that this, enactmnent aims at is
the assign-nent of future book debts that
are not registered,. Well, if the honourable gentleman puts in a claim that all
assignients of book debts-which. includea
future book debts-must be made bona fide

of elisting book débts made boira fide and

existing book debts. It will not affect in
the future an assignment made to-nierrow;
it will leave assignments made to-morrow
as they were yesterday-all existing 'book
debts.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It will surely
prevent an assignment of existing and
future book debts?

date of assignýment fromn specified creditors.
That is the llrst case. If

and inakes another exception-"or of debts
growing due under specified contracts."
Now, that means this, that if a customer
goes into a bank and produces a number of
accounts for goods sold, to bis customers
which are to corne due, we will say, in three
months, or six months, he can only make an
an assignment of those book de.bts, so far as
this section is concerned.
Thus we have
two exceptions; first, those that are due at
the date, and second, those whiclh are coming due from customers, or any assignment
of 'book delbts included in the transfer of a
business.
Now, the third one is flot a
case between lihe bank and the creditor, but
it is a case where I seil a 'business, and also
seli the book debts as, a going eûncern.
So there are three cases excluded: first,
those that are due; second, those that
are coming due, and, third, those that are
assigned for a present consideration. 0f
course, this applies only to existing dëbts.
A nman goes into the bank and says: "Here
1 have a hundred accounts; they amound to
$50,000 taken together; they are maturing
at three, six and nine months; I will assign
these accounts to you as security for this
money that I arn Iborrowing frorn you."
Those accounts are clearly excepted from
this section, and are left to be governed by
the law, whatever the law was before the
passing of this section.
So tihat, when
one analyses it, the effect of this Bill is this
-that it only deals with a'ssignments of
book debts which a man cannot specirfy or
describe, because they may not be existing
at the time when he makes the assigninent
to the bank.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is what I
understood to be the meaning of the section.
Hon. Mr. LYN!CH.-STAUNT0N: And
that is what it is.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No doubt that is
what it is; but I want to show the
Committee that tihere is no reason why
that should not 'be extended to the registering of debts that may not be existing at
the moment, !but which may arise the next
day.
I do not see why that sbould not be
done, for this reason: we ail khow what
takes -place in the course of trade; the
existing accounts which are being offered
may ail be paid up in a month or two
rnonths, and yet the borrower may want
to borrow, and may succeed in borrowing,
on
a term of three
months.
In
order that that security rnay be a
continuing security the creditor ought to
have the right to look not only at the exHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAI3NTON.

isting debts but at the debts within three
months. Otherwise, you have an assignment that is perfectly legal, but if the man
becomes insoivent a year after, you have
a question as to the validity of that transaction. What I want te cover is the case
of the man who wants to borrow not only
on the accounts of to-day but on the accounts that he wiIl have coming to hirn
within three or six months. I do not see
why that should not be done, or why, if
a man becomes bankrupt in two years
afterwards, he should have those accounts
questioned because the assignment was
not registered.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I want to say a
word about the policy of this. Take the
case of a trader dealing with another
trader, and one transfers bis business to
another. In the meantime the trader goes
to a bank and receives an advance of
money on book debts and other assets.
That man goes into bankruptcy. The creditors think that there is something to draw
upon, and that they will be paid a portion
of the indebtedness, but when they meet
they find that ail the assets of the bankrupt have been covered by advances made
by the bank, of which the creditors ini
general have had no advice whatever. They
simply trusted their goods to the fancied
security of the property of the trader who
has assigned. 'Now, is it advisable that
the bank should gobble up everything in
sight, when it means that on an unregistered document the creditors are deceived
and have lost their property?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Did it ever occur to my honourable friend that that
money got from the bank has probably
gone to the creditors? The trader borrowed that money in . order to meet his
liabilities, and the creditors have got the
benefit of that loan.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Referring to
what was said by the honourable member
for Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton),
it is quite clear that the second proviso
excepts certain debts; but the objection to
that is this. You take in, say, a dozen
accounts, and those accounts are ail assigned. You have the names of the persons, and that assignment will be good
under this second proviso. Then, if that
is to stand, and that account is increased,
or the account is changed by the merchant,
the security is gene; so that my idea is
that we should have the assig-nment of
book debts very much in the saine way as
they existed before this Bankruptey Act

JUNE 24, 1922
came into effect-that is, that the
banks and other people may take the security just in the samne way as they did before. There was no crying evil. People
must do business, and the way that they
do business is by securing money from the
bank. I see no reason why the bank or
any individual who advances money should
flot be allowed to take an assignment which
would be good not only as to the book debts
which exist at the time of the assignment,
but as to f uture debts. I therefore move
that amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is a provision of that kind to-day in the statutes
of Ontario which renders valid an assignment of book debts provided certain time
elapses between the date. of the assignment
and the date of the bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: 'The Bankruptcy Act supercedes that, though.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Possibly.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In a general
way I would like to support the amendment,
but I would prefer to add that the transaction should not be invalidated for three,
five or six years hence by insolvency. I
really do flot think that would impose a
very great hardship. I do not think the
case would often arise. If this provision is
going to be retroactive to the time the
credit is given, make it retroactive within
the statute of limitations.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps my
honourable friend would add to his amendment: provided it is made within a certain
time, say six months before the assignment.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: You had better
make it three months, I should think.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then
you neutralise everything that has gone
before.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: The whole thing is
shot to pieces.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is changing
the economy of the Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNiGH-STAUNTON: You
may as well leave it out altogether.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I *ill add:
"1where such assignment is made at least
three months prior to the bankruptcy."
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot was negatived: yeas, 7; nays,
17.
Section 4 was agreed to.

605

On section 5-further particulars to be
included in notice of first meeting of
creditors:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I have been asked
to introduce a very slight amendment to
that clause. I understand it was intended
to amend it in the other House as I am
about to suggest. The amendment which I
have been requested to make is to make
the clause read:
A list of such creditorLx, the amnount of their
dlaims, and their post office addresses.

A gentleman who was here to lookc
after this Bill, the President of the Credit
Men's Association, said that those words
were left out by an oversight. It is desirable that when a list of creditors and
their post office addresses is sent in, there
should be included also a statement of the
amount of their dlaims, so that when the
meeting is held that information will be
available.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There is no objection to that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Add after the
word "creditors" the words "the amount
of their claims."
The proposed amendment was agreed to,
and section 5, as amended, was agreed to.
Section 6 was agreed to.
On section 7-courts of bankruptcy not
now to, be so called:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Why is that?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What are they to be called?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I explained that
Under the Bankruptcy Act as
before.
now in force, the judges of the Bankruptcy Court are appointed by the Minister of Justice; this is to do away with
that system, and to permit of the administration of the Bankruptcy Act by the
judges of the ordinary courts in each province. As I said before, there ceases to
be any bankru'ptcy judge; the court ceases
to be the Bankruptey Court-lt is the existing court. In Quebec it is the Superior
Court.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8--single judges to be assigned to, bankruptcy work by Chief Justice instead of by Minister of Justice:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: As the Bankruptcy
Court disappears, and -as the Act is te be
administered by the cdrdinary existing
tribunals of the provinces, which have

906

SENATE

their own officials who are paid by the
provinces, this is to do away with the
special officers who were collecting large
amounts in fees. This amendment is
made at the request of some of the provincial Governments who say: "We pay
the expense of the administration, and we
will pay the employees: the fees should
not go to any special employees."
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Have you consi-dered the effect of using the words
" Chief Justice of the court " as far as
Ontario is concerned? In Ontario, as I
recollect it, there are two divisions of the
Court of Appeal. Division Number 1 is
presided over by the Chief Justice of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Is
there not a definition in the original Act?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I have not
looked at that.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
If
there is not, that had better be provided
for.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: "The court means
the court which is vested with original
jurisdiction in bankruptcy under this
Act."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There are half
a dozen chief justices in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: As a matter
of practice, the Chief Justice of Ontario
has acted in all these matters and I think
it advisable to have him continue; but
whether these words confer jurisdiction
on him or the Chief Justice of one of the
other divisions I am not prepared to say.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is assigned to
the Chief Justice. We must provide for
the administration of the Act; and the
business is to be done by such judges of
the court as the Chief Justice, under
whose jurisdiction the Act falls, will
decide.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
But
you have not provided what jurisdiction
it will be under. In Ontario there is the
Chief Justice of Ontario, there is the
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas-and
there is no Common Pleas Division, there
is the Chief Justice of the Exchequerand there is no Exchequer Division. Now,
who is the Chief Justice?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Then there is
the Chief Justice of the Second Divisional
Court.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: He is
called the Chief Judge, I think.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I think this
matter should be looked into before the
section finally goes through.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There
were Bankruptcy Courts when the Act
was drawn, and when it was intended
that they should exercise jurisdiction it
was always stated. I think the honourable gentleman had better let this lie
over.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Very well, we will
leave this.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is another
point. In section 7 you speak of "constituted appeal courts of bankruptcy." You
are repealing the law in that respect and
are creating a new jurisdiction, or, rather,
you are conferring the power on another
court. How does that affect the right of
appeal? Will there still be an appeal from
the court you are creating?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think tnat is covered by the amendment. At all events, it
may stand, and I will look into it.
Section 8 stands.
On section 7-Courts of Bankruptcy not
now to be so 'called (reconsidered) :
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Section
7 had better stand too.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, 7 and 8 go
together.
Section 7 stands.
Sections 9 and 10 were agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Now, there are the
new sections 11, 12 and 13 that were added
in Committee. These are very important
sections; I call special attention to them.
They are intended primarily, I believe, to
help in settling the affairs of Riordan, but
they are of general application; and I,
with other members of the CommitteeHon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I interrupt
my honourable friend and tell him that he
is divulging what took place in Committee?
Hon. #r. BEIQUE: I think I am quite
in order. I say that the Committee bas
gone carefully into these new provisions
and, in my opinion, bas adopted them in a
very conservative way.
In 1903 or 1904, as a young member of this
honourable House, I took upon myself the
duty of framing an Act, which was passed

JUNE 24, 1922
by Parliament, to provide for schemes of
arrangement in the case of insolvency of
railway companies. Under the law as it
existed then, in case of such a failure, the
railway had to be sold by the sheriff, which
was destructive of the value of the property. I thought it was important that
we should have in this country, as they
have in England and in the United States,
the power of protecting the rights of all
parties concerned. Otherwise a single interested party might ruin the interests of
the majority. The legislation passed at
that time is to be found in section 365 of
the Railway Act as contained in the Revised
Statutes. I will read just a small portion
of the Railway Act, because it embodies
the same principle that is applied to insolvent corporations. Section 365 says:
Where a company is unable ta meet its engagements with its creditors, the directors may
prepare a scheme of arrangement between the
company and its creditors, and may file it in
the Exchequer Court.
(2) Such scheme of arrangement may or may
not include provisions for settling and defining
any rights of shareholders of the company as
among themselves, and, for the raising if necessary of additional share and loan capital.

The machinery is provided in the section,
and then section 366 says:
Tho scheme shall be deemed ta be assented
ta-

(a) by the holders of mortgages or bonde
issued under the authority of this or any Special
Act relating ta the company, when it is assented
to in writing by three-fourths in value of the

(b) by holders of debenture stock of the
company, when it Is assented ta in writing by
three-fourths in value of the holders of such
stock;
(c) by the holders of any rent charge, or
other payment, charged on the recetpts of or

(d) by the guaranteed or preference shareholders of the company, when it la assented ta

shareholders, or three-fourths in value of each
class, if there are more classes of such shareholders than 'one; and,

information
when this Bill goes back to the House of
Commons, if the Minister of Justice cannot approve of the amendments, he need
not feel comimitted to them in any way.
Section 11, which is a new clause, would
read:
11. Section 13 of the said Act le amended by
inserting therein immediately after subsection
2 thereof the following:
"('2a)
Any scheme of arrangement under
which the right of participation therein of any
creditor or of any shareholder of a debtor which
Is a corporation le made conditional upon the
purchase by such creditor or shareholder of any
new securities or upon any other payment or
contribution by such creditor or shareholder
shall provide that the claim of any creditor or
shares of any such shareholder who elects not
to participate in the scheme shall be valued by
the Courte at the amount, if any, realizable
thereon upon a sale by the trustee of all the
property and asets of the debtor to ,wind up his
estate and that the value so determined shall
within ninety days after the determination
thereof or such further time as may be alilowed
by the Court ta be paid ta such creditor or
shareholder either in money or In such securities as shall be specified pursuant ta such
scheme of arrangement and approved by the
Court and such payment shall be in full satisfaction of his claim or payment upon his shares
as the case may be. For the purpose of assisting the Court ta so value the claims of any
creditors and shares of any shareholders of a
corporation debtor who elect not ta participate
in the scheme, the Court may appoint a qualified person ta examine into the value thereof
as aforesaid and report the same ta the court.
In case of request therefor by creditors or
shareholders wbo do not elect ta participate in
the scheme holding one4fifth in amount of ail
proved debts, or one-fifth in intereet of all the
shares of such corporation debtor hereinafter
referred ta as "the minority creditors" or "the
minority shareholders" as the case may be, the
Court shall appoint three persons; one ta be
nominated by the minority creditors ta assist
the Court in valuing the claims of the minority
creditore, one by the minority shareholders ta
assist the Court in valuing the shares of the
minority shareholders, and the third by the
creditors and shareholders who elect ta participate in the scheme; provided however that a
majority of the minority creditors or ehareholders shall have the right ta agree with the
creditors and shareholders who elect ta partici
pate in the scheme upon one or two persons
only being appointed. Such person or persons
shall be entitled to reasonable compensation
ta be fixed by the Court which together with
the necessary expenses in connection with the
examination into the value of such claims and
eharea shall be paid from the estate of the
debtor. Na secret arrangement shall be made
with any creditors or shareholders ta induce
them ta participate in any such scheme.

That is section 11.

Now section 12:

12. Section 13 of the said Act is amended by
etriking out subsection 3 thereof as enacted
by secton 12 of the Bankruptcy Act Anendment Act, 19)21, and substituting therefor the
following:

I will point out what is new in this
section:

place of meeting, the day of mailing to count
as the first day's notice,

any change is made in the rights of the shareholders under the letters patent or other instrument of incorporation of the company or the
right of participation in such scheme of any
shareholder is made conditional upon the purchase by such shareholder of any new securities or upon any other payment or contribution
by such shareholder, to every shareholder of
such corporation.

That

is

the

new

part.

Then follows

what is contained in the existing Act:
-If
any meeting of his creditors whereat a
statement or list of the debtor's assets, liabilities and creditors was presented bas been held
before the Trustee is so required to convene
such meeting to consider such proposai and at
the time when the debtor requires the convening of such meeting the condition of the
debtor's estate remains substantially the same
as at the time of such former meeting, the
Trustee may omit observance of the provisions
identified as (b) and (c) in this subsection.
If at the meeting so convened to consider such
proposal or at any subsequent meeting of creditors a majority of all the creditors and holding
two-thirds in amount of all proved debts-

Then the new part:
-and,
in the case of a meeting to consider a
proposal of a scheme of arrangement, of the
nature mentioned in this subsection, of the
affairs of a corporation debtor, the holders of
a majority in interest of each class of the
shares of such corporation debtor resolve to
accept the proposal either as made or as altered
or modified at the request of the meeting, it
shall be deemed to be duly accepted by the
creditors and in the case aforesaid by the
shareholders of any such corporation debtor.-

That is the new part:
-If
approved by the court such extension, composition or scheme of arrangement shall be
binding on all the creditors-

That is the law as it stands, and then
there is added:
-and,
in the case of a scheme of arrangement
of the nature mentioned in this subsection of
the affairs of a corporation debtor incorporated
by or under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, upon all the shareholders thereof upon
the fling in the office of the Secretary of State
of a certified copy of the scheme and of the
Court's approval thereof and, in the case of a
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

scheme of arrangement, of the nature mentioned
in this subsection, of the affairs of a corporation debtor incorporated other than by or under
an Act of the Parliament of Canada, upon all
the shareholders thereof upon any necessary
steps being taken to give effect thereto under
the laws by or under which such company is
incorporated.
13. Section 13 of the said Act is amended
by striking out subsections 8 and 9 thereof and
substituting therefor the following:
(8) If the court is of opinion that the terms
of the proposal are not reasonable, or are not
calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal and in any case in which the court is
required, where the debtor is adjudged bankrupt, to refuse his discharge, the Court shall
refuse to approve the proposal-

Then comes in the new part:
-unless for special reasons the court otherwise
determine.

That is giving an additional discretion
to the court.
(9) If any facts are proved on proof of
which the court would be required either to
refuse, suspend or attach 'conditions to the debtor's discharge were he adjudged bankrupt, the
court shall refuse to approve the proposal unless
it provides reasonable security for payment of
not less than fifty cents on the dollar on all
the unsecured debts provable against the debtor's estate-

Then comes in this addition:
-or
unless in the opinion of the court such
refusal would be prejudicial to the interests of
the general body of creditors.

Then clause 14:
14. Subsection 5 of the section 46 of the said
Act is amended by inserting after the word
"direct" in the sixth line thereof the following:
-- and any such sale by the Trustees shall
have the effect provided in subsection 3 of
section 20 of this Act."

These are the amendments which were
prepared in the Committee.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman a question.
Suppose a man has asked for an extension
of time, and the extension has been
granted by his creditors.
He makes an
assignment to the bank. He is conducting his business and shipping goods in
the meantime. Then he becornes bankrupt.
Will the security of the bank hold in the
meantime, while he is asking for an extension of time?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think so. Of
course, it will not affect the security.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Mr. Chairman,
I think it is asking a good deal of the
members of this House to expect them to
accept these amendments just after hearing them read. Some of them are very important. They may be all right, but be-

60e;

JUNE 24, 1922
fore they are finally passed, so far as I
amn concerned, I would like to have an opportunity of reading them.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Would it flot be best
to report thern, to get them out of the Committee, with the understanding that at the
third reading, if necessary, they may be
reconsidered, and f ull consideration wilI
be given to any suggestion made? That
would give us the advantage of having
the Bill reprinted between 110W and Monday, so that every honourable member
might have a copy.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: That is quite
satisfactory.
But the honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable gentleman forgets that he hias appended two clauses.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I was bearing that
in mind. I would ask that they be passed
and taken with the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why cannot the
Committee direct that the Bill be printed?
We could rise, report progress and ask
leave to sit again.
.Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: My suggestion is
merely that the Bill be printed as amended.
It will not leave this Committee stage.
But I suggest that the amendments be
adopted, so that they may be printed, with
the understandîng that they may be reconsidered.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not; see how
we can do that consistently. We cannot
adopt themn and take themn up again. Let
us bave the Bill reprinted, and let us report progress and ask leave to sit again
to consider the amendments. If we adopt
them now we cannot discuss them again.
We must do one th-ing or the other.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn like my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Proudfoot). My mmd is not swift enough to
carry me through three or four pages of
typewritten matter of that kind. If I voted
for those amendments now it would be simply because I have unbounded conlidence
in my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Béique.)
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
We shail be just as far ahead if we wait
until they are printed.
Sections 11, 12, and 13, as amended, were
agreed to.
Progress was reported.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What is the capaeity of the new elevator? Do you happen to have that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The capacity
is flot indicated in the memorandum which
I have.
Sections 1, 2 and 3 were agreed to.
On section 4-monthly applications for
advances:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would like
to know if the Commission has ever so far
paid interest, or if there is any likelihood
of them paying the 5 per cent on this
$5,000,000 provided for?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honour.
able gentleman did not lend me his ear
wben I stated that ail the interest had been
regularly paid on the amount of debentures
out, includîng the înterest due last year,
which was. over a million dollars, and that
there is a very large margin, not only
for the administration, but for the carrying out of the works. In the statement
I read a million and a haif, I think, is
indicated as having been taken from
revenue for capital expenditure.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-deposit debentures with
Receiver General to cover advances:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Are those debentures
retained by the iReceiver General, or are
they offered for sale to the people of Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Government retains the debentures, and issues its
own bonds. The Government bas always
been able to borrow at a cheaper rate, and
is giving the advantage of that rate to
the ports.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not at
present. We do not get money for 5 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The debentures come
before the public in the end? The public
buy them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It ail depends
on where the Government issue its'bilîs;- it
may be in London, as bas often happened.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But I understand
there are only three millions in the bands
of the public; the balance is in the Treasury
of the Commission.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Sections 5 and 6 were agreed to.

The titie and the preamble were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time and passed.
INDIAN BILL
PONSIDER5ED

IN COMMITTEE AND
PONED

POST-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the honourable gentleman reàdy to go into Committee
on this Bill?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
like to get some information. Take, for
instance, the question of the enfranchisement of Indians since this Act passed. I
understand, upon inquiry, that 560 Indians
have been enfranchised.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But not by
compulsory law?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No,
whatever the law is on the statute book.
In 1920 we practically repealed everything
dealing with enfranchisement, and thne section now on the statute book of 1920 is the
taw touching the enfranchisement of
Indians. How many, whether by the compulsory system, as you caîl it, or any other
system?
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 142, an
Act to amend the Indian Act.
Hon. Mr. Willoughby in the Chair.
On section 1-inquiry as to fitness of Indian for enfranchisement in future to be
at request of Indian or of band:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honouraible
gentlemen, this Bill is composed of two
clauses.
The first one has for its object
simply the withdrawing from the Superintendent General of Thd'ian Affaira, of the
right to set in motion machinery for the
enfranchisement of Indians, which was provîded under the Act- on the statute !book,and leaving to the Indian himscîf or to the
majority of the 'band the right to initiate
tjhe enfranchisement.
There are here two
policies which are quite clearly different
and op'posed to each other.
My honourable friend the late Minister of the 'Interior
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) favours the
compulsory system. The Present Minister
favoura the liberty of the Indian te
remain as he is so long at it pleases hini te
do so, or so long as it plea9es

SE NATE
the mai ority of the band that the
band should remain as it is. Now,
1 draw the attention of my honouraýble
friend to this fact, that we could perhaps
reject the pol'icy of the present Minister of
the- Interior, but it wnuld flot set the presIf the Minister of the
ent Act in motion.
Interior is adverse to using his compulsory
powers, then the macbinery will neyer be
He is under the impression
set in motion.
that there is considerable dissatisfaction,
among the Indians; that they are constantly
making representations because of the
tbreat under which they lie, of being disorganized by the will of the Superintendent
Gieneral of the Indian Department. The
Mînister of the Interior ia of the opinion
that we sbould return to the freedom wbich
tbey had 'before the Act of 1920, and that
the Indian sbould not be under the constant
tbreat of being some day siubjected to, enfranchisement against his will.
My honourable friend stated that there
was a necessity for this country to force
those men into civil life, to make them the
equals of White men, to throw responsibility
on their shoulders, and have thern develop,
through the use of liberty and freedom, to

facilities.
reserve, and it bas furnished them witb an
opportunity to develop intellectually.
The other clause is proposed to meet the
wishes of the Indians who have a fear
that their right to maintain the reserve
as it bas been beretofore may be disturbed
by the pbraseology of clause 197 of tbe old
Act. Lt says:
The Dequty Superintendent General may acquire for a settler who is an Indian land as
well without as wîtiln an Indýan reserve, and
shall have authority to set apart for such settier a portion of the common lands of the band
without the consent of the councUI of the band
In the event of land being so acquired or set
apart on an Indian reserve. the Deputy Superintendent General shall have power to take the
said land as security for any advances made
to such setler, and the provisions of The
Soldier Settiement Act, 1919, shah, as far as
applicable, apply t0 such transac1ýons.

This is to cover tbe case of the Indian
wbo bas enlisted, and wbo on returning
asks, under the Soldiers Settiement Act, for
land in the reserve. The memorandum I obtained frorn the Deputy Superintendent
General dealing with tbis clause is as
follows:
HIon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

The 197th section of the Act gavc the Deputy
to grant location tickets -,j Indian sett:ers who obtained boans1Pwer

Has my honHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
ourable friend any estirnate of the number
who have obtained boans?
Would my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bonourabLe friend, bave that statement in
mind?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; I
tbink there were some two or three bundred,
but I could not tell that.
The stateHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment goes on:
-and to lake security for boan., ulpûn tle lands
granted to Indian soldiers.
The Indians urged that tbis ,)ower endangered their tille ta their lands, and that the
result might be to alienate lthe lands. In order
ta remove this objection the proposed amendmient provides that security shah, only be taken
on the individual interest and improvements of
the Indian soldier, an d that the interest of the
band shail not be affected.
Il was also claimed that the title given by
a Location Ticket was a bLtter tfIle than the
titie under which many of the banda hold their
lands; and to remove this objection the amendmient provides that the land shall be set apart
without reference bo the character of the titie
c nveyed.

The Department sets apart a piece of
land wîthout stating wbat kind of title the
Indian soldier will bave in the land, so that
be may not bave a better title than tbat
of the band in the reserve.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY:
Could the
Indian mortgage tbat land after be becornes enfrancbised?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, I do not
beleive be could. By virtue of this Act be
could only mortgage for the advance maade
under tbe Soldiers Settlement Act, and that
ta limited to the improvements wbich he
makes; so that the Government bas flot
even a mortgage on the real estate itsel.f.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hon..
ourable gentlemen, tbis Bill proposes to
alter very rnaterially the policy wbich we
bave been pursuing for many years toucbing the enfranchisement of the Indian. Now,
it is utterly impossible to discuss tbis satisfactorily to-nigbt, and my honourable
friend can very well appreciate that we
cannot do justice to so important a subject
as this in fiften minutes. There is certain
information wbicb I would like my bonourable friend to give me, touching the number of Indians who bave been enfr.ancbised,
say since the first of Jul.y, 1920; that would
bring us down practically for two years,
as we are closely approacbing tbe first of

01Ô

JUNE 24, 1922
July, 1922. 1 should also like to know the
number of returned soldier settiers belonging ta the different Indian tribes that have
been settled upon lands since their return
from overseas.
Hon. Mr .WATSON: On and off the reserve?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
both conditions; and possibly my honourable friend would be good enough ta ascertain what representations have been made
to the Departments as to the changes
which are embodied in this Bill, and by
whoni.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What representations have been made in f avour of this
legisiation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The memorandum
on the Bill speaks about the individual
interest of the Indian in the land: what
does that mean?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
suggest to my honourable friend ta have
the Deputy Superintendent General present on Monday. He is very famihiar with
ail these questions, and would be of great
assistance, not anly ta himself butý ta the
House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 put the question ta the Superintendent himself, this
morning, and he said it only concerned
whatever movables and improvements the
Indian had made upon the land which
would corne ta him under this Act.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Suppose the Indian
moved off the land, wouhd he have any
further interest in it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will look
into the Act. There must be a way for
the Government ta have a re-entry; but the
re-entry of the Governrnent is anly in the
rights of the band. The land would revert
ta the band.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What occurred ta
nie was that it looked a very illusory thing.
Under the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Soldier Settiement Act money can be advan ced for agricultural implements, and
a chattel mortgage is taken upon the ralling stock of the soldier who settles upon
the land.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: But that is not an
interest in the land; that is an interest
in the movables. What I amn referring to
is the interest in the land.

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The Indian
bas no interest in the land which hie could
sell, say, to a white man.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, hie has not.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Then there is no
meaning to that?
Progress was reported.

INDIAN BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committe9e
on Bill 142, an Act to arnend the Indian
Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Willoughby in the Chair.
On section 1-inquiry of the fitness of
Indians for enfranchisement in future to
be at request of Indians or of Bands:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, when this Bill was presented ta the House by my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand> 1 made
some observations upon what I considered
the undesirability of this legislation. 1
appreciate the responsibility that one takes
in opposing a measure such as this, which

SENATE
is administrative so far as the Minister
of the Department charged with the administration of the Act is concerned. I therefore question in xny own mind the desirability of voting against the Bill, although
I arn strongly opposed to it.
I recall that in 1920 the House of Coinmons spent nearly a week in giving consideration to the amendrnents to the Indian
Act which. are involved in the measure now
before us. The Senate of Canada did the
saine. We spent at least three of four
days dealing with that subject, and it was
only after very mature consideration that
we placed upon the statute book the legisiation which is to-day being repealed. There
is a tendency on the part of incoming Governments to repeal, at one fell swoop,
legisiation which bas been tried and has
given satisfactory resuits. It seems to, me
undesirable that thîs kind of thing should
be done. When legisiation embodying an
important policy and promising results is
once placed upon the statute book, and
Parliament bas deliberately expressed
itself in that respect, every reasonable
effort should be made to carry it out successfully.
The policy involved in the legisiation
which it is proposed to repeal to-day is
that of practically civilizing the Indians,
placing them upon a self-supporting basis,
impressing upon them the necessity of
their assuming aIl the obligations of citizenship at as early a day as possible. It is
flot reasonable to suppose that the Canadian Governnent must necessarily for
ail time retain the obligation of looking
after the Indians and maintaining them as
wards of the nation. We have already had
experience that Indians are just as suseeptible to education and appreciation of
the responsibilities of citizenship as other
members of the community. We have in
Canada to-day thousands of Indians who
have been enfranchised, and have in this
way heen, so to speak, separated from their
Bands and have taken upon themselves
the obligations attacbing to ail citizens.
Immediately res-ponsibility is thrown upon
any individual, even if hie has only a gleam
of intelligence, hie almost invariably recognizes that responsîbility and prepares
himself to meet and dîscharge it, wbatever
it may be.
Now it is proposed to revert to the position wvhich obtained some time ago, leaving
it entirely to the Indians to determine
whether they shahl become enfranchîsed or
not. It goes without saying that once the
State enters upon the responsibility of
keeping people providing for tbem the neSir JAMES LOUGHEED.

cessaries of life, doing the thinking and
the acting for them, there is a failure to
develop tbe human faculties whicb are to
be found in Indians as well as in other
persons. Consequently my impression is,
and I venture Vo say to the House, that no
enfranchisement will take place among the
different Indian bands of the Dominion so
long as we leave to tbem the responsibil'ity
of taking the initiative.
There is in the Bill a qualification: that
is to say, any individual Indian who may
choose to express a desire to become enfrancbised will have the rigbt to do so.
But that position is an improbable one. If
an Indian finds himself at variance with
his Band, bie will scarcely take the initiative himself to become enfranchised. Therefore it seems to me that this respo.nsibility
was very much safer in the bands of the
Government than it will be under the Bihl
now before us. I do not intend opposing
the Bihl further. I have expressed my
views upon the subject, and if the present
Superintendent General of Indian Affairs
-who is likewise the Minister of the
Interior-feels that it is only in this
manner tban he can administer successfully the affairs of the Indian Department,
the responsibility is upon bis sboulders and
not upon ours. I therefore would bave
great besitation in expressing my views to
the extent of moving any amendrnent to
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I bave already stated that there
are two, systems that corne into confiict in
this Bill: tbe systern of forcing tbe Indian
to take out bis citizensbip papers, and that
*of leaving tbe matter to bis own initiative.
My bonourable friend is of the belief, supported by a certain number of thoýse who
have studied the problem, that compulsory
powers should be vested in tbe Department.
Others believe tbat it is better that the
treatment of the Indians should continue
in the formi and procedure that we bave
followed since Confederation-suaviter in
mod o.
The reniarks of my honourable friend as
to Acts being passed and then repealed recail to my mind a statement made by Mr.
Jose-ph Chamberlain to a late ýcolleague of
ours, who had be-en twenty-five years in
power in Ontario. Mr. Chamberlain said
to him: "This is a very extraordinary
situation. The same party in power for
twenty-five years? We in Great Britain
believe that legisiation only becomes the
law of the nation when, after having been
opposed by His Majesty's regular Opposition, the Opposition assumes the responsi-

JUNE 26, 1922
bilities of office later on, accepte that
legisiation, and leaves it on the statute
book. Their acquiesence represents, the
real will of the nativn."1 He expressed his
surprise that a party should impose its
will for twenty-five years without giving
.a chance to the other half of the population less one to consent to proposed legisiation or give its imprimatur to past legisiation. I recognize that there may corne a
time when ail parties interested in these
questions may agree upon the procedure
to be adopted; but, with xny honourable
friend, 1 recognize also that, when the head
of the Department decides upon a policy,
it should be his policy for the time he bas
the administration of the Departinent.
I would ask Mr. Williams to corne to the
floor.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E,. FOSTER:
I would like to cail the attention of Tny
honourable frie'nd to the second section.
My honourable friend, in explaining it,
gave the Chamber to, understand that it
applied simply to Indians who had served
in the war. But it does not seeni to, me
that the section makes that clear. It is
"an Indian" without limitation, and nowhere in the section cau 1 see any implication, that ib is restricted to an Indian who
has served in the war. The allusion to the
Soldier Settlemeut Act, as I understand it,
eimply applies those regulations to the
working out of the loans-to the payments
and res-pousîbilitieg which apply to the
Soldier Settlemeut Act. 1 would like to
have my honourable frieud's opinion on
that.
I arn in.Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
formed that the second section deals ouly
with the Indian soldier.
Right Hou. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Does ýmy honourable friend think the section really defines that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- Clause 196
of the Act is not amended, and it reads as
fohlows:

(1) Thse Soldier Settlement Act, 1919 (excepting sections three, four, eighi, nine, ten,
eleven, fourteen, twenty-nine, subsection two
of flfty-one, and sixty thereof, and excepting
the whole of Fart Three thereoi), wlth such
arnendments as may from timne to time be made
to said Act shall, with respect ta any '«settler"
as deflned by said Act who le an "Indian" as
deflned by this Act, be administered by the
Superintendent General of Indian Affaire.
(2) For the purpose of such administration,
the Deputy Superintenhdent General of Indian
Affairs shaîl have the same powers as the Soldier ;Settlement Board has under the Soldier
Settlement Act, 1919, the wo: ds "Daputy
Iniîan Affairs"
of
General
Superintendent
being, for such purpose, read in tIse saId Act

1

as substltuted for the words "~The, Soldier Settlemnent Board" and for the words --The Board."
(3) iSai-d Act, with such exceptIcfls as aforesaid. shall for such purpose, be read as one with
this part of this Act.
We are amending Part III of the Act

by the second section of this, Bill, which has
to, do with Indian soldiers' settiement.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-titie for comnion lands of
band niay be granted on land acquired for
Indian settier, etc.:
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: How does that
affect the tribal rights in a reserve? Does
that alienate that part of the land froin
the reserve?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I have a
short memorandum givingt a complete explanation of this aimendmlent, and I will
put it on record. Trhe objection of the
Indians was :

1. That the grantiflg to an Indian soldier of
a location ticket for the common lands of the
band would be grantiflg to such soldier a better
titie than that held by other Indiana on their
reserve;
2. That the security taken on the holding of
an Indian soldier under this section for a joan)
made under the -Soldier Setternerit Act might
resuit in the fee of the land passlng away from
the Indians In the event of the land belng sold
to recover the amount of the loan.
With respect to the flrst objection, I beg to
point out that the title to Indian reserves ls in
the Crown for the Indiana of each particular
band. When the reserves were first set apart,
the land ws aIl common land. Gradually varlous
members of the bands took Up the occupation
of particular parcels and remairied and continued in possession of the same clearing and
cultivatlng it, erecting buildings, fences, etc. The
interest whlch they thus acqulred Is called the
individual Indian interest In that particular parcel, an'd such interest is transferred from one
Indian to another by quit dlaim deed or by
will. When an Indian gives a quit dlaim deed
of his land, whîch can only be dor.e to a member of the band, he dispases of bis Individual
Interest only. The common Interest of the band
in the land In question ls not in any way
affected by such transactions.
Subsequently -provision was made in the Indian Act for giving an Indian a better security
as to his holding by the issue of what is called
a location ticket. The vrocess for obtaining the
same is to secure a resolution of the council of
the band locating an lndian for the land he
may be already in ocupation of, or land from
the common land. On approval of this resolution by tIhe Superintendent General a location
ticket is issued to the occupant of the land iu
question and a record of hie holding kept In
the Department. Thse question as to the adoption of this, system was left to thse discretion
of the various bands. Only a f ew bands have
adopted this system. Thse Six Nations Indiana
are among those who have not adopted this
system, they having a land registration of their
osen. TIsai is why they object ýo a soldier receiving a location ticket. To meet this situation the section is amended ellmlnatlng the

;16

SENATE

issue of a "location ticket" and substituting
therefor the "setting apart" of a portion of the
common land by the Superintendent General
which gives the soldier a right to the occupation of that particular parcel "set apart" which
is ail that is necessary and which satisfies the
objection taken by the Six Nations.

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: What do you
mean by "set apart"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is set apart
by enclosure, which gives them the enjoyment of that part under the general laws
that govern the territory of the band.
With respect to the second objection, I have

to say that there was no just cause for alarm

that the title of a soldier's lard might be
alienated from the reserve. Undec the Act, as
it stands, there are only three ways by which
the band title to land can be disposed of, and
that is:
1. By surrender of a reserve or part of a
reserve by the band in Councill. (See Section
48).
2. Where land is taken with the consent of
the, Governor in Council for rights of way,
public utilities, etc.
(See Section 46).
3. Where an Indian gets a patent for land on
enfranchisement after having paid to the band
the value of the band interest In the same.
(See Section 107).
But to allay any misapprehension that there
may be in this matter the proposed amendment speciflcally states that the band interest
is not to be in any way affected by the taking of
security by way of mortgage •tgainst
the Indian soldier's holding. In the event of action
being taken to secure the amount of a mortgage on such holding on default by the soldier,
the land with all the appurtenances would be
offered for sale to a member of the band and
the purchaser would go Into possession of the
same and have the same title as the Indian
soldier had which title is called the indIvidual
Indian interest. The conveyance of the same
le by quit claim deed without any covenants as
to title whatever. The comnion band interest
is accordingly not in any way prejudiced.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Se they exercise
rights without assuming the corresponding
duty of exercising the franchise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Dominion Elections Act gave the Indian soldier
the right to vote.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, but that
Act has gone.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am not sure
whether I got the whole import of the
statement read by the honourable leader
of the House. Suppose an Indian who is
a returned soldier acquires from the
Soldier Settlement Board a farm property
entirely outside of the Indian reserve and
fails te pay the debt incurred and it becomes liable te forfeiture, what would
happen? If I understand this section correctly, the situation is exactly the same
as though the land were part of the
reserve.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Land acquired
outside the reserve is not affected by this.
section in any way whatever, and the
Indian who has acquired land outside the
reserve is treated just like an ordinary
white man.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What does this
mean, then?
The Deputy Superintendent General may
acquire for a settler who is an Indian, land as
well without as within an Indian reserve, and
shall have authority-

and so on. If I read this correctly, the
final provision applies te that land:

lindividual

It shall, however, be only the
Indian interest in such lands that is being acquired or given as security, and the interest of
the band in such lands shall not be in any way
affected by such transactions.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should like to
know to what extent returned Indian
soldiers have taken advantage of the provisions made for giving them soldiers' land,
and the success, if any, with which they
have met.

I should like te know whether the band
acquires any interest whatever in that
land.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, none
whatever.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
complete information in that regard, but
J may say that in the Six Nations band
alone 80 out of 400 have availed themselves of the facilities of the Soldier Settlement Act.

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Could the honourable gentleman give any information as
te how many western Indian returned
soldiers took advantage of the Act-Manitoba Indians.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will get the
information for the honourable gentleman
before prorogation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The nunber of
Indians mentioned by my honourable friend
is the number outside the reserve?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, the 80
Indian soldiers belonging te the Six Na-

Hon.

Mr.

BELCOURT:

Are

those

Indians treated in exactly the saine way
as the other returned soldiers? We must
bear in mind that most of them are not
enfranchised.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

fions band have taken land in the reserve.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was really
more interested in knowing how many had
gone outside.
I am inHon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
formed that they are very few.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is just
one further point. In the case of these 80
Six Nation Indians who have taken up
land within the reserve, and to whomi the
Government has advanced sumns of money
to enable them te settie upon it and stock
,*t-in the event of their failure to îmake
good, and in event of forfeiture, what
security has the Government when it
already owns the land?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ail the unprovements upon that land-house, out,buildings, implements, and whatever the
land could be sold for to another Indian in
the band.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I understood
my honourable friend the other day to
state that if an Indian went off the land
he would have no further dlaim, and that
the band would own whatever was there.
Therefore, if the band owns the property
that is left, 1 f ail to see where the security
us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Superintendent General would take it as security
for the loan, but subject ta the obligation
of disposing of it to another member of
the band.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In other words,
the Crown reserves the titie, but the
Indian would have the right ta have the
improvements disposed of for his benefit.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The value
would be restricted to whatever could be
obtained for it from other Indians.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamnble and the title were agreed

QUEBEC HARBOUR ADVANCES BILL
FURTRER OONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 78, An Act to provide for further
advances to the Quebec Harbour Commissioners.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.

bliI

Hon. Mr. -Smith in the Chair.
On section 2-$1,500,000 ma, be advanced to Harbour Comniissioners for terminal facilities:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The honourable leader of the Governinent was asked
for soine information, and fpromised to
make a statement in the House in reference
to the discussion the other day in Committee.
Hon. Mr. DAiNDURAND: It may be
somewhat difficuit to convey to the House
the information as to the place where
dredging would be done, without honourable gentlemen lookîng at the plan which
is on the Table. If honourable gentlemen
are au fait of the topography of the port
of Quebec they will know where the large
steamers come to the wharf. Some dredging is required at the entrance of the St.
Charles river, to admit of large steamers
entering the mouth of this river to go to
the ins4de pier. If steamers were not increased in length this dredging would not
be necessary; but for steamers of from
500 to 800 feet len.gth there is danger
when t'hey turn they mnay touch the outside part of the entrance. There is also
necessity for dredging to greater depth to
enable them te reach the inside of the
wharfage systemn which has been installed.
It is desired to provide an entrance behind the present wharves in order to utilize
the wharfage.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What is the scale
of the mnap?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 4à feet to
1,000 f eet.
Hon. Mr. REID: This is the clause to
which I raised objection, and I asked the
leader of the Governinent if he would consider amending it. He bas brought down
the pl-an, and, as I understand it, the situation is exacti'- as I stated to the House
on Saturday; that is, work had been done
at the city of Quebec, and under the policy
of the Government the work was ta be
carried towards the St. Charles river and
was to stop at a certain point. The plan
shows that along the water front there is
a long pier for the accommodation of large
steamers like the Empresses, and the warehousing conditions are of course in firitclass state. I was at Quebec within the
last few weeks, and no comiplaint could be
made as to that part of the harbour. It
would accommodate the largest vessel that
crosses the Atlantic both for depth of
water and other ship accommodation. The

518

SENATE

proposed plan of the inside work shows
the number of berths for vessells, but of
course that work is exacitly in the sanie
condition as it has been for a number of
years. The width of the channel to enter
those berths is about 800 feet, with a
safe waterway of at least 35 feet in depth.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But the
scale shows only 650 feet.
Hon. Mr. REID: The Deputy Minister
said it was 800 feet, but even if 650 feet
is the wiýdth, it was stated around the
table when the honourable members were
looking at the plan that that was hardly
wide enough on account of the tide making
a current in and out. This is the first
time that I have heard that the channel
was not wide enough, or that there was
any difficulty in any vessel entering that
channel to -pass inýto the berths. If it was
quite safe, and vessels had no difficulty,
and there was no accident during all the
ears of the war when there was such a
great traffic, harbour conditions being exactly the sanie as they are now, and ail
those vessels could pass through this 650foot or 800-foot channel into the berths
and load and unload and corne out again
safely, surely there is suflicient capacity
now when conditions are back to normal,
and the traffic is probably only 25 per
cent of what it was during the war.
Quebec was the port xçvhere probably twothirds of the traffic was done during the
war.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I beg ýmy
honourable friend's pardon. We had hardly
any traffic dur-ing the war except during
the last year, 1918. The larger steamers
do not go inside now: they are afraid.
Hon. Mr. REID: Perhaps I amn wrong,
so far as the traffic is concerned.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- I think the
figures which the honourable leader of the
Government read the other day indicated
that froni 1919 to 1921 the earnings of the
Quebec harbour were substantially more
than double what they were in previous
years, which would indicate a very substantial increase in traffic.
Hon. Mr. REID.- At alI levents, there
must have been a great deal of traffic at
that time going to Quebec, if the port of
Quebcc is now equipped to do the work it
has donc for so many years, with conditions
as they are, surely we should not start lin
to spend at least another million dollars for
xvork that in my judgment will not be required for rnany years to corne. But, in addiHon. -Mr. REID.

tion to that , there was a question, when the
St. Charles river work was delayed, whether
it would not be better, if we were going to
spend more money for wharfage accommodation, to put the wharves along the
xvijst side where the Transcontinental railway ruas to, the Champlain market. If the
wharves were constructed there the trouble
would he overcome in relation to sand or
other material filling, and requiring to be
continually dredged.
Il the honourable
leader of the Government has *decided that
he will leave the Bill as it is, and cannot
consider reducing it, I will move an amendment to redu-e the amount, in accordance
with the notice I gave him on Saturday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the
attention of my honourable friend to this
situation. Some $5,000,000 worth of work
has been done on the inside at the mouth of
St. Charles river in order to enable large
steamerýs to go hehi*nd, the present wharfage, which faces the St. Lawrence. Now,
would it be good policy, after $5,000,000
has been spent, partly by my honourable
friendHon. Mr. REID: Might I ask my honourable friend to give me some detail as to
how that $5,000,000 wýas spent, because I
think it includes the elevator.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. REID: But it makes no difference, s0 far as the elevator is concerned,
whether the ships go inside or not, as there
is a long elevator that carnies the freight to
and froni the ships.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Not outside.
Hon. Mr. REID: Lt carnies it to those
berths, and it coulýd be carried out farther.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Lt does not
extend to the outside wharvýes.
Hon. Mr. REID.- No, but it carrnes it to
the present berths, and it could easily be
extended to carry it outsi*de; so that froni
the $5,000,000 thýere should be deducted the
cost of the elevator, and, in addition, the
cost of the trackage that runs right out to
the main pier. The only part that the
honourable leader shoulld include in the
$5,000,000 lis the cost of the berths, the
piers that connect them, and the dredging.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
This
expenditure we are asked to sanction for
Quebec is confessedly necessary only if we
have vessels of 40 foot draught. Lt is
admitted that there are at Quebec Harbour
sufficient channels and wharves for alI the

JUNE 26, 1922
existing vessels and for ail vessels which
have been laid down so far. In spite of
the unlikelihood of vessels of larger capacity being laid down and in future years
coming to Quebec, we are asked to vote a
million dollars and more. A million dollars
in these post-war days seems very little,
but prior te the war we thou.ght a great
deal of it. As 1 said in some remarks I
made the other day, we pay very little attention to enormous expenditures made for
terminal and transportation work; but
here we have the Estimates of the Governnment showing that their expenditure for

the coming year will be over $100,000,000

more than the e'xpected revenue. The
Minister is at his wits' end to get money,
and the people are being taxed te the very
extreme; yet we find this item of $1,500,000
f or the improvernent of Quebec Harbour,
which now has facilities far beyond what
it requires for any trade it now has or
may expect for a long tume to corne. This
item is put in against a niere possibility,
for there is no additional business in view,
nor are there any reasonable expectations of
such business as will require this expenditure. The Governinent say: "It is a good
thing to be always -prepared for what may
bappen." The Government have not corne
to us and said: "lWe know that there are
vessels being bujît that will increase the
trade in Quebec; we know that these
vessels want to corne te Quebec and cannot
get into that harbour unless this expenditure is made." If the Government told
us that, there niight be somne reason for
asking for this vote, but are we to ýpass it
just because it is proposed? I subrnit that
we should not allow any of Vhese expenditures unless we see that they are imperative for the well-being of the country.
Hon. 'Mr. ROCHE: I have listeaed with
great attention to the rernarks that have
been made by the former Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Reid) and, by my bonourable friend who bas just sat down. I
would point out one fact w'hich will at once
appeal to ail honourable miembers who are
discussing this precise mode of operation,
namely, that the dred-ging at the niouth of
a river is very changeable. You dig a big
hole-that is what dredging 'means-and
ahl that is adjacent to it, and ail the niud
that is brought; down the river, and ail the
waste material, go into that hole, filling it
up. So if there is 30 feet of water there
to-day, there niay not be 25 feet in the
spring. There is the drawback in all deep
dredging, that it foi-ms a receptacle for
alI the inud and waste material in the
neigburhood.

619

Witb regard to the nautical question,
with which rný honourable f riend froni
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is so
farniliar, I do not think it requires a much
larger number of vessels to make Imperative the deepening of a channel, or of water
adjacent to a channel. It may be needed
te accommodate even one vessel. Everybody wbo is familiar with the matter knows
that a large vessel, or even a small vessel,
approaching a dock is greatly dependent
upen the wind, the tide, the speed of the
vessel, whether she is light or deep in the
water, 'wbether the tugs that have bold of
the vessel operate together at the psychological time or whether they pull apart, or
whetber the steam of the ship is sufficient
to carry her to tbe objective point or wbe'ther it f-ails just at the critical moment.
A vessel, whether of -large size or of ismall,
requires a circuinference, as muých as
lengtb, ahl around ber in order to be safe
In making the movement of approaching a
dock, wbich is difficult witb a variable or
a beam wind or with any of those circumstances that I have detailed derogating
from the straightness of ber course to the
distant objective. It is my experience with
dredging-and I have seen dredging al
my life, at railway piers, at wbarves, and
other places--that a large circurnference is
necessary before it is safe for any vessel
to approach a wharf of the description that
bas been indicated to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
wbetber sîl members of the Senate are
familiar or not witb the situation at tbe
port of Quebec and the entrance to tbe
wbarves that bave been equipped at considerable expense, witb sbeds and railway
tracks. Just at the rear of the wharf on
tbe St. Lawrence there is an entrance
As my bonourabie

friend from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Roche) bas
said, wben the sbips desire to enter in
order to bertb at wbat rnay be called the
entrance of the St. Charles river, wbich is
sissply at tbe back of the wharf fronting
on the St. Lawrence where the Empresses
come, tbey sometî-mes find themselves in
difficulties. I arn told that in 1918 two
shîps tried to enter in the wind, and tbeir
stierns were -swept around, just at tbe place
wbere the dredging sbould be done. The
question now before us is whetber, after a
few millions of dollars bave been spent for
the tborough equipment of the wbarf, wésbould witbbold our bands and allow that
expenditure and the splendid wbarfage go
to wast-e and be a loss to the country. We
bave already invested sorne millions of

SENATE
money in the port. The present request is
that we do some dredging in order to enlarge the entraince and make use of what
has cost some millions of dollars.
The
dredging will1 cost, according to the figure
I have ýgiven, the first item, $210,000, which
is the item that my honourable friend the
ex-Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Reid)
wants Vo strike out. Well, every one must
assume r.esponsibility for his own actions:
to govern is to foresee. If we strike out
this item, and if filling goeis on at the port
of Quebec, which ought to be equipped flot
only for the present but also for the future,
and if that port loses the advantages that
would accrue from the vote proposed, then
we must accept the consequences.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: May I ask the honourable gentleman how rnuch is the vote
that we are on now?
Hon. Mr. REID: A million and a haîf.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: IV is $210,000
for dredging work Vo be done during three
seasons, to enlarge the entranýce. Will my
honourable friend corne and look at the
plans? The enlargement of the entrance
will allow over 4,000 feet of wharfage to be
utilized which may otherwise go to waste.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I desire to raise
my voice in protest against votes of this
kind, in view of the present condition of
the country. As was pointed out by my
honourable friend frorn Hamnilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), in spite of an extra
$30,000,000 or $40,000,000 being imposed
in the way of sales Vax, 'and in spite of ahl
the other heavy taxes that the people have
Vo pay, it is now pro'posed Vo incur expenditures that wîll bring our total expenditures for the current year up to $100,000,000 more than the revenue in sight. In
the face of that situation' it seems foolish
to vote money Vo be expended for the next
three years. So far as one can judge by
the explanations on both sides of the
Hou-se, the building of the harbour at the
St. Charles river has beeýn a mistake.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, no, not
there.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: From what I know
of the harbour of Quebec, 1 believe that
farther west, along the St. Lawrence
shore, there is a depth of 35 or 40 feet of
water where this dredging could have been
done at much lesýs expense, and it would be
where the railway accomimodation is. However, it is done now. The only reason that
the Governinent can advanee for the extravagant expenditure now proposed is that
the sanie sort of thing, or worse, was done
Hon.

Mr. DANDURA4ND.

and is being done at St. John and to a
c-ertain extent, perhaps, at Halifax. I was
down at St. John hast year and looked at
Courtenay Bay.
How any man in his
senses could advocate dredging there, when
there is' so much better water all around,
is more than I have ever been able Vo understand. However, I arn speaking now
only with regard Vo the advisability under
present financial conditions of voting a
million and a haîf for work extending over
three years. Why depart from the usual
rnethod of voting what is necessary for the
work this year? Some dredging rnay be
necessary at Quebec to make the channel
wider Vo enable, vessels to get in behind
the wharves, and into the St. Charles river.
But there is a great deal of work proposed in this vote that is Vo 'my mind noV
necessary. Last year, when I had the
pleasure of going around that harbour,
there were facilities of all sorts-wharves
and elevators and ail other equipment for
a large amount of shipping: there was
everything but the shipping. There were
practically no steamboats and practically
no freight. So it seems to me that the
Governrnent are going beyond what is at
present necessary, and are doing so at a
time when we are not in a position to do
so. Every dollar expended there and on
other work will add that much to our
national debt, for the Finance Minister
says that we shaîl likely go hehind to the
'xtent of $100,000,000 this year. In the
iast two years we were frorn $70,000,000
to $80,000,000 short.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will rny honourable friend allow me to draw bis attention to this fact, that the item of $210,000
does not represent a vote of money: it represents the right of the Harbour Commissioners of Quebec Vo issue deentures
to that arnount during the Vhree years, according as the work proceeds.
By approving of this vote we shaîl be simply deciding
for the principle of carrying on the work.
The information I would convey Vo my honourable friend is that, if we do approve of
this vote, the work will take three years
and the $210,000 will cover that period.

well, but that does not affect the general
result.

rny honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) intimates, that as a great deal of
money bas already been expended there is
some justification for spending enough more

shall know better by another year. However, I just wanted to, make my protest
against the extravagant expenditures that
we are called upon to support, in connection
with the whole administration and on works
throughout the country. I 'have, saîd time
and again, in past Sessions, that from
$75,000,000 to $100,000,000 could be saved
every year without any public interest
sufferin-g at aIl. We have to impose extra
taxation on the poor-a great deal more
than on the rich-and they have to pay
these taxes, and the money deriNBd. from
them is thrown away on useless and extravagant expenditures.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? He says
that from $150,000,000 to $175,000,000 can
be saved.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No, I did not say
that. I said from $75,000,000 to $100,000,000.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Will the honourable gentleman kindly point out how?
Hon. Mr. REID: This is not really a
vote on an item of $200,000. There is
before us a Bill calling for a vote of
$1,500,000 for the Harbour Commission of
Quebec. I suggested to the Government
that they reduce that amount by what was
intended for construction.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: How
much is that?
Hon. Mr. REID: About $1,000,000.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Oh, it
is reduced, is it?
Hon. Mr. REID: No; I am asking that
it be reduced by $1,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On two items.
Hon. Mr. REID: On two items. The
details were given by the honourable leader
of the Government showing how this million and a haîf, is made up. 1 suppose
the details appear in Hansard. The amount
includes about $1,000,000 for construction
and haîf a million for eight or ten items
of repairs and renewals. 1 think the facîlities that are now at Quebec and being used
should be kept in a good state of repair
and maintained. In the total of $1,000,000 there is provision for a certain amount

of dredging to widen the entrance into the
berths. That is for new work. At the
entrance certain work was completed and
the vessels have been using it for a number
of years in coming into the berths. I take
the position that this is sufficient for a
number of years, and that under present
financial conditions it is not advisable to
proceed with that dredging until it is needed
for larger vessels going into that harbour.
I feel that there is plenty of time ahead
for us to consider that work. It will be
time enough to undertake it if at any time
in the future larger vessels are going to
use it. Therefore I take issue with the
Government and ask them to refuse the
proposed expenditure for dredging.
There is also an item of about $700,000
for the extension of the present pier, or
for some work at the upper entrance, towards the St. Charles river. It is admitted
by the honourable leader of the Government and by the officials of the Department
that inside the harbour there is already
4,000 feet of wharfage completed, with
tracks running through it, and with adequate elevator capacity.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
5,000 feet.
Hon. Mr. REID: I was putting it within the bounds in saying 4,000. In view of
the fact that we have had such facilities for several years, and that they have
not been utilized to their full capacity, my
request is that the Government defer new
construction work until financial conditions
improve. I asked the leader of the Government on Saturday if he would take the
matter up with the Government. I did not
wish to move an amendment. I thought
that if the facts were put before the Government they might consider reducing the
amount in the Bill. I stated that if the
honourable gentleman could not see his way
to reducing that figure; I would move my
amendment.
May I ask the honourable
gentleman again whether it is the intention of the Government to reduce the
amount mentioned in the Bill, or does he
wish me to move my amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The difficulty
I am in is this. I am advised by the engineer of the Harbour Commissioners of
Quebec and by the officials of the Marine
and Fisheries Department that this 4,000
or 5,000 feet of wharfage, splendàdly
equipped, as my honourable friend bas said,
will be threatened and left unused and
wasted if this dredging is not done, and if
the continuation of the Louise embankHon. Mr. REID.

ment quay wall in the river St. Charles
in a westerly direction for a length of 600
feet, to make a junction with the lock
wall in the river St. Charles, is not completed. On the other hand, if this work
is done, there will be 500 feet more of
wharfage, and the constant movement cf
the sand towards the present 4,000 feet
of wharfage, thus reducing the depth of
water at the wharves, will be prevented.
It would seem that this expenditure of
$1,000,000 was needed 'in order to permit
of the u-se of the inside wharves in order
to enable the large steamers to reach them.
J have already intimated that these sandbanks are dangerous to large steamers,
which have refra'ined from going in. In
view of the fact that some millions of dollars have been expended already, is this
dredging not worth while?
My honourable friend says that this work
is not needed because there is enough
wharfage on the St. Lawrence side. My
information is that even to-day the wharfage at times is not sufficient, and that
steamers have to wait for a chance tc
reach the wharf. We are not discussing
the pol1icy of expenditures that have been
incurred up to the present time.
The
money bas been spent. The question now
is whether it is good policy to do the
dredging necessary to utilizing the facilihies already there, and to continue the
work of completing the junction between
the Louise embankment and the lock walls
of the St. Charles river.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Do the engineers
say that in order to utilize the present
work and to prevent the coming in of sand,
the building of this 500 feet of wharf is
necessary?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, they
make that statement.
Hon.
Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I
understood my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) and also the honourable
gentleman
from
Quebec
(Hon.
Mr.
L'Espérance) to say that this expenditure
of $1,000,000 was to be made for the purpose of providing facilities at the docks for
vessels of 40 feet draft.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, no; my
honourable friend is in error.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
There
is another thing.
Will the honourable
gentleman explain why it is necessary or
desirable to pass at this Session a larger
amount than it is expected will be expended in a year?

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend was flot in the Chamber when
I gave the answer to that question. There
is no money voted. That is siniply an
enabling Act in favour of the Harbour
Comniissioners of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. LNYCH-STAUNTON:

comniits us to the $1,500,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But it

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Why
should we be committed this year to expenditures to be made in the next three
years any more than to expenditures for
the next twenty years?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the
usual procedure followed in such cases.
We are allowing the Harbour Commissioners to, borrow up to $1,500,000, but each
item will have to be approved by the
Department of Marine and Fisheries and
passed by Order in Council. The $210,000
for dredging is set down in virtue of a
programme which it is declared will require three years for completion; but the
debentures will be issued as the work goes
along. When engineers say that this
dredging is necessary to énable ships to
reach this 4,000 or 5,000 feet of wharfage,
and to utilîze a work which has been
carried on for the last four or five years,
how can I refuse to ask for this $210,000?
I suggest that my honourable friend should
reconsider his amendment to strike out
that particular item?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend how long this 4,000 feet
of wharfage has been in use? How long
bas it been constructed?
Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: 5,000
feet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It took five
or six years to construct that work. It was
started in 1914 and was finished around
1920.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It was cornmenced in 1914?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is my
information.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
The exchairman of the Harbour Commission is
better informed than 1.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Only this
morning I was reading the report of the
Special Committee of this House, of which
the honourable gentleman from Quebec

(Hon. Mr. L'Espérance) was Chairman,
and which had to deal with the matter of
traffic through the port of Quebec. In the
report I noticed reference to the fact, if
it is a fact, that whereas in 1916 a substantial quantity of grain had passed
through the elevators of Quebec, flot one
bushel liad passed through sinice 1916. 1
therefore assume that these 5,000 feet of
wharf, and the large elevators on the river
-St. Charles, have not been in general use
since that tixne. I understand also that
boats corne in day after day and land
passengers and mails along the edge of the
St. Lawrence at the deep water docks there,
but the freight cargoes are not loaded at
the city of Quebec, the boats, with the
exception of perhaps two or three of th-~
very largest, going to the port of Montreai.
We ail know that water transportation is
cheaper tha-n transportation by rail. That
is true the world over, and I do flot think
it can be justly contended that the facilities of the port of Quebec should be further increased until business warrants
the increase. -This House last Saturdav
voted $5,000,000 for the port of Montreai
without one word of criticism-why? Because the port of Montreal bas paid its
way-it bas paid interest on the inivestment and more-and under such conditions this House should not hesitate to do
everything ýnecessary to help in the expansion of that port. But in the port of
Quebec this country has spent from
$7,000,00fl to $8,000,000, and not one single
cent of interest has been repaid on thc
investment. The figures submitted by the
leader of the Government indicate that the
operating deficit exceeds $106,000, yet they
corne to u.9 and ask for the expenditure of
another $1,500,000 in a place where there
are idie wharves already. I submit that
that is not good business.
Now, I wis'h to make a somewhat personal reference. Liast Saturday afternoon
an honourable gentleman in this House
fram the -province of Quebec approached
me and charged me with opposing this
legisiation because the work was located
in the province of Quebec. I want to state
that nobody concurred more gladly than I
did in the voting of the money for the deveiopment of the port of Montreal. I
would also point out that not less than ten
days ago 1 oppo-sed what I thought was an
unnecessary and unwarranted expenditure
of money in my own native county in the
province of Ontario. It is not because of
any special feeling against the province of
Quebec that 1 take this stand in this

Mr.

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. Mr. REID: 1 judge from the remnarks of the leader of the Government that
it is flot his intention to reduce this amount,
and therefore I wilI move my amendment.
Before doing so, however, I want to Tefer
again to the two items that are really
covered by my amendmnent. But one item
for dredging that bas been mentioned and
emphasized by the leader of the Government is not dredging of material that flows
into the river, for that was completed
but is for new work altogether, away out
at the entrance to the berths that have
been completed. The Harbour Commission
completed an entrance of 650 or 800 feet in
width for any vessel to enter the harbour
and along theSt. Lawrence where the Empresses moor, and that entrance, so, far
as I have ever heard, has been quite sufficient since the work bas been completed.
1 have neyer heard until now of any request from the Harbour Commission to
widen that entrance. Therefore, this being
new work, and the other work having
been satisfactory for ýso many years, I feel
that this is not the proper time to proceed
with this new work.
The other item is to, extend the pier away
up towards theSt. 'Charles river, or to complete the additional 500 or 600 feet of new
pier. Already we have 4,000 or 5,000 feet
of pier there now, and it bas not at any
time been used to, its capacity. In xny judgment, the work included in that item of
$700,000 odd should flot be carried on at
present.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is that part of the
$1,500,000?
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes; that is new work.
We have 4,000 or 5,000 feet complèted, and
this would make it 400 or 500 feet more.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What do you say
as to the argument that this addition of
500 feet is essential to the other?
Hon. Mr. REID: There is nothing in it
whatever, in my judgment, and I have been
there and know the whole situation thoroughly. Those 500 feet would extend the
work up to the bridge that crosses over to
Limoilou.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would that prevent
the sand from coming down?
Hon. Mr. REID: There is nothing coming
down there now; it is flot ~filing in.
It would be a good haîf mile ont.
There is a 85-foot navigation there
now along those 4,000 feet, and I dlaimi
that that should ba allowed to remain un-

S-40

tii this work is proceeded with, if it ever
is. I think the view of the previous Harbour Commission was that if new work
were to be done it should ha to build new
piers and warehouses from Champlain market west along the Transcontinental railway.
.Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: What Commission does the honourable gentleman
refer to?
Hon. Mr. REID: The Harbour Commission. I understood that that was their
view. 1 neyer understood, from any of the
Harbour Commissioners with whom. I
talked, that it was advisable to continue
that ýSt. Charles river work away up
through the river as it was laid ont on
this plan. Now 1 beg leave to move this
amendment, seconded by Hon. G. D. Robertson:
That section 2 be amnended by atriking out
the words "one niilon"' in lunes 4 and 6 in
said section, and adding the words -mainten-

ance and repairs,"1 In Une 6, after the word
"the'.
That leaves the full amount that the hionourable leader of the Government said to
us on Saturday was necessary for ail repairs, and to put the plant, if 1 may so caîl
it, into first-class condition for operation
in the niost economical way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would asic
xny honourable friend if he would not consider this proposaI: that he test the feeling
of the Senate on the two items separately;
submitting the item for the new construction work and extension of the wharf,
which represents an expenditure of $700,000, by itself, and separately test the Senate
on the question of adding dredging at the
entrance to the port?
Hon. Mr. REID: I could net very well
do that, because the dredging is new work,
not in the channel at ahl; it is to widen the
entrance. In my judgnient, if even a 650-foot
channel bas, been sufficient for some years,
it is adequate for many years to corne.
Therefore I would not feel justified ini
voting that the dredging be donie. Then,
as te the new pier, I believe, from my
knowledge of the conditions, that it is not
required at ahl. Even if the number of
vessels coming there s'hould increase, it
would ha man-y yearsf before that would
ha required, if ever. For these reasons I
would rather submnit the two amounts, togetber, and. test the Senate on both.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But you have
this difficulty, that there may be Senators

REVISED uDrrON

626

SENATE

who would desire to maintain the item for
the dredging, but who would follow my
honourable friend on his a-mendment to eut
out the extension. There is an extension
of wh'arfage which would serve a double
object, as I understand, which would represent $700,000. On the other item, there
is a demand for $200,000. So it seems that
dealing with those two matters separately
instead of combining them would be doing
justice to the two claims.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Might I point
out to my honourable friend that section 2
of this Bill does not divide into items the
various expenditures proposed; and also
th'at item 18 of the memorandum which he
read last Saturday for the expenditure of
about $125,000 was for the building of a
certain pier which the honourable mover of
this amendment mentioned at that time as
work that in his opinion was wholly unnecessary. Se that out of the $500,000, if the
amendment is adopted, there would be
available approximately $125,000 to carry
on dredging work, if the Harbour Commissioners so desire. This would provide
ample funds for any dredging work that
may occur to the Commission as being required.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I would like to ask
the honourable leader a question. I understand that in 1912 a Commission was appointed for the port of Quebec, and that
a scheme was proposed for the improvement of that harbour. Is this part of the
original scheme as laid out for the port in
1912, or is it something new?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is not new.
It is part of the plan.
Hon. Mr. REID: It is part of the original plan, but it is new work as compared
with what was done and completed in 1919.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is part of
the comprehensive plan laid out in 1912
and 1913.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: It was contemplated in 1912, and proposed by the engineers who planned the improvements for
the port of Quebec; is that right?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, by a
select firm of engineers from England who
were retained at that time.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would like
to ask the honourable member for Grenville if his amendment takes out the item
of $210,000 which appears on page 633 of
the Debates, and item $729,152, which appears on page 634, making a total of $930,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

152? Is that the object of the amendment?
Hon. Mr. REID: That is really the object
of the amendme'nt.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
understand it as it reads.

Then I do not

Hon. Mr. REID: My amendment strikes
out $1,000,000, roughly, and leaves $500,000
that the Harbour Commission may use as
they and the Government may agree. When
I read those items on Saturday as given
by the leader of the Government, I thought
that those two items, amounting roughly to
$950,000, should not be proceeded with,
There was another item of $50,000 for an
award. That would make about $1,000,000,
in round numbers.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: What is that
award?
Hon. Mr. REID: There was a firm in
Quebec that had a claim against the Harbour Commission, and the Commission
handed it to the Government. The Government said to the Minister of Justice: "Put
it in to the Exchequer Court." That Court
gave an award of some $50,000. It was
appealed to the Supreme Court, who held
that it should be paid. Accordingly, at
last Session the late Government put the
amount in the Estimates, feeling that as
the courts. had awarded $50,000 it should
be paid. At that time objection was taken
by a member of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: From Gaspé?
Hon. Mr. REID: I do not know where
it was, but at all events it was from the
Opposition side. He said he could prove
that the Whole thing was a fake-at least,
that was the meaning of it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Fraud?
Hon. Mr. REID: Fraud. Then the Government withdrew the amount. The present Prime Minister also, refused to allow
it to pass. A commission was granted. No
action was taken by those who made the
charges to disprove the item. The position I take is that the amount should be
paid, but that the present Government
should acknowledge that they were wrong.
They should first carry on the investigation that was started, and if after they
investigate it, they say that that amount
should be paid, I think it should be paid.
Until then I say it should be withheld, but
I am in favour of paying it.

REJECTED

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 141, an Act ta
repeal the Lake of the Woods Regulation
Act, 1921.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a very short Bill, but it deals with a
question the history ai which I desire ta
give in a few words ta, the bouse, in
order ta, refresh the memory of the meinbers wha were present with us last
Session, and ta inforin honourable Senators who have entered this Chamber since.
The matter refers ta the control of works
on the Winnipeg River, which has its
source in the Lake af the Woods, and ani
the English River, which flows into the
Winnipeg River some distance below, but
in the province ai Ontario. The legislation
which we passed hast year, and which comprised two Acts, duly assented ta, and
placed on the statute book, was înitiated
under the following circumstances:

SENATE
The International Joirnt Commission, ln its
flndings in the Lake of the Woods reference
matter, reported to the Governments of Canada
and of the United States, on Jane 12th, 1917,
and among other things recommended that the
levels and outflow of the Lake of the Woods
should be controlled by the appropriate authorlty in Canada in order that:
(a) the leveis of the Lake be malntained between elevations 1056 and 1061 ; and
(b) dependabie flow be furnished from the
Lake in the interest of ail concerned.
At the time of the Commission'2 report, the
Norman Dam at the outiet of the Lake, the
main factor in its control. was being operated
by the Department of Publie Woris of Ontario,
upon the the advice of engineers in the Dominion Water Power Brancmi of the Department
of the Interior.
A very heavy flood occurring fl the sumnier
of 19163 precipitated a situation which demanded
a more formaI, deflite and responsibie method
of control. Consistent with the Cco'nmlssion'a recomimendations and following informai conferences witb certain representatives of the
Governments of Canada and Ontario, i was
agreed that a joint Control Board bie set up
by Order ie Council. Accordingly, upon the representation of the then Minister of .the
Interior, the Governor ln Ceuncil, on the 21st
.lanuary, 1919, constltuted a Lake of the Woods
Control Board, to consist of four qualified civil
engineers. two to represent Canada and two
to represent the Province of Ontario. The two
Dominion engineers appeinted in this connection were Mr. W. J. Stewart and Mr. J. B.
Chaliies. On the lIth February, 1919, a provincial Order in Council was passed for the samne
purposes. and appointed Mn. H. G. Acres and
Mr. L. V. Horke as the two provincial members
of the Beard.
One of the main functions of this Board was
"te considen and take appropniate action through
the proper authorites of the Dominion and Provincial 'Govennments, te secure aIl necessary
authority and te bave everything done to enable the Board to carry out the purpose and
intent of this Minute".
IConsistent with the inesponsibility specifically mentioned, the Contiol Board urged that
a confenence bie cailed of representatIves of the
Oovernments of the Dominion, of Ontario and
cf Manitoba, for the purpose of arriving ai
some deflnite and mutually satisfactory arrangement whereby certain requisite statutony authority could be given te the Cintrol Board.
This conference was beld ln the office of the
then -Minister of the Interior. the Honounable
Sir James Lougheed, on January 3lst
1 1921.*
At this conference the concurrent legisiation
acheme was agreed te.

This concurrent

legislation

was to

be

passed by the Federal Parlianient and by
the Legisiature of Ontanio. They agreed
upon a joint Bill te be introduced into the
two Houses for the purpose cf appcinting
a joint Board of Control of the Lake of
the Woods and the Winnipeg and English
river works. The agreement is contained
in chapter 10 cf the Statutes of last year,
the preamble of which reads as follows:
Whereas it bas been agreed by and between
the Government of the Dominion of Canada and
the Govennment cf tbe province of Ontario
Hon. Mr. DANDURtAND.

that the powers bereinaften mentioned shahl be
vested in a Board consisting cf f rur members,
two to be appointed by the Governor General
in Coucoul and two by the Lieutenant Governor
in Council and that the necessary legisiation
te authonize the saine shahl be enacted by the
1
F ariiament cf 'Canada and the Legisiature ef
Ontario respectively.

The Bill was submitted toïboth branches
cf this Parliament, and was passed. Hon.
Mr. Drury, Prime Minister cf Ontario,
introduced a siniil-ar Bill in the Ontario
legisiature. But on the 28th cf April he
addressed te the Prime Minister cf Canada
the following communication:
Ie view of the fact tbat thq Lake cf the
Woods Control Bili was opposed iast nigbt in
tbe flouse by the Liberai Opposition and tbe
Conservative opposition as well as from tbe
Government side it was found lnadvlsabie te
press second reading under circumstances that
pointed te the probable defeat ef tbe measure.
In witbdnawing the Bil] I mnade tbe announcement that if then desired It wolild be reintroduced next session.
I respectfully urge tbat
in the meantime the present control arrangenient be continued an.d assure you cf tbe
thonough co-operation of this Government te
ensure the best resuits for ail the interests Involved.
E. C. Drury.

He was asking that the Control Board
appointed under the Order in Council, and
which was in existence at that tume, should
be continued. 'On the 29th cf April the
Prime Minister cf Canada answered as
fohlows:
I have your teiegram cf yesterday. I regret
very much indeed that thic Lake cf the Woods
Controi Biii is not te be passed by tbe Ontario
Legislature tbis session. It bas tlready passed

I wili take up the matter cf continuing the
present Control Board with the Mirister cf tbe
Interior and can assure you that we will endeavour to do so if samne can lbe effectiveiy done.
Faithfuliy yours,
Arthlur Meigben.

Between the 29th cf April and the latter
part cf May the Federal Government decided te pass legisiation ta fill the gap between that time and the tume when the
legisiature cf Ontario would *be ready te
impiement its undertaking, and pass the
Joint Control Act. The Act which was

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. The
second Act passed, chapter 38, an Act respecting the Lake of the Woods and other
waters, contained this clause:
If the necessary Iegisiation of Ontario re-

ferred to In the preamble of tac Lake of the
Woods Control Board Act, 1921. be enacted by

by proclamation, published In the Canada
Gazette, repeal or suspend this Act and the
regulations macde thereunder at any trne when
or atter the Lake of the Woods Control Board
Act, 1921, shall corne into force.

If the clause had stopped there, there
would be no difficulty now. But there is a
proviso upon which there may be some
divergence of opinion in this Chamber,
as there was in the other. It is as follows:
Provided that notwlthstanding any repeal or
suspension of this Act In the manner .provided
by this section the works and each of thern
hereby declared to be for the general advantage
of Canada shall remain and continue to be
works for the general advantage of Canada.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will niy honourable friend tell us inow whether there
were any regulations made under chapter
38 or chapter 10?

been appolnted under the Orders in Council that preceded this legislation were continued in office.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And they had

Yes, there
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
were regulations under that Order in Council.
On the 26th of May, the right honourable the Prime Minister made the followir.g statement:

On May 31, the Prime Minister said:

Ontario, whlch did not go througn; no our for.
mer Bill la vahueles.. The present ineasure la
designed to hold the situation ln the ineantirne.

Welh, honourable gentlemen, the legislature of Ontario, during its hast session,
passed concurrent legisîstion in the very
ternis of chapter 10 of 1921. Before doing

631

so, Mr. Drury came to, Ottawa and asked
the Prime Minister and sorne other members of the Government whether, if he
carried out his part of the agreement and
obtained from the Legisiature its sanction
of the Bill which he had introduced, the
Federal Government would deem it its
duty to withdraw chapter 38. The ýGovernment examined into the situation and decided that it would abide by the undertaking of the precedin'g Prime Minister and
his Administration. Hence the present Bill.
I draw the attention of honourable gentlemen of this Chamber to the fact thait the
works that are covered by the Act which
-itis now sought to repeal are wholly within
the province of Ontario, and interest that
province in the highest degree. Manitoba
is interested also, but not in the samne way.
Manitoba is interested in the maintenance
of a certain level of water in the lower
part of the Winnipeg river. Manitoba does
flot appear very prominently in these
negotiations, because the Federal Government, through the f act that the lands of
the province of Manitoba are vested in the
Dominion of Canada, was principalhy representing the interests of that province in
seeing that it suffered no injury from the
controlling of the waters from the Lake of
the Woods to the line of division between
Ontario and Manitoba.
It would seem strange, in view of the
agreement between the parties, if Ontario
was to be deprived of its control over waters
and works wholly within that province.
The action of the present Government, in
moving to repeal the Act is based upon
what the Government believes to be a
solemn enactnient, undertaking, or agreement, which should be adhered to, between
Governaients, as welh as between individuals. The agreement was a simple one.
It could not be carried out hast year. The
Prime Minister of Ontario asiced the Prime
Minister of Canada if there was still time
to carry out the agreement. The Prime
Minister last year had declared that the
second Act was for the sole purpose og filling the gap until the Ontario Legisiature
had carried out its part of the undertaking.
The Ontario Legisiature having now done
so, it seems that it is our duty, in dealing
fairly between the two Governments, to
hive up to the understanding.
There is another reason, which I think
should strike honourable gentlemen in this
Chamber. It is the f set that the Dominion
of Canada, in xnovir'g towards a Joint Control Bill, has been actuated principally by
a cali from the province of Manitoba, 'which

632

SENATE

it was bound to protect because it held
its lands; and it would seem somewhat
extraordinary if the Dominion of Canada
were to claim the whole authority when
there would appear to be a simple solution.
I do not know whether there will be any
objection to this legislation. The facts
seem to be simple. Shall the province of
Ontario be deprived of its control of lands
and of works wholly within the province,
more especially after it has agreed to a
joint control in order to benefit or give
greater protection to the province of Manitoba, which is solely interested in the lower
part of the Winnipeg river? I am quite
sure that what was true in April of last
year is true in June, 1922. In April last
year my honourable friend succeeded in
arranging a satisfactory agreement between
the province of Ontario and the province of
Manitoba, except for the last proviso in
clause 10. I do not see any reason why that
proviso should be retained. The situation,
if this Act is repealed, will simply be that
which existed in the minds and in the will
of the Dominion of Canada and of Ontario
and Manitoba in March and April of last
year. If there is any new reason that has
arisen to vary that arrangement between
Ontario, Manitoba, and the Dominion of
Canada, I have yet to hear of it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The question
has occurred to me, but I have not studied
it out at all, whether carrying out the
agreement for the joint control would not
necessitate the declaration that the work
is for the general advantage of Canada?
How can the Dominion be a party to an
agreement of that sort, or how can the
agreement be carried out, unless the Dominion has some interest in it?
How can
any joint control, or any kind of control, be
exercised over this property, which is in
Ontario, unless the Act contains some declaration such as the one we are going to
take out of it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer is
in the statement I made, that the Dominion
of Canada was in the right of Manitoba
because it held all the public lands of that
province, and nobody ever questioned the
right of the Dominion of Canada to legislate along with Ontario for a joint control.
If my honourable friend will look at
chapter 10 of 1921 he will find that he himself was a party to the passing of this
legislation:
Whereas it has been agreed by and between
the Government of the Dominion of Canada and
the Government of the Province of Ontario that
iHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the powers hereinatter mentioned shall be
vested in a Board consisting of four members,
two to be appointed by the Governor General
in Council and two by the Lieutenant Governor
in Council an:d that the necessary legislation
to authorize the same shall be enacted by the
Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of
Ontario respectively:

There was no statement that those works

were to come exclusively under the Federal
jurisdiction by declaration that they were
for the general advantage of Canada, and
yet my honourable friend and the Senate
and the House of Commons passed the Act
by which that joint control was established,
and it was only when the second Act was
passed that it was deemed appropriate
to add that clause.
If it was not
deemed
necessary
when
chapter
10
was enacted, I for one do not see
that it is necessary now, and, since an arrangement has 'been arrived at between the
Federal Government representing Manitoba
and the province of Ontario, I have not yet
heard a good reason why we should go back
upon that agreement.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is never too
late to learn.
At the time chapter 10 was
passed probably the attention of Parliament
was not drawn to the position .I am now
taking.
I cannot remember that the matter was discussed in either House.
The
more I think of it the more it seems to me
that my position is absolutely correct. My
honourable friend cites Chapter 10, but I
retort by reciting chapter 38, in which the
declaration was inserted because it was
considered necessary at that time.
I have
not heard any reason why the declaration
in chapter 38 was not right.
How are
you going to insist on exercising a control
over some property which is wholly situated
in one province?
You cannot do that.
It is only by declaring it to be a
work for the general advantage of Canada
that you can continue to have a status in
that agreement.,
Your status is gone if
you take that out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAiND:
I am not
ready to agree with that statement. The
Federal Government was in the right of
Manitoba in agreeing to pass concurrent
legislation with Ontario, which held the
powers in those lands, and I do not see
that the Federal Government needed to
declare that the works were for the general advantage of Canada. If it did so,
it did not need to consult Ontario.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But the need for
the declaration was because it was going
to be a joint control.

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. *Mr. DANDURAND: A joint Act
of Parliament was to be passed concurrently by Ontario and by Ottawa. The Federal
Parliament did pass chapter 10 in conformity with the agreenment, that my honourable friend is thinking we had brought
inte being. The legislature did flot pass
the legisiation at the succeeding session,
and the Prime Minister of Canada at that
tume said: " Because the legisiature did
not aid us at the succeeding session, therefore we should be free." We should be
free il the province had decided to hold
up the agreement, but he did not say that.
He said, on the contrary, in his speech, in
explaining the Bill:
Mr. Meighen: The previeus bill, already
passed, was inleuded to be c.>ncurrent wlth
legislation by the province of Ontario whlch
did net go through, s0 our former bill le valueless. The present measure le d,,sIgned te hold
the situation lu the meantime, unti;, If it should
corne to pass, the Ontario Legelature enaotsthe
concurrent legislation contempiated.

Andý later on:
It le oniy because, through no fault of ours,
but eutlreiy threugh the fault ef the Goverunment or the Legislature of Otarlo-I do net care
where the blame le placed-but I thlnk It Io
chiedly on the shouldere ef the Premier ef
Ontario by reason of hie failure te carry through
the, joint legislatlou-we a~re comruelled te take
the position whlch, we are taklng now to ask
that Parliament vest us with at.*horlty te serve
the intereets of beth provinces and the whole
country untîl we are able te effect the joint
legisiation for wh'lch we strove lu the first place.

Se that the Prime Minister of Canada
did not withdraw because Ontario had
fallen down. No; he said: "When Ontario
is ready to implement "-he did net state
the time, but he certainly gave 'Ontario as
far as the fo'llowing Session.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Has the honourable
gentleman the Ontario sitatute?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Ontario
statute that was passed, is absolutely on ail
fours with the agreement entered into by
the Ontario Government and the Federal
authorities.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have no objection to the BiRi personallv. It is not
because I amn opposed te what the Government wants te do, but 1 amn drawing attention, which I think is niy duty, or the
duty of any one else who might have the
idea, to the fact that we are introducing a
serious constitutional question. For my
part I want te warn the Governmient that
if they carry eut this Bill their status
under this joint agreement has ceased, and
they will not be able to insist any -longer
on having any kind of control. over those
works.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But chapter
10Hon. -Mr. BELCOURT: I do flot care
what chapter 10 says; we have a constitution which siays that this Parlianient has
noi juTisdiction orver provincial niatters.
That is the point I arn making.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE'ED: I propose, before sitting down, to mtove that
this 3111 be flot now read the second time,
but be read the second time this day three
months. May I say, for the information of
the House-possibly some honourable gentleman may have overlooked it-that in
January, 1909, the United States and Great
Britain entered into a treaty dealing with
the boundary, to prevent disputes regarding the use of boundary waters, but aiso
among other things--te settie ail questions which arc now pendlng

between the United States and the Dominion
of Canada invoiving the rights. obligations or
intereste of either lu relation to t7:e other or to
the inhabitauts of the other, aiong their common frondier, and te make provision for the
adjustment and settiement of ail such questions that may hereafter arise.

Rn pursuance of that treaty the representatives of 'both Governments, known as
the International Joint Commission, were
set in motion for the purpose of determining one of the questions in disipute, and
I read froni the letter of June, 1912:
The questions so referred te th.- Commission
are as follows:
1. In order to secure the most advantageous
use of the waters of the Lake of the Woods and
ef the waters tlowiug into and fi om the laits
on each side ef the boundary for domestie aud
sani*tary purposes, for navigation and transportation purposes, for fishing purposes, and for
power and irrigation purpses, an)d also in order
to secure the niost advantageous use of the
shores and harbours of the lake and of the
waters flowing into and from the lake, le It
practicabie and desirable to maintain the surface of the lake during the different seasous
of the year at a certain stated level. and if sO
at what level?
2. If a certain 9tated level is recommended
lu anewer te question No. 1, and if such level
la higher than the normal or natural level of
the lake, te what extent, If at ail, would the
lake when nriaintained at such level, overflow
the lowlands upon its southeru border, or
elsewhere on its border, and what la the value
of the lande which would be submerged?
3. Iu what way or mauner, lncluding the contruction and operation, of dams or other works
at the outiets and inlets of the lake, or In the
waters which. are directiy or indirectly tributary
to the lake, or otherwise, le Lt possible and
advlsable te regulate the volum6, use and outtlow of the waters of the lake so as te maintain the level recommended lu answer te Question No. 1, and by what means or arrangement
rau the preper construct!on and operation of
regulating works, or a sYstLem or method of
regulation, be best secured and niaintalned lu

SENATE
order to insure the adequate protection and
development of all the interests involved on
both sides of the boundary, with the least possible damage to all rights and interests, both
public and private, which may be affected by
maintaining the proposed level?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is the Lake of
the Woods mentioned in that Treaty?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
not a copy of the Treaty before me, but the
United States joined in submitting these
particular questions to the International
Joint Commission.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And there is no
doubt that those waters were included?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No
doubt, because the International Joint Commission, made up of the representatives of
those two Governments, the United States
Government and the Government of Canada, proceeded to examine into those matters, and to report, and I now propose to
read one of its conclusions on dealing with
question No. 1:
Whenever the level of the lake rises to 1,061
sea level datum, water shall be wasted or conserved as directed by the Commission under
the system of international supervision and
control hereinafter recommended, and between
1,056 and 1061 water may be drawn from the
lake by the appropriate authority in Canada for
the benefit of Canadian interests, provided, however, that the level of the lake shall not, even
toward the end of a series of dry years, be
drawn below 1,056 sea lavel datum.

The senior member for Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) asked me whether this particular subject was regarded as coming
within the Treaty, and I now quote from
the report of the Commission dealing more
particularly with the Norman dam, because the question of the control of the
Norman dam is really the storm-centre of
this whole question.
So that honourable gentlemen may understand the more specific question that is
agitating the Ontario Government, I may
say that there is a dam known as the Norman dam at the outlet of the Lake of the
Woods, and that was recently purchased
by Mr. Backus, a very enterprising captain
of industry, one of the leading ones in the
United States, who appreciated the advantage it would be to hold the key to the
situation. He is therefore not only master
of the Norman dam, but to a very large
extent master of the Ontario Government
at present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is that justifiable?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
so. I think honourable gentlemen present
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

who are familiar with all the details of
this very important question are likewise
familiar with the very important role that
Mr. Backus plays on that particular stage.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend is spoiling a good case, I am afraid.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
what the Commission said in reference to
the Norman dam:
The regulation of the outflow from the Lake

of the Woods involves the use of controlling
works. The present Norman Dam in the western outlet is well adapted to such use. Although
built for power purposes, it has sufficient wasteway capacity to discharge all the flood water
that need ever be drawn from the lake through
this outlet.

Before I deal with the other phasesHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before my honourable friend proceeds, will he tell us just
what the International Commission dild
under the reference, if anything?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
made recommendations to this Government,
which the Government proceeded to carry
out, and it is in order to carry out those
recommendations that this legislation is
now brought down.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I stated the
same thing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes; I
am not contraverting the position taken
by my honourable friend. Under chapter
10 of the Statutes of 1921 an arrangement
was entered into, as outlined by my honourable friend the leader of the Government, for a joint control by the two Governments, the federal Government and the
Government of Ontario. Mr. Drury, the
Premier of Ontario, visited Ottawa, and
after a conference expressed his hearty
willingness to join in that joint control,
and not only to do that but to pass the necessary legislation to exercise control over
the Norman dam. That was left in rather
a nebulous state. Mr. Drury at that time
was not fully convinced as to how he could
intervene with this Government in dealing
with that question, but as to the general
proposal he was heartily in favour of it,
recognizing at the same time that the Norman dam was the key to the situation for
the control of the waters of the Lake of
the Woods.
The Parliament of Canada in all good
faith placed this Act, chapter 10, upon the
statute book. Honourable gentlemen can
read it, and it will be observed that the
purpose was that the two Governments
should exercise a joint control. Mr. Drury

JUNE 26, 1922
could nlot implement the promise which hie
had made to'the Governinent of Canada
to pass legisiation by which the Ontario
Government would unite with this Government in the joint contral. Our statute
was no sooner placed upon the statute book
than the interested parties in Ontario
began to play politics with the wbole subject, and that is the reason why Mr. Drury
was unable to pass the legisiation which. he
had in view.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Who coniposed -the
opposition?
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
fact is that, in my judgment, he neyer
made a genuine trial to pass that legislation. He introduced the Bill and then
dropped it. Mr. Backus at once protested
against the legisiation, and Mr. Drury
naturally looked to the representations
which Mr. Backus made on that occasion.
By the way, I may say that there bas
been no more favoured child of the Government of Ontario than Mr. Backus. Mr.
Backus bas been practicall-y given concessions in the province of Ontario representing almost an empire. I amn not criticising or finding fault with Mr. Backus.
That is bis business. He is a captain of
industry, a prince of pulp manufacturers.
He is here for that particular business.
Could niy
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
hon. friend state during what period-is it
lately, or during the last year or two--Mr.
Backus bas obtained those immense concessions?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
My honourable friend, I suppose, wants
us more particularly to go back previous
t'O 1896.
No. I would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
like to know if it was from Mr. Drury that
he got those concessions.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say for my honouratble friend's information
that it was from Mr. Drury.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He- wants to
give everybody bis dtxe.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Most
valuable concessions. But I amn not eriticising Mr. Backus for that. Mr. Backus
bas facilities in securing a very large
volume of American capital for tbe purpose of developing Canadian resources and
pouring the profits into the financial coffers
of tbe great republic to the soutb of us.
Possi'bly we are unable to develop our own
resources to ýthe extent that our good

635

friends the capitalists of the United
States are prepared to do. More particularly of late, as the pulp industry bas been
a very profitable one, our friends in the
United States have looked with a very
covetous eye on the resources which we in
Canada possess, with a view to the develop..
ment of those resources. But, I may say,
Mr. Backus is probably the largest pulp
manufacturer in the province of Ontario, or
bas the largest limits, which he bas received
These
from the Ontario Government.
forces in Ontario, having joined hands,
prevented Mr. TDrury, .apparently4 from
putting through the joint legisiation.
The consequence was that this Government found itsèlf confronted with a situation which governed the very important
investments that had been made in the
province of Manitoba. To honourable
gentlemen who may nlot be familiar with
the situation in Manitoba, let me explain
that the large power industries, in which
millions have been expended, depend upon
the flow of water in the Winnipeg river,
and if there be any interference with the
Winnipeg river by which that flow is
stopped, then Manitoba is deprived of the
power upon which she absolutely depends
for the operation of ail those industries.
In order that you may have saine appreciation of the enormrnas amount of money
which bas been invested in the province of
Manitoba for the developinent of power,
and of the degree te whidh the successthe very existence-of these investments depends upon the minantenance of the flow of
water in the Winnipeg river, which is regulated by the Lake of the Woods waters,
let me give you just an inkling of se
of the investments which have been made
there. For instance, the Winnipeg Electric
Company -bas approximately $8,000,000 in
power develoipient. The Manitoba Power
Company, Limited, bas $7,500,000; the city
of Winnipeg has $10,000,000; the province
has $2,500,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has that
developinent been during the last twelve
months?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That developinent has been going on for some
years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But niy honourable frîend made that agreement for
joint control.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Cer.
tainly. That is the only way we can give
protection to those interests. If we fail te

336

SENATE

give protection to those interests, then
they are wiped out at one feIl swoop.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But chapter 10 was the extent to which nxy
honourable friend intended to give them
protection.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I amn
coming to that in a moment, and I venture
to say my honourable friend will agree
that chapter 10 was inadequate, in view
of the subsequent conditions which arose.
I say that if there had been good faith
between the two Governments as to the
exercise of control without the intervention of any interested parties, whose interests would be thus affected, that might
have been sufficient; but we had no sooner
placed upon the statute ibook this legislation for the co-o'peration of Ontario,
hased upon the mutual good will of the
two Governments, than we became convinced that the legisiation would be inadequate The Government had to have
something more. The Government had to.
have a pronouncement that the work was
for the general advantage of Canada.
My honeurable friend has asked why
was not the assurance of the Ontario
Government suficient. The Ontario G-overnment could have passed this legisiation one day and repealed it the next, and
where would the legisiation of the Dominion Parliament ho? Where would be
the interests of the province of Manitoba
if the Ontario Government should at any
time repoal its legisiation and withdraw
from mutual control and exorcise the
arbitrary powers which they claimed ta
have? Consequently it became necessary
for the Federal Government to declare:
"We shall exorcise to the limit whatever
rights we have in those promises." In
doing se they simply invoked the right to
assure adequate protection being given to
those inte.rests.
I hold in my hand a letter from Mr.
Julien Smith, Supervising Engineer of the
Manitoba Power Company, Limited. I
understand he is an engineer very welI
known in the city of Montreal. He writes
to me:
I feel It my duty te protest against the
passing of the proposed Bill which ia now before the Parliament off Canada, by which the
former Act concerning the control off the Lake
off the Woods la te be altered.

That is to say, he is opposed ta this
legisiation which my honourable friend has
introduced to-day.
The :banking interesta who have flnanced the
seven and a haîf million dollars off bonds of
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

the Manitoba Power Co., appoirted me as
Supervîsing engineer to represent their interests
in the Mfanitoba Power Compan3,.
These seven million and a haîf dollars
($7,500,000) of bonds were soid te a syndit-ate off
American and Canadian bankers and have been
distributed ali over Canada and the United
States.
Water-power Bonds in Canada have always
had a good reputation, and this is the fIrst time
to my knowledge that any Act of -the Dominion
off Canada bas been suggested which would in
any way affect injuriousiy the inveatments,
which people have made in gooo faith in the
water-power propositions off ibis country.
The taking away off the controi off the Lake off
the Woods from. the Dominion Government is a
serious matter to ail off the water-powers on
the Winnipeg River, and particularly te the
plant n0w under construction at Great Falls,
Manitoba.
This plant Is one off the great- warer-powers
of Canada. and when completed will have a
capaoity off over 150,000 H.P.

My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) asked the question, why was the
legisiation of last year passed without the
declaration, which under the British North
America Act was nocessary, that this was
a work for the general advantage of Canada? I need scarcely refer, honourable
gentlemen, ta the section of the British
North America Act, but I xvili take the
liberty of reading it.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: It is section 92,
paragraph 10 (c).
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
section 92 of the British North America
Act the powers of the provinces are very
clearly defined.
Then, under paragraph
10, there are exceptions made. It states
that the province bas juriadiction inLocal works and undertakings other
such as ar-e off the following classes.

than

Thon, among those classes of exceptions
is ta be found this provision:
Such works as, aithough wholly aitoate within the Province are beffore or after their executien declared ýby the P'arliament off Canada ta
bc for the general advantage orf Canada or for
the advantage off two or more of the Provinces.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: While my honourable friend is dealing with these subsections of iparagraph 10, might I ask him
what is his opinion of subsection A? My
object is ta see if my honourable friend
agrees with me that these are net works
within paragraph a:
Lines off steam. or other ships, ralIways, canais,
telegraphs, and other works and und,Žrtakings
connecting the Province with any ether or
others off the Provinces, or extending be3 end
the limits off the Province.

I would liko ta know whether miy henourable friend agrees with me that the works

JUNE 26, 1922
Mn
question do flot corne within the terns of
paragraph a.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Why?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Because they are
not "Uines of stearn or other ships, railways, canais, telegraphs"; they are not
works and undertakings connecting one province with another, or extending beyond
the limits of the province. The last words,
"or extending beyond the limits of the
Province," must of necessity be related to
the first words of the paragraph.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is only where
works of that kind extend beyond the limits
of the province that they corne under paragraph a. ýI would like to know what my
honourable friend thinks of that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
not examined paragraph a in that respect.
So I have no hesitation in saying that when
paragraph c specifically provides for a condition such as that upon which. we were
seeking to legisiate, we corne under that
paragraph; and if we corne under c I think
we therefore do flot corne under a.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I tell xny
honourable friend why I put that question
to him?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Because it would
be argued, I assume, that Canada had that
power anyway and there was no necessity
of putting a declaration of that kind into
chapter 38. It will be contended that if
we do take it out now it will flot matter
at ail, because il would be clainied or
argued that the Dominion of Canada would
in any case have jurisdiction under paragraph a. That is the reason I put the question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
first place, the Parliament of Canada had
power
to intervene in this matter,
under the authority given it by the
British North Amerioa Act with reIît was obligagard to navigation.
tory upon the Govern.ment of Canada
bo see that these waters were kept at the
fiewage recommended by the Co'mmission,
for the purpose of maintaining navigation.
Entirely apart fro~m the general powers exercisa-ble by the Government under the
North America Act, we have the specific
power vested in us under the Act, these
being navigable waters. According to the

63

findings of the International Joint Commission, they are navigable waters, and the
obligation of rnaintaining the flowage devolves upon the Government. The -International Joint Commission, in makiing their
recommendation, would not necessarily
have in mind the maintenance of the fiowage frorn a power standpoint. They were
looking at those waters as boundary waters.
The report found that the duty of the
maintenance is cast upon the Governrnent,
o'nd the report suggested that the Board of
Control should be appointed for the purpose of regulating and controlling those
waters. This Government then, in good
faith, carried out to the utrnost its arrangement with the province of Ontario, but the
Covernment of Ontario did not see fît to
imipflement the agree<ment which it had similarly entered into to plface upon the statute
book of the Province precisely similar legislation.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Governmen-t points rather triumphantly to
the fact that during the present Session the
Ontario Government have placed upon the
statute book the statute which they were to
have placed there last Session.. I venture
to say to my honourable friend now, and
I say it 94th confidence, that had we not
enaicted chapter 38 lest; Session, and declared the work to be a work for the general
advantage of Canada, we should not have
heard frein the Ontario Government during
its recent Session. I say it is owing to, chapter 38 having been placed upon the statute
book and the Governmnent of Canada having
dec-lared this, work to be one for the gerieral advantage of Canada that the province
of Ontario has implemented the 'agreement
and provided for it in its own statutes,
and now seeks to have us withdraw the
legislation of last Session,. 1 cannot understand the Parliament of Canada, or the
Governinent of the day-for this is a Goverasuent Bill-ýplacing such reliance as they
apparently do upon the legisiation of tJhe
province of Ontario concerning a matter
involving the many millions I 'have mentioned-a statute which can be repealed on
the morrow after it is passe& TJiere is no
assurance or guarantee on the part of the
Goverament of Ontario to impleinent the
agreement 'whidh they have entered mbt,
and the default which they amade in flot
carrinýg out their agreement of last year
is the very best evidence th'at we ean have
that this Government is calIled upon to exeroise the miost drastic power it hýas in protecting the interests to which I have -ailuded.

C33

SENATE

Can anyone doubt for a moment that
this is a work for the general advantage of
Canada? If the Parliament of Canada does
not regulate the dam known as the Norman
dam nor control the waters of t'he English
river and Lac Seul, I fail to see in what
way it can give the necessary protection
to the interests in the province of Manitoba
that are demanding protection. And who
can find fault with the Parliament of Canada for this purpose declaring this to be
a work for the general advantage of Canada? What injury is it going to do? If
the province of Ontario were suffering any
specifie damage from the exercise of this
power ves-ted in the Dominion Parliament,
I could very well understand the provnce
of Ontario protesting against the legisiation which my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) .now seeks to repeal. But bas
there been any evidence submitted to this
House that the existence of this legislation and its continuance as a law of the
Dominion will operate injuriously or with
prejudice to the province of Ontario? No.
The Ontario Legislature should be the first
body to say to the Parliament of Canada:
"Our interests in this respect are not provincial; this is larger than a provincial
niatter; we will support you in every way
we can to protect the enormous investments
ir the province of Manitoba depending upon
the flow of water in the Winnipeg river.
As I have said, this has become a political
matter in the province of Ontario; and
because one gentleman finds that his interests have been somewhat handicapped
in regard to the exercise of his discretion
in dealing with the enormous interests in
the province of Manitoba, he intervenes
and says that the province of Ontario
must demand the repeal of this legislation, and the province of Ontario is here
to-day for that purpose, and at his request.
Now, I ask my honourable friend the
leader of the Government, who, I am sure
appreciates the situation, in what other
way could the Dominion of Canada protect those great industries in the province
of Manitoba? It is well known from an
engineering standpoint-and any engineer
who has studied this whole situation will
tell you-that Mr. Backus has the key to
the situation. Being the owner of the
Norman dam, and owning the dam known
as the White Dog Rapids, he controls the
whole situation. He, in the exercise of
plenary powers, can prevent the people of
Manitoba getting the water necessary to
give them the power which they have at

LOUGHEED.

present, and to which they are entitled,
and which, I am satisfied, the Parliament
of Canada will see that they enjoy for
years to come.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Was the province
not asked to enter into an agreement with
regard to this joint control, or was it
simply to pass a statute?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
signify a willingness now to come within
chapter 10; but it only provides for a
joint control. But, as I have pointed
out, there is nothing to assure us that
that joint control will continue, or that
the Ontario Government at the next
session will not repeal the Act passed this
session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Likewise,
what about this Parliament?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This
Parliament is a very much more dependable institution than the provincial legislatures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend is not modest.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. I
am always prepared to pay a tribute to
the Parliament of Canada as compared
with the provincial legislatures.
My Jhonourable friend epeaks of our
depriving Ontario of the control of its
lands. There is no deprivation. In what
way is there an interference with the right
of the province to enjoy the full exercise
of its legislative powers as to its lands?
My hnourable friend says that we
entered into a solemn engagement with
the province of Ontario. What about the
solemn engagement that it entered into
with this Government last year? We have
a right, I should say, to measure the extent of the solemnity of the province of
Ontario by the way in which it dealt with
the subject last year. When my honourable friend talks about solemn engagements, it rather appeals to my sense of
levity.
I think it is hardly necessary for me
to say anything further upon this matter.
In the first place, we are simply carrying
out the recommendations made by the International Joint Commission, a Commission appointed by the Government of the
United States and the Government of
Canada for the adjustment and settlement
of the question. That Commission has
intimated that the only way to regulate
the flowage of the Lake of the Woods
is by control of the Norman dam. As Mr.

JUNE 26, 1922
Backus is the owner of the Norman dam,
we have to adopt some niethod to exercise
control, and we think the British North
America Act has fully met the situation,
and we have evoked that power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who owned
the dam iii March and April last year?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Backus.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then chapter
10 seemed te be sufficient, te control him?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, it
does flot.
Hon. Mr. ýDANDURAND: It seemed to
be strong enough.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
think it is not. This dam was buit many
years ago, and it i-s an outlaw dam in the
sense that the permission of the Minister
of Publie Works for it was flot obtained
under the Navigable Waters Act, and n-:
authority has since been obtained from the
Federal Government for its retention.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was there ever
any request from the Dominion Government?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, I
understand not. But Mr. Backus bas purchased it, and owning, as I say he does, the
key to the situation, ho proposes te make it a
very valuable instrument probably for the
purpose of levying tribute elsewhere.
Theref ore it seems to me, in a word, that
the Parliament of Canada is within its
rights in baving passed this legislatien.
Honeurable gentlemen, I fancy, will not
doubt that for a moment. In the second
place, we may ask ourselves this question:
were 'the eonditions of 80 important a
character as to warrant the Government in
exercising this power under the British
North America Act? I say yes. There were
$38,00,000 or $40,000,000 invested la
lenterprises in Manitoba which are dependent upon receiving water from the
Lake of the Woods by way cf the Winnipeg
river. It is necessary to protect these interests; and, notwithstanding any assurances that may be given by the province
of Ontario, either by legislation or otherwise, I say it will net be sufficient to
warrant us in continuing to depend upon
those assurances. I therefore meve:
That the Bill be not nov read a second time,
bu t that it be read a second time tis day three

mnonths.
Hon. F. F. PARDEE: Honourable
gentlemen, after listening to the honeur.
able leader of the Opposition, who bas just

6

finished bis remarks, it appears to me tbat
if bis argument is carried te its logical
conclusion, sucb a thing as wbat I may
cail vested interests in provincial rigbts
is gone. In other words, no matter wbat
right a province may have, if any private
individuals or private interests step la,
they may come to tbe Dominion Parliament
and say: "'We desire tbat tbis or that particular provincial right shall be taýken and
that So-and-so shall be declared to, be for
tbe general advantage of Canada;" tbereby
absolutely depriving the province cf the
rigbt, and setting aside provincial control.
The honourable gentleman says: "Wby
did not tbe province cf Ontario come in a
big, strong way and say, 'We bave notblng
against tbe province of Manïtoba, and as
a consequence are quite content to enter
into an arrangement which will give people
lower down on the Winnipeg river a dependable flow of water'." I submit to this
House that that ls exactly wbat was done.
There was oome trouble; there was a
gettiag together; tbere was an agreement
made. That agreement was ýreduced to
writing. There were certain tbings to be
done by the Commission la the way of
controlling tbe flow cf water. That Commission later on was to be fortified by an
Act of tbis Parliament, and by an Act of
tbe Provincial legisiature. Tbe agreement
'wis to be crystallized into legisiation
giving them all tbe powers tbe province
would bave or that tbe Dominion on behaîf
of tbe province of Manitoba, demanded.
That was done. what then?
It appears to me ýtbat -my bonourable
friend stretches a peint wben be says: "«Ah,
that is very well; 'but wbat did the province of Ontario do? They did not carry
out their agreement: tbey refused te carry
it eut." As a matter cf fae!t, I tbink it is
bardly wortb wbile te tell any bonourable
member cf this body that the province cf
Ontario did net refuse and could net refuse,
and my honourable friend knows quite well
why it could' nôt refuse. There was in the
Legislature cf Ontario, as there is in 'this
Parliament te-day, a tinýge ef group representatien. Mr. Drury .teld Mr. Meighen,
and it la set out in the correspoadence,
that ho ceuld not bring dowa that legislation, because, with the groups that ho had
about hlm, be could. net carry it. But what
ho saiýd was this: 'II cannot carry the logislation in my ewa House, but I arn perfeetly
content that the Commissien should go on
and that Maniteba sbould receive the
ri'gbts ithat, she was te receive under the
agreement." And I subm.it to this House
that when my honourable frÉend s'ays,

SENATE

640

"But what reliance can you place on the
word of the Ontario Government?"-,and
inferentially, therefore, on 'the word ofany Government-the answer comes very
promptly from the action of 'the Ontario
Government during the Session just ended
-why? Because the very things that they
promised some two or three years ago that
they would do as soon as they were in a position to do them were done. Then the Government of the day comes along, very properly, I submit, and says: "The agreement having been carried out, and Ontario having come forward in a big, broad,
generous way, and having said, 'We do
not desire to take any advantage of the
province of Manitoba,' we will repeal the
Act that was passed last session declaring
these works to be works for the general
advantage of Canada, and we will put
provincial rights back where they belong."
That is what is done by this proposed legislation. So far as that phase of the ques-,
tion is concerned, let it rest there.
When the honourable gentleman comes,
here-,and he is an authority-and says:
"Really, the great trouble -is that financial.
men have invested $40,000,000 in the
bonds of these power and electrie companies, and they stand a chance of losing
the money they have invested," let me aslo
the honourable gentleman if they did not
know when they put their money into the,
ventures that there was no Act declaring
these works to be for the general advantage
of Canada?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: $7,000,000 of that
was let loose this year.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Very well, we will
deduct $7,000,000 and make it $33,000,000.
When they put the $33,000,000 into these
enterprises, did they take the proper legal
advice, as they could have d'one, and found
out that the volume of water flows from
the Lake of the Woods through the Norman dam, and via the White Dog Rapids,
al] of which are within the province of
Ontario, and every square foot of which
were subject to provincial rights and to
the laws of the province of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I inform the
honourable gentleman that a portion of the
Lake of the Woods is within the province
of Manitoba. But that is not all. The city
of Winnipeg has spent from $15,000,000 to
$20,000,000 in water in getting a supply
from that lake within the boundaries of
Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: But the Norman
dam is not in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr.

PARDEE.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: That is what is
complained of. It seems to me that the real
milk in the cocoanut is that there is a
water-power which has ben improved, and
upon which a good deal of money has been
spent, and that the city of Winnipeg and
the private interests there, who are complaining, desire to take advantage of that,
and do not desire to spend one dollar of
their own money in getting their own
water-power.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Let us see now. In
the report which was brought down there
were some figures as to the fall of the
water. It is set out in the report that
there is a fall of 29 feet at the Norman
dam, which is spoken of as the governing
factor in this matter. There is a fall of
291 feet in the Winnipeg river below the
Norman dam. Very well; if you substract
the 29 feet from the 291 feet you have the
remainder of the fall for the development
of the water-power in the Winnipeg river.
Why would it not be quite possible, if the
people of Winnipeg and the province of
Manitoba are so fearful that an even flow
of water will not be maintained, and that
the level will not be properly controlled, to
develop water-,powers below the Norman
dam and maintain an even flow by storage,
and in that way avoid any trouble with the
province of Ontario? I contend that if
the people of the city of Winnipeg and the
people of the province of Manitoba desire
to develop their own water-power, they
can do so at their own expense. The plea
is made that these are navigable waters.
Well, almost any waters are navigable
these days. But if you take the reports
brought down and examine the type of
boats sailing on the Rainy river, you will
find that the biggest boat d'raws 7 feet, and
the draft of most of them is 3 feet. I do not
think anyone needs to control those waters
for the purposes of navigation in the class
of navigation that is carried on-and it is
the only class there is.
I repeat: if the procedure of the late
Government is to go on, if for private
interests of any kind the provinces are to
be done out of their provincial rights,
where is the end of that to be. If the
Dominion Government has a right to declare those works to be for the general
advantage of Canada, to take them without the control of the province of Ontario,
it bas a right, with regard to any waters
or anything else in any part of the pro-

JUNE 26, 1922
vince of Ontario, to say: "These waters
shall not belong to this particular province;
nothing of the nature of provincial rights
shall further stand; we declare them all
to be for the general advantage of Canada," and the province will have to give
them up. To argue that we have that
right is to go back to the earliest history
of the province. Some of the greatest
constitutional fights that were ever known
were fought then as between the Liberal
and Conservative Governments to establish
the very thing that that Norman dam stands
for; and it was established in the highest
courts of the realm that those water-powers
belonged entirely to the province, which
had absolute jurisdiction over them.
I do not know whether it is worth while
going any further into particulars in this
matter. I have gone into it rather thoroughly, and I spoke last year in the House
of Commons regarding it. In conclusion,
I wish to say that in my opinion it does
not matter whether or not Mr. Backus is
mixed up in it. He seems to be rather
a bugaboo to the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed),
I hold no
brief for Backus, but I will simply say
that when Backus did purchase the pulp
mills and limits in Ontario the present
Government got almost twice as much out
of them as the former Government was
prepared to sell them for. That is not
germane to the question, neither is Backus
nor any other man germane to it; but he
came along and through certain channels
he obtained certain rights. If he dbtained
those rights properly it is not for this
House or the other House to step in and
in any way intervene in the bargain that
the province of Ontario made with Backus,
no matter whether it is detrimental to
the other province or not. If it was detrimental to the other province, which I will
not admit, it has no right to complain to us,
because it has its own remedy. Under the
legislation as it exists to-day on the statute
book of Ontario, the commission of engineers that was formed and carried on could
have carried on last year without this legislation being passed in any way whatever,
and that is what Mr. Drury desired. I say
there is no possible chance that that Commission, or any other commission of fairminded men, backed up as they would be
by the Government or governments for
whom they are acting, would do anything
that might be detrimental to the perpetuation of an even flow of water for the industries and powers that my honourable friend
wants. Under the legislation as it stands

641

to-day, with the repeal of the Act of last
year whereby those works were declared
to be for the general advantage of Canada,
Manitoba is absolutely safeguarded, and
it cannot go higher than have the word
of the Government which is at present in
power, or any Government.
Hon. ROBERT WATSON: Honourable
gentlemen, in taking part in this discussion I shall have to be excused because I
am not a lawyer. I will not argue it from
a legal standpoint. I will deal with this
question more from a practical standpoint,
as to how it affects the people of Manitoba.
This matter has been prolonged for
some years, and attention has been directed
to Manitoba, because unfortunately that
province is in the position of having no
standing in this case except through the
Senate and the House of Commons. As
has been well said here, the Winnipeg
river is entirely under the control, of the
Federal 'Government, and is administered
by them; they control every right to construct works in that river, and every dollar that is received from power franchises
and charters to do business on that river;
consequently we have to look to Ottawa
for protection, and you wouild naturally
suppose that ;people who got power to
construet those works on the Winnipeg
river would receive protection from
Ottawa.
Some two years ago it became known to
the people of Manitoba that Mr. Backus
had secured large pup and timber concessions from the Ontario -Government. It
was also known to the people of the West
that he had purchased the Norman dam.
That dam has been properly described
to-day by the leader of the other side as
an outlaw dam, because under the legislation of the Department of the Interior
the builder of every dam of that description constructed on water which is international or interprovincial had to secure
permission from the Federal Government.
Such permission was never secured by the
people who built the Norman dam. The
dam, to my knowledge, was originaiy
bui'lt b, Mr. John Mather and the late
Senator Gibson.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: How many years
ago?

Hon. Mr. WATSON,: It must have been
about twenty years ago.
Hon. Mr. MeaMEANS: More like thirty.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: No, twenty years
ago. I happen to know something of the

S-41
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
circumstances fron Mr. Mather himself,
and am able to say why the dam was built.
Mr. Mather had timber limits which comprised the islands in the Lake of the
Woods. The Ontario Government did not
want the timber eut off those islands, and
they gave Mr. Mather power to construct
the Norman dam to control a water-power
in lieu of his right to cut timber on the
islands. That was about the time of the
agitation about transmitting power over
long distances, and I know that Mr. iMather
at that time came to Winnipeg and secured
contracts for only about 5,000 horseýpower.
At that particular time the methods of
conducting electrical energy with high voltage were not so advanced as they are today, and it would take 5 wires of threeeighths of an inch in diameter to
and
horse-power,
carry even 10,000
they could only deliver at the other
end about 80 per cent of the power
Hence that prothat was generated.
But under the arject was given up.
rangement with the Ontario Government
Mr. Mather had to construct a dam, and
he formed a conipany which constructed
this Norman dam, and which was able to
control the flow of water into the Winnipeg
river.
The people of Manitoba learned that Mr.
Backus, in addition to securing those large
pulp and timber limits, had secure-d this
dam. It is reported that he paid $110,000
for it. We know that he proceeded to
Winnipeg, knowing the relation that Norman dam held towards the power down
the river thiat Winnipeg was interested in,
and he tried to seli the dam to Winnipeg
for $1,500,000.
I do not blame Mr.
Backus; he is a good, shrewd business man,
but I do blame the people who allow him
to take this power and have it operated
for the general advantage of Backus instead of for the general advantage of the
people of Canada.
Now, not only Winnipeg, but the province
of Manitoba, is entirely dependent on the
Winnipeg river power.
The city of Winnipeg has invested a large sum of money
in a power plant, and that power has been
extended to different parts of the province
of Manitoba.
It was extended to my
town a year ago, and people there
are using it, and the rates charged
for it have been reduced to about two-thirds
of the rates charged 'by the local steam
plant.
The people of Manitoba are as
as much dependent on the Winnipeg River
as the people of Toronto and Ontario are
dependent on Niagara Falls, or the people
Hon. Mr. WATSON.

of Quebec are dependent on the St. Maurice
river. I think it is fair to give those comparisons for illustration of our position in
Manitoba.
The Lake of the Woods occupies practically the same position as the
large dam that was built on the St. Maurice
river, from which I understand the Quebec
Government is to-day getting a revenue of
about $200,000 a year by regulating the
flow of that river.
Mr. Backus is known pretty well in the
West.
I do not need to mention his name
to the newspaper men, for they know what
he charged them for paper; that is his
business, and he had the power. This Parliament about twenty years ago granted Mr
Backus the privilege of constructing a pulp
and paper mill on the International Falls,
at Fort Frances, on Rainy River.
He
erected his plant at Fort Frances, where he
was to develop as much power on the
Canadian as on the American side. He
put his pulp mill in the middle of the
stream, and he ran his pulp logs to the
mill on a chain, and had them ground into
pulp, which was then ,pumped to his pulp
mill on the Arerican side; and all that
Canadians got from it was the tail water
from his pulp mill in the Fort Frances
locks. That is what we know about Backus
and the Rainy River.
My honourable friend referred to the
water as belonging to Ontario.
I may
say that it is not only international but it is
interprovincial. Winnipeg city gets its water
from Shoal lake, which is an arm of the
Lake of the Woods, and is situated in Manitoba.
The water cornes through an aqueduct 100 miles long. The city of Winnipeg
bas expended about $20,000,000 in bringing
that water from Shoal lake to Winnipeg.
We are not coming here without a claim,
and we think that the Federal Government should recognize our claim. If there
ever was a situation that warranted the
Federal Government in making a declaration that works were for the general advantage of Canada, I believe it is now, and we
are insisting on that because we are having
the very experience we have been speaking
of to-day.
If Ontario bas ibeen deprived
of any rights she can go to the law courts.
I remember Ontario's fight for provincial
rights years ago.
There was a saying
in Ontario that it was Hardy, Pardee and
Mowat who were fighting for provincial
rights.
In Manitoba we have no legal
rights, and we have to appeal to the Senate,
because the House of Commons is willing to
give away our rights, as shown in the legislation submitted here to-day.

JUNE 26, 1922
I have had some littie experience in
talking about provincial rights. Just about
40 years ago to-day I was campaigning in
Manitoba for provincial rights, and I do
not think 1 can be accused of not abiding
by the principle of provincial rights; but
if that principle is to, be made use of in a
case of this kind, we shall be working
provincial rights to death in a way that
'wlll seriously affect the city of Winnipeg
and the entire province.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: It is affecting
the whole province of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: If I did not take
the stand 1 arn taking to-day and back up
the legislation of last year, I would not be
playing the game fairly. 1 had the privilege of being învited to and of attending
conferences in Ottawa and Toronto, on behaif of the interests of Manitoba; and long
before this legisiation was attempted to be
passed in the province of Ontario, immediately upon its being introduced at Ottawa,
Mr. Backus, with his legal lurninaries,
carne to Ottawa to protest against the joint
legisiation. I had the privilege of being
present at the meeting in the Privy Council
Chamber in Ottawa, when I think four
members of the Senate, who were in the then
Governrnent, were present, to hear what
he had to say. Mr. Backus with his counsel frorn Minnesota fought that thing to
a finish, and clairned that if this concurrent legislation that has been referred to
were passed it would ruin hirn, and he
could not get rnoney to carry out works at
Rat Portage which he had promised. That
was his claim. He went from here to Toronto, and again he protested there. Mr.
Hudson, the late Attorney General of Manitoba, who is now in the House of Comrnons, was present, looking after the interests of Manitoba, and he met the same
opposition there against this concurrent
legislation. Mr. Backus was neyer satisfied with concurrent legislation, and he
used bis influence to prevent that frorn
being passed in the Ontario Legislature.
Now be cornes, at the suggestion of the
very men who prevented the passage of
that legislation in the Ontario House, and
tells them, "I prefer the concurrent legislation of Ontario and the Federal Government," rather than the Act passed here,
when the provision was made that it was
for the general benefit of Canada, in order,
to protect the province of Manitoba.
Have we any guarantee that if we withdzaw this legisiation Ontario will not rescind the legisiation it has passed this sesS-41i

643

sion? I say we have no guarantee, knowin-g as we do the influence that Mr.
Backus has with the Ontario Government.
I venture to say he has control there,
though I believe that, when Mr. Drury
said he was anxîous to corne down here to
help Manitoba, he was perfectly sincere.
I think he gave away more than he thouglit
he was giving when he gave those concessions to Mr. Backus, because he gave flot
only the timber limits but the waterpowers. In this situation, sureiy this Parlaiment is flot going to put Manitoba into .
the hands of Mr. Backus, because that is
exactly what it means, according to xny
judgnient.
As far as the present situation is concerned, what complaint has Mr. Backus or
the Ontario Government? There were to
be four men, two appointed by the Federal
Government and two by the Ontario Government, to form a Commission. That was
before this legisiation was passed, and the
sarne men are the commissioners to-day,
and there is no complaint. Why interfere
with the situation? Why not leave it as
it is? If there are any abuses later on, it
will be time enough to make the change
then.
I might say, so far as development is
concerned, that about 200,000 horse-power
are developed at the present time on the
Winnipeg river, and I understand that
about 300,000 horse-power more can be developed and made available. That would
make a total of 500,000 horse-power. Let
it be understood that it is very important
to have a dependable flow of water. A few
years ago it was thought there were only
two or three places on the Winnipeg river
whe're electric power could -be developedLac du Bonnet, 60 miles from Winnipeg,
and the outiet of the Lake of the Woods,
120 miles from Winnipeg. It is a very
rapid river, and I think it has more fail
than my honourable friend stated, because
1 understand there is a 300-foot fali
between the Lake of the Woods and
Winn*ipeg,
then there is a 40 or
50-foot fall from Winnipeg to Lake
A few years ago it was
Winnipeg.
thought that it would not 'be praeticable
to develop that power .on account o'f the
Honfrazil ice forming in the rapids.
ourable gentlemen who have anything to
do with water-powers, even in Ottawa here,
know the trouble there is with frazil ice;
that is an ice that is formed right in flowing water. It is almost like needles, and
when it strikes the water-wheels it willi
often baIl up like a snowball and stop the

644

SENATE

wheel in a few seconds. More power is developed where there is dead water, with
solid ice over the water, because there is
no trouble with frazil ice, which only forins
in rapids. But there is trouble xvhen there
is anchor ice, which jams up the wbole
stream, when the water is covercd with ice
and is kept at a uniform level.
In the matter before us now, I know 1
arn speaking for 100 per cent of the people
of Manitoba xvhen I take this stand. They
want the leg;slatioil that was passed here
last year. I amn not a lawyer, but I amn
inclined to think that if we passed this
Bill it would look like an admission on
the part of the Federal Goverament that
they did not possess the right to declaro
that the works are for the general advanta.-e of Canada. and that that was the
reason they rescinded that legisiation. As
I said, this is a case where the Senate or
the Parliament is justified-Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I would like to
ask the honourable gentleman if there ever
was an agreement in writing between the
provinces of Manitoba and Ontario and the
Dominion Government with respect to
these rights?

Hon. Mr. WATrSON: No, I think flot;
I neyer heard of any.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was
the agreement which brought forth chapter 10 for joint control.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Oh, yes; I thought
you meant previous to that.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: That was merely a
verbal agreement?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But implemented by the Premiers of both provinces.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: There was nothing
in writing at that time, but there is no
question that Mr. Drury was prepared to
do anything and everything he could to
protect Manitoba, and I believe he would
have carried out that concurrent legishation but that the Backus influence prevented hlm f rom doing so.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Mr. Drury was
prepared to do whatever he couhd under
provincial rights?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think this case
involves the Federal and flot provincial
rights. and on behaif of the people of Manitoba 1 urge that the motion of sny hon,purable friend (Hon. Sir James Lougheed)
Hon. Mr. WATSON.

be carried. I think it would be a calamity
to allow this Bihl te pass.
I arn not going to refer to the
mioney
that
has
been invested
on
the
strength
of
this
legisiation;
lut, honouiable gentlemen, you wilh undersLand the situation. The people of Manitoba are depending on the Winnipeg River
for their power, for their electric energy,
for their street railway, for manufacturing.
The city of Winnipeg is dependent upon the
Winnipeg River and practically the wihole
province of Manitoba is now depending or
will depend upon ýit.
It supplies their
hydro-power, and they have ne other and
xviii not have any other. It appears to me
that the coTitrol should be vested in the
Federal Governrnent and not entrusted to
a local governrnent or to Mr. Backus or any
cther indivîdual. I think this control1 ought
tc, be retained by the Federal authorities,
and I trust that in the interest of the
people of Manitoba the Governrnent xvill see
fit to retain it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to ask a question. As 1
understand from the honourable leader ef
the Government, the reason £for the
action proposed by the Dominion Government is that they have the control of the
lî.nd in Manitoba; consequently any action
that the Dominion Governrnent takes is
taken ostensibly for the benefit and protection of Manitoba. Js the Governnient
of Manitoba asking for the reýpeal of this
statute, or do they want it repealed? Do
they think it is in their in'terest to have it
repealed?
Before I sit down I want te say just one
word to my honourable friend the leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Sir James Lougheed).
It seemed to me that he was placing a
great deal of blame on Mr. Drury for net
passing the Act last Session, as he had
promised to do. It strikes me that the
blame was net se much on Mr. Drury. I
think he wouýld have passed the measure
hast Session if he could have done so; but,
as I undenstood the matter, Mr. Backus
had secured the services of two very able
hawyers to oppose it. They happened to be
the leader of the Liberal party and the
leader of the Conservative party. They
xvere in opposition te Mr. Drury.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
seem to be a bad lot ail round.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:- Se I do not think
it is fair te put ahi the bllame on Mr. Drury.
I ithink the blame bellonged on the other side
of the House. If they had acquieEsced the

JUNE 26, 1922
legisiation would have been passed last
year. And no doubt Mr. Bsckus is getting
in bis work to-day. I remember that a
year or two ago, when this Parliament
passed a law with reference to newsprint
and the Canadian manufacturers obeyed
the law, this American pirate refused te
obey, and did not obey. I do not think Mr.
Backus deserves any consideratien xvhatever at our hands.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
1 desire to say a fe'w words i regard te the
vote I intend to give on this matter. I do
not think this, is at ail a question of Mr.
Backus or any other person. If it were, I
certainly would vote for the a.mendment
proposed by the honourable leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Sir James Lougheed).
Let us see where we are. About fiffeen
or sixteen years ,agc, on behaif of Ontario,
1 a.ppeared as counsel beýore a Committee
af this Senate und before the House of Gommons Committee to oppose just such legislition 'as this. At that time the l-ate Mr.
Conniee wanted to get the control of the
power -on the Nipegon River and the control
of two or three other power propositions in
the northern part of Ontario. He could
not get possession of them £rom Ontario;
se he conceived the bright idea of building
a canal £rom Lake Superior to Edmonton
and he brought down a Bill regarding this
power on the Nipigon'River, which was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.
Sur James Whitney sent mue down here
to oppose the measure; and my instructions
were to tell the Dominion Parliament that
if at any time they insisted on declaring
to be for the general advantage of Canada
part of the domain of the province they
would find that any legisiation they chose
to pass by that high-handed action would
remain unenforced; the Government of the
province of Ontario controlled the administration of the l.aw, and it was net going te
lend itself to supporting any law which
robbed it of the right guaranteed to it
under the British North 'America Act.
The British North America Act is a
treaty, an agreement made amongst the
various provinces of this country, and by
that act the pu~blie lands are given to the
four original provinces. That was a bargain made 1between the Federal authorities
and the provincial, and this legisiation is,
I th'ink, the first ever passed by the Parliament of Canada in violation of that agreement. I contend that the clause in the
British North America Act whith gives to
the Parliament of Canada the right to

645

declare any work to 'be for the general
advantage of Canada does net, in the true
intent and meaning of the Act, apply to
provincial preperties. It was meant to
apply oniy to property of subjects of the
King, net -to the property of the provinces.
If that power does apply to provincial
properties-and of course the question
would ibe contested bitterly by the province
of Ontarlo before the Privy !Counil-then
the Parliament of Canada can on the same
plea declare to be for -the general advantage
of Canada ail the 'works on the Niagara
river, and so deprive the province cf control of its Chippewa develepment.
I submnit to this Senate that there is
ne reasen for the action that was taken by
the Dominion Governruent, and there is ne
advantage being given te Manitoba by it.
Manitoba is net accorded a single jot more
of protection tby leavin-g chapter 38 on the
statute 'bock than that province would have
if the statute were repealed. I will give
yeu my reasons for that. In the first
place, there is a greait principle involved,
whether the Dominion of Canada will live
up te the pact muade at Confederation, or
whether it will violate it, net -in regard te
private interests, but by direct violation of
the right of the province itself. There is
a e~eat 'difference Ibetween declaring a
railroad through Canada te be fer the
general advantage of Canada and declaring
something bel.onging te the province itself
te be fer the general advantage of Canada.
W'hat; does chapter 88 enact? I amu interested in urging my view only on the question cf principle, because I believe that
the legislatien is enly a violation of principle and confers ne ibenefit upon Manitoba.
In section 2 cf chapter 38 dt is declared
that the works new existing or which may
hereafter exist on the outlets cf the Lake
of the Woods, the Winnipeg River and the
English River, are works -for the general
advantage cf Canada.
Notice Vhat the
whole Act is confined te works on the
outlet cf the Lake of the Woods, the
eutlet of the Winnipeg River and the outiet
cf the English River. I do net know why
anyone should imagine that the province cf
Ontario would try te injure. Manitoba. But
if the Ontario Government desire te injure
the province cf Manitoba, what is te prevent them frem putting works on the river
that leads eut from Rainy Lake? That is
net involved, and the Dominion Government
would have ne right te interfere with the
stoppage cf the flow of the water froru
Rainy Lake into the Lake cf the Woods. I

Honourable gentlemen, I arn discussing
this question for just one reason, namely:
I consider that one of the purposes for
which the Senate was formed was that the
delegation £rom each province should, look
after the interests of its own province.
The delegation of each province is here.
An*d, mind, it is the provinces that insist
on the Senate seeing that no violation of
provincial rights is allowed.
In support of what I believe to be the
principle involved, I approve of the Bill
which is before this House.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: May I say a
very few words here? I have heard a
great deal about vested rights. Let us see
what these vested rights amount to. As
I understand, the people who lay dlaim to
these rights got them from the province
of Ontario. My honourable friend who has
just spoken admits, as everyone must, that
there were at that time and still are rights
vested in the Dominion, and that Manitoba
also had some rights. The vested rights
which the gentleman in question has are
rights acquired or rights which have
arisen from the action of Ontario alone.
So far I have not heard that any rîghts
have been acquired from the Dominion
Government, and it is only the rights that
are vested in the Dominion of Canada or
in the province of Manitoba that these who
are opposed to the Bill are endeavouring
to protect here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is the province. It is flot individuals.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The rule is just
as applicable for or against a province as
for or against an individual. What is it we
are doing? I arn afraid my honourable
friend fromn Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) has not read the Bill. He speaks
of disallowance. He says that if the province of Ontario passed an Act to-morrow

647

to repeal the Act passed. Iast Session, and
sent this agreement to the fire, we could
disallow that legisiation. What will be the
position of this Parliament if this Bill is
adopted? Will it be in a position to ex~ercise such an extraordinary power as
disallowaflce-a thing which has practically
neyer been done. What does the Bill say?
It s«ysý "Chapter 38 of the Statutes of
1921 is hereby repealed, and the *works
mentioned or described in the said Act
shahl no longer be deemed to be works for
the general advantage of Canada." If we
pass that, we are simply putting our-selves
out of court forever. We could not talk
disallowance after that. We would be told:
"Why, gentlemen, the Parliament of
Canada has admitted that you have nc
rights."
I must confess that I did not know that
such a Bill had been submitted to the
other House; but the mere reading of the
Bihl-I know nothing of the facts--convinces me that this is legisiation which. we
should not pass. I do not see why ail this
time should have been taken in arguing
about it. To use a trite expression, it is
as plain as the nose on your face. I arn
quite sure that the Ontario Government
will- not do anyth-ing coatrary te its dignity
or honour; but we have no guarantee, and
this Parliament, in a conflict of interests,
cannot rely purely and simply on somebody's word. We cannot afford to put ourselves out of court. If we do that we are
derelict in our duty. I cannot sec why any
la'wyer should have any doubt as to the
meaning of thi8 Bil or of the position in
whîch it would place us.
Hon. WILLIAM PROUDFOOT: Honourable gentlemen, I have a few remarks to
make in regard to this Bill, more particularly as I come from the province of
Ontario and intend to support the amendment. I quite agree with many of the remarks which fell from the lips of the
honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), and, so far
as provincial rights are concerned, I amn
as strongly opposed as hie is to their béing
interfered with. During the early part of
my political career we dealt with the
rights of the provinces in Ontario, and
we used to discuss on the platform at
elections, the Streanis Bill-s and certain
other Bills. We attempted to show, and
apparently we satisfied the people for
many years, that the rights of Ontario
were being interfered with by the Dominion
Parliament.

SENATE
The situation here is somewhat peculiar.
One would imagine that the province of
Manitoba was not particularly interested.
I find, however, upon referring to the map
issued by the International Joint Commission in 1915, that that province can develop
about 500,000 horse-power, while Ontario
has on the Winnipeg river about 100.000
horse-power and on the English river about
140,000 horse-power. Then there is the
further fact that we are dealing with
navigable waters, and that a very considerable portion of the Lake of the Woods runs
into and borders on American territory. So
we have the interprovincial and also the
international situation to consider. Furthermore, we find that a great deal of
money was spent in securing the reports
of this Joint Commission. It seems to me
that the work in question is clearly within
the rights of the Federal Parliament, and,
while I would dislike very much to see
the Federal Parliament interfere with the
rights of any province, I take it that the
situation in regard to this particular matter is one in which the Goverment has a
perfect right to interfere. What I do not
understand is why the Government last
Session saw fit to enter into an arrangement with the province of Ontario. Why
did they not, in the first instance, pass the
Bill which they finally passed without reference to the province of Ontario? Had they
donc so they could have protected not
only Ontario, but also the province of Manitoba.
I would like to present to honourable
gentlemen my views of the position we
occupy. Last Session an Act was passed
-chapter 38-which, after describing the
object of the legislation, used these words,
in referring to the various dams and so
on:
At any time are and eaeh of them is declared
to be for the general advantage of Canada.
That is set forth in the second clause.
Then in the last clause we find that, even

if the Ontario Government should see fit
to pass last Session the legislation, which
it was expected to pass, the Act declares:
Provided that notwithstanding any repeal or
suspension of this Act in the manner provided
by this section the works and each of them
hereby declared to be for the general advantage
of Canada shall remain and continue to be
works for the general advantage of Canada.
What are we asked to do by the Bill
before us? We are asked to say that when

we made use of that language last Session
we were stating something which we had
no right to state, because the Bill says:
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT.

Chapter 38 of the statutes of 1921 Is hereby
re)ealed. and the works mentioned or described
in the said Act shall no longer be or be deemed
to be works for the general advantage of
Canada.
I do not understand how any honourable
gentleman can stultify himself by saying
that the Act of last Session should be repealed, and that we made use of a statement then which was not in accordance
vith the facts, and are now going to say

we were wrong in that respect.

Suppose

we pass this legislation and find in a few

years that provincial rights, so far as Manitoba is concerned, are being interfered with.
Maitoba may come to the Dominion Par-

liament and ask for protection. If we pass
this Bill, how can we in the face of that
declare that these works are for' the general advantage of Canada? We would be
placing ourselves in a position in which
we should not be placed.
'What is the great hurry for this legislation? The Act of last Session has gone

into operation. We find that the Commission has been appointed, and that they
have passed certain regulations which
have been acted upon. We have heard no
complaints from any of the parties that the
Dominion Government or the people enforcing the legislation have acted unfairly.
That being so, why are we asked to pass this
legislation? There must be some ulterior
reason for asking to have legislation of this
kind placed on the statute book. Should we
not go slow in retracing our steps? Why
not let the Act remain as it is. If, after
it has been in operation a number of years,
it is found that an injustice is being done
to the province of Ontario or to the province of Manitoba, we can reconsider the
matter, and will then be in a position to
retrace our steps and retrace them honourably.
My honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) said that the
province of Ontario might interfere with
the flow of water by damming Rainy lake.
Well, I ask honourable gentlemen to look
at the plan supplied by the Joint Commission, and to tell me what would be done
with the power if Rainy lake were dammed?
What use would there be for it? The only
people who have any considerable use for
the power, at any rate at the present time,
are the people of the province of Manitoba.
I would not like it to be thought that I
was in any way opposing provincial
rights, and if I thought the action we are
taking to-day would in any way interfere
with provincial rights, or would cause
any harm to the province of Ontario, I

JUNE 26, 1922
would be one of the first to oppose the
amendrnent.
There is another thought which cornes
to me. We ail know that Mr. Drury, the
Prime Minister of Ontario, is a man of
very high character and reputation--a
man who, I think, would be only too will..
ing to act fairly. But he has flot a majority in the Legislature, and we do flot
know what may happen in the next Session. This being so, why flot let the legisiation already on the statute book remain as it is until sorne party in the Province of Ontario acquires a cleai~ majority and is in a position to, legisiate for
the people? I believe that to enact proper
legisiation a Government should have a
sufficient majority at its back to say
authoritatively to the people: "We believe in so-and-so, and we are going to
pass this legisiation." That is not the position in *the province of Ontario -at the
present tirne, and until the Governrnent
bas such a majority we should let matters
rest as they are. No harm has been done
during the past year, and I arn satisfied
that none will be done.
Some Hon. SE NATORS: Question.
Hon. G. H. BRADBURY: Honourable
gentlemen, 1I desire to say a word or two
on this question. 1 arn peculiarly interested because these great water-powers on
the Winnipeg river are situated in rny own
county. When I entered Parliament, in
1908 or 1909, there wacs a. Bill brought
before the Commons by Mr. Conmee to
get control of these great water-powers
by a canal scherne from the Lake of the
Woods through the Winnipeg river to
lake Winnipeg and via the iSaskatchewan
river up to Edmonton. Ever since that
day, f rom time to time, efforts have been
made to get control in sorne way of the
water-powers of the Winnipeg river. The
matter before the House concerns flot only
the city of Winnipeg,.but every town and
every part of northern Manitoba, and a
considerable portion of the southern part.
AIL. our light, heat, and ipower torne from
Lac du Bonnet, and the other water-powers on that river. While sorne honourable
gentlemen have spoken of the expenditure
of $30,000,000 or $40,000,000, they are only
speaking of the nioney invested in these
power developments, and are leaving out
of their calculations the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the great city
of Winnipeg and in other portions of Manitoba which would be affected. If anything
were done to affect the supply of power it
would injure and destroy hundred of millions of dollars worth of investrnents ia

the province of Manitoba. My own town
of Selkirk would be affected, as would
every other town in that !part of the province; consequently I arn very much interested in this rnatter.
Sorne honourable gentleman took the opportunity to point out that when the
water-<powers were developed on the Winnipeg river, those takinýg part in their developrnent knew the conditions of the Norman dam and the 'Lake of the Woods. I
honourable gentlemen
should aike to tl
that when the water-powers were developed on the Winnipeg river the conditions
were not the sarne es they are to-day. The
Norman dam then was not in the possession of Mr. Backus; it was in the hands of
a private company, and the men who built
that dam were mnen who would not injure
any power-schenie on the Winnipeg river.
But as soon as Mr. Backus got control of
it and the English river power, he controlled the whole situation. He could
starve the water-powers on the Winnipeg
If he were left in control
river.
he could do incalculable damage not only
to the city of Winnipeg but to the whole
province of Manitoba.
I arn not going to enter into, the legal
aspect of this case, as it has been discussed
by so many legal gentlemen here, hardly
one of thern agreeing with the other; but
the moral situation is this, that we have
the Norman dam situated on the Lake of
the Woods, which is an international water
and also an interprovincial water. Honourable gentlemen here should be seized of
the fact that the Lake of the Woods is
flot altogether in Ontario; part of it is« in
Manitoba; consequently the province of
Manitoba bas a decided interest in anything that affects the level of that water.
Outside of those great water-powers we are
dependent on that lake for our water supply in the city o'f Winnipeg and in Greater
Winnipeg, and if it is interfered with or
not properly controlled by the Government it will injure that great water
scheme and affect nîl the people of that
great city. The Governrnent of Manitoba
rnust have some say in that question, or
else there mnust be some neutral power that
will be absolutely fair to the province of
Manitoba. But while the whole province
of Manitoba is directly interested, we have
no other court of appeal than the Parliament of Canada for our protection, and
we feel that our case is a good one. It.
happens that this Norman dam is in Ontario, as is also the English river, and the
great powers upon it. This gentleman,

ROOT VEGETABLES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 133, an Act to regulate the Sale and Inspection of Root
Vegetables.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill regulates the grading, marking, and
packing of potatoes and onions, and one
of its clauses relates to other vegetables.
This is the result of the work of the Committee on Agriculture of the House of
Commons, who seem to have gone minutely
into the matter.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: This, seems to be a
very comprehensive Bill, dealing with
potatoes, onions, and, I suppose, other
vegetables.
I thought the honourable
leader of the House would give us some
explanation of the scope of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When the
Bill is read in Committee my honourable
friend will see exactly what it covers.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read a second time.

People who are flot familiar with the
growing of potatoes, onions, and other
vegetables would be surprised at the extent
of that industry. Those who are famiijar
wi.th the situation realize how import.ant i-t
is that it be regulated. I arn no judge of
the rules of .procedure -applied, but, in
reading the discussion which occurred in
another place and which revealed differences of opinion on some points, 1 have
been considerably enlightened as, to the
importance of the work covered by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Do the provisions
of the Bill apply to organized farmers who
grow vegetables and bring into *a city,
town or village bags of potatoes, onions or
other produce for sale?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
it does.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Section 13 will answer that question.
Hon. Mr. McMÉANS: It does, as far as
I can see.
H1on. Mr. BRADBURY: If it does not
appiy to the farmer who brings in potatoes,
for instance, 1 do not thinlc the Bill is
nmach good.
Section 13
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
says:
Ail potatoes, onions, artichokeýs, beets, carrots,
parsnips and tornips offered for sale shall be
sold by weight, and the standard round avoirdupois shall be the unit of welght used. Provided that when any of the foregoirg vegetabies
are offered for sale with the top leaves attached,
comnionily termed by the trade "green vegeta.bles", or when potatoes are sold or offered
for sale by the ciosed barrel, this section shahl
flot apply in the saine.

Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Is not that in
line with the old law .providing that a hag
of potatoes should weigh so much?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: A change bas
been made. 1 understand the practice of
considering a Sag as 90 pounds bas been
discontinued, and potatoes are sold by the
pound. That is quite right.
While on my feet I would like to say that,
in my opinion, there ought to be, in addi-

tion to this Bill, some provision made
regarding the sale of other vegetables.
Take for instance, spinach. That is a very
light vegetable. It is at present sold by
the gallon, and some dealers can make a
half gallon fill a gallon container to the top.
The practice is similiar to what is done with
strawberries. I think ýspinach ought to be
included in this Bill. It ought to be sold
by weight.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If this Bill
works out to the satisfaction of the public,
the principle of it may be extended to other
vegetables.

On section 4-onion grades:
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Before you pass the
onions, may I say a word? Potatoes from
Prince Edward Island are landed on the
coast by the cargo, and I think it would be
very difficult to know whether they were
good or bad, or whether they were Bovees,
Bluenoses, Early Rose, or Whites,, or
whatever you call them. Would inspection
of that kind apply to a whole cargo? Would
a man have to stand over the hatchway

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Let my honourable friend tell us who they
are.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I can tell the
honourable gentleman thisRight Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
We have veterinary surgeons all through
the country: are yoù going to put them on
this business? You have customs officers:
you are not going to put them on this
business? You have fruit inspectors: are
you going to put them at it? Potatoes,
spinach, onions, and all other kinds of
vegetables are raised on almost every
square foot of cultivable soil in Canada,
and they are sold on alamost all the markets
everywhere. To whom are you going to
entrust this work? Are you going to entrust it to mining inspectors or inspectors
of hulls> and boilers of steamers? You have
lots of inspectors, but what branch are
you going to put upon this work?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is left
with the Minister, as my honourable friend
will see if he reads paragraph a of section 2.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But what I want to find out is whether
there is to be a large number of inspectors appointed. If there are not those
already in the service of the Government
who will do the work, the inspection will
entail a very large cost. I think that if
it is for the benefit of the trade-producer and consumer alike-the trade ought
to carry the expense of the inspection.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the point
is well taken. It is quite important that
the cost should be paid by the vendors.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
By those benefited-by the trade.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In answer to
my right honourable friend, I may say that
it is as I surmised. The fruit inspectors
already in the employ of the Government
will in the main carry out this new legislation, with the assistance of a very few
more in each province during the season
when this inspection must go on.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then we have the assurance of the Minister
that in the main the inspection will be performed without extra cost by inspectors
already in the Service. Have we also the
added assurance that if additional inspectors are to be appointed, a system of fees
will be instituted to carry the expense?

65:

Hon. Mr. ,DANDURAND: I do not find
that in the Bill, nor am I aware that that G
policy will be followed. But, as I have
stated already, I think the Government
could well afford to pass over to the trade
interested the cost of the inspection.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Take a province
like Prince Edward Island, where there
are millions of bushels of potatoes exported
in a month. How is it going to be practicable to have those potatoes inspected?
and who is going to pay the inspectors?
This is freak legislation. The intention is
good, but it is the same as a good many
other Bills that we have passed this year.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: I take it for granted
that there will be no inspection unless the
purchaser of the vegetables asks for it.
If he is satisfied to take a cargo or a
barrel or a box of vegetables as it is, I do
not suppose there will be any expense incurred for an inspector.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: That is just where
I object to this Bill. A man sells a carload
of potatoes. They go to Montreal and the
price drops, and if those potatoes are not
up to the millimetre when they are taped,
they are turned down. This is freak
legislation of the worst kind. I have every
respect for the intention of the Bill, but I
do not think it is practicable to enforce it.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURYI I would draw
attention to the fact that during the discussion on another Bill in this House I pointed
out that we had a department that had a
very large staff of inspectors. The Meat
and Canned Foods Branch has 275 inspectors at different points throughout the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Part
of their duty at the present time is to inspect vegetables of all kinds before they
are put into cold storage. I presume this
Bill will come under that department, and
I hope it will, because it is a very efficient
department, and I believe that the 'inspection would impose a very little extra expense on the country.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: iShould not the
Minister be empowered to make regulations
to provide for inspection?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think he is.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Section 11 does that partially for potatoes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say,
honourable gentlemen, that this measure
is mainly for the trade. Representatives
of the Growers' Associations of all the pro-

vinces met here, along with representatives
of the provincial Governments, worked
upon the Bill and approved of it. They
are asking for the inspection for their protection. A letter that was read in another
place referred to a carload of potatoes that
was sent from New Brunswick to Ontario.
In transit the price dropped, and a telegram was sent stating that the potatoes
were not of the proper grade. I ask, what
was the proper grade when there was no
official grading? Fortunately the shipper
had a representative not more than 100
miles from the place in Ontario where the
potatoes were, and he telegraphd to him
to go and see what was the matter. That
agent went and asked if there were any
good New Brunswick potatoes there: he
wanted first class potatoes. He was told
that a carload had just been received, and
that there were no better potatoes.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: He paid?

JUNE 26, 1922
the House for a few moments while I
point out some respects in connection with
this Bill wbich 1 think are manifest disadvantages, and which introduce entirely
new principles and almoat new practices
into the general dealings 'with commercial
matters in ouir country.
This Bill bears no resemblance at alit is not even a forty-first cousin-to the
Act which was in operation duriiig the war
years, and which was provided for possible
operation during the year 1921. As regards
reither principle nor practice are they
alike. But, outside of that, the circumstances are absolutely different to-day from
wvhat they were at that time. Then you
had everywhere buying in gross, and buying through governments; and we had organized selling and buying arrangements
amongst ourselves in order to meet the situation abroad. The position is enti.rely
different at the present tîme. Now you put
on a piece of legislation which is unique in
itself-which has no counterpart in any
other country that I know of.
Take, first and foremost, the principle
of buying and selling by exchanges. Every
other great agricultural country in the
world does buy and does sell through a
system of exchanges. In Europe and in
America that is the case. Consequently
yen are putting this legisiation into operation under circumstances entirely different,
as te regulations of other markets in buying and selling. On this new plan you are
geing into competition with every other
country in the world which. bas a surplus
of wheat and is desirous of selling it; and
you are putting an unusual something in
the way of every foreign buyer who is lookîng about the world to decide where hie
shaîl buy his wheat-whether he shahl go
te Canada, te the United States, to Argentina, India, or where.
Now, what are some of those hindrances
which we erect? For the first time in
the history of Canada you are making a
piece of legislation which is absolutely
and undadulteratedly class legislation in
its operation, and in the motives for its
enactment. You are giving to the farmers
in two provinces, whose chief product is
wheat, a wmter-tight compa.rtment for 75
or 80 per cent of the chief food product of
Canada. Every man muet chew hie proportion of grain in the form of bread, and
znust have it te live upon; but the fortunate producers of that wheat in those twe
provinces f rom which that bread is made
have it in their power te say whether or
flot one single bushel of that wheat shall

5

go out from those provinces, and when it
shall go out. Now, if that is effective, as
it i. wished to be by the class for whom
it is made, it raises the price of food and
increases the cost of living to every consumer in the Dominion of Canada, and of
our nine millions of people the majority are
consumers of wheat which they have to
purchase, and the infinitesimal minority
are the farmers in those two provinces
who raise that wheat.
You interfere with interprovincial trade,
making a water-tight compartment in the
centre of the wheat-producing industry,
and rendering it possible for them to impose what restriction they please. and what
export provisions they please, even to prohibition. If there is any motive in it, and
if any resuit cornes from it, the motive is
and the result will be to raise the price of
wheat as against what it would otherwise
bring to them; and as it does that it maises
the cost of living to every one of the vast
majority of people who have to buy their
food.
Now, I have just time merely to suggest
these things. You do another thing. Do
you suppose that the -buyers of. grain in
the European countries, for instance, do
not know just a-bout as -much as to the
wheat production of the world, Canada included, as we in Canada know about the
wheat production and the surplus bhat will

Canada, but in the meantime wre do net know
what the conditions will be in Canada;
we know that they have passed an Act
which puts into the bande of a Commission,
appeinted virtually by two provinces, the
bulk of Canadian wheat they have to sell."
Thase buyers know that this Bill giveé

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
gentlemen, I had not intended rnaking any
remarks on this Bill, but I want to say,
with ail due respect to the right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster), that in niy opinion he has entirely
overdrawn his statement and has done
more than his duty in attempting to explain this Bill. As we go through this
measure we shahl find very few of the
conditions that rny right honourable friend
says exist in it. I understood him to say
that buyers from the old country-frorn
En.gland, if you like-are not able at
present to corne over here and make a
contract for wheat. Clause 8, 1 think,
makes this point very clear. If there is
anybody in the old country or in any other
market who wants to corne to 'Saskatchewan or Alberta and make a contract
for wheat, he can do so. There is nothing
in this Bill to prevent it.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: The Bill is not in
force.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It will be in a
week.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I do not quite
understand the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Curry). We ail know that this
Bihl bas mot been passed, but I am referring to the remarks made by the right
honourable gentleman, and am stating that
in my opinion he overdid bis duty. Wben
the Bill is discussed clause by clause, we
shahl not find in it the terrible conditions
which be depicts. The intention of this
Bill-and I beileve it carnies out itg intention-is not to raise the price of food
to anybody in this country, and. it need
not have that effect. The object of this

country to go up into Alberta and into
Saskatchewan, or come into Canada, and
make a contract for wheat to be delivered
in October, November, or December. It
is free in a way. But does he know what,

been made. I stated also that the purpose
was not to raise the price of food. If the
right honourable gentleman said anything,
he said that the result of this Bill would
be that the price of food would be raised.
I say that that is not the intention, and in
my opinion that is not correct. The farmers do not ask for anything but the market price.
I have made no special preparation
to discuss this question, and I was surprised to hear the remarks which have been
made. However, I would like to point out
one respect in which the old Board was a
great advantage to the farmers in the
West. 'Some of them lived right by the
station. When they had threshed their
grain they could take it to the station and
load it right onto a car or put it in the
elevator. The first month, or the first two
weeks, of the market in Western Canada
are as a rule the best, because then you
can get the most for your wheat. I say
that without fear of contradiction. Under
the proposed arrangement, and under the
former Wheat Board, the man living ten
miles from the station is on an equal footing with the man living right at the station. That is a very great benefit to the
farmers in the West, as any honourable
member who has had anything to do with
farming will understand.
True, the Dominion Government constitute the Board. They appoint the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, and about
there the Dominion Government's duty
ends. As I said before, the Dominion Government are absolutely not responsible for
one cent of the deficit. They are not
responsible in any way financially. The
producers say they want a co-operative
method of selling their wheat, like the old
Board.
Honourable gentlemen may call
this an experiment, but I claim that the old
Wheat Board proved the advantages that
I have indicated. One was in the selling of
the wheat on the same basis for the
farmers, whether they were located near
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

the station or far away from it.
The
trading was done under exactly the same
conditions. As to this Board, I take the
right honourable gentleman's word that
the leader of the Progressives in the other
House said that this was an experiment.
What I thought he said was that the Board
was to be temporary. I do not remember
definitely; therefore I will not say that the
leader of the Progressives did not say that
this was an experiment. I will tell you
where the experiment came in. When the
previous Wheat Board was organized,
during the war, many of the farmers in the
West thought it would not work. As you
will observe in exaimining this Bill, they
pay a certain amount of money and are
given participation tickets. For instance,
they are given 20 per cent or 30 per cent.
That permits the farmer to pay the bills
which are pressing. He does not have to
haul all his wheat and rush it on to the
market in the early part of the season.
That is one of the principal purposes of
this Bill-to permit the wheat to be sold
over the year instead of being rushed on
the market all at once, so that a Grain
Exchange or speculators may take advantage of the fact and get it at a lower price.
One of the great objects of this Bill is to
allow the selling of the wheat to spread
over the year.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Will this Commission have the right to buy wheat outright?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: You mean the
Board?
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I mean the
Board, Commission, or combine, or whatever you call it. The honourable gentleman
knows what I mean. Will this Board have
any right to buy the wheat outright?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: To pay in full?
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: That is what I
want to know.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I will tell my
honourable friend. The principal object of
this Board is to market the wheat to the
best advantage of the farmers of that
country.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: I quite understand that.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, when I heard my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
on this Wheat Board, my memory was carried back a great many years ago to the
time when, ia the other House, I often
heard him do the saine thing, and do it
just as well as hie did to-night. He bas
put up a straw man and then proceeded
to knock him down, just as neatly and
effectively as possible. The right honourable gentleman bas pictured to this House
the terrible results that will follow if this
Wheat Board is established.
We did not have a Wheat Board last
year, and what happened then? We had
a Wheat Board two or three years ago,
established when the price of wheat was
away up high, and when it would have gone
up very much higher if the Wheat Board
had not been established. The wheat growers of the West, through the establishment
of that Board, got in many cases less than
they would have received had there been
no Wheat Board. They got a good, big
price; it was a very satisfactory price, and
it worked very wellHon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the hionourable gentleman a question? What foundation bas he for making the statemeat
that the price would have gone very much
higher if the Wheat Board had not existed?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: This reason is that
it shut out ail speculation in the wheat of
those provinces.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Will not this
Wheat Board do the saine?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It shut out al
speculation in wheat. The price at that
time was over $2 a bushel. It had gone
up to $3. Some of the farmers in my old
constituency sold carloads of .wheat at
$3 a bushel net at their own station, and
when the Wheat Board came in'to operation
they very likely put a good price on the
wheat, and got a good price.
There bas been very great dissatisfaction among the farmers of the West. What
happened? As everybody knows, during the
past few years, we have not had in the
West very good crops, and the farmers
were pressed by those to whom they
owed money, and were in many instances forced to draw their wheat
to the market just as soon as the wheat
was threshed; and what was the result?
The price of good wheat throughout the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

went down to 75 cents, and ia many cases
even as low as 60 cents a bushel to the
farmer. The farmers were forced to draw
the wheat to the markets, and the resuit was
that it was bought by the speculators; and
as soon as the winter set in and the farmers
could flot bring their wheat to market
any more, what happened? The wheat,
which was chiefly in the hauds of the
speculators, went up from 35 to 45 cents a
bushel above what the farmers got for it.
Who got the benefit of that? Did the consumer get any benefit in the price of bread?
Last year when wheat was bringing 60
or 65 or 75 cents a bushel, how much less
did the consumers in any part of the
Dominion pay as compared wîth the time
when wheat was consisting $2.25? Who
got the benefit? It was chiefly the middlemen who boug'ht the wheat and held it for
a. few months and got a profit of 40 to 45
cents a bushel on it. That is the condition that this Bill is going to try to overcome. This Board will take the wheat and
handle it, and pay, not 20 or 25 per cent,
as my honourable friend suggests, but in
ail probability about 70 per cent, and there
will not be the slightest danger of a deficit. The farmers will be enabled to pay
off some of their debts. If they get only
70 cents, and the wheat when it is sold
brings $1 a bushel, there will be a distribution, as there was before, of 30 cents
a bushel-and this time the farmers will
not throw their certificates away.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Does this legisiation
apply to, oats or feed or other kinds of
grain?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the
honourable gentleman whether this Bill
will interfere in any way with the Grain
Growers' Company of the West?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do not know
whether it will interfere with the Grain
Growers' Grain Company or not. If this
Bill is in the interest of the farmers, it is
in the interest of the grain growers, and
the grain growers are anxiousHon. Mr. CALDER: He says the Grain
Growers' Grain Company.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF. They are just the
samne as any other speculative company, I
imagine, and they are supporting it. At
ahl events, the President of the Company
is supportîng it, and it seems to me that
they must be in favour of it. The grain
merchants throughout the country are not
supporting it, but I am not sure that that
is not a good sign for the people.

JUNE 26, 1922
At ail events, as my right hono*fable
friend has said, this is only an experiment:
it may not; work out as well as the farmers
expect it to do. But, surely, when they
are practicaliy a unit in demanding it,
and when it is flot; going to cost the Dominion one single dollar, there can be no
great objection to passing legisiation to, enable those provinces to try it out for themselves.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Does my honourable friend think it will be brought into
force this year?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I do.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Two of the three
Western Provinces have to, ask for it.
They wili have to cail their Legislatures
in order to do so. Do you thinlc they will
do that?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: This Bill is of
such importance to the people of the three
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and
Alberta that they will caîl their Legisiatures together and pass the necssary legislation-at ieast, I am assured by a number of people from these provinces to whom
I have spoken, that that will be done.
.In my opinion, this Board wiil be a
benefit not only to the three provinces, but
to the whole Dominion, for the reason that
speculating will to a great extent be shut
off, and the millers will be able to buy
wheat cheaper than tbey would if the
grain got into the hands of speculators,
as it did last year.
My rîght honourabie friend says he
is afraid that the buyers from European
countries, particularly from Britain, wil!
be deterred from. coming across to buy
because this legisiation enables the provinces to refuse to seIl their wheat.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: To make a
corner.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: What is the object
of the larmer? Is it not to seil bis wbeat?
It is to seli his wheat to the best advantage,
and to get bis money as soon as he can to
pay off his debts, or, if he bas no debts,
to buy what he wants. My judgment is that
this legisiation will benefit the farmers,
the consumers, and trade generally
througbout the Dominion, and I do not
think there is anytbing in it to prevent
buyers coming bere. In fact, to my mind
there wiil be an additional inducement for
a buyer coming from the old country wbc'
wants to buy a million or two or three
million bushels of wbeat. Instead of going

will go to the Board-the oniy concern in
those provinces that will be selling wheatand he will be able to buy what he wants.
I think the resuit of the Wheat Board will
be so satisfactory that it will become more
or less of a permanent institution for
handling the grain of our western country.
If it is advantageous to the western farmer
in that he gets more money out of his crop,
it will be advantageous to the merchants
and the manufacturers of Canada, because
there is no better spender on earth thail
the western farmer. When times are good
and he has mioney to spend, he spends. it,
and it is practically ail spent on manufactured goods. That being so, everyonc
will reap the benefit, and I say by al
means let us give this measure a trial.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Is not this on the
same principle as the Cheese Boards that
operate in the eastern provinces?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I imagine it is.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They work very
satisfactorily.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I really do not
know enough about the Cheese Boards to
be able to say f or certain, but I think it
is along the same line. This is a co-operative method of seiling wheat, and that is
practically ail it is. The provinces assume
the responsibiiity, but the advances made
by the Board will not be large enough to
cause any danger of a deficit to anybody.
The farmers may not get as large an
amount in their second payment as they
expect, but they wiil get something, and
there will be no deficît and no loss to anybody.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: They wiil get
whatever there is.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFE: They will get
whatever there is in their wheat, and the
speculators will not make so much money,
and, in my judgment, the consumer of
bread will get'it much cheaper.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I have made
some memoranda, but as I cannot see theni
without my glasses, I wiil not bother you
with them. I have said practicaiiy ail I
want to say. Give the farmers what they
are asking for, and if that does not work

SENATE
From the Pro-

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The honourable
gentleman says very clearly and very convincingly that the purpose of this legislation is not to prevent but to facilitate the
sale of wheat.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It is to facilitate
the sale.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable gentleman now tell me how this measure would serve any better than a measure
that would create a voluntary board for
the purpose of facilitating the sale? Will
he tell me what the difference would be,
and how this measure will better enable
them to sell their wheat. If they all
gathered together and agreed upon a commission for the purpose of selling their
wheat, woulld not that accomplish the same
purpose?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Well, honourable
gentlemen, if they would all agree to a
voluntary wheat board, you would have
practically the same thing as a compulsory
board; but you could not get all the
farmers or anything like all the farmers to
agree to it. You could not get any class of
peopie to agree to anything like that voluntarily. But the great majority want the
compulsory board.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then it means
confiscation.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I follow
up my question with another?
If there
were a voluntary board, and if everybody
agreed, my honourable friend claims that
that board would be equivalent to a conpulsory board.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: In effect, yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do I understand
then, that the difference between a voluntary board and a compulsory board is that
what the people of Saskatchewan want is
the power to coerce the minority of the
farmers?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Why did you

not agree yesterday to coerce the Indians?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think I
enjoyed an advantage that some honourable
gentleman of this Chamber did not have.

attend, all the meetings of the other House
on this Bill. Do not infer from that, however, that I am going to make a long

speech. I am not going to oppose this
legislation, but I am free to confess that I
am not very hopeful of any benefits being
derived from it. The honourable gentleman
from Assinibola (Hon. Mr. Turriff) in
almost the last words he uttered before he
was asked certain questions, said this was
co-operation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Coercion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Co-operation
by coercion.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The farmers
from the West have been developing various
co-operative organizations and in the
development of the co-operative marketing
of wheat they would have my endorsement.
But the very essence of co-operation implies voluntary consent. There is no voluntary consent in this. The Board have the
right to take our wheat and to prohibit the
sale or impose such restrictions or conditions as they like upon the export of
wheat from the province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend tell us what happens if a
farmer refuses to come under that provision?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
He is not allowed to take his wheat out.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I presume
he could not market his wheat at all. The
position the Minister of Agriculture occupied in relation to this Bill is a matter
of public knowledge. I am not going to
criticize the position of any man, but it is
not known to every one that the Minister
of Agriculture, at all events-and I live
in the constituency adjoining his, and
know whereof I speak-owed his election
to a large extent to his supposed belief in
a Wheat Board. I for one came down to
this House fully convinced that the Minister of Agriculture was a believer in a
compulsory Wheat Board. I have learned
that I was in error, and that the Minister of Agriculture was a believer in a
voluntary board. I am sorry to think
that if he is a believer in a voluntary
Wheat Board, he is still as inconsistent as
he was before, because the Board constituted under the provisions of this Act
is not a voluntary Board. As I have
said, and as it has been pointed out, the
Board has the power to take the wheat
and to restrict its sale, and has absolutely
compulsory powers.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or purchase?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Or purchase,

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: I would like
to ask the honourable gentleman where he
finds in the Bill a statement that any individual farmer is bound to sell his grain
to the Board?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The clause

Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: The clause at
the end only deals with two Orders in
Council that may be passed to prevent the
export of grain from any province. As
far as I can see, it does not interfere with
the individual right.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But if they

as may be deemed advisable upon the
export of wheat from that province," surely
they can regulate the buying of it? Surely
that is implied?
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
think so.

I should not

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If they can
impose conditions for the export of wheat,
they can prohibit the export of my wheat
from the province, surely.
As I said, I did not rise for the purpose
of attacking this Bill, but I think there is
a fundamental misconception in connection with the marketing of grain. The
fundamental idea referred to by the right
honourable gentleman who first addressed
the House is that by this Bill the farmers
can enhance the pricle of their products;
and there is a conception that they can
easily keep the grain over from October
for one year more if they think they are
going to get a higher price. Figures and
data were laid before the special Committee of the House of Commons, and will
be found in other publications, demonstrating absolutely that in the course of years
from 1908 to 1920, in the Winnipeg Board
of Trade, the closing prices of grain were
less at the end of the year than they were
in the month of October when the grain
was marketed. I have the figures here.
Similar investigations were made in Minneapolis, and also by one of the professors
at Harvard, and by a professor at the
University of Chicago.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: What was the reason
that they were lower?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I cannot give
you the reason: I can only state the fact
that the imports to the English market
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

are a strickingly regular average amount,
taking them month by month the year
round.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Is it the amount of
southern wheat that is coming in then
from the Argentine?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, there
is an amount coming in then, but the
English grain dealers have not the large
storage facilities that we have in this
country, and they buy on comparatively
short dates. They do not stock up for long
times ahead. The large storages are in
this country, in the United States, and
in Argentine. But if you take the elevator
charges, plus the interest on your money,
which costs 1 cents per bushel per month,
and strike an average over a period of
years, you will find that the farmer who
has sold his wheat in the month of October
has been the gainer. If that be the case,
then fundamentally there can be no great
gain in attempting to carry grain over
till the next summer. I do believe that the
prices in the months of January, February
and March, have often subsided or slumped
to some extent. It has been shown by
absolute mathematical demonstration for
years that the farmer has not gained by
carrying his grain over.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: There is no
attempt to carry it over by this Board.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No, but the
theory is that you must not glut the market
by rushing it out at once. At the present
time, under the old method of handling the
grain, the farmer can put it in an elevator
and get an advance on it at once. Under
the Wheat Board he can put his grain in
an elevator and he will get a participation
certificate. At present, however, he can
go to a grain dealer and get the advance
on his grain the very moment he puts it
in; so that in my opinion there is not the
necessity for the farmer dumping his grain
out now with the Grain Board, any more
than there was under the methods of the
grain buyer.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would like to have
the views of the honourable gentleman on
clause 10, as to the extent to which the
province could legislate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Well, it would
seem to me that, under clause 10, the Board
might have powers conferred on it by the
Legislature of the Province, because it
involves przperty and civil rights.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I draw your attention to the last words, "within the legislative authority of the province."

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. Mr. WVILLOUGHBY: The question
is, vihat art Jne powers of legislation possessed by the province?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, for purèhase
and sale.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have grave
doubts as to the right of the province to
put any restriction on my right to export
grain out of the province. That touches
property and civil rights. I think it can
expropriate the grain in the province.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But export is governed by section 20.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes. Wihen
you are dealing with the legal phase, it
may not be known that long prior to the
last election the legal gentlemen connected
with the Grain Growers' Association of
the West had given their opinion that the
old Grain Board could not be legalized at
the present tinue. The solicitor for the
Saskatchewan Grain Board gave a written
opinion long before the election was on,
while candidates were being chosen, stating
that the Wheat Board, constituted as it
had heretofore been, would be ultra vires.
The old Board, with ail its powers, would
perhaps be a very gocod thing for the West;
but it is not compatible with my ideas of
right for the rest of Canada. However,
vie cannot have it now, because it was created under the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was there anything of this kind of coercion in the old
Wheat Board?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Absolutely.
It had the most coercive, the most drastic
poviers; they viere found in section 6 of
chapter 40, the old Ac-the Dominion
Board, constituted under the War Measures
Act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I would like to
cail the attention of the Government, viho
are assuming the responsibility for this
measure, to article 121 of the British North
America Act, which says:
Ail articles of the growth, produce, or mýanufacture of any one of the provinces, shall, from
and after the Union, be adnxItted free into each
of the other provinces.

I wiii ask niy honourable friends on the
other side if, in their opinion, the law now
before the House is not en absolute violation of this clause of the constitution?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does not that
clause refer merely to duty?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If my honourable friends foliow, they wiii see that there
is a special clause, 122, that deals with
duties, maintaining the old export duties
as they were.
Hon. Mr~. BEIQUE: Export means outside the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It meant from
one province to another.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: What is 122?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It is this:
The custoins and excise Iaws of each province,
sha1, gubjet to the provisions of this Act, continue in force until aitered by the Parliamnent
of Canada.
But it is distinctly stated in the constitution--and it seems to me the purpose
of the law was obvios-that nothing could
be done by the Federal Parliament with
the object of preventing exporting from one
province to, another.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is duty.
Hon. Mr.'MeMEANS: I would ask ny.
honourable friend what about the liquor
tramei?.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Exactly, and I
b el.ieve îît is the samne-a violation. But
to my mind the purpose is obvious, for
if you allow the provinces to surround
themselves with vialls of protection, how
are you going to make this country a
unity? My honourable friend from Saskcatchewan has pleaded the case of the
farmer, and hie has placed it in the best
possible light fromn their point of view. H1e
says that their only purpose is to help
the fariners to, seli to advantage by grouping them together. I suggest to, him that
hie wili succeed so long as the farnuers
get more money for their wheat; but the
farmers of the West cannot get more money
for their wheat unless the farmer in my
own Province pays more money for bis
bread.
Oh, yes, they
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
can.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Wait a minute.
The farmer in my province will not very
long pay more money for his bread unless
hie forces the farmer in the West to, pay
more for the commodities which he himself
produces.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: We are doing that
now, and we have been doing that ail our
lives-paying more for the produet that the
farmer uses to the manufacturer in
Quebec.

Vit)j

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know the old
cry that comes from the West: the poor
children who 'have always been ill-treated
by Confederation are the children of the
West. May I tell them that the opinion
of the East is very different. It is that
they are spoiled children of Confederation.
They get cheaper transportation for their
wheat than applies anywhere else in the
world. They have had their railway built
with the money that came from the Eastthat had to be produced in the East.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
No, no.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Wait a minute-by the farmers as well as by theHon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is the old
game.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know that is
very easy for the man from the West
simply to make an affirmation, wave his
hand, and say, "I have proved something."
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The man from
the West has a great deal of assurance: he
has what I call the western spirit. He
comes down to Parliament and takes off
his coat, rolls up his sleeves, and says,
"I must get it." Then the people from
the East ask why? "I must get it," is the
answer. But give me a convincing answer.
The answer in the past has not been quite as
convincing or effective as it is at present,
but it has been, and it is now, the big
stick. You are using it now. Let me tell
you one thing: if you succeed, if you raise
the price of your wheat, the farmer from
the province of Quebec will ask that
the price
of
his hay be raised.
Do not forget that the Quebec farmers
have a greater agricultural production
than the farmers in the Western Provinces. Do not forget that Ontario produces a great deal more agricultural products than any two provinces of the West.
Do you not think that, when the majority
of the people pay more for their bread, they
will ask for equal protection? This measure is to my mind protection to the last
degree, and if every province exacts its
pound of flesh by coming to Parliament
and asking to be given means whereby its
farmers may artificially raise the prices of
what they produceHon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: This Bill does
not say that at all.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I say it.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I do not.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know the honourable gentleman does not. I say the
only possibly reason you can have for the
passing of this Bill is to raise the price.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: No, no.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Will not the honourable gentleman agree that the Liverpool
market governs the price of wheat? And
how can the Western farmers by means
of the Wheat Board get more than the
markets of the world will give them?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not prepared to say.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: That is the honourable gentleman's argument.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not prepared to say that this legislation will be
successful. I believe it is not going to be.
But what I do say is that the only reasonable purpose there can be is to raise the
price of wheat.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: It will be cheaper.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It will prevent the
speculator robbing the producers. That is
the purpose.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am going
back, honourable gentlemen, to where I
began. What I said in the beginning was
what led directly, in my opinion, to the
second argument. If each province is
going artificially to raise the price of what
it produces, what is to become of unity
in this country? I desire simply 4o put
this question to the Government: is that
not clearly forbidden by article 121 of
the British North America Act, which says
that there shall be no interference whatever with the produce of one province being
exported to any other province of the
Dominion? My humble opinion is that this
measure is ultra vires and, if attacked, will
be so declared by the courts.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to say just one word with
reference to this Bill. Personally I have
the gravest doubt as to its success. Nevertheless I am not going to oppose the Bill.
My reason is mainly that mentioned by
the honourable member for Moosejaw
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) and the honourable.member for Ottawa City (Hon. Mr.

JUNE 26, 1922
Belcourt). There is no question at ail that
in the three prairie provinces to-day the
great mass of our farmers are in favour
of legisiation of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: No doubt.
Hon. Mr CALDER: And they are in
favour of it for one main reason: they
have a hope that by this legisiation the
average price they will receive for their
grain throughout the entire season will be
greater than it is at the present time.
They do not expect that frorn day to day,
by any manipulation on the part of the
Board, they will enhance the price of
wheat for a particular day, but they hope
that the Board will control the flow of
wheat to the European and Canadian markets in such a way that at the end of the
season the farmers generally-for it is intended that they shahl ail get the same
price-will receive a higher price than
t.hey would under the present rnethod of
handling grain.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend tell us why and how?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: For this reason.
We rnight discuss for a week the problem
now before us, and I dare say rnany of us
would be as far away frorn a clear understanding of it as I arn at the present
time; for it is an exceedingly complicated,
intricate problem and requires, one might
say, a lifetime of study to understand it.
That is my experience with it, and I have
lived in the West and have been confronted with the problem a great many
times. However, the idea is this. The
price of wheat is fixed at Liverpool, practically for the world. It is determined
by the flow of wheat there and by the demand for wheat from time to time. It is
hoped that by means of this legislation
a Board will intervene and control the
surplus that Canada has, in such a way
as to prevent the drop of the Liverpool
price. The drop, as I understand it, is
the basic, underlying idea.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: By controlling
the shipping?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, no-by controlling the flow, the quantity thlat reaches
the Liverpool market or is on the way to
the Liverpool market.
I have always maintained, with respect
to this question, that if the wheat-producing Dations of the world would get together and form pooîs or boards, such
as is intended here, the purpose in view
might be accornplished; but my own idea

66'

is, as the right honourable gentleman who
spoke first (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) pointed out, that the tendency
will be for this legisiation to defeat the
very object that we have in view. So long
as the Argentine, India, Egypt, the United
States, and other wheat-producing countries have not boards that will control the
flow of wheat from those countries to that
market, what is going to happen? Well,
you can easily imagine. The Board in
this country that is endeavouring by its
operations to control that flow from Canada and thereby to enhance the price of
wheat to our producers, is simply antagonizing ail the buyers of the world; that
is ail there is to it; and the tendency wiil
be for the buyers of ail those European
countries to get their wheat without looking to Canada for a supply.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: To boycott Canad]a.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly. That is
exactly what I arn afraid of. I arn not;
going to take up the time of the House.
This is a very big question. As the honourable member from Assinibola (Hon. Mr.
Turriff) bas said, this is purely experimental legislation. I have indicated one
objection, which is in my opinion a very
serious one. My own idea, but I may be
wrong, is that in the end our people are
goîng to suifer by this legisiation. That is
my idea. I state it frankly. I may be
wrong. I have no doubt that those who are
promoting the legislation have the very
best intentions as to what is to be accomplished, and they think it will be accomplished. From my knowledge of the subject, I believe there is the very gravest
danger that our people, ail the people of
Canada, may suifer by legislation of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will the honourable gentleman allow me to ask him
whether the object aimed at by this Bill 's
not identically the samne that the grain
growers had?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Of course, they
have advocated this. They have advocated
it since the Wheat Board was first formed,
in 1919. There was a howl of opposition
to that Board. The whole of Western
Canada was up in arms against it. The
honourable gentleman from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriif) thought that if the
Board had net been brought into existence
wheat would have gone soaring and the
farmers would have received higher prices.
Nobody knows beter than he that the

668

SENATE

prices that were being paid in the Winnipeg
market at that time were purely speculative prices-prices offered by speculators
from the United States.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: May I correct my
honourable friend? During the working
of that Wheat Board the farmer across
the line got a higher price for his wheat,
month in and month out, than the Western
farmer got from the Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I can understand
that.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Well, he did.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: He did, for th:s
very reason, that at that particular time
the American Government had a Board ->f
Control that guaranteed the prices and
they were not paying one dollar more.
There may have been a certain amount of
trading in wheat, but it was infinitesimal,
and what occured during the first twa
weeks or the first ten days after the
opening of the market in Winnipeg was
purely speculative.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The Americans
had a minimum guarantee, not a maximum.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, but the
American Government at the same time
practically took control as we took control.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: No; they guaranteed a minimum price.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They controlled the
price, as we eventually had ta do. However, that is aside from the question.
I have pointed out one phase of the matter. Now, there is another phase, and that
is the compulsory feature. That, I must
say, I do not like.
People are farming
under entirefly different conditions. I will
give an illustration. I come in, we will say,
from the United States. I bring $75,000
and invest it in one of those Western provinces, buying one of the very best farms
I can buy, within a mile of a railway. I
have all my plans. I build an elevator at
the railway station. I am in a position,
on account of my capital, to take full advantage of the world's market at any time.
But no: this Board comes in. As everybody knows, the prices at the opening of
the market are as a rule the best. We will
say the price of wheat is $1.50 and during
the season is draps te $1.20 or $1.30.
I
have all the facilities. I have invested my
capital and made all my arrangements se
that I may take advantage of the market at
any time. As a result of my ability and
the investment of my capital I am preHon. Mr. CALDER.

pared te take the fullest advantage of the
market. But no! Under this legislation it
is declared: "You shall not do se.
Your
wheat shall go into the eommon pot, and
at the end of the season, no matter what
the average price ýis, that price and no
more shall you get."
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is what the
farmers are asking for.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I know they are
asking for it. I say I doubt very much the
advisability of the establishment of that
Board. Here is one man who cames in and
locates himself on a first-class farm close
te a railway, and has the capital te invest
in an elevator. Another man is located 20
miles from a railway and bas not the same
facilities. You are getting pretty close te
-shall I say-extreme socialismn. You are
not very far from it.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Communism.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It may be all right,
but that is the principle embodied in this
Bill; and, if I am not mistakenHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is Communism.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -if this legislation
goes into force and is operated, there will
be thousands of farmers in Western Canada who will come te understand it and
will not have the same faith in it as they
appear te have at the present time. It is
an experiment. I am prepared te see the
experiment go on.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Honourable gentlemen, I am not going te attempt to make
a speech, but I want to say that I regret
that I cannot agree with many of my
friends from the West with regard te this
measure. I believe this is vicious legislation. I have had this opinion ever since
the question has been discussed.
It is
paternal legislation and, I believe, is not in
the best interest of the farmers, many of
whom have been asking for it. In the
northern part of Manitoba, especially in
the constituency I represent, I have a large
number of friends who raise, not only
wheat, but a large number of cattle and
all kinds of root crops. If the Government
can justify creating a Wheat Board te
take possession and take care of the wheat
from the farmers of Saskatchewan and
Alberta and guarantee the price te the
farmers, the men who are raising live
stock in Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan have just as good or a better right
te dermand that the Government create
facilities te take care of their livestock.

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Nobody denies
that.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Just a year ago,
when there was a shortage of fodder ahl
through the West, the farmers in that
western country had to sacrifice their livestock-in sanie cases practically had ta
give it away. The wheat grower has neyer
been confron<ted with a situation of that
kind, simply because wheat can be held
over. Livestock cannot. 1 coitend that
if the Gavernment enters upon a pohicy of
this kind, of creating what is class legislatien of the very worst kind, every other
industry outside .of farming will have the
right ta make a similar demand upon the
Government.
However, I honestly believe that the
legisiation will neyer go tinte force. I do
not believe the provinces wilh ever concur
ixn it. I do not behieve that the majority
of the farmers in those Western Provinces
wiIl agree ta it. The coercive feature of
this legisiation is, in my opinion, obnoxiaus,
and will not appeal ta the farmiers of the
West. To me it looks very much as though
the Government and those responsible for
this legislation were 9imply " passing the
buck" ta the Provinces in the West, and
1 think yau will find that they will refuse
ta accept it.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed ta.*
On section 2-Canadian Wheat Board ta
be appointed:
In studying
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT:
that section I find that provision is made
for the appoiutment of a Chairman and
an Assistant Chairman, and apparently
there are ta, be ten members of the Board;
but, though I have examined the Bill caref ulhy, I cannot discover any section which
provides for the appointment of the members other than the Chairman and the Assistant Chairman. It may be ini the Bill,
but I have failed ta discover it.
Right Han. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
It ia in section 2.
Hou. Mr. PROUDFOOT: But who is
gaing ta appoint them? It says there shall
be ten members, but I do not see it mentioned how they are ta 'be. appointed.

669

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: By the
Governor in Council. It is stated in the
first line.
Right Han. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The first line of section 2.
Han. Mr. PROUD FOOT: Yes, it says the
Board shall consist of nlot more than ten
members.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: "The Governor
in Council may appoint" the Board.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2 ta 6, both included, were
agreed to.
On section 7-sales ta Canadian millers
on same basis -as to f oreign buyers:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE - This says that
49sales shall be on the same basis with
respect te price, termas of delivery, etc., as
sales ta foreign buyers."l
Right. Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is for the Board.
Section 7 was agreed ta.
Sections 8 to 12, both included, were
agreed ta.
On section 13-disbursements for expenses or otherwise ta be deducted. from
proceeds of season's operations:
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is one point that I want te call ta
the attention of the Government. There
seeýns te be a contradiction. The theory
of the Board is tihat it may obtain advancea
of money from such sources as are spoken
of, and that it may take deliveries, and
with that nioney psy the person who delivers the wheat a certain fixed price or
initial prie, and at the same time give
a participation ticket. After the operations
of the year are over, and aIl sales have
been made, and ail expenses and disbursenients have been paid, if there is a surplus
it is, ta be divided among the participation
ticket holders pro rata. I understand that
that was the practice of the old Wheat
Board. The lest line in section 13 says
that. after the dishursements are made,'
and after ail the payments have been
received and aIl disbursements mnade, the
balance shail be distributed pro rata amoing
the producers and others holding participation certificates. Th'at is, plain.
Now, I turn to section 16 for the purpose
of my comparison. It says:
The

Government

of

Canada

shall

flot

be

responsible for any3 deficits that mnay occur in
the operatiofis of the Board In concurring pro-

SENATE
x'inces, and should a surplus occur it shall be
divided among the concurring provinces on a
pro rata basis.

If ail the wheat has been sold and ail the
expenses paid and the surplus is distrihuted to the participation certificate
holders, how in the world can there be any
surplus to, be distributed between the two
provinces?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: When the Board
was in existence before, a number of these
certificate hollders neyer asked for the
money at ail. Thèy had sold their certificates, or lost thein.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That might probably occur, but it probably will not; occur to any large extent
this time. During the operation of the
last Board they had not got on to the idea
that the participation certificates- were of
very much value. There was a surplus
under the operation of the old Board, aind
that was turned into consolidated revenue.
In this case it will be turned into the provinces.
Section 13 was agreed to.
Sections 14 to 19, both inclusive, were
agreed to.
On section 20-power to prohibit or impose conditions on export wheat from province:
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If one -province
bas regulations different from another,
what happens? Who is going to settle the
difference? This section says:
The Board shall have power by regulation
approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of any province.

Hon. Mr. WLLOUGHBY: And it says:
and also approved
in Couneil.

by the

Governor

GeneraI

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Governor
General in Council would see that they
harmonized.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If Alberta did not choose to put on an
export restriction, she could not be compelled to put it on, and consequently the
restriction would refer only to Saskatchewan. That goes to show how unusual this
legislation is.
Section 20 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 187,
an Act to amend the Income War Tax Act,
1917.
Hon. Mr. Daniel in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
Mr. Russell to come to the floor.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-travelling expenses:
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Before this
section carnies would the honourable
Minister explain how the section as
amended would read? Does this apply
specially to commercial travellers and
railway employees?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think it
ducs.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The Minister
gave that explanation a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The travelling expenses of commercial travellers wereflot deducted from their total income. Now,
in virtue of this clause, they may be
deducted.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Does the section
specially mention commercial traveilers,
or are they the only people to whoma it
would apply?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should think
not. It is much wider than that. It saysr

JUNE 26, 1922
Travelling expenses including the entire
amount expended for meals and lodging, while
awlay froni homue in the pursuit of a trade or
business.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
What is the old section of the Act, and
how is it changed by this?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wilI turn to
the Act of 1917, as amended in 1919. It
says:
In determlining the income no deduction shall
be allowed In respect of persona] and living
expenses, and in cases in which personal and
living expenses form part of the profit, gain
or remuneration of the taxpayer, the sanie shall
be asseeed as Income for the purposes of this
Act;
Deficits or losses sustainefi ln transactions

the chie! bu4siness, trade or profession or occupation of the taxpayer shall fot be deducted
from income derived fron the chie! business,
trade, profession or occupation of the taxpayer
in determining hie taxabie Income.

Then cornes the clause in the Bill:
Travelling expenses
(lncludlng the entire
amount expended for meals and lodging) while
&^way from borne in the pursuit of a trade or
business.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
is apparently a description or qualification. The expenses of any one in the pursuit of a trade or business will be exempt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, it is
not limited to commercial travellers.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Would that apply to, professional men? Theirs is flot a
trade.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
It
would apply to, any one away from home
in pursuit of a trade or business. It is
a business.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-normal tax:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would like
to, ask the Minister what the old section
was. I think there has been a change.
'Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Paragraph a

On seation 2-powers of Minister:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the administration of the Act it was found that a
number of applications were submitted by
persons so seriously ill that they had no
expectancy of life, and in many cases the
illness was not in any way attributable to
military service. Section 13 of the present Act gives the Minister of Finance
discretion to refuse to insure any soldier
for sufficient reason. This amendment defines the classes of cases in which insurance shall be refused. Briefly, it confines
insurance in cases where the applicant is
seriously ill to cases where the illness is
directly attributable to war service, and
there are actual dependents. There is a
proviso, however, adopted by the House
on a motion by the Opposition, which permits the insurance of all returned soldiers,
even though they are so seriously ill that
they have no expectancy of life, so long
as they have dependents up to and inclusive of January lst, 1923. The schedule
attached to the Act indicates in detail the
classes of cases in which insurance will not
be granted.

CONSIDERED

IN COMMLTTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into 'Committee on Bill 192,
an Act to amend The Pension Act, 1919.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1-"-ýwidowed mother" defiiùed:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This amendnment is designed to render deserted
mothers, when the circumstances are exceptional, as eligible for pension on the
saine basis as a widowed mother. The
case of a mother deserted for some turne
and without any knowledge of hier hus-band's whereabouts, and therefore unable
to compel support, would thus be pensionable in the discretion of the Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would my honourable friend read the definition of
"widowed inother"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
definition.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-time in which application

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The insertion
of the word "or" between clauses (a) and
<b) and between clauses (b) and (c) resuits in giving to dependents the right to

Declaration of Peace (August 31, 1921).
Previously dlaims by dependents had to

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I would like to

widowed mother. Take the case of a
mother who lost hier eldest son in 1918, and

she come under the definition of a widowed

SENATE

New subsection 7 of section 20 was
agreed to, and section 4 of the Bill was
agreed to.
On section 5-pension to widow:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The effect
of this amendment will be to render eligible for pension widows of ex-members of
the forces who have contracted marriage
within one year of the soldier's discharge
and whose death is attributable to an
injury or disease which had made its
appearance prior to the date of marriage.
The law, previous to this amendment, excluded all cases where marriage had taken
place subsequent to the appearance of an
injury or disease which resulted in death.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: I think that is one
of the clauses that the Board should be very
particular about. It appears to me it is
opening the door rather wide, to allow a
pension in the case of a person who has
married within one year after being discharged from the forces, and who even at
that time was suffering to such an extent
that in all probability he was unlikel-y to
recover. Perhaps marriage is contracted
just for the purpose of the pension. That is
a rather wide clause to put into this
Bill, if I understand it aright. Just consider how wide it is. It says, "within one
year after the date of discharge from
the forces." Suppose a man who has been
discharged is in receipt of a 50, 60 or 70
per cent pension. The chances are, medically, that he can never recover, and in all
probability his injury or disease will sooner
or later cause his death. We know very
well that there were many marriages contracted during the war simply for the purpose of obtaining the returned soldier's gratuity. Might not a similar thing happen
in this case? I have the greatest sympathy
for men who are disabled or injured and
who desire to marry; it is a natural desire;
but at the same time I think that in this
case the pension might me abused to such
an extent that this very class might become a great burden on the country. Without definitely opposing the clause, I think
it is opening the door very wide.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has the
Government any information as to the number of cases there would be of this class,
or as to what woul.d be the liability that
we are assuming?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is reckoned
that by the passing of this amendment
there will be an additional liability of
$125,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A year?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Per annum?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then
I would suggest that this should stand
over until we can fully consider it. It
seems to me that the pensions laws already
placed upon the statute book are more
than generous, and particularly in regard
to dependents. If this bad regard to exsoldiers suffering disability I could very
well appreciate the desirability of extending the provisions of the Pension Act to
men of that kind; but we are, in my judgment, going away beyond what we should
do in regard to dependents, particularly
in a matter of this kind. I think we had
better make haste slowly in extending
the provisions of the Pension Act, especially to those who have not participated in
any way in the activities of the war, and
who at the time of marriage did not contemplate that they would be entitled to a
pension. So this is a gratuitous provision
in favour of persons who did not expect
to become beneficiaries of a pension of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: A good point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend does not state the case fully
The persons concerned were married ir

wife of a pension.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That

Because the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:-deprives her of a pension. And now we are
imposing upon the Government the obligation of paying her a pension, notwithstanding that she was not entitled to it
and was by statute precluded from receiving it.

Hon. Mr. PARDEE: And of paying
pensions to persons who may yet be married.
lon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
the better way is to strike out the clause.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: I think so too.
Hon Mr. BELCOURT: I should think
that in many cases the woman would
know of the disease of the man she was
ma rying and of the likelihood of his not
living much longer. Probably the obtaining of this pension would be an inducement to marriage.

JUNE 26, 1922
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would very often be the case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think my honourable friend is right.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I would like to ask a question. When in
a case like this you have proceeded for a
number of years on a narrower margin or
limit, and now you widen the limit, is the
effect to go back and retroactively even
up similar cases?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
because all these marriages must have been
contracted.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If that is so, it is still more serious; and
it seems serious enough under the statements that have been made already in the
Committee. There is always that pressure. The United States, fifty years after
the Civil WarHon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, it would
not be retroactive.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It would not be retroactive?
Hon Mr. DANDURAND: The first payment would start on the lst of September
of this year.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not mean retroactive with regard to
this particular case; but there were other
cases which under the preceding limitations were not allowed at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Now pensions are to be allowed to new
applicants. Does this extension go back
and operate upon -all refusals under the
preceding law?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, because
it affects those marriages that took place
within one year after the discharge of the
soldier, and the soldiers were mostly discharged before January or February of
1920.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then it is retroactive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is in effect
retroactive; that is, it covers cases that
were not covered by that Act. It is the
payments that are not retroactive.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: This is an
amendent to the Pensions Act. Is there
not somewhere in the original Act a large
S-43i

.67

discretion left with the Minister to deal
with .such cases?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not in a
case of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, there is
no discretion.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I move that section 5 be -struck out.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: There is perhaps,
I take it, some reason why the- section
might remain. I can understand very well
a discharged soldier who is in a very poor
condition of health getting married and
his wife acting practically as a nurse for
him until he dies. I presume that it must
be with some case of that kind in view that
this clause is included in the Bill. I should
think there might be reasons for allowing
pensions to widows for a reason of that
kind. Perhaps we might give a little more
consideration to that point.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I think that a
returned soldier in the condition referred
to by my honourable friend from St. John
(Hon. Mr. Daniel) is looked after in the
meantime. What I fear is that we may
load up the Pension Act year after year, so
that in fifty years from now we shall be
doing just as the United States is-,paying
more than we paid at the end of the war.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is another
consideration that we must remember: we
do not owe the woman anything.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: She bas rendered
no service. She married the man who did
serve, but he is dead and gone.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is quite possible she may benefit from the insurance,
and she is taken under the Insurance Act.
The motion 'of Hon. Mr. Turriff was
agreed to.
On section 6-disability at time of discharge attributable to military service:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is a
new section and incorporates in the Act the
practice in force for some time past.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: There are very
many border line cases of this kind. The
Commission will say: "This man is ill, but
the difficulty is that the illness he now bas
was not contracted during service and was
not due to service." If a man went on
military service apparently well,- and has
come out in six months, a year, or two

SENATE
years, having somnething the matter with
him, the Board are rather inclined to hold
that the illness was not the resuit of service
at ail. As a rnatter of fact they will go
back to the time of the man's enlistment
and say that the particular disease was
present at that time, and that consequently
hie is flot entitled to a pension. My contention iýs now and bas always been thait a
man who has been on active service cornes
out in considerably worse condition than
hie went in. Even if he had some disease
when hoe entered, we must always remember that the man was accepted by the
country; he was passed by the medical
e'xaminerý, was given bis certificate of
health and went to serve. If he came out
of the service in worse condition than when
he vient in, that man or his dependents are,
1 contend, most assuredly, entitled Vo a
pension. If we desire to broaden the Act
in ýany way at ail, that is a way in which.
it might very well and very equitably be
ibroadened.
I hope that the honourable
gentleman who leads the Opposition (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed), with the experience
hie has ha-d in the Militia Department, will
bear me out in the statement that I have
made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
Vo me that this ýmatter is left very largely
to the Commission to decide whether the
disability was attributable to, or was incurred or aggravated during, service; and,
inasmuch as this responsibility is thrown
upon the Commission, I think wie should
not go further than section 5.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 tbink that
this clause covers exactly the case my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Pardee) bas
in mmnd.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: I should like to
know from the Minister if that was the intention of the Committee at the time the
clause was re-drafteýd and inserted in this
B ill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was drafted
by the law officers of the Crown and is,
I think, fnirly clear.
Lt establishes a
prosu'mption in favour of the soldier, which
must be disproved by the Commission:
Any clisa-bility froin w1hich a rnember of the
fores~ wh ser eÈl in an acturo theatre of the
(;rozi \Vr
was suffering at the tinie of his
discharge, shall for p)ension purnoses be decmed

or aggravated during bis iiitary serv"ice, unIess atni until it be established hv the Commiissin that the disah)ility wasý not attrbutable
to or iineurred or aiggrax ated duri ig such servi!ce.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE.

Foliowing the argument of my honourable, friend, I think that this condition fits
the case hie has in mind: "unless and until
it be established by the Commission that
the disability was not attributable Vo or
during
such
ýncurred
or aggravated
service."
Hon. Mr. PARDEE:
the saving clause.

Quite so.

That is

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
responsibility is upon the Commission Vo
establish that ho is noV entitled Vo it.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Yes, but that does
not cover the point I am making. The onus
is still there. My contention is that if a
man bas beon accepted for service and has
corne out unfit to earn a living, or bas
djed, then bis dependents are entitled Vo
bis pension by reason of the fact that he
xvas acceptod and did serve. When hie was
taken into the service hie was supposed Vo
be an A-i man. He is therefore entitled Vo
that pension while living, whether or noV
his disability wvas aggravated by service,
and if hie bas died the dependents hie bas
left behind him are entiled Vo a pension.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
are a great many cases in which tho
evidence is incontrovertible that the man
enlisted at a time when he was suffering
from the disability.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We
know that so great xvas the rivalry during
the organization of the different forces
that many Commanding Officers implored
mon Vo join, and the medical examinationxvas practically not observed. I suppose
there are hundreds of tubercular cases
which to-day are being pensioned or being
looked after by tbe Government. Tbey are
mon wbo were tubercular at the time of
enistmvîît, and knew tboy were tubercular,
and they joined for the purpose of practically throwing upon the Government Vhs
oblig-ation of supporting tbcm for the rest
of their lives.
lion. Mr. PARDEE: If I may interrupt
mny honourable friend the great trouble
in that respect is that they sbould nover
bave been passed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUCHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. PARDEE: If there was somf
rivalry, that xvas noV the fault of the

At least, I subrniit that.

Under

permanent
and
cumbrances,
Hitherto the terms of repayments in case of
advances to settlers for cliattels varied from
advances for land purchase and permanent improvements. Stock and equipment advances are
now repayable in six annual instalments in
cases of settlers on purchased and privately
owned lands, and four instalments in cases of
settlers on Dominion lands. Under the original
Act of 1917, alil loans for stock and equipment
and building material, etc., on Dominion lands
and first mortgages were ail on a twenty year
term, which was a mauch more appropriate and
reasonable provision. Considering the fact that
settlers who are already established are to get
twentyflye years from the date of consolidation
within which to repay their loans and that in
their case stock and equipment advances will
be repayable on the same terms as land purchase, removal of encumbrances and permanent improvements, it is consdered only
equitable that settlers securing advances for
stock and equipment in future should be given
a similar privilege.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Are we
regotiating any loans now or have ve concluded all loans under the Settlement Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There are a
few going through to men to whon the
Board was committed.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I should like to
know if the loans are being advanced practically as they were at first, and in the
same amounts?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The terms
have not been altered. There are very few
demands coming in.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It would seem to
me, with the experience the Department
now has of what a small percentage will
be able to make a success of farming by
tsking loans of $3,000 or $4,000 or $5,000,
while having practically no capital of their
own, that the Government should refuse
cases of that kind, even if they were good
men and accustomed to farming, because
not 10 per cent vho take a loan of $5,000
or $6,000 or $7,000, without capital of their
own in excess of what is called for, namely,
$500, can make a success. I am not at all
objecting to the extension of the time. In
many cases I believe it is just putting
off the evil day, but in some cases no doubt
the men may be able to pull through with
the longer term when they would not have
been able to do so under the shorter term.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The number
of applicants has gradually dwindled from
season to season. Since the opening of the
present season there have not been 200
applicants. The Department is more severe
in its scrutiny of the ability and capital of

more careful in the selection of the land.

Settlers securing advances from the Board
after the 1st of July are, as a rue, unable to
prepare new land for crops next season. It is
proposed to treat loans to such settlers, insofar
as the date of the first and subsequent advances
are concerned, as if the loan had been granted
to the settler in the following year.
of Section 59 of the Act as it
Clause (d)
sands provides that in case of improved lands
the Board may vary the termas of payment in
in case of land purchase so that the first annual
instalments shall be repayable not later than
the date two years from the date of sale and
shall consist of accrued interest. It was intended, when clause (d) was enacted, to give
specially favourable terms of repayment to
settlers on unimproved lands, and with this
end in view, clause (d) provides that the first
payment should consist of accrued interest. In
certain instances, however, the acciued interest
regular
may be almost as large as the
amortized payment, so that th's section as it
stands is of no benefit in many cases. The
new clause (1), as proposed, will give relief in
cases of this character by prescribing that the
first payment shall commence two years froir
the first standard date after date of loan and
that every payment shal be a regular amortized
payment.

On section 2-standard date:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

(reading):

It la proposed to fix by statute the date on
which annual instalments are tn be paid by
settlers, such dates to be the first day of
October in Manitoba and in the provinces West
thereof, and the first day of November in the
provinces east of Manitoba. These dates have
already been fixed by the Regulations of the
Board, approved by the Governor in Council.
It is desired, however, to define these dates by
statute, particularly in view of the fact that it
has been ifound necessary to refer to the
standard date in connection with the amendment relating to consolidation of advances.

Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-notice in writing of amount
of indebtedness to soldier:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

(reading):

In view of the changes in the terms of repayments that will be made, the various amounts
and terms of repayment mentioned in the
agreements executed by settlers will not be in
conformity with the change in the terms of repayments. The proposed amendment, therefore,
provides tbat the Consolidated Notice to be
sent to settlers by the Board will be prima
facie evidence of the settler's indebtedness and
of the changed dates and amounts of payments.

Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-Board may order payment
of the surplus to credit of the assurance
fund:

settier after having made application to the
Board for loan, and after the Board hec purchased land for hlm, refuses te take up recidence on the land andi drops hic application.
The Act makes no provision foi such cases,
andi the surplus must he refunded to the cettier.
In many instances the land acquired by the
Board for the settler hec been accjulred hy the
Board below the market price, for instance in
the case of school bauds and certain classes of
Dominion lande or other lande where a special
reduction is made in consideration of the fact
that the landi is deeded to the Board for actual

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
short Bill which is for the purpose of continuing the Oleomargarine Act of 1919 for
another year.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bi'll.
Hon. Mr. McLennan in the Chair.
On section 1-time extended for importation and sale:
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
should like to ask the Leader of the Government why this is continued as a yearly
offering. It has now been dangling before
the two Houses of Parliament for some four
years in a stage of experimentation. One
would think that length of time would be
quite sufficient to establish facts and information upon which the Government could
make up its mind as to whether this should
be a permanent measure or not. All industry is to a certain extent queered when
based upon a limited period of operation.
The making and the importation of oleomargarine is permitted in the United States
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of America; it is legal in Denmark; it is
the rule and practice in all the foremost
countries of the world; and I do not suppose
that any of us feel that we can go back to
the position of isolation which we previously
occupied in not permitting the making and
importation of oleomargarine. Why not,
then, cut the matter short, and make this
a permanent measure, in so far as the law
can make it permanent, and give the industry an opportunity of carrying on operations on the best basis possible? There
is always a possibility of repealing a law
if the public sentiment of the country, in
the experience of that law, come to the conclusion that it is prejudicial. What is the
reason that the Government bas not made
up its mind one way or the other, either to
give this life or to cut off its frail thread of
existence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Minister of Agriculture stated in the other
Chamber that the extension of this Act
for one year seemed to express the mild
and medium average opinion of the House
of Commons. This measure came in succession to a resolution of the House of
Commons on which opinions seemed to be
somewhat sharply divided. I am simply
presenting the Bill as it comes from the
House of Commons, as expressing the will
of the Government I represent in this
Chamber. It is in line with my own views
as to the necessity of maintaining the right
to manufacture and import oleomargarine.
I do not know of any sufficient reason to
cause me to alter my opinion on this point.
I believe that what is good to-day will bc
good to-morrow and next year and the year
after. This is my own oninion. The Bill embodies, at all events, what I feel to be the
right principle, and I offer it to the House
as I have received it.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I quite agree with
the remarks made by my right honourable
friend the Senator from Ottawa (Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster). As he said,
this measure has been up every year for
the last four or five years, and a considerable amount of time is taken up with
it, particularly in the House of Commons.
To my mind there is absolutely no reason
for this. Ninety-eight per cent of the
farmers, to judge by the debate in the
House of Commons at this session, are in
favour of the Bill. It seems to me there is
absolutely no reason why, if people want
to eat oleomargarine, they should not be
allowed to do so. I might point out that
when butter is at an ordinary, fair price

JUNE 27, 1922
there is very little oleoenargarine used.
Oleomargarine does not corne into competition with butter. In the year 1919
there were 16,000,000 pounda used in Canada; in 1920 there were 11,000,000 pounda;
and in 1921, when the price of butter was
more moderate, there were only thiree million and some odd pound&-considerably
under four milIlion pounds. This shows that
there la not much oleomargarine used.
To pans a law declaring that oleomargarine may not be manufactured la Canada or imported into this country would
be, to my mind, sim!ply absurd. As the
right honourable 'gentleman has pointed
out, there in na other civilized country on
earth that puts any impediment in the way
of the manufacture, importation, or use of
oleomargarine. I quite agree with his
suggestion that we ought now to niake the
law permanent. If there should, be any
great change in public opinion la the
future, we could take action again; but I
think that the extension of this Act from
year to year ia a waste of time and money;
it ia absolutely absurd, and in flot in accordance with the wishes of the great
majority of the people of Canada.
BOYER (translaHon. GUSTAVE
tion) : I do not agree with my honourable
colleague froni Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turrif), and I protest against the carrying out
of his evident desire that Parliament should
go stil-l further th-an the propos-ai of the
Government with regard to oleomargari-ne.
I take exception not so much ta the product
itself as'to the unfair and injurious coinpetition which it creates against the dairy
industry of our country. In the past two
years dairying has had innumerable difficulties to encounter. Among our fammers there
is discouragement, and nothing should 'be
done whieih would prolong tîhlis feeling.
Nearly aIl the farmers of this country
are interested in the making of butter and
cheese, and their organizations represent
an enormous capital.
I do not wish to deny the nutritious qualîtien of oleomargarine, nor do I want to
raiae my voie againat anything good that
may be said of it. I will even admit that
to a certain degree it contains elements
possessing food value. But what I desire
particularly to point out to the honourable
members of titis House la that the cc>mpetition of this product with butter is a disA pound of butter

manufacture of oleomargarine is mainly in
the hands of a comparatively small number
of concerna, whereas the entire agricultural
coinmunity is interested in the manufacture
of butter.
When it is, contended that oleomargarine
la necessary to the workingman, who
wants it because of its cheapness, I say that
is a mistake, for in the article delivered
the workingmen, or the poorer class, do not
obtain their money's worth.
It is a recognized fact, proven by statistics, that dairying proper is flot in itself
a payin-g indu'stry. Leaving out of consideration the years of the war, 1 aay
dairying la flot profitable except for the
fact that the keeping of cattle is absolutely
necessary for the purpose of maintaining
the fertility of the soil.
In the oid provinces-Ontario, Quebec
and the Maritime Provinces-mixed farming is practised in order that the necessary
fertilizer may be available. The farmera
in these sections of Canada have learned
that the fertility taken from, the soul muat
be restored to it by successive crops. The old
saying that farming without cattie is impossible is here uuderstood in its full force.
The contrary is the case in the West. There
a fertile soul at first yielded abundant crops,
but the earliest cultivated areas of the
West, far from being as productive as they
used to be, are now giving yields considerably lower than the average. Farms in
Manitoba which at the start produced
from 50 to 60 bushels to the acre give now
only 10 to 12 buahels. What la the reason,
you ask. It is eaaily stated: the fertilizing
elements. have been continuously taken front
the soul and neyer replaced. The consequence la that ln thos.e western districts
farming without cattle is no longer possible. In fact, the western provinces are
organizing for the purpose of engaging in
mixed farming. Now, do we wish to discourage the farmers by placing a rival product on the 'market beside their butter, when
butter production is already less remunerative than it ¶night ho? I was astonished
when la the House of Commons the other
duy the Proresives voted -against the
resolution of Mr. Neill to do away with the
manufacture and sale of oleoinargarine la
this country. The Progressives, who are
supposed to work with their whole soul and
with ail their strength for the development
and welfare of the agricnitural class, have
apparently failed to consider the support
they owe flot only to their own followers
in the West, but to ail the farmers throughout the country. Only eight Progressives

SENATE
voted in favour of Mr. Neill's resolution;
the other members voting for it were
Liberals and Conservatives from the other
provinces.
I admit that the members from the cities
could not take the sane ground on this
question as · he members from the country
t
districts; and, instead of sup.porting the
Neill resolution, they simply asked that
oleomargarine be subjected to strict inspection and placed on the market under its
own name, so that it might not be mistaken
for butter.
If the Pýrogressive members from the
West saw no benefit to themselves in Mr.
Neill's proposal to prohibit oleomargarine,
they should at least have remembered that
their confreres, the farmers of the other
provinces, who are largely interested, in the
dairy industry, would gain by it. The attitude of the western Progressives fully
demonstrates this great truth, that the interests of the farmers of the East and those
of the farmers of the West are irreconcilable.
If the western farmers would be the real
champions of the agrarian interest, they
should consider the farmers not merely of
one portion of the country, but of the whole
of Canada. The measure that was introduced by the former Government and
passed, and is now extended for one year
at the instance of the present Government,
is far from being satisfactory to the
farmers, who demand the absolute prohibition of oleomargarine.
But at least the
Bill should be left in the form in which it
is now before us, and at another Session
we shall have an opportunity of discussing
this question again, and the opponents of
the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine
may convince the Government once for all
that this product shoulid be banned.
The free admission of oleomargarine into
this country dates back only to the first
year of the war, when the Government
thought it should accede to the demands
made upon it to permit the entry of oleomargarine as well as its manufacture in
Canada. This was done for a purpose
which was believed to be humanitarian,
as it was expected to lower the cost of
living. Now that the war is over, now that
the motive invoked has ceased to exist and
oleomargarine has not lessened the cost of
living as expected, it would be in my
opinion reasonable to refuse to allow this
product to remain in unfair competition
with dairy products.
Hon.

Mr. lOYElt

As all opinions must 'be respected, and
as the new House of Commons was not conversant with the question, as was the former
House, it was perhaps good policy to grant
an extension of time, which will permit of
the question being more thoroughly studied
at another Session and disposed of once for
all in the best interests of the community.
All the milk producers' associations in
the
Western
Provinces
have
already
adopted resolutions protesting against the
importation of oleomargarine and the
manufacture of it in this country.
The National Dairy Council of Canada,
meeting at Winnipeg in December last,
passed a resolution in the name of the
butter producers of the country, protesting
against the manufacture and, sale of oleomargarine in Canada; and many other
associations have adopted like resolutions.
In view, therefore, of the general sentiment of the farmers, which is hostile to this
article, it seems to me that the Government
should do no more than extend the time
allowed by the present law.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER:
Honourable
gentlemen, I think the Government are
wise in presenting this legislation to extend
the time for one year only. It bas been said
by one honourable gentleman on the opposite
side of the House that oleomargarine does
not interfere with the sale of butter. Let
me say that if it is sold as oleomargarine I
do not fear the resuits it may have on the
butter market. But who are to-day the
buyers of oleomargarine throughout this
country? The unsuspecting and the uninnitiated are buying a composition known as
oleomargarine. The honourable member
fron Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) spoke
of it being manufactured in the United
States, but in that country it is not permitted to put colouring into it without
paying an excise duty of ten cents per
pound. Here in Canada, under the methods
of manufacture, a certain armount of butter
is used in the product to improve flavor
and colour.
If it could be arranged
to have the constituents of the oleomargarine printed on the label, so that
the people might know what they were
buying, it would not interfere with firstelass dairy or creamery butter. That is
the situation as I view it. When butter is at
the price at which it is to-day, 40 cents
a pound, o'leomargarine is solid to people
who do not know its food content. I claim
that five pounls of oleomargarine do not
contain as much food value for a growing
child as ,ne pound of our best butter. That

JUNE 27, 1922
is a statement of the resu'at of doctors'
analyses. Oleomargarine is made from
vegetable oils and many other ingredients
such as refuse fats from abattoirs, etc.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Did the honourable gentleman say that five pounds of
oleomargarine were only as good as one
pound of butter?
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: I said that-yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then it is much
more expensive.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: It is much more
expensive.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, just a few words with reference to this subject. I am quite in accord
with the legislation which the honourable
leader of the Government has brought
down, except that I think it would have
been better if no time restriction had been
included in the Bill. I want to refer for
a few moments particularly to a resolution
respecting the manufacture and importation of oleomargarine that has been the
subject of consideration by Parliament, and
to draw an analogy which I think will
appeal to honourable gentlemen, and indicate clearly that this restriction upon
the importation and manufacture of oleomargarine in Canada ought to be permanently withdrawn. What is the reason of
the opposition to its manufacture and sale?
It is primarily because it comes into competition with another article which is manufactured in Canada, namely, butter. No
one can blame those interested in the butter
industry for taking that stand; but I
think it is the duty of Parliament to
legislate for the benefit of all the people
rather than for a particular class; and
I think that it is in the interest of a
majority of the people of Canada to bring
to the doors of the consumers, most of
whom are poor men and women, foodstuffs at the most reasonable prices, especially food that is sanitary and wholesome.
It cannot be gainsaid that oleomargarine
is a wholesome food. It is manufactured
under the most advantageous conditions,
in much more cleanly surroundings than is
most of our butter, and I am sure that
inspectors, if asked, would say that it is
just as wholesome, just as sanitary, as any
dairy butter that is made. Possibly some
creameries are conducted in just as cleanly
a fashion as are the oleomargarine manufacturing establishments.
However, that is not the point that I
want particularly to make. It is this. This

law permitting the manufacture of oleomargarine was put on the statute book
in 1918 or 1919, when the price of butter
was prohibitive to very many people. There
is no necessity for restricting the importation or the manufacture of an article that
is desired and used by many people who
cannot afford something better, unless that
importation and manufacture is going to
destroy absolutely or seriously hinder some
other industry. In that case the prohibition
of its manufacture or importation might
be worthy of consideration. But no honourable gentleman, I am sure, will contend
that there are any dairy f armers out of
employment, or that they are not able to
find a market for the butter they produce.
It is a fact that I am sure no one will
dispute that butter bas never before
brought so good a price as it has since
this legislation has been in force. That
being the case, it cannot be said that it
is necessary to prohibit the importation
or manufacture of oleomargarine for the
purpose of preventing the destruction of
the dairy industry.
Let me cite what I think would be an
analogous case. A Minister of the Crown
only a few months ago stated from his
place in Parliament that there were over
200,000 unemployed men in Canada. That
represented, I suppose, probably 400,000
dependents, or an aggregate of more than
half a million people in this country without employment and, consequently, most
of them without means of purchasing the
necessaries of life. I want to suggest to
the House that it mi'ght have been perfectly consistent and logical for those
hundreds of thousands of unemployed men
and their dependents to have come to the
Government of Canada and -said: "We
desire you to legislate positively against
the importation of agricultural implements
into Canada, for the reason that there are
in Canada nearly half a million unemployed
men and dependents, who might be employed in the manufacture of those things."
Agricultural implements can all be manufactured in this country; we can meet our
requirements absolutely. No such request
has been made, but I say that it would not
be inconsistent for them to have made such
request. What would have been the resuit
if such legislation had been enacted? There
has been importel into Canada during
the past two or three years approximately
$20,000,000 worth of agricultural imipleAt least 50 per cent
ments annually.
of that amount-and that is a very conservative estimate-represents the labour

SENATE
that goes into the production and manufacture of materials that enter into those

goods. $10,000,000 expended in wages in
Canada means what? It means employment
at $4 a day for 8,000 men for 300 days in
a year. If we had a situation of that sort
hefe, I would not object to our farmer
friends, the producers of butter, saying:
"Everybody is employed; everybody has
money to buy butter; let them buy butter."
But so long as our farmer friends say,
" We want our Canadian labour to remain
unemployed so that we may import our
agricultural
implements
from
outside
Canada," I say that the consumers of Canada are not going to look favourably upon
a proposition to prohibit the importation
or manufacture of wholesome, sanitary
food that can be obtained by the consumer
at a lower rate.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: May I remind
my honourable friend that the farmers of
Canada are largely in favour of the free
importation of oleomargarine?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I appreciate
that, but there is a particular class of
butter-makers who are not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to inform my honourable friend from
Brockville that the suggestion he has made,
that packages of oleomargarine should be
marked, is already provided for in the Act,
and according to my information, that is
the practice. Section 7 of chapter 24 of
1920 provides:
No personi shall sell, offer for sale, or have in
his possession for sale, any oleonargarine, unless the packages containing such oleomargarine
are marked or labelled "Oleomargarine"
in
accordance with the ;provisions of this Act or
oL any regulations made hereunder.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the honourab'e ex-Minister of Labour consider it
a good thing for the workingman to buy
oleomargarine if what the member for
Brockville (Hon. Mr. Webster) says is
true, that five pounds which cost $1.25 are
not as good as one pound of butter that
costs 40 cents? Surely it would not be advantageous for workingmen to buy oleomargarine if that be so.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the butter
is contained in it, then surely the statement would not hold good.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: We can get certificates from many scientific men that
oleomargarine contains more food products
than butter.

PUBLIC LOAN BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved
the
second reading of Bill 197, an Act to authorize the raising, by way of Loan, of certain sums of money for the Public Service.
He said: This Act speaks for itself. It
is shortHon. Mr. DAVID: But not sweet.
Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
But not
sweet. The purpose is to authorize the
issue of new loans to meet obligations
arising during the coming year or in the
early future. There are Treasury Bills
to the amount of $143,000,000; there is a
loan maturing on the first of December of
this year of $182,000,000; these make a
total of $325,000,000. Against that we have
already obtained in the New York market
$100,000,000 so the needs of the Finance
Department will be $225,000,000. But the
Government is now taking authority also
to provide for a loan maturing November
1, 1923, of $172,000,000, and a loan'maturing November 1, 1924, of $108,000,000, the
two making $280,000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is this
loan to be put on the Canadian market or
the foreign market? I saw an intimation
in the press that it was to be a Canadian
loan.
Does my honourable friend know
anything about that?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is somewhat
difficult to accept that statement, for only
a moment before the same honourable gentleman indicated that butter was a component part of the oleomargarine.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I have no
certain data. I had the impression that
it would be put on the Canadian market,
but it may possibly be put on both markets.

Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: It is to a certain degree.

The motion was agreed to, and the BiH
was read the second time.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SEOOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 198, an Act to
amend The Customs Tariff, 1907.
He said: This Act, which has for its purpose the altering of the tariff to the extent
indicated in the Bill, has an amendment
to the Customs Tariff Amendment Act of
1921, amending the Customs tariff of 1907
by substituting the following section:
12a. The Governor in Council may from time
to time, as he deems it expedienit, order that
goods of any description or class specified in
such order, impo'rted into Canada, shall be
marked, stamped, branded or labelled in legible
English or -French word-s, in a conspicuous place
that shall not be covered or obscured by any
subsequent attachments or arrangements, so as
Said markto indica-te the counitry of origin.
ing, stamping, branding or labelling shal be
as nearly indelible and permanen-t as -the nature
of the goods will permit.

This, in its terms, is the same marking
Act as the one that was passed last year,
but it restricts the particular cases to those
considered expedient by the Governor in
Council. The Act last year was a general
Act which applied to trade in general. It
was found quite difficult, if not impossible,
of application. A date had been fixed for
its going into force, and that date was
The Boards of Trade and
suspended.
other interested parties protested against
the Act being generally applied. The Government has felt that there was virtue in
the Act if it were applied in special cases,
and not generally.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SEOOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moyed the
second reading of Bill 200, an Act to
amend the Special War Revenue Act,
1915.
He said: This Bill bears on the rates
to be levied under the Act. It extends the
power to levy taxes on insurance companies, on unlicensed British or foreign
companies, or on unlicensed inter-insurance associations. It has been found equitable to reach the insurance companies that
do business without any regular licensed
agency in Canada by levying a five per
cent tax on the premiums paid by the assured. The tax on cable and telegraph
companies is increased. The tax on promissory notes is defined. There is a tax
on cheques on a graduated scale: a two-

SENATE
cent stamp as heretofore on sums not exceeding $50, and two cents per $50 or
fraction thereof up to $5,000, which makes
Thereafter the tax
a maximum of $2.
romains at $2, even for the larger figures.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: What
choque for $98 have to pay?

would

a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Four cents.
There are other levies which honourable
gentlemen can find by looking at the various clauses. The stamp tax on sales or
transfers of stock is increased from two
to three cents. The stamp tax on money
orders of express companies and the
stamp tax on post office money orders are
increased. There is a stamp tax on receipts, under clause 10:
No per'son shall give a receipt unless there is
affixed thereto an adhesive st-amp or unlesse
there is impressed thereon by means of a die
a stamp of ýthe value of two cents.

Receipts will bear that tax, which will
be an even tax of two cents for whatever
is the amount of the receipt. I think that
tax has been in existence in England for
a number of years. In every European
country it bas been in existence for many
years before the war, and bas produced a
considerable income.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: On some cash
registers, when a customer gets a bill
marked " Paid," will that have to bear a
two cent stamp?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There will
need to be a stamp for all such purchases
above $10.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: So that a merchant who bas one of those cash registers,
and in the course of a day punches out,
as they term it, a number of those bills
with

" Paid "

marked

on

the

bottom,

whenever they exced $10, will have to put
a two cent stamp on each receipt?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is worth two
cents to get your receipt when you are
buying more than $10 worth, because the
shopkeeper might say, " I never got the
money, the clerk got it," or something else.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Suppose the bill of sale was $50 and the
bills were made out in five sections of $10
each, there would be no tax.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Act provides for that, and I may say, in answer
to my honourable friend that this will not
core into effect before the lst of January next. The Department is in correHon. _Mr. DANDURAND.

spondence with the British authorities to
see how their Act is applied on cash purchases such as have been described.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
How does the Act deal with the case I
have mentioned?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In England you
only get a receipt if you insist upon having
it. Very often you are told it will be a
penny for the stamp.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer
to my right honourable friend is to be
found in subsection 3 of section 10.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: When the Minister speaks of the Bill not coming into
force until the lst of January, will he give
it the same benediction that the Minister
of Agriculture gave to the Oleomargarine
Bill in the other House when he denounced
it as a rotten Bill and when he said that
perhaps there would be a Bill passed at
the nest Session of Parliament to do away
with it altogether? What are the fighting
chances of the law ever going into effect
at all?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend will admit that this country
needs to levy a larger income than it bas.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Why not tax the
big interests. Why not increase the tax
proportionately on cheques above $5,000?
When a man rolling in wealth or the big
interests issue a cheque up to $5,000 there
are stamps affixed to a certain amount, and
above that amount there is nothing additional.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is no evidence of wealth.

The choque

Hon. Mr. BENNETT: It is generally a
good evidence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No,
the
choque is simply the instrument used to
discharge a debt.
There may be thousands of transactions between banks and
corporations by which money is simply
moved from one place to another, and
there is no gain to anybody.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: Are not corporations simply associations of individuals?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
The
reason the increase in the tax stopped at
$5,000 is that most of the daily transactions upon which the Government will
levy are of that class. My personal view
is that the taxe goes too far in going up to
$5,000.
But we need the money.
Such
operations as transfers of money from one

JUNE 27, 1922
place to another were brought to the attention of the Finance Department, and
the Minister of Finance realized that a tax
on such transactions would bear heavily
upon ordinary financial operations.
We
will see how this works, and if there is
need to retrace our steps we will have to
do so. 1 fear that we shall have to retrace
our steps rather than go forward.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: Would not the
saine argument apply to transactions involving less that $5,000? There are inany
transactions below that figure in which
there is no0 gain. Generally when brokers
aeli bonds there is some gain. Would the
saine principle apply to the poor man who
transferred $500 that would apply to the
mnan who spends $100,000?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Section 4 would
seeni to hold out some hope to people who
believe that the stamp tax on cheques is
a very ill-advised one, because it puts a
very serious obstacle in the way of trade.
The cheque is the great highway of 'business. What you are going to do is to place
a toîl-gate on this highway, and stop every
cheque to see whether the requisite amount
has been paid on it. Therein, to my mind,
lies the defect in this new mode of taxation. I notice in section 4 that the Minister of Finance, notwithstanding anything
in the Act, reserves the power to make
regulations in virtue of which a cheque
may bear on it a stamped die stating that
stamps of the requisite value in respect
thereof have been duly paid. If the Government could devise some means by which
practically ail calculations
on these
cheques would be done away with, I think
it would be rendering a very great service.
Honourable gentlemen know what is involved in the control of enormous quantities of cheques. When a bank receives
large piles of cheques in deposits, every
one of those cheques has to be controlled.
I disagree with my honourable friend froni
Simcoe (Hon. Mr. Bennett) who said that
a man issuing small cheques was generally
a poor man. Who are the people who issue
cheques, be they small, medium, or large?
They are not people of the very poor class
by any means; they are rather people who
spend their money freely and are in the
habit of using cheques. Does the workingman issue cheques?
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: If my honourable
friend were conversant with the practice
in small towns he w'ould know that workingmen very often keep a bank account,
so that -if there is any question as to

687

whether an account has been paid or not,
the transaction can be traced even though
the cheque or the receipt may have been
lost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but my
honourable friend will recognize that more
than nine-tenths of these cheques are below
$50, so that the two-cent stamp which they
have been in the habit of putting on the
cheques is still sufficient, and the tax is flot
increased by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not deny
what xny honourable friend has said, but
îny contention is that for every man in
poor circunistances who issues cheques to
pay an account, there are twenty-five or
perhaps fifty who do not. The workingman
generally gives his money to his wife, and
she pays the accounts. Take the fanmer, for
instance. Will he issue cheques?
Hon. Mn. DONNELLY: Yes, sir.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In great nunibers? He will not. The business conimunity is the part of the community particularly interested in this and will suifer
most froni it. It will suifer more by the loss
of tume and the extra wages paid for
clerical labour than it will froni the imposition of the tax. In other words, if the
Government is going to levy $5,000,000 a
year by thîs tax, it will cost the country a
great deal more than that for clerical
labour to look after the cheques and see
that they are properly stamped. Every*
cheque has to be examinied, and if thene
are not sufficient; stamps on them, they will
have to be rejected. I hope the Minister
of Finance has reserved the power to make
regulations whereby the toîl-gate which
hie has erected in the high-way of trade .will
automatically open every time a cheque
comes along, s0 that thene may be an
economy of tume in the transactions of the
country. If hie does that, hie will have
rendered a great service.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Unlike my honourable friend, I ami under the impression that
this is one of the best and easiest methods
of collecting taxation. I only rîse for the
purpose of asking whether the tax in respect to promissory notes will be collected
in the saine way? In glancing oven the
Bill, it seenis to me that thene is no limit
to the two-cent tax on eveny $50.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
lumit in the case of the promissory note.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
My opinion is
that that will be more of a hardship than

SENATE
the tax on cheques, because the borrower
is more apt to be a poor man than the
lender or the issuer of a cheque. I do not
sec why notes should not be placed on a
par with cheques.
The old Act
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
levied two cents per $100 on promissory
notes. The tax now is 2 cents per $50.
Hon. Mr. BENNETT: And bills of exchange are treated in the same way as
cheques.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is there any reason
for placing a higher tax on notes than
on cheques?
There is no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ther reason that I know of, but that it
will produce more.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Will the Minister
irform us whether the Department has
any information from the banks as to the
total number of cheques that usually go
through the banks or clearing houses in a
year?
I do not know
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
whether all the banks keep records of the
cheques that pass through their institutions. They make no report to the Government, and there is no official data. I
may say that in an institution with which
I am connected, upon the imposition of
the 2-cent stamp tax there was a decrease
of 1,100,000 in the number of cheques
passing through the wickets in the first
year; but in the twenty-four months that
followed, the number gradually came back
te normal. This means that people hai
decided that they would pay certain small
accounts in cash, or that in making deposits
ir the bank they would retain a certain
amount. But as they felt that they had to
obtain receipts and preserve them, they
gradually came back to the old habit of
paying by cheque. There may be a certain
decrease again under this Act, but gradually the people will get into the old groove
of issuing cheques in payment of their accounts thereby ensuring that they will have
un evidence of the payment of the accounts,
without the necessity of retaining receipts.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: J hope the
honourable Minister vill not forget to give
that instance of what the 2-cent tax did to
the Minister of Finance, and at the same
time point out to him the probable effects
of the progressive tax on cheques. It will
be very much more serious.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friond will surely credit me with
Hon. Mr. CORDON.

enough public spirit to think that I have
already imparted that information.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: I have been informed on very high authority that the
information I have asked for could be ohtained by the Department within twentyfour hours. I understand that the approximate number of cheques passing through
clearing houses last year was in the neighbourhood of three-quarters of a billion. On
that basis if there were a flat rate of 3 cents
charged, more revenue would be produced
than will be produced under the present
system of a graduated scale. No doubt the
Stamp Act in England has reached a high
state of perfection. I think the Government would be well advised to inquire
about it, or to send a man over there to
study the system.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said there
was no official data in the Department. Of
course, the Minister of Finance had general
information whieh would give him a pretty
good idea of what this tax would produce.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Did I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that the
2-cent stamp tax had the effect of lessening the amount passing through a certain
institution by $1,100,000?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
choques.

No; 1,100,000

Hon. Mr. GORDON: If that is the case,
the view which I expressed a short time ago
must have been very wrong because if a
two-cent stamp had that effect, what wouId
be the effect of a two-dollar stamp?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is quite easy to give.

The answer

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Thon my honourable friend must be right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) is not exact;y correct when he
thinks that the labouring element does not
utilize the cheque. I know of a savings
institution, the large majority of whose
depositors are of the labouring element,
and whose cheques are regularly used by
them. That labour element felt, when the
Stamp Act came into force, that it cou-Id
refrain from issuing small cheques of $5,
$10, and $15.
Those people -decided they
would hold a certain amount from deposit,
and would pay their small debts and thus
save the two-cent stamp for each payment.
That caused a certain temporary deflection,
but gradually they returned to the safer

JUNE 27, 1922
niethod of depositing the money and drawing upon their wccounts. Now, cheques
of froni $50 te $100 are in -the tgreat
majority. When it is a question of paying
a debt of $200 or $500, who will dlaim, that
a person will keep money in bis bouse and
withhold it froni deposit in the bank in
order not to be obliged to put a stamp on
tbe cheque? Wben the amount is sufficiently important to be deposited in a
bank, for safety, there will be no difficulty
as to the working of the Stamp Act. Tbe
banks -will of course feel a defiection bere
and tbere for a certain tinie, but gradually
people wilil become accustomed to tbe Act
and will corne up to tbe mark.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I hope ny bonourable friend, will take an opportunity of
looking intoithe case whicb was specifically
mentioned, because I feel quite satisfied
that bis figures are not correct. I would
ask bum to look that up.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wbat figure?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: With ahl due respect to my honourable friend, I cannot
understand bow there would be in one
institution, 1,100,000 cheques.
During the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
year.
Hon. Mr. GORD ON: I think that if the
honourable gentleman wËI look into that
matter hie will find there mnust be something
wrong witb bis figures.

How much on

Gordon).
An average
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

About $47,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: At tbe present
tume the parties issuing cbeques have tbe
privilege of using either the war tax twocent stamp or a two-cent postage stamp. I
understand that the Department have no
reliable informatIon as to the extent to
whicb the revenue of the Post Office lias
been increased by the use of 2-cent
stamps, or as to the total revenue derived
S-44

iu

from the stanip tax. Is it flot possible that
a faise impression niay be given regarding the revenue of the Post Office Departnment by the widespread use of the twocent postage stamp upon cheques? People
inay be clamouring for a reduction In the
postal rates because the Post Office Department is showing a surplus, when, as a
matter of fact, the surplus ia derived froni
the use of the 2-cent stamps upon
cheques. I think it would be very proper
for the Governnient to aniend the Act 50
that only war-tax stamps or revenue
stamps inight be used. The Government
wou.ld then be in a position to give us
definite information as to the total revenue
from the sta-mp tax, and we would also
know exactly the postal revenue. I think
that would be much better than the present
rather haphazard way of using either postage stamps or revenue stanips.
We ail know
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
how annoying to the public in general bas
been the obligation of affixing a stamp on
every choque, because a person does not;
always have a sta-m.p. This proposai waýs
carefully considered, but the Government
felt that it was botter not to go beyond the
inconvenience eaused by the requirement
to affix a stamp; but the requirement of
affixing a special stamp on every cheque
would be condemned by the whole population froni the Atlantic to the Pacifie.
Ordinary postage stamips -are needed by
everyone who writes a letter and are always at band. Let us try to facilitate the
collection of the tax wîith -as littie annoyance
as possible to the people of the country.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The annoyance
works both ways. I niay state niy own
case. One day I was writing a letter and
found that -I was short of postage stanips.
I had an abundance of revenue stamps,
and I put on two of tbem-thoughtlessly,
I suppose. The resuit was that a week
later the letter was returned to nme through
the dead letter office.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Wbat would
,the honourable Minister think of the suggestion to increase the tax on every cheque,
say, to four cents, or, if that will not
cover the case, make it five cents?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That would be
hitting the poor mian.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: I think that would
be an improvement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was an
impression that going up to $5,000 would

equalize the burden among the various
classes of the population.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What is the largest
denomination in postage stamps?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
there is a dollar stamp; but there are $50
revenue stamps.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But I mean postage
stamps.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They go perhaps up to one dollar.
Hon. Mr. MULHOLLAND: If you receive an American cheque and deposit it
in the bank, do you have to attach the

THIRD READING

Bill 200, an Act to amend The Special
War Revenue Act, 1915.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 201, an Act to amend
the Customs Act and the Department of
Customs and Excise Act.
He said: This Bill involves a contentious question, that of the valuation of goods
coming from countries with a depreciated
currency. There was in the Customs Act
a provision giving power to value the depreciated currency up 'to 50 -per cent of its
face value. Section 59 of the Customs Act
contains the following subsection enacted in
1921:
(6) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of
this section, in computing the value for duty of
the currency of an invoice, no reduction shall
be allowed in excess of fifty per cent of the
value of the standard or proclaimed currency
of the country from whence the goods are invoiced to Canada, irrespective of the rate of
exchnge existing between such country and
Canada on date of the shipment of t'he goods;
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and in respect of goode shipped te Canada from
a country where the rate of exchange is adverse
te Canada, the value for duty of the currency
of the invoice shall be computed at the rate
of exchange existing between such country and
Canada at the date of the shipment of the
goods.

That is replaced by the following:
"(2) In the case of importations of goods the
manufacture or produce of a foreign country,
the currency of which 'is substantially depreciated, the value fer duty shall net be, less than
-the value that would be placed on similar gods
manufactured or produced ini the United Kingdom and imported from that country, if such
'similar goods are made or produced there. If
similar goods are not made or produ'ced in the
United ;Kingdom, the value for duty shall net
be less than the value of similar goods made
or produced in any European country the currency of which is net substantially depreciated.
The minister imay determine the value of such
goods, and the value se determined shall, until
otherwise provided, be the value upon which
the duty on euch goods shall be computed and
levied under regulations prescribed by rthe minister."

There was considerable difficulty in applying the old Act, because there were untold possibilities of fraud being perpetrated
on the Canadian Customs by the goods of
a foreign country of depreciated currency
being shipped to Canada through some other
country with a normal currency. I have
been informed by a manufacturer that goods
which he bought in England were to his
mind German goods. They showed no indication of their origin. They had been
used by him in his manufacturing for the
last twenty-five years. Similar goods were
made in England, but he was firmly of the
conviction that the goods in question were
from Germany.
Yet these goods were
coming in under the preference granted to
Great Britain. Now the standard will be
that of similar goods imported from other
European countries.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Is he
quite sure that the section as drafted will
meet the difficulty that has faced the Customs officials of Canada? The difficulty in
the past, as I understand, has been that the
produce of a country with a depreciated
currency lost its nationality completely. Ini
other words, such goods were entered in the
Canadian Customs House, not as coming
from Germany, but as coming from Switzerland or England. They were supposed to
be English or Swiss goods. Therefore
what you have to guard against is that

course, it was impossible for the Customs
officer to do that, but the Minister may be
better able to do so, and prevent goods
manufactured in Germany from being
sent to Switzerland or to England and sold
as English or Swiss goods. It is known that
the Minister has means of knowing where
the goods were manufactured. So I fail
to see the matter as my honourable friend
puts it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think my honourable friend is labouring under an error.
Under the old law the Customs officer received with the goods an invoice to evidence the date of the sale and the value of
the foreign depreciated currency. He had
in one hand a bill of sale, and in the other
the certified value of depreciated currency
of the country from which these goods
came. Therefore he had absolutely no discretion: the value was there. What my
honourable friend has been pointing out
will certainly happen under this Act, because there will be no evidence before the
Customs officer at all, as there was under
the old system, of the value of the article
imported into Canada. He had then the bill
of sale and the value of the foreign currency as compared to ours, whereas he has
nothing at all now, and if he receive
goods from RumaniaHon. Mr. BEIQUE: He will have the
ruling of the Minister.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The ruling of
the Minister on what? On 5,000 sorts of
goods that come into Canada? He will
have to use his discretion; otherwise the
wires will be kept hot between every Customs officer in Canada and the Minister.
When the Customs officer receives goods
he will have to apply his own judgment
and ascertain first what the value of the
goods is in England; if he cannot find that,
then what the value of the goods is in
Europe; and if he cannot find that, I suppose he will turn the matter over to the
Minister; whereas, under the other system,
the value of the goods was fixed automatically by evidence as to the value of the
depreciated currency at the time the goods
were imported.
Hon. Mr. REID: As I had experience in
the Customs while I was Minister of Customs, I was naturally interested in the
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

changes that were being made. Under the
operation of the Customs law, every person entering goods at a port had to produce a certified invoice, or, failing that,
had to make a declaration. The invoice
would show what country the goods came
from, and the value for duty. If there was
any doubt as to the value or the rate of
duty to be paid, the officer would call the
Board of Customs, which was established
under section 40, and that body always
finally settled those points. Section 40
was as follows:
Whenever any duty ad valorem is imposed on
any goods imported into Canada, the value for
duty shall be the fair market value thereof,
when sold for home consumption, in the principal markets of the country whence and at
the time when the same were exported directly
to Canada.

Clause 41 was as follows:
Such market value shall be the fair market
value, of 'such goods in the usual and ordinary
commercial acceptance of the term-

Following in the ordinary course of trade,
providing for discounts for cash, and so on.
Under that Act it was the Board of Customs that finally decided matters of that
kind.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the law
now.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes, that is the law
now, and if the case were referred to the
Minister he would simply take the advice
of the Board of Customs. Then we have
section 46, as follows:
Wheniever goods are imported into Canada
under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the, value thereof
for duty-

That clause states that in a case of that
kind-the Minister may determine the value for duty
of such goods and the value so determined shall,
until otherwise, provided, be the value upon
which the duty on such goods shall be computed
and levied.

Then subsection 2 says that the Minister
shall have full authority to deal with the
matter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They are not
amending that clause at all?
Hon. Mr. REID: No, but this clause is
being put in as a subsection, I understand,
se that in cases of depreciated currency the
same method will apply. Of course, it is
not the Minister who is going to deal vith
every case: it is the Board, of Customs. I
went into this matter pretty thoroughly,
because it seemed to me that a change was
being made in the law, that had been in

JUNE 27, 1922

(i9i

f orce so many years; but as I interpret the
Act now, after having had some of the
officials thoroughly explain it to me, it is
being left without any change whatever except that clause 46 is being made to apply
to depreciated currency, and if there is any
change of valuation on account of depreciated currency it will be between the
Minister and the Board of Customs to decide what shahl be a fair charge and valuation.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It is only an amendment.
Hon. Mr. REID: It is only an amiendment, and the fact of changing it to the
Minister does not change the law now in
force.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

wll bear considerable discussion, and I
should not like to see such an important
matter suminarily disposed of. I do not
think my honourable friend would be doing
justice to the subject in forcing it on when
prorogation is just a few hours away.

Bill 198, an Act to amend the Customs
Tariff, 1907.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
QUEBEC HARBOUR ADVANCES BILL

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It bas been
moved in amendmnent by Hon. Mr. Reid,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Robertson:
That clause 2 be amended by striking out the
words "one million" in lines 4 and 5, and also
and
by inserting the words "maintenance
repairs" In line 6 of the said clause after the
-word "the" where it occurs the second timne.

Hon. Mr. REID: I may say that, since
the Bill was hast before the House, the
Marine Department bas submitted a plan
which I have gone into with some of the
officiais of the Department. They represent that there was a mistake--that the
entrance is about 500 feet wide, and that
some sult bas flowed into the channel, and
that if we do not do some dredging the
results may be serious. They state that
this contention is borne out by the -reports
of the engineers of the Harbour Commission. In view of these statements I feel
that I shouhd noit perhaps take the responsibility of moving to reject the expenditure
for dredging.
I stili hold, however, that the new, work
mentioned in item 2 of the details should
not be proceeded with under present finasacial conditions. 1 go further than that,
and 'take the ground that it should flot be

proceeded with at all. In this conneotion
may I repeat what I said a few days ago,
that I have no desire to injure the harbour
of Quebec; on the contrary, I should like
to see everything done to make it one of
the greaitest ports in the world. I may
also say that the late Chairman of the
Quebec Harbour Commission, the honourable gentleman from the Gulf (Hon. Mr.
L'Espérance), a gentleman in whom we all
have the greatest confidence, states that
the dredging is absolutely necessary. Therefore, with the consent of the House I would
ask that this figure be reduced to $750,000,
and I would then like to have the House
decide whether the section should pass.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Honourable
gentlemen, I am glad to hear the honourable gentleman from Grenville (Hon. Mr.
Reid) admit that the dredging at least is
a very urgent necessity. However, before
we take the vote on the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman, which,
if it carries, may defeat the Bill, will the
leader of the House tell us whether he is
willing to accept it? If he is I have
nothing more to say.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot accept the amendment of the honourable
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Honourable
gentlemen, before taking a vote on this
amendment to a Money Bill, which, should
it carry, would mean the rejection of the
whole Bill and prove very serious, if not
fatal, to the best interest of the port
of Quebec and highly detrimental to
the interest of the whole of Canada,
I hope this honourable body will give
me a few more minutes of attention.
The money asked for in this Bill is
to be expended over a ,period of three
years. It is for the protection and continuation of plans approved and work
authorized under the late Administration.
My honourable friend from Grenville
has said that he is not against the port
of Quebec, and I believe him. His past
record is there to prove that he is not. He
was a leading and active member of an
Administration which did more for the development of the port of Quebec between
1913 and 1921 than had been done by al]
previous Administrations since Confederation. I am sure, therefore, that he will
give a sympathetie hearing to one who has
been a constant and loyal supporter of
this policy, one who bas been intimately
connected with the improvements of that
port and who has made a special study of
Hon. Mr. REID.

transportation by rai, and water in relation or co-ordination with the Canadian
National Railways and the port of Quebec.
My honourable friend, while approving
of most of the items in the list of improvements to be carried out under the provisions of this Bill, has made objection to the
dredging the Quay Wall. I will be perfectly frank with this honourable body. I
believe that all the improvements asked
for are necessary and will ultimately have
to be carried out, but that some are more
urgent than others. In my opinion, the
dredging and the building of piers, item
No. 18, are of immediate importance. They
are urgently required to protect and to
take full advantage of the work we have
previously done at a considerable expense
to this country.
As to item No. 2, although I am of
opinion that it must eventually be carried
out in order to fill the gap now existing
between the present pier and the River
St. Charles lock wall, it may not have the
same urgency, but it should be proceeded
with as soon as conditions justify. The
sand which accumulates in the St. Charles
basin and has to be dredged yearly comes
for the most part through this gap. When
this is filled it will give the harbour some
200,000 feet of reclaimed land worth more
than the whole appropriation asked for
in this item.
It may not be so urgent as the rest, but
I would not for this item alone take the
responsibility of defeating a Money Bill
which was debated and passed in the other
House, which, after all, has the full responsibility of expenditures of public
moneys. Why, it was only yesterday that
I heard my right honourable friend the exMinister of Trade and Commerce pronounce one of the most severe arraignments which I have heard in this Chamber against the Government for introducing a measure which, in the honourable
gentleman's estimation, is going to tax
and increase the price of the food of every
man, woman and child of this country; and
still my right honourable friend very wisely refrained from taking the responsibility of killing that measure, and why? Because, as he said, the measure had been
debated and voted in a House freshly elected by the people of this country. If my
right honourable friend can conscientiously adopt this course on a question involving a very high fundamental principle,
surely we ought not to adopt a different
course on a Bill involving only a comparatively small expenditure of money.
I

JUNE 27, 1922
trust, therefore, that my honourable friend
from Grenville, who bas been such a good
and consistent supporter of the development of the port of Quebec, will reconsider
hie action and withdraw the ameadiment
bh as proposed. Should he decidýeto do so,
I hope that the honourable leader of this
House will represent to the Government
the necessity of authorizing, for the present, only snch works as require immediate
attention, and delay as long as possible the
building of the Quay Wall in the port of
Quebee.
1 crave the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
permission of the House to add a few
words to the argument we have juet heard
from the honourable gentleman from the
Gulf (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance). It is asked
that $700,000 be spent to extend the wharf
so as to, close in the gap through which
sand and mud wash in and out and settie
along the 8,000 feet of wharf, which bas
been splendidly eqnipped to receive sh.ips,
and where our immigrant buildings are
erected. The sum of $700,000, if the money
is to be had from the Federal Treasury,
will represent et 5 per cent, $35,000 a year.
Is it not manifest that that sum, or an
amount approximating it, or exceeding it
will be needed to dlean up that ýbasin every
spring and summer and put it in a condition to receive large steamships7 In addition to the faet that this proposed expenditure represents a charge of only $35,000 a
year, the honourable gentleman from the
Gulf bas steted that the dredging of that
basin wiIl permit of the reclamation of lanid
the rentaI of which will dim.inish considerably this amount of $35,000. So it appears
to be a good commercial proposition for the
maintenance and use of the works that
bave been buil't there at a cost of millions.
The work propoeed je not to be carried on
and finished within one year. The dredging le to cover a period of 'chree years.
Under these circumetances, I suggeet that
my honourable friend (Hon. -Mr. Reid)
agree to our giving the Harbour Commission and the Marine Depertment the necessery leeway to enable them to protect that
basin ini the manner which has been indicated by the engineers, -Who are convinced
that by reason of the land being reclaimed
and leased to prdvate parties and corporations, the charge may not, after ail, 'welgh
very heavily upon the public treasury.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, just a word further on this
matter, as I tock some part in the discussion of it yesterday. It has been pointed

69à

out that some dredging ie necessary. After
hearing from some of the officers of the
Department of Marine, we must agree that
a slight amount of dredging at the entrance
of the St. Charles river is desirable;
though I do flot think they have proven
that it la absolutely necessary.
It is proposedi to spend the sum of $125,000, as set forth in one of the items, for the
-building of a protecting wali across the
harbour, severai thorusand feet away from
the present docks. That was shown on a
plan madle in the year 1918. A substantial
portion of this money is inciuded for the
carrying on of the generai plan of deveiopment of that harbour that was started at
that time, but which the engineer or the
department officiai did not say, and in my
opinion could not say, was an absolute
necessity. But in 1913 thie dock 5,000 fret
long, was compicte, with 35 feet of water in
front of it, and ready to accommodate
ships far in excess of any of the requiremente that have occurred up to date. And,
mind you, there bas not been up to this
year, so f ar as we have been able to ascertain, any demand on the part of the Harbour Commissioners et Quebec for this
important dredging proposai that has suddeniy deveioped. Had the silting been
seriocus and the filiing ln continuing year
after year, 1 fancy the late Board of Harbour Commissioners of Quebec would probably have said .something about it. They
did not. Now, ail at once, it deveiope that
this large amount of work is necessary.
As the honourable leader of the Government has explained, it is intended that the
spending of the money under thie vote shall
cover a period of three years. I submit
that if the vote lseut in two, as is propoed
by the mover of the amendment (Hon. Mr.
Reid), it will have the effeet of causing
those responsible for the spending of that
money to be a littie more careful and
cautions as to how it le spent, so as to get
the beet possible returns from IL Should
it happen a Year hence that further appropriations are required, provision can
then be made for them. Nobody wants to
see thé port of Quebec hampered; but it le
beiieved thait a vote of $1,500,000 for further public works to develop that port is
unnecessary. The port bas already been deveioped far beyond its present requiremente, and it has neyer yet returned to the
country a single cent by way of interest on
the money 4nvested. I therefore hope that
the amendment made by the honourable
member from Grenville will prevail.

;96

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would not
like honourable members to be influenced
by the argument that has been advanced in
this Chamber, that the Quebec harbour has
given no return for the money expended
upon it. I have refrained from entering
upon that ground; but I would remind my
honourable friends that on ports which in
my opinion it was proper to equip we have
advanced considerable money, knowing that
there was no immediate return. Halifax
cost us $16,738,000 in money directly spent
by us; St. John harbour, $14,000,000; Vancouver, $7,000,000; Toronto, $8,506,000;
upon which expenditure we received no return. I mention these facts simply in
order that the re-affirmation of the fact
that Quebec bas paid no interest may not
deter us from fulfilling our obligationsHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: So far as
necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -to the extent of equipping the port to a satisfactory
degree.
Hon. Mr. PROUDFOOT: Honourable
gentlemen, I have heard all the arguments
which have been advanced in reference to
cutting down this vote, and I do not see
my way clear to vote for the amendment,
because I feel that the Government should
take the responsibility. The Government
and the engineers say that this work is
required. That being so, I am not going
to set up my judgment in opposition to
theirs.
There is another consideration which appeals to me strongly. For many years I
represented, and I am still interested in,
a harbour. The people in my former constituency have been applying to the Government, year in and year out, to supply
money for the protection of that harbour,
and for continuing it. We are still making
applications of that kind. We have an application before the Governement at the
present time, and they have seen fit, at our
request, to grant a considerable sum of
money for improvements at that harbour.
Next year I intend to press them very
strongly to make a considerably larger appropriation than they did this year. That
being so, I do not see how I can with any
degree of consistency say to the Government, " You are wrong in applying to Parliament for this amount of money," and
next year go to them, as I have done this
year, and ask them to make grants for the
harbour in which I am interested.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. REID: I desire to add one word
with reference to the statement made by
the honourable leader of the Government.
The honourable gentleman said there had

been $17,000,000 or $18,000,000 spent at

Halifax. That is true, but vessels have
the free use of those facilities. Toronto
bas been referred to. The expenditure in
Toronto was agreed to on condition that
the city of Toronto would spend an equal
amount; so that for practically every dollar
spent by the Government the city of
Toronto must spend an equal amount. The
case of Vancouver was the same prior to
that harbour being taken over by the Harbour Commissioners. The same applied to
Montreal and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not present the statement as an argument for each
case must be treated on its merits. I alluded
to it only because it had been repeated
quite often in this Chamber that Quebec
was paying no interest.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Honourable gentlemen, I am a very strong believer in the
improvement of our harbours. I believe
that the great harbours, such as St. John,
Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, Vancouver, and
Victoria particularly, should have all the
equipment that is necessary to enable them
to carry trade that we hope will come to
this country. For that reason I intend
voting for the motion.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: Honourable gentlemen, I will add only a few words to express my regret that so much opposition
has been offered to this request from the
harbour of Quebec. As bas been well stated
by the honourable gentleman from the
Gulf (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance), Quebec has
a natural harbour, created by the Almighty
for the purposes of navigation. Situated
at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, it is a
national harbour for big shipping, and, being a national harbour, it ought to be protected and maintained by the nation.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Why was not Quebec content with the natural harbour that
the Almighty made? Why did they strive
to make it an artificial harbour?
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: It is a natural
harbour, but we are trying to improve it,
for nature must be assisted. The appropriation in question bas been voted by the
House of Commons, which in matters of
expenditure and public credit represents
the nation; and I think the Senate ought
to be very careful, as it bas always been,

JUNE 27, 1922
about refusing to sanction money votes
passed by the bouse of Gommons. It is
the business of the House of Commons to
vote money. They are responsible directly
to the people for money grants. Therefore
I think that in this case we ought to comply with the request that bas been made
by those 'who are more familiar than we
can be with the situation. The request
cornes from the Hlarbour Commission, whose
duty it is to study the needs of the barbour; it cornes from the engineers, who
have thoroughly studied the question, who
know their business, and know exactly what
they want. We are not harbour engineers.
The men who have studied the question
mnust take the responsibility for their recommendations, and we ought not te oppose
them.
1 bave no desire to pass any reflections
upon honourable gentlemen who have
spoken in this bouse, but I arn surprised
utt the opposition offered by men who bave
been Ministers of the Crown and for a
long time leaders of their party in the
House of Commons, and who have certainly asked for very large appropriations
and have made large expenditures with
which the country bas been saddled and
will be for a long time to corne. These
honourable gentlemen now speak against
the principles which they formerly advocated. How would the ex-iMinister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Reid) have liked it if
every tirne he carne to asic for rnoney for
the carrying out of his railway policy the
Senaters had stopped his appropriation
and prevented hirn frorn undertaking work
which he thought it his duty to do for
this country? He wouid not have liked it.
He would bave spoken against the Senate.
Our party had at one time the majority
in the Senate. We did not block the Money
Bills; we did not block the appropriations.
We deemed it our duty to criticize, but not
to pass arnendrnents that wouid nullify the
Money Buis and prevent the appropriation
asked for by the House of Gommons.
Naturaily 1 arn a littie sensitive when
Quebec is spoken of, because it is my native city. We heard the ex-Minister of
Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) state three
or four tirnes: "I arn not in favour of the
app.ropriation asked for the harbour of
Quebec, because it is not a paying proposition." After ail, as bas been stated by
the honourable gentleman on the other side
who spoke of harbours in Ontario (Hon.
Mr. Proudfoot), the harbours of Ontario
are certainiy not paying prop sitions. However, since Quebec harbour bas been im-

9

proved it has been doing better every year,
and, il I remember rightly the report submitted to us last year, there was a surplus
of some -$23,000 or $25,000 over the expenses in the administration of the Quebec
harbour. That means that the tendency is
in the right direction, and that the harbour
will finally be a paying proposition if it is
properly equipped and we grant what is
asked for maintenance and improvements
by the engineers and the Harbour Commission.
Hon. Mrt. GORD ON: Honourable gentlemen, £rom what bas been said in this
House so far, I gather that no honourable
mnember would oppose this Bill if he could
be sure that the money would be spent to
the advantage of the harbour. Personally
I do not know very much about the harbour, but I arn going to. vote for the Bill
because I know well the Chairman of the
Board, and I know that under bis jurisdiction none of this money will be spent
irnpro-perly. I believe that if the whole of
the money is. fot required he will see that
whatever is flot needed is not obtained or
spent. That is the sole reason why I arn
going to support this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I should be very
sorry if the impression went abroad that
the comprehensive plan of development
and improvement for the port of Quebec, prepared with a great deal of
care by the former Administration and
now to be carried out by the new,
were to be blocked by the Senate.
I think it would be very difficuit to explain why a plan made, approved for
years, and now being carried out, should
be put aside, the works stopped, and the
policy adopted by both parties abandoned.
I think that we ought to be very careful
before we prevent, by any action of this
Huse. the proper developrnent of one of
our national ports. I think that we ought
to be very prudent indeed; and for my
part I arn not prepared to assume the responsibility of saying to the old Administration that they were wrong, or to the
new Administration that they are equally
wrong in this plan for the development of
the port of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: I beg the forbearance of the House for a few minutes, but
I feel that I should raise my voice on this
question. I would be very sorry if the city
of Quebec had to, bear the stigma of being
selected by honourable members of this
House as a subject of attack on the score
of economy. This is no new question, be-

cause it happens that the special improvements and extensions which have come before this Parliament during the present
Session belong to the general plan of improvement that was prepared many years
ago. My honourable friend the member
for Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) knows a
great deal about it, and I would ask him
not to press his amendment, which would
surely be very badly received in the city
of Quebec and in the province of Quebec.
The amount involved is several hundred
thousand dollars, but I think the objection
is what we used to call cheese-paring, and
I would be very sorry if my sisters and
brothers were selected for an example of
the rigid economy that is coming to be the
practice in this House. I trust my honourable friend will be impressed by the explanations that have been given by the
honourable member for the Gulf division
(Hon. Mr. L'Espérance), who knows all
about the matter, he having been the
Chairman of the Harbour Commission for
many years, and also by the pledge that
has been given by the leader of the Government on this occasion that he would see,
and that the Government would see, that
the money should be spent only to the extent of the expenditure asked for.
In
view of all the explanations that have been
given in this House, I would be very glad
if my honourable friend the member for
Grenville would withdraw his amendment.
If it is put to a vote, I shall have to vote
against it, and vote for the Bill in toto.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Reid was negatived: years, 30; nays, 36.
Sections 2 to 8, both included, were
agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed
to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.

Bill 78, An Act to provide for further advances to the Quebec Harbour

CANCELLATION OF LEASES OF
DOMINION LANDS BILL
CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE OF COMMONS
AMENDMENTS

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the Senate proceeded to consider
the amendments made by the House of
Commons to Bill Y2, An Act respecting
Notices of Cancellation of Leases of Dominion Lands.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, the House of Commons having
disagreed to clause 3 of the Bill as passed
by the Senate, regarding it as unnecessarily tying the hands of the Government and
the Department, I beg to suggest that the
Senate do not insist on its amendment. I
may say that it is not the intention of the
present head of the Department of the Interior to recommend any relaxation in the
provisions of the Order in Council passed
on the 6th of October, 1919, which I had
occasion to mention in the course of the
debate, by which a certain area of land
sought by the amendment to be only leased
under statutory enactment has been withdrawn from disposal under the provisions
of the coal mining regulations of the Department. This area is in Townships 55,
56, 57, 58 and 59, Ranges 7, 8, and 9, west
of the sixth initial meridian. Under the
circumstances I feel that we should not
insist upon our amendment. I may say,
furthermore, that ,while the Minister of
the Interior advises me to make that statement, he adds that before long all of those
lands will probably be transferred to the
province of Alberta and be no more in the
right of the Dominion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out to my honourable friend that a
complication has arisen owing to an
amendment inserted by the Commons
which destroys the essential clause in the
Bill passed by this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We might
perhaps first dispose of the first amendment made by the Commons. They have
rejected clause 3 of our Bill-because we
must not forget that it was initiated in
this Chamber. So I will moveHon. Mr. BEIQUE: Let us understand
where we are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is just
what I am trying to explain.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would suggest to the honourable gentleman that the
House go into Committee on the amendments.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
House went into Committee on the amendments.
Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Section 3,
which has been rejected by the Commons,
reads as follows:

which reservation was established by the Order
in Council (P.C. No. 2044) dated the sixth day
of October, 1919, withdrawing from disposai
under the provisions o! the regulations then In

property of the Crown in townships 55, 56, 57,
58 and 59, ranges 7, 8 and 9 west o! Sixth

otherwise disposed of, except under the authority o! and in accordance with the provisions of
any Act of the Parlianient of Canada hereafter
passed and specificalhy relating to such rights
or lands and to the sahe, lease or other disposition thereof.

The Minister of the Interior aslced the
House of Commons not to, affirm, that
amendment, inasmueh as it seemed to restrict the general powers of the Department and of the Governor in Council; and
he feit that, since the Government oi Canada had by Order in Council withdrawn
from lease or sale those areas, there was
no reason to go beyond the statement of
policy he was making; and he added that
before long those areas, with the lands
now held by the Dominion in Alberta,
would be returned to the province of
Alberta. I move that the Senate concur in
that amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, the situation is as folIows. Section 3 was introduced into the
Bill practically to, supplement an Order
in Council known as number 2,044, whereby the lands in question, in the words of
the Order in Council,

from disposai under the provisions of the coah
mining regulations above referred to.

ed by the late Governaient when in office,
the sames provision would have been inserted in the Act. However, as the Minister of Interior feit somewhat sensitive
upon the subjeet, and as it was represented
on the part of the Government that the
reservation which was made by the late
Government would be protected and continued, it was thought; that that woul.]
probably be a sufficient assurance to those
who were interested in the matter to permit of their consenting to, the withdrawal
of clause 3, thus permitting of the Bill
being accepted by the Commons as it was
originally introduced in the Senate.
I inay say that I took up the subject
with the Minister of the Interior, who informed me that his views were substantially the same as those of the late Government, and told me that he would not object to any assurance that might be desirable for the purpose of giving expression
to those views. He accordingly sent me a
letter, which I beg to read to the Senate,
and which I accept as a satisfactory assurance that the policy of the late Goverament in dealing with these lands wil
be followed by the present Minister of the
Interior and by the Government. He statez
in his letter:
In case the explanation which I furnished to
the H-ouse of Commons on Friday last in connection with Bill No. 153, respecting Notices of

to take the place of clause 3 which we inserted in the Bill.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There are
two other Commons amendments to be dealt
with. That House, I think through a misunderstanding, rejected a further clause. I
had moved a supplementary clause to meet
the objection which had been raised that
under the Act we seemed to nullify the
effect of the judgment of the Privy Council
in the case of Paulson, and to deny to him
advantages that he had obtained under that
judgment. I drew the attention of the
]Tpartment to the fact, and received an
amendment which read in this way:
This Act shall not affect any rights under
any judgment rendered before the date of the
passing of this Act-

That was to cover the Paulson case.
-or under any action, suit or other proceeding
instituted before the lst day of May, 1922.

A question arose as to the word " proceeding," which we said was a legal proceeding, and this amendment was accepted,
but it was struck out in the Commons. I
will read it as further amended by the
Commons:
This Act shal not affect any rights under
any judgment rendered before the date of the
passing of this Act or claimed in any action,
suit or petition of right instituted or presented
before the 1st day of July, 1922.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Why July? Why
not last May?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was in
order to allow a claimant an opportunity
to obtain a fiat.
I move that our own amendment as embodied in clause 5 'be maintained, and that
we do not concur in the amendment made
by the House of Commons to strike out
clause 5.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
We
restore clause 5, and do not consent to the
Commons amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We restore
clause 5 and do not consent to the alternative.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Now I should
like to say a word which I think is called
for. In the Commons Debates I saw a
statement of the Minister of Interior that
the representative of the United States of
America had lodged a complaint with the
Department against the adoption of this
Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Act, because, in the mind of that representative, it would injuriously affect the
claim of an American citizen. I want to
draw the attention of the Senate to the
fact that, under the Act as it will be, we
shall cure only the technical defects, detected by the courts, in the form of the
cancellations of leases, and in the service of
those cancellations. This Bill will cover
some 20,000 claims under a uniform enactment. Among the claimants will be our
nationals as well as those of foreign countries. The form had been accepted as sufficient by the 20,000 people whose leases
had been cancelled under it. Under our
clause anyone who- acquired a right, by
petition of right or a suit before the lst
of May last, may continue to further his
interests before our courts. This Bill will
simply deny to those 20,000 claimants, whoever they may be, the right to raise the
question of the form of the cancellation or
of the notice; and whatever other rights
may accrue to the previous holders of the
leases remain in their entirety under the
general law. We are simply declaring that
what the Department did in the past in
cancelling leases and giving notice will not
be attacked in the courts. I thought I
should make this statement, because we are
dealing fairly and equitably and on the
same basis with all the people who have had
dealings with the Department.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You are doing
nothing of the kind.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
no doubt that, if any manifest injustice bas
been done -in a matter of this kind, Parliament will give relief.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Parliament is

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then
it will exercise its right to grant relief.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are taking
it away only on a question of procedure.
Reasons will. have to be drafted for our
non-concurrence in thé Commons amendments.
The Committee rose and reported that
they had agreed to the first amendment
made by the House of Commons, and had
disagreed to the second and third amendments made by the House to Bill Y2, an
Act respecting Notices of Cancellation of
Leases of Dominion Lands.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
report was concurred in.

JUNE 27, 1922
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved that a
message be sent to the House of Gommons
to acquaint that House accordingly.
The motion »was agreed to.
RAILWAY RATES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 206, an Act to amend
the Railway Act, 1919.
He said: Honourabie gentlemen, this
Bill has for its object the continuance of
the suspension of what is known as the
Crowsnest Pass Agreement, which is ta
be found in chapter 5 of the Statutes of
Canada of 1897, with the exception of the
rates on grain and flour. The Bill reads:
Subsection 5 of section 325 of the Railway
Act, 1919, shall nothwithstandlng the proviso
thereof, remain in effect until the sixth day of
July. 1923, and may be contlnued in force for
a further period of one year by order of the
Governor In Council published In the Canada
Gazette: Provided that, nothwlthstanding anysaid subsection
the
In
or
herein
thlng
5 contained, rates on grain and foeur shall, on
and from the sixth day of July, 1922, be governed by the conditions of the agreemuent In
pursuance of chapter five of the Statutes of
Canada, 1897.

I will not impose upon the members of
this House a statement explaining what
this Bill means. We ail know that a subcommittee of the House of Gommons bas
been sitting for the last month examining
into the advisability of suspending for a
further period the Crowsnest Pass Agreement or allowing it to be restored on the
6th of July next. The Committee decided
that the suspension of the agreement
should be continued for another year, and
that the Governor in Council should have
the right to continue it for twelve months
longer, except with respect to the rates on
grain and flour. The Committee's recommendation was accepted by the Gommons
and is now before us. It involves a number of questions. It bas a bearing upon
the income of the railways, not only the
Ganadian Pacific Railway, but also the
National Railways, which wilI be affected
thereby. It will need to be supplemented
by some action on the part of our Railway Board in fixing rates generally, except for flour and grain. But, as honourable members are at least as familiar as
I amn with this intricate question, I submit the Bill to the judgment of this Chamiber.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Does this say
wheat or grain?

7U1

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It says grain
and flour.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot intend to discuss the Bill except to point out that the
considerations involved are important and
very complicated. It has received particular attention in the House of Gommons
from ail parties in that Chamber. It has
bieen the subject-matter of an inquiry by
a special committee whose work extended
over a considerable period, and, as in the
case of many other complicated subjects,
the Bill is probably unsatisfactory to ail
parties concerned. It seems to me that
any discussion of it by niyself or by other
honourabie members would not further illuminate the situation or facilitate the
carrying out of the purposes in view. I
amn therefore impelled to accept the Bill
as it bas come £rom the House of Gommons, and, so far as I can determine the
tendency of this House, I fancy it is very
much the samne as that which I have expressed.
Hon. Mr. REID: 1 have two objections
to this Bill, and I wili state them in about
five minutes. The subsection reads:
Subsection 5 of section 325 of the Railway
Act, 1919, shali, nothwithstanding the proviso
thereof, remain in effect until the sixth day of
July, 1923.

That is, for one year.
ing words:

Then the follow-

And may be contlnued in f ores for a further
period of one year by order of the Governor in
Council published in the Canada Gazette.

That is the first objection 1 have. My
reason for objecting is that Parliament
will probably be in session in January next
and continue until probabIy this time next
year, and it does not seem to me quite fair
that when Parliament is in session its
powers shouid be delegated to the Governor in Council. I think Parliament
should have retained the right to consider
the further extension, and my reason for
stating s0 is that we do not know what
wiil be the effect of this Bill. It is possible
that, as a resuit of enacting what I consider to be class legislation granting iower
freight rates to a part of this country,
there will be a loss on the operations of
the railways and that a heavy burden of
higher freight rates will have to be borne
by the other provinces to niake up for that
ioss. 1 object therefore to the extension
being granted by Order in Council. It
wouid have been better, in my judgment,,
to have given Parliament an opportunity
of considering the matter for the f oliow-

i02

SENATE

ing year in view of the situation that
would then exist, and of determining
whether or not it would be necessary to
extend the arrangement. I have always
understood that the Governor in Council
was empowered to act when Parliament
was not in session; but it will be in session
next year at a time when the Crowsnest
agreement might properly be considered.
The question of continuing its suspension
at that time ought to have been left for
Parliament to decide.
The other part of this Bill which I consider objectionable is the proviso:
Provided nothwithstanding anything herein
or in said subsection five contained, rates on
grain and flour shall, on and from the sixth
day of July, 1922, be governed by the provisions
of the agreement made pursuant to chapter flye
of the Statutes of Canada, 1897.

minute. I desire to point out that by this
Bill we are not giving anything to any
class of people; we are only putting into
force what the people of Canada were given
in return for a large cash subsidy. It was
the Progressive party in the House of
Commons that urged strongly that this Bill
should be passed. While it agreed that the
reduction of rates on the other items mentioned in the Crowsnest Agreement should
stand in abeyance for a year or two, it was
on the general understanding that in the
course of another year, or two years at
the most, in all probability, freight rates
all over this continent would come down,
and the natural state of affairs would be
such that the railways of their own accord
would reduce the rates on other articles
besides grain and flour and the other
articles mentioned in the agreement. In a
short time there will be a general reduction of freight rates. The reduction will
come when one or two questions particularly
the labour question, are settled.
The
Crowsnest freight rate on grain and flour
is a paying rate. The railway company
has not suffered to any great extent, and
the present arrangement is, I think, very
satisfactory all round.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

That means that for the next two years
at least there will be very low rates on
grain and flour-rates that may perhaps
be in the judgment of the Board of Railway Commissioners too low, owing to the
cost of operation, til. conditions became
normal. Other parts of the country will
have to bear the extra burden.
I object also for this reason, that other
parts of the Dominion may want s-imilar
advantages. There are great coal mines in
Nova Scotia, and also in Alberta. Nova

TEMPERANCE BILL

CONSIDERATION 0F COMMONS DISAGREFiMENT TO BEINATE AMENDMENTe

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Gommons disagreeing
to certain amendments made by the Senate
to Bill 132, an Act to amend the Canada
Temperanceý Act.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, we have now to deal with a
message from the House of Gommons, informlng this Chamber that they have not;
agreed to the amendments made by the
Senate to Bill 132, "for the reason that
the said amendrnents would destroy the
effect of the whole Bill." I notice that the
House of Commons, in refusing to accept
the rejection by the Senate of the second
part of the Bill, consciously or unconsciously rejected also the amall amendment that
we made. It thus refuses to accept our
two amendments.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
are the two?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: It rejects our
striking out of Part V of the Act, which
authorized the prohibition of the importation of liquor into any province that would
ask the Governor in Couneil, by resolution
of its Executive ýGovernrnent, to, pass such
prohibition.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE POSTER:
What was the other?
The other
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
one was our amendment adding the words:
IlProvided that such day shail not be prior
to the first day of Octob",r, 1922."

That is, that the Order in Council prohibiting the exportation of liquor in a province should not corne into force before the
first day of October next. I move that the
Senate insist -upon this amendment.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: «The other
amendment in which the Hous-e of Comxnons has not seen fit to concur was the
amendmnent moved by the honourable gentleman froen Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
striking out Part V, which enabled a province to prohibit the importation of liquor
except by the Government or a Government Commission. I move that the Senate
do not insist on that amendment.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
What are the reasons that the other Chamber gives?
The reason
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is that the said amendrnent would destroy
the effect of the whole Bill.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
1 should like to understand the way in
which it destroys the effect of the whoie
Bill. As I understand it, the rejection of
section 3 and what is contained in it, does
not la any way, manner, or form affect the
preceding part of the Bill, to which we did
agree. It takes away no rlght, that I see.
-I arn disHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
posed to view the reason given by the Gommons in the sanie light as my right honourabie friend.
Hon. :Mr. BELCOURT: That is no reason at ail.
The reason
flon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is that the disappearance of section 3 wouid
destroy the whole effect of the second part
of the Bill.
But I do not intend to stand on any
technical objection to the message before
us. It is a strange way of expressing dissent fromn the policy involved in our action.
We must simpiy take the fact that this
Bill cornes back to the Senate with a refusai by the Gommons to concur in the
amendment we made. The reason why I
move that this amendrnent be not insisted
upon is this. We have afflrmed the principle, both in the present and in the preceding Parliament, when a good number
of honourable gentlemen now in this
Chamber were members of the Cabinet
that adopted the policy of settling the temperance question, for a certain time, at all
events, on certain lines. We decided to

SENATE

704

give full effect to the wi'l of the people of
the various provinces. We affirmed that
policy. One province states its will; a
neighbouring province states another will.
But has not each and every province of the
Dominion perfect freedom, under the
policy adopted by my right honourable
friend, and supported by him in the other
Chamber, and carried into the statutes?
I said the other day that this was the only
way to maintain Confederation-that it
was the spirit which had been accepted by
the fathers of Confederation. My honourable friend from New Brunswick (Hon.
Mr. Fowler) challenged my statement,
which went beyond the liquor question:
it reached to the habits of life of each
people. We felt and we said that we
would not be disturbed or annoyed in
regard to our way of living, domestic and social. That is what we said
when we entered Confederation, b'ecause
we felt that under that compact we would
live our own life happily, freely, as we
pleased, and as we had heretofore done.
This is the position I took when the Federal Parliament, under the leadership of
my revered leader, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
enacted the Lord's Day Observance Act. I
told him that we would shake the columns
of the temple before we would allow the
habits of Quebec to be imposed upon Ontario, and that, on the other hand, Quebec would not accept the habits of thought
and the ways of living, social and otherwise, of another province. That was the
basis of Confederation.
To-day we reaffirm that principle. I accepted with enthusiasm the policy initiated
by the preceding Cabinet of respecting the
will of the provinces. In this Bill there
is continued the same policy. British Columbia, Quebec, and every other province
has the right to import liquor. Ontario
retains that right and also New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and all the other provinces, upon certain conditions. When we
were asked to limit the right of importation in a province to the Government of
that province, of which it was but the instrument or creation, we said: "We will
agree to that." Is there anything unfair
in that? I quite realize that it may not
accord with the principles of my right
honourable friend, who is a teetotaler and
a prohibitionist, to accept a law which
gives a monopoly of any kind to the Government of a province or to an agency of
that Government. He does not like, by his
vote, to grant power to sell liquor. But
his view has not been accepted by the CabHon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

inet of which he was a member. Every
one in that Cabinet knew what his views
were, but I am quite sure the large majority of those who sat around him at the
Council table were non-teetotallers, as I
hope are the majority of those at the
Council table where I sit. But that is the
business of each and every one of them.
I say that this amendment, which the
Commons rejects, would thwart the will
of any province that desired to have the
right to limit importation into that province to the Government itself. We have
heard in this Chamber the assertion that
what the Executive of a province did was
not representative of the will of the people
of that province. That is quite a paradox,
constitutionally speaking, for the will of
the people can only be expressed by its
parliament, and on this question the Legislature and the Executive speak for the
people. The people can alter its will and
change its ýpolicy; but, so long as there is
a majority in the Legislature to maintain
the Executive, that Executive or Cabinet
speaks for the people of that province.
That is my reason for suggesting that the
Senate do not insist on this amendment.
The Senate carried the amendment by
only a few votes. It is an open question. I
appeal to Caesar better informed. I say
that the Senate of Canada should allow the
provinces to live their own lives and to
determine freely their manner of disposing
of the temperance or liquor question.
For these reasons, honourable gentlemen,
I ask that the Senate declare that it does
not insist on its amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, this question can be put in
a nutshell. It is simply a question as to
whether the law shall stand as it is, or
whether my honourable friend's dictum
shall prevail, that we shall change the law.
The law as it is represents the will of the
people. The law as my honourable friend
wants it this afternoon represents the
absolutism of a provincial Executive
against the will of the people. The people
referred to are those of British Columbia
and Quebec. Under the law placed upon
the statute book, and supported by my
honourable friend when it was so placed,
the people have a right as against the
Executive in those provinces to import
whatsoever liquor they choose, qualified by
whatever the Dominion statute may be.
The provincial Executive steps in and says:
" We are going to thwart the will of the
people as guaranteed by the federal Government so that we may enjoy the monopo-

JUNE 27, 1922
listie right of all importation into the province." That is what my honourable friend
My honourable
asks this House to do.
friend grows excited, and tells us that the
pillars of the temple will be pulled down
if we do not consent to giving this monopoly to two provinces in the Dominion.
Why have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
they asked for it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then,
may I ask my honourable friend: what
right have they, after a statute is solemnly
and deliberately placed upon the statute
book giving the provinces a broad measure
of liberty, to come to the Federal Parliament and say: " We demand that this
shall be repealed and that absolute powers
be vested in us." That is what those provinces ask to-day-and why? That they
may wield the big stick politically over the
provinces in which the Executive carries
out its will.
What has
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
politics to do with that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I say
those provinces have deliberately gone into
the liquor business. The liquor business in
those provinces 'is to-day supreme over
every other interest. The provinces referred to have entered upon an undertaking
which overshadows all other provincial considerations, and from which they enjoy a
revenue which transcends all their other
revenues. They are giving more attention
to that business, and I may say, with some
degree of confidence, to establishing the
ramifications of the liquor business within
the boundaries of their provinces than to
any other subject within their authority
and jurisdiction.
My honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend is not speaking for Quebec,
surely?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I dare
say my honourable friend can scarcely
point to any other interest being administered in the province of Quebec that can
compare with the liquor interest of that
province.
Our. road
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
system is the envy of all the other provinces.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
road system and all the other systems of
the province are subordinate. This is the
source from which the sinews of war are
S-45

drawn, and from which, to a very large extent, is derived the means to carry on these
other systems.
Hon. Mr. MITCHELL: They are trying
to correct an evil.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, I
leave that to my Quebec friends. When I
hear gentlemen who have assumed the role
of moral reformers impressing upon this
Chamber the fact that those two provinces
are iseriously engaged in a great work of
moral reform in their administration of
the liquor business, it appeals to my sense
of levity; and if their observations seem
to me somewhat grotesque and appeal to
my risibilities, I hope they will attribute it
to an undue sense of humour on my part.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask why
my honourable friend 'is making this a
political and party question? What is the
motive in doing that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not dealing with it from a political or party
standpoint. I am dealing with it from a
moral and economic standpoint, and from
the standpoint of every consideration that
can enter into the mind of anybody. Can
my honourable friend point to any question
in any of those provinces which possesses
more political possibilities than the liquor
question? If he can, I may say that I am
entirely unaware of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend that the Commission
in the province of Quebec is so absolutely
independent that in order to establish its
independence it has appointed Conservatives
to the majority of the positions of representatives and agents. It has absolutely refused to yield to the will of members of
Parliament in that respect.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I congratulate my honourable friend on the
altruism of the province of Quebec and the
idealism with which it administers this important undertaking. If such a desiraible
condition has been reached in that province, why, in view of the satisfactory
results that have already been experienced,
do they want to be given a monopoly? Are
they not satisfied with the present system?
Is not my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend aware that if anyone outside of the Commission is allowed to import, the door is opened wide to all kinds
of devices of bootleggers to import liquor
into the province?

REVISED EDITION

'06

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
not prepared to admit that. I should think
that a liquor system that would produce
such revenues in both provinces would
probably be regarded as being upon a satisfactory basis; and I accept the results as
the very highest tribute which can be paid
not only to the system, but to its administration. In a word, there are two conditions facing the people of Canada in connection with this question. In the dry provinces importation is prohibited-I am
speaking now of importation by the public
as distinguished from importation by the
provincial Government-in the wet provinces-I am so designating the province of
Quebec and the province of British Columbia-the people enjoy the right of importation. At the same time, the Government
of the wet provinces can and do control
that importation by publicly levying a
tax, by measure or otherwise, so that they
derive a substantial revenue from such importations. I think it will be admitted that
in both provinces the system enforced by
the Executive in regard to importation by
private individuals contributes a satisfactory revenue to the respective provinces.
This is the question in a nutshell. The
people to-day have the right to import: the
provinces say: " That is unsatisfactory, and
we demand a monopolistic right, and a prohibition against the people of these provinces importing liquor." I say it is democracy opposed to absolutism, and I am
in favour of the will of the peonle prevailing, and a democratic law like the
present one remaining on the statute book.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What means are
there of ascertaining public opinion except
through the legislatures?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say to my honourable friend that there are
times when this Parliament is entrusied
with the right of declaring the will of the
people in any of the provinces. That we
have done.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know of
the opinion given by the people themselves.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What does section 5 say? It says that no person except
the Executive shall import any liquor into
any province. That is the whole thing.
I ask, honourable gentlemen, how the Commission, say in the province of Quebec,
could operate, unless the pub!ic were prohibited from importing? In the prcvince
of Quebec to-day, as the leader of the Opposition says, we have the right to import.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

But it does us no good. We can only get
the liquor as far as the Customs house, and
we have to pay the duties on it there. The
province of Quebec this year has contributed to the Dominion Treasury, through
the Customs house, the magnificent sum of
$8,000,000. The duty on one case of Scotch
is $20; on a gallon it is $10. If the liquor
runs above a certain percentage of spirit
there is an additional duty. On highwines
the duty is as much as $14 or $15 a gallon.
If anybody outside of the Commission
wants to import, what is to ,prevent it
being done? The minute I try to get my
liquor outside the Customs' house I run
against the police of the Quebec Liquor
Commission. They say: " Where are you
going with that liquor?" No one has the
right to carry one drop of intoxicating
liquor in the streets of Montreal or any
place in the province of Quebec unless it
has come from the Commission itself. I
know of a man who ordered intoxicating
liquor before the law was in operation, but
it did not arrive in time. The only way
you can bring liquor into Montreal is by
having it consigned to the Liquor Commission. If liquor comes to Montreal consigned to an individual, the officials at the
Customs bouse simply telephone to the
Liquor Commisison that So-and-so has imported so many cases of this or that, and
the liquor is watched and cannot be taken
out of the Customs house. But there is
some doubt as to whether the law does not
give one the right to carry to his bouse
iiquor that he has imported. If this legislation goes through there will be no doubt
about it, and nobody but the Commission
can import. I think it is only fair to give
the provinces the right to say no if they
want to say no. Why should my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) not be the first to agree to
that?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: What is to prevent
a bootlegger organizing a syndicate?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Bootlegging is
almost done away with in our province, as
far as we know.
My honourable friend alluded to the
Liquor Commission. I affirm upon my responsibility as a Senator that I have gone
repeatedly to try to get some person employment with the Commission, and the moment I stated to the Chairman of the
Board, Mr. Simard, that this man was
recommended by So-and-so-this was when
Hon. Mr. Gouin was Premier of Quebec-

he said: "I don't care fir Mr. Gouin or

JUNE 27, 1922
Mr. Taschereau. I am the President of
the Liquor Commission, and I am going to
run it as I think fit." Many members of
the local legislature have been refused by
the Commission. I have been in the offices
of the Commission, and have seen strong
Conservatives, friends of mine, employed
there--some of them in important positions. Even one of the Commissioners is
an out-and-out Conservative, and he gives
all the patronage to Conservatives, and we
cannot get any of it. So there is no use
of talking about politics. I do not see
why the House should not allow the provinces to have their own way in this matter. I brought up a motion to give further
liberties to the provinces, but it was turned
down.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, my honourable
friend the leader of the Government in
this House seemed to me to be a little bit
excited when he commenced his statement
with reference to this matter. I want to
inform my honourable friend that he
started out on entirely wrong premises,
and consequently came to a conclusion that
has no foundation upon which to stand.
I had the honour of presenting to this
Chamber a few days ago a brief summary
of the course of legislation in this connection. The basic fact to keep in mind is
this: that nobody came to this Parliament
by plebiscite or otherwise asking this Parliament to undertake to carry out or promote in any way a license system. The
plea which came to this Parliament from
the earliest time up to the present time
was not for regulation by license, but
for control by prohibition. Prohibitory
measures were asked for, prohibitory possibilities were contemplated. The old Dunkin Act, the old Scott Act, and the plebiscites that have been held so far, have not
been upon the question of a license system,
but with reference to prohibition. Parliament, when it took the requests into account, as I said before, found it impossible
or impracticable to give Dominion prohibition, but said: " We will give you the
opportunity to choose for yourself whether
you will or will not have prohibition. If
you decide that you wish prohibition, and
that is shown by the plebiscite, and your
Legislature acts upon the wishes of the
people as shown in the plebiscite, come to
us and we will give you these additional
aids to enable you to carry out prohibition."
That bas been the consistent course of
Parliament in regard to temperance and
prohibition from the earliest days.
S-451

Under the old Government we confirmed
that principle and carried it out, and the
first part of this Bill carries out the same
principle, namely, that when a province
demands prohibition, and by a plebiscite or
by its Legislature shows the will of the
people to be for prohibitory legislation,
not license legislation, this Parliament will
add its powers as they affect manufacturing and importation and exportation, in
order that that province may carry out,
not license, but prohibition. That is the
basis upon which we commenced, and upon
which we have proceeded; and, in so far
as that is concerned, we have said to the
provinces: " We will give you all the rights
and powers we ourselves possess to aid you
in your efforts to enforce prohibition and
make it the law in your province." I think
my honourable friend rather forgot that
course of legislation. He seemed to go on
the assumption that we have made it a
principle in Federal legislation to give to
each province absolute right, and add to
that our different authorities to carry out
licensed operations, in monopoly or otherwise, by thorough control or by distributed
control. There never was any fair ground
for coming to that conclusion. What we
did-and I want to make it as clear as I
possibly can-was to say: "You have asked
for prohibition. We cannot give you
Dominion prohibition, but we will give
you an opportunity to have provincial prohibition; and, as you come to us from time
to time asking us to implement with our
powers those that you have for carrying
out the prohibition that you are endeavouring to put into operation, in order that
there may be a better fulfilment of the law
we will aid you with our powers." But
we never have, by law, or by precept, or
by our example, declared: "We will give
to every province full right to do as it
likes in the matter of prohibition and
license, and we will put behind each province, whether it is for prohibition or for
license, all the subsidiary powers which
as a Federal legislature we possess, and
will therefore aid you in your work." That
is the distinction I want my honourable
friend to draw between the position as I
put it and the position as he is putting it.
Now let me refer to this one particular
case. Take the province of Ontario. They
have had plebiscite after plebiscite, with
overwhelming majorities. On the top of
the actual unit vote of the electors they
have enacted their legislation. Their people,
by their plebiscites and their legislators
chosen by the people, give you an absolute
right to say that the outcome is the result

SENATE
of the will of the people. There is no such
case as that in the other provinces. It
may be more or less of a fiction, but we
must go upon the theory that if a province
elects a legislature, that legislature speaks
for the province, because it has come from
the vote. But in no way can the pronouncement of the legislature be taken to
be as strong and deep or as thorough and
honest a representation of the will of the
people as is manifested when you have,
outside of the election of the legislature,
and underneath that, a prohibition plebiscite in which the majority is strongly in
favour of one line of view. Whilst technically the legislature does express the will
of the people upon a great many different
subjects, yet there are a great many factors that enter into the election of a legislature. But when the people speak by a
plebiscite on one question, and one alone,
the verdict is proof positive of what the
will of the people is, and that is what gives
the province its claim upon us to help it
by our subsidiary powers.
My honourable friend seemed to intimate that because I had views on the matter
of temperance and prohibition which were
in his opinion maybe a little extremethough he may in his heart quite weil
agree with me-therefore I was rather :n
the position of a bigoted individual who
did not want to let other people have their
own views. I am not in that way at all.
I have my beliefs. I am bound to put my
beliefs into my life work. I am bound to
embody my beliefs, in so far as I think
they affect the public weal, in the publie
work that I do in the legislature. On that
ground I am opposed to making a licensed
monopoly in any province in our Dominion,
and in so far as legislation of the Dominion Parliament is required to buttress that,
I am bound as a member of the Dominion
Parliament to carry out my feelings of
opposition in that respect and to represent
my principles. That I do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I did not
mean to go further.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
No, I do not think my honourable friend
did.
Now, coming down to this point, I can
see where, to my mind, the giving of the
monopoly of importation to a Government
in a province does two things. In the first
place it puts the system which they are
carrying out on a basis of revenue and
money-getting, which buttresses it and
makes it more difficult for prohibition ever
to become successful in such a province.
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

Why, the very fact has come out heretofore in this discussion. One of the strong
points that have been urged is that in the
province of Quebec you get a large revenue
and that consequently you are able to
build roads, help educational institutions
and help all philanthropic and charitable
institutions that you wish. What is the
effect of all that? It is that as you feed
these with money that you get from a
certain system you buttress that system,
and you make it more difficult to turn from
a system of license, supported in that way,
to a system of prohibition, that does away
with the revenues which come from drink.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But which
may go towards temperance.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Will the right honourable gentleman permit me a question?
Which does he think is right-that private
interests should pocket that money or that
it should go into the public chest and be
used for the general benefit of the country?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If an answer is required to that question,
my answer is this. I have no sympathy
with the employment of any of the
revenues which come from a traffic which
I consider is prejudicial to the general
good of the country and of the people.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: But that does not
answer my question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The other
system will make plutocrats.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Will make plutocrats in what way?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If you leave
the trade to the private initiative of a few
men you will simply make millionaires and
plutocrats of them and I do not see that
the public in general will benefit through
expenditure on education, goods roads, etc.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not when they
cannot import for sale.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Will the right
honourable gentleman give me a straight
answer to that question? I would like to
have this explained by the right honourable
gentleman, who is so well able to explain
things. Time and time again it has been
proven that you cannot stop the trade. Of
course, I understand the right honourable
gentleman's statement about prohibition;
but my question was this: does not the
right honourable gentleman think that it is
better for a province to derive the profit and
invest it in philanthropic works than to al-

JUNE 27, 1922
low the profit to go to individuals who become plutocrats, powerful men in the community, and do what they like with the
money?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not, for my part, acknowledge in any
way that it is impossible to prevent the
private individual from amassing gain
from the sale of liquor in a traffic such as
tÇiis.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: But, as a practical man, what does my right honourable
friend think?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not think that prohibition is impracticable. I do not think that prohibition, in
its enforcement, has been a failure. I think
that in the provinces of our own country
which have taken it up and carried it out
so far it has been much different from a
failure; and I am of the opinion that in
the United States of America it has not
been a failure. The people of the Unitrd
States have for forty years tested out this
question. They have gone in regular march
through State after State, by state amendments prohibiting the liquor traffic, and
then have marched up to the 18th amendment of the Constitution and have had
prohibition adopted throughout the United
States. I am of the opinion that in that
country as well as in ours, on an average,
the benefits that have come from prohibition have been incalculable. I am of this
opinion as well, that the enforcement of
prohibition is from day to day becoming
more effective. It is following the ordinary course of l.aws which are enacted from
time to time along new lines. It requires
time to come to what may 'be called the
average efficiency in the execution of law.
It is plain enough to see that in regard to
almost every one of our laws there is not
perfect fulfilment; you find breakages more
or less; and that condition will continue so
long as humanity is fallible and has its
weaknesses. But it is a fact, to my mind,
that prohibition is following the course of
other legislation, and that the enforcement
of it will be just as good as the average enforcement of our other laws.
I have taken the time of this Chamber
longer than I should have done, but I
wished to point out the error into which
my honourable friend fell in respect to the
basis of his argument. I wish also to state
that I am not in favour of making a
licensed monopoly in any province of this
Dominion. It is on those two grounds that

709

I have given the vote that I have given in
this Chamber and intend to persist along
the same line.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, if this were not a question of primary
importance I would not detain this honourable House for a minute or two longer;
but I think it is a question in which the
unity of the country is involved. With the
legislative power divided as it is, if the
people of a province find that their will in
what is within their sphere is not supreme,
or will not be obeyed they will feel that
even in matters coming within the jurisdiction of their own legislature their province is ruled, not by their own Government, but by the Federal Parliament, because of this Parliament possessing some
portion of the legislative power which is
necessary to supplement and give effect to
the will of the people of the province.
Now I ask the right honourable gentleman who has just spoken if, as a member
of the late administration, in power from
1911 to last year, he did not agree, and I
ask the honourable leader of the other side
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed), who was also
a member of the Cabinet in those administrations, if he did not likewise agree, to this
principle, that the question of temperance
-or call it prohibition if you will-was a
question to be decided by the people of each
province. Were we not agreed upon that?
And has it not been the policy of the Government of the honourable gentlemen ever
since 1911 to respect the right of each province to decide whether it would have prohibition or hot, or in what way it would
enforce prohibition?
Is it not a question of the manner of
enforcing prohibition? There may be a province, like the province of Ontario, which
is of opinion that what is best for its people
is complete prohibition. In the province of
Quebec the will of the people was ascertained, and, as I said the other day, the
province by a tremendous majority, almost
unanimously, decided, not to have complete
prohibition, but to allow beer and wine. It
decided also in favour of its present system
-not in the first instance, but when it was
found that the other system was opening
the door to boptleggers and so demoralizing
the whole community. Now, are we to understand that the representatives of the
other provinces in this Parliament will
irterfere and place obstacles in the way
cf the people's will being carried out? That
is what I would like to understand. The
Government of the province of Quebec de-

10

SENATE

cided that in the interests of temperance it
was better to adopt the system which has
been latterly adopted. Not only the Government, but also the leader of the Opposition and every other member of the Legislature are agreed upon that. I defy the
right honourable gentleman to contradict
this statement. Are we not to take that as
the will of the province? Now, because some
(f us desire another system of temperance,
or are of the opinion that another system
would be better, the liberty of the subject
is not to be interfered with, and he is not to
be .prevented from exercising his right to
import his own liquor. The Parliament of
Canada shall say to the province: "We
refuse to supplement your power sa
as to enable you to carry out the
will of your people and give effect to the
law which is now in operation in the province." I stated the other day, and I reiterate it without hesitation, that if it is open
to anybody to import liquor, we shall have
a repetition of the condition which prevailed two or three years ago; we shall
have in the province of Quebec any number
of bootleggers, who will use that liquor,
which will be imported right and left, for
the purpose of selling it in the United
States, or in Ontario, or in other provinces.
It is not so much that the province itself
would suffer, but it would be a cause of
demoralization in the community.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Before the honourable gentleman sits down, I should like to
ask him a question. Does not the Doherty
Act protect you really as well as this does?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No. When the
Doherty Act was passed-I think, in 1912
or 1913-when the province of Ontario decided that it would not permit of any liquor
being imported into the province, the honourable leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) presented a Bill.
My best friends were against the Bill.
My best friends in this very House were
against it. The honourable gentleman's
Bill was defeated in Committee of the
Whole of this honourable House. Did I not
come to his rescue? I was not present at
the time it was considered in committee, but
when I came back and the report was made
to the House, I helped the honourable
gentleman and succeeded in having full
effect given to the will of the province.
Now it is the very same thing that I ask
for my province.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What was the
province in that case?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It was the province
of Ontario. I am now asking that the
same measure of justice as was given to
the people of Ontario be given to the province of Quebec. The present law works
to the satisfaction not only of the people
generally, but also of those who, like the
right honourable gentleman, have given fifteen or twenty years, the best of their lives,
to the cause of prohibition and temperance.
They acknowledge that the law is working
properly and in the best direction. It was
passed with the unanimous consent of the
people of the province of Quebec. Where
is the reason for refusing now to supplement the power required by the province
to give full effect to the will of the people?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I want to ask a
question or two on this. How will this
Bill affect you by giving you more power?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: In this way, that
it is only the Parliament of Canada that
can prevent importation, and, if this Bill
does not pass as it was printed, it means
that myself or any other citizen of the
province will be at liberty to import a large
quantity of liquor, and dispose of it, if we
can do so without being detected by the
Commission. Of course, I am sure the
Commission will succeed in confiscating a
large portion of it, but a large portion will
escape and will tend to demoralize the
trade and the community. Now, you are
agreed that in the interest of temperance
or of prohibition Parliament should *estrict the exercise of the rights of the
people. It is merely a question of degree.
You approve of Parlianent preventing the
people in certain provinces from having
liquor in their own homes or purchasing any
liquor at all. We are not going that far.
We are interfering merely to prevent individuals importing, but are giving them the
privilege of having their imnortation rade
by the Commission. The Commission insist on that being done because they can
then control the entire quantity of liquor
which is imported into ti'e province, and
prevent the abuse which otherwise would
oc'cur.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I want just to
c.orrect one impression. The honoui able
leadcr of the Government rnd also the
nonourable gentleman who bas just spoken
have argued from the basis that the people
of the two provinces have spoken on this
question. I pointed out in the debate on
the third reading of this Bill, and I want
to emphasize it again, that in introducing

JUNE 27, 1922
this measure the leader of the Government
nformed us that the people of the province
of Quebec, or at least the Government of
Quebec, had not asked for this legislation
at all. Now, if the Bill does not pass, the
law that is in force in the province of
Quebec, which the last honourable gentleman who spoke (Hon. Mr. Béique) has extolled so highly, will not be changed in
the least. The position will be precisely as
it was before this Bill was introduced.
With regard to the province of British
Columbia, it is true that one member of the
Executive Council of that Province has
asked for this legislation, that is to say,
the Attorney General; but as a matter of
fact neither the legislation on the statute
book nor any prebiscite bas touched the
question of private importation, with this
exception, that the very Government *of
which that Attorney General is a member
put legislation on the statute book containing a clause which impliedly provides for
and permits importation by imposing a
duty on liquor which is imported. So that
when you say that the people of the provinces speak through their legislatures. I
say that so far as British Columbia is concerned they have impliedly agreed to and
asked for the right of private importation,
because their own legislation as it stands
provides that importation may take place if
the importer pays a certain tax to the
Government.
How my honourable friend can base his
very eloquent and impassioned argument
on the suggestion that the people of British
Columbia has asked for this legislation,
and are being refused something that they
have asked for, I cannot see. The question
of private -importation bas never been put
before the people. As a matter of fact,
in the old prohibition law the right of
private importation was expressly reserved
to the household. When the new policy was
decided upon, a referendum was put to the
people, and the only question in that referendum was: " Are you in favour of the
sale of liquor in sealed packages by the
Government? " Then, following their previous policy as to the right of importation,
the legislature provided for importation by
requiring the importer to pay a duty. So
the demand for this legislation comes, not
from the people, not from the legislature,
but from a single person.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am very
much surprised to hear a representative of
the province of British Columbia taking
that stand in the Senate f Canada, and he

iii

is not alone in that respect among the
representatives of British Columbia. Are
they not aware that last evening, when
the honourable the Solicitor General moved
not to concur in this amendment, he was
seconded by Mr. Ladner, from Vancouver,
who said:
I would just like to say a word in favour of
The amendments made by the
the motion.
Senate do have the effect stated. I am of the
it is in the interests of the province
opinion that
of Britjsh Columbia that the control of liquors
be vested in the provincial government, and
for that reason, without delaylng the House
any further, I express my approval of the motion.

It seems that, in addition to the member of the Executive to whom my honourable friend refers, a member of this very
Parliament, a member freshly elected by
the people, from the very city from which
my honourable friend comes, tells him that
the interests of his own province are protected by the amendment which he is now
seeking to reject. It means that British
Columbia is simply given authority to
maintain a monopoly in the hands of the
Executive. That authority will last how
long? So long as the people of British
Columbia maintain that Executive. When,
to-morrow or the day after to-morrow, an
election changes that Executive, it may
assert its will by rescinding this legislation. The machinery is in the Act. The
Lieutenant Governor in Council may repeal what the Lieutenant Governor in
Council may have done a year before, or
a month before. So we are simply giving
the Legislature, the people of British Columbia, the right to use our Federal power
to enforce their own will; and I am surprised that representatives of British Columbia in this Chamber should say: "Nay,
my province shall not have that power."
I do not know on what principle they deny
to their own province the application of
its own will to-day and the application of
its own will to-morrow, if to-morrow that
will is not the same as it is to-day. I have
heard and I have read in the press that
there will be an appeal to the people this
year or next year. Parliaments do not live
long. They are but shadows in a procession that moves constantly. The will
of the people of British Columbia will be
expressed at the polls, it will be indicated
by the return of the members of the legislature, who will then form their Committee or Executive; and this Bill is but giving to the people of any province the right
to express their will. It seems that we
should not begrudge them that right.

712

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I want to vote on
this question conscientiously, as far as I
can see it, and as I am going to vote contrary, as I believe, to a great many of my
friends on this side of the House, I think
I should state my reasons for se voting.
As I understand this question, the liquor
problem is a matter for the provinces,
which under the constitution have the right
to legislate with regard to the sale or nonsale of liquor within their confines. I do
not think anybody disputes that. The
different provinces have legislated in different ways-Ontario in favour of prohibition, and Quebec assuming the control
of the sale of liquor through agents appointed by the provincial executive. Even
if we had the right to prevent the provinces from carrying out their own wishes
as expressed in their legislation, I think
we should not exercise it. There are many
in this House, and no doubt there are
many in the House of Commons, who did
not see eye to eye with the Government of
Ontario when it enacted its legislation, and
yet when that province came to this House
and asked for legislation to enable it more
effectively to carry out its policy, members of this House did not hesitate to grant
the legislation necessary for that purpose,
because everyone felt that it was a provincial matter, and that the constitution
provided that the province should control
this subject; hence they said, "We will do
what we can to enable you to carry out
your law."
Many of the honourable gentlemen who
have spoken against this Bill seem te put
their views in this way: "We are willing
te grant enabling legislation te the provinces if they see eye te eye with us, and
want prohibition; but if any province dares
te take a contrary view, and feels that
prohibition is not in the public interest,
we will not grant that province enabling
legislation." I think that is a wrong view.
When the fathers of Confederation allotted
the various subjects to the provincial legislatures and that of the Dominion, they had
an object in view. Matters of local concern, such as education, were placed in
the hands of the provinces. This course
was taken wisely, and it seems te me only
right that we should assist the provincial
legislatures in carrying out the desires of
the founders of this Dominion in that respect.
As I pointed out the other day, Ontario
has provincial control, just as Quebec has.
It does not matter a particle whether or
not the province of Quebec or Ontario or
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

British Columbia makes money out of this
legislation: that is a matter for themselves. The province of Ontario is selling
liquor for medicinal and sacramental purposes in a way which it thinks proper.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is selling wine
that contains 25 per cent of alcohol.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I have no desire te
discuss the legislation of the provincial
Parliaments. Whether or not the law of
the province of Ontario or that of the
province of Quebec is a good law does not
matter te me because I realize that the
question upon which they are legislating is
one within the power of the provincial
legislature, and they must be left te decide
how they shall treat the subject, and what
laws governing it, they shall place upon
the statute book. If we take away from
the province of Quebec the right te control
this question as it sees fit, te be consistent
we would be obliged te remove from the
statute book of the Dominion the enabling
legislation which was granted te the province of Ontario.
Te say that the province of Quebec or the
province of British Columbia does not want
this law is, te me, a very strange pronouncement.
No doubt the governments
of those provinces were well aware of this
law being now before this Parliament;
yet we have not heard any protest from
either province against it, or any resolution passed by either Provincial Assembly
in regard te it. We have evidence that the
province of British Columbia, through one
of its Ministers, asked for this law. Therefore I take it that those provinces are
coming te this Parliament in the same way
as Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick came, and are asking this Parliament
te give them whatever assistance we can
te carry out the laws which have been
passed by their legislatures, and which
having been se passed, must be taken te
be the will of those provinces until we
have proof te the contrary.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, that
the Senate doth not insist on the second
amendment made by the Senate te Bill
132, an Act te amend the Canada Temperance Act, was negatived on the following

PEACE TREATIES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 203, an Act for carrying into effect the Treaty of Peace between His Majesty and Hungary and Turkey.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this
Bill is an Act for carrying into effect the
Treaties of Peace between His Majesty
and Hungary and Turkey. It provides:
<1) The Governor in Council niay inake such
appomntments, establlsh such offices, make such
Orders in Couneil, and do such things as appear
to hlm to be necessary for carrylng out the
said Treaties and for giving effect to any of the
provisions of the said Treaties.
(2) Any Order in Council made under this
Act may provide for the Imposition by summary process or otherwise of penalties in respect of breaches of the provisions thereof, and
shall be laid before Parliament as soon as mnay
be after it is made, and shall have effect as if
enacted in this Act, but mnay be varied or revoked by a subsequent Order In Council.
(3) Any expense incurred in carrying out
the said Treaties shahl be defrayed out of
moneys provided by Parliament.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
One of these treaties has been ratified, the
other bas not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
either of them has been ratified by Parliament.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The Turkish Treaty bas not been ratified
by Turkey.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There neyer
bas been any ratification as regards
Turkey; and, in view of the most recent
despatches upon the subject, that country
may neyer ratify the Treaty.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Why are we required to ratify it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is necessary
that the treaties be ratified for the purpose of dealing with former enemy property and debts in Turkey and Hungary
in a manner similar to that which, is aiready provided for dealing with former
enemy property and debts in Germany, Anstria and Bulgaria. That the House may
see the need of this legisiation I might
mention that one concern in Canada has a
claim against these countries amounting to
$600,000, which cannot be deait with without the statute in quesltion.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is extraordjnary that we should pass an Act to provide
means for carrying out a treaty which we
have flot ratified.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are now
ratifying it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This is for carrying it into effect, and assumes that we
have ratified it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then what does
it mean?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
These treaties have been passed and have
been signed by us, but as I understand,
Turkey has not agreed to sign the treaty
in question?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Nor has Turkey
ratjfied it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The Bill gives
authority for the appointment by the Governor in Council of certain officers to carry
it out. What does that mean? That means
that we accept it. That is the implication.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
But my right
honourable friend points out that Turkey
has not signed it yet.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 do not deny
that.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
We wîhl do our part.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: One has to act
before the other anyway.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Parliament
should not ratify a treaty that one of the
parties bas flot signed.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think the treaties have been signed.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
But have not
been ratified by their Parliaments?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, they
have been signed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Should
flot the exercise of these powers be made
subject to the ratification of the treaty,
and should not the Bill so provide? It
seems to me a rather peculiar step to take
-to make provision for appointments,
establishing offices, passing Orders in
Council, and doing ail. other things necessary to the c.arrying out of the treaty, if
~itis not an effective instrument.
lion. Mr. DANDL'RAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will ask
that this debate be adjourned, and after
recess I will have the proper information.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
My
recollection is that in the case of former
treaties growing out of the Treaty of
Peace, the Government of Canada signed
them and we afterwards ratified them.
That is to say, effect was given to themn
and we approved by statute of what was
done. It seems to me that that would be
the better course to pursue in this case.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Both of these treaties have really been
signed by us and by Great Britain. I
imagine the difficulty arises in this respect:
the Treaty was with the Turkish Government, but there is an imperium in imperio
in Turkey and ratification bas not been
irade because of the Kemalites.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will get the
information and have it after the sitting
is resumed.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.
TRENTON HARBOUR BILL
SECON D READING,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of B.Ill 204, an Act respecting the Harbour of Trenton, in the Province of Ontario.
He said: This Bill creates a Harbour
Commission for the harbour of Trenton.
It provides:
The mnayor of the town of Trenton, for the
time being, and two persons appointed from
time to timne by the Governor in Council, shall
be commissioners under this Act to have the
superintendence of the harbour and harbour
master of the port of Trenton, under the titie
of "The Trenton Harbour Commissioners."

A harbour master is to 'be appointed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Who is
going to pay?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not intend to make ýany serious objection to this
proposaI, but I would point out one or two
things that are, 1 think, of doubtful wisdom. Having taken some part in the debate on another harbour matter, I cannot
let this Bill pass without voicing my views
upon it.
Trenton is located at the outiet of the
Trent canal into Lake Ontario. A request
is made for the establishment of a Harbour Clommission at this point, where the
volume of traffic by rvater -is small ns
compared with that of many ports in the

JUNE 27, 1922
Great Lakes where Harbour Commissions
do not exist. What I desire to point out to
the Government is that if a Harbour Commission is once established, with the Mayor
of the municipality or other local gentlemen drawing a amaîl salary supposed to be
earned by fees collected, it drifts in a few
years' time into a tharbour commission
maintained as are the commissions of many
of our large harbours to-day, and that if
this legisiation is passed and a Harbour
Commission is constituted at a small port,
where very littie business is done and only
a small sum can be collected in fees, encouragement will be given to the people of
many other ports, where more business is
done, to corne forward and ask for similar
consideration.
Furthermore, it is proposed by this Bill
that the Harbour Board of the town of
Trenton shahl col.iect fees-on what? For
instance, on railway ties, logs, telegraph
poles, etc., that have floated down the Trent
for perhaps 100 miles. Before they can
pass through that municipality and get
into Lake Ontario, toll must be paid on
them to the Harbour Commission of the
town of Trenton, although the goods did
flot originate there and are not destined
there. I think that is a very objectionable
feature of the Bill.
At this late hour I do not intend moving
any amendment, but I would call the attention of the Government to these two matters that are worthy of consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But ii they
are worthy of consideration, they would
perhaps justify suspending the action of
It is for honourable memParliament.
bers who possess knowledge of the local
situation to inforni this Chamber. Personally I know littie of this proposai.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
gentlemen, I do not think this is an entirely new departure. There is already a harbour at Belleville, which is not f ar from
Trenton. While Belleville may be somewhat larger, its volume of shipping is no
greater. My understanding of this proposai is that the people of Trenton are not
asking for any Government aid: they are
asking to be authorized to organize this
Harbour Commission so that they may be
in a position to collect fees froni their harbour and maintain it properhy.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that
the House go into Committee on this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Move the third
reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have indicated the purpose of the Bill. Shall we
go into Committee or give it the third
reading?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: You may proceed with it, so far as I amn concerned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If there is no
objection to the various clauses, I move
the third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.
HOUSE 0F COMMONS HANSARD,
FRENCH VERSION
REPORT

0F COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN moved concurrence in the third report of the Standing
Committee on Debates and Reporting.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think some explanation ought to be given. This is a
rather unusual kind of report. Probably
most of the members have not read it or
do not know what it contains.
The ConiHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mittee recommends:
1. That for future sessions the number of the
unrevised edition of the flouse of Commons
Hansard, French version, for distribution to
Senators through the Senate post office, be increased by two hundred.
2. That in addition to the present distribution
of the bound volumes of the flouse et Commons,
French version, one hundred addltional copies
of the said volumes be available for distribution
under the direction of the Chairman of the Coinmlttee.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I
understand, it places the Senate on a parity with the House of Commons in this
respect. Members of the House of Gommons, I understand, are entitled to both
French and English editions of Hansard.
Members of the Senate are not. The purpose of this is to permit of members of the
Senate who desire the French version receiving it.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But this would do
more. I think the number of English
copies is 125. This report recommenda
225 French copies to 125 Engiish.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I really believe
that if we can in any way spread in our
Province a knowledge of what is going on

SENATE

Ib

in Parliament it will be a good thing. The
cost is very little.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: If the number of
English copies is 125, I do not see why the
number of the French copies should be
more than that.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Make them equal.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Why should the
Senate ask for more copies of the French
Hansard than of the English?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: This report recommends that we obtain 200 more copies
of the French version. I do not know of
any reason why there could not be an equal
number of copies in English.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Was the honourable gentleman present at the Committee meeting when this matter was decided?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, I was not.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Better leave this.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend points out that there is a lesser
number of English copies. I think we
should be fair. Why should we double the
number of French copies?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
can obtain information from the Chairman
of the Committee between now and 8
o'clock, and we may take up this matter
agan.
The motion stands.

and disposal of canteen funds; for the repatriation of ex-members of the forces discharged in
England and their dependents and relief for
distressed ex-members of the forces in the
United Kingdom; for the treatment of former
members of the forces classified as wholly incurable or chronically recurrent cases needing
institutional care; for the provision of measures
of unemployment relief to ex-members of the
forces and their dependents; and for the payment of compensation in respect of industrial
accidents and the return of premiums paid by
employers of ex-members of the forces to Workmen's Compensation Boards; the whole subject
to such appropriations as Parliament may provide.

BANKRUPTCY BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS

AGREED TO

The Senate proceeded to consider a message from the House of Commons returning Bill 107, an Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act, and informing the Senate that
that House had concurred in the first,
second, third, fourth and fifth amendments
and in clauses 10, 11 and 13 of the sixth
amendment; that they had made a consequential amendment to section 12 in
amendment No. 6 by striking out the word
"majority" in line 39, page 5, of the Bill
as reprinted, and substituting therefor the
word "two-thirds"; and that they did not
concur in section 14 of amendment No. 6
because it tended to destroy the effect of
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) will explain those amendments.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The substitution of
the word "two-thirds" is intended to cover
an oversight; so there can be no objection
to that.
As regards clause 14, I fail to see any
reason for the objection of the House of
Commons to that clause; but the elimination of it will not affect the Bill at all. It
was merely for the purpose of providing
that the sale of the property should have
the effect of a sheriff's sale. Without this
clause it will have practically the same
effect.
I move that this House agree to the
amendments made by the House of Commons.
The motion was agreed to.

for the preservation of the general peace and

their insular possessions and insular dominions
in the region of the Pacifie Ocean(and the accompanying Declaration), and the Agreement
between the same Powers supplementary therete, which Treaty and Agreement were signed at
Washington on the thirteenth day of December,
nineteen hundred and twenty-one, and on the
sixth day of February, nineteen hundred and

do approve of the same.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, there
appears in my name a resolution for the
approval by this Chamber of seven Treaties
that were signed in Washington on the 6th
of February last. The first treaty is one
between the United States of America, the
British Empire, France, Italy and Japan,
and is for the purpose of limiting naval
armaments.
We will all agree that it was a happy
thought that moved the President of the
republic to the south of us to call to Washington a Conference with the primary object of arranging for a treaty between the
nations that were interested in the maintenance of peace on the Pacifie Ocean. The
Treaty which is before us contains an admirable principle in international relations
-that of co-operation. Mr. Woodrow Wilson, on a visit to England, used the cryptie
phrase that together the Allies had won
the war, and only together could they win
the peace. If that was a good principle
for the five Powers that signed this Treaty
in trying to establish peace on the Pacifie
on a permanent basis it seems that it is a
principle that could as well be applied to all
the Allies -and if it were extended to all
the Allies, it would truly be a league of
nations.
This first step in the application of prin-ciples to be found in this Teaty of Peace
may be of untold benefit. If the principle
embodied, in the Treaty now before us for
review develops and fructifies-if it enters
into the traditions of the people-it may
help to create a better world in which to
live, a world of nations which, having no
formidable weapons, may become one, a
world where peace may have a chance to
reign.
The dream of aggrandizement which
nourishes imperialism, based as it is on
unavowed human weakness and covetousress which are called megalomania, would
thus be curbed and would soon vanish. If
imperialism is strongly armed it will try
to extend territorially and commercially by
brute force. That bas been the tradition
and the way of imperialism througiout all
the ages.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The second treaty adopts rules for the
protection of neutrals, and non-combatants at sea. Article 5 prohibits the use of
nsphyxiating, poisonous, or other gases.
After nineteen centuries of Christianity we
must prohibit between men what would
seem more fit for the wild and ferocious
animals of the jungle.
The third treaty concerns China, which
other nations having the might, have often
invaded and preyed upon in divers ways.
The signatories to the treaty agree to
respect the sovereignty, the independence,
and the territorial and administrative integrity of China; they agree to apply the
principle of the "open door", or equality of
opportunity, to all nations for trade in
China. This shows to what an extent trade
plays a part in the maintenance of peace.
The "open door" throughout the world
would remove nine-tenths of the causes of
war; free trade all around would be a most
potent factor for peace.
The fifth Treaty is between the United
States, the British Empire, France, and
Japan. These powers agree between themselves to respect each other's rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacifie
ocean. This agreement is to continue in
force for ten years, and to be subject thereafter to twelve months' notice. It imposes
no military obligations. In cases of difference the parties to the Treaty agree to
conference.
This will undoubtedly make
for amicable settlement.
Canada is most vitally interested in these
treaties concerning the Pacifie ocean. If
peace is thus established and secured between the United States and Japan, it will
mean that the thought of peace will permeate the minds of Americans and Japanese, and that the trade of the warmongers and the newspapers preaching the
" yellow-peril," will come to an end. If
these two treaties which ensure peace in
the Pacifie ocean are held to be a blessing
by the many nations that dwell on the
Pacifie, why should not the United States,
which stretches to the Atlantic, join in a
similar treaty for the maintenance of
peace on that great ocean, and enter into
an agreement that, if any differences
arose there, they should be settled by conference. It is my firm conviction that
peace on the Atlantic could be secured forever by such an agreement.
The sixth treaty is a -short one. It contains a reservation by the United States
as to the mandated islands in the Pacifie,
and as to its rights to negotiate with the

JUNE 27, 1922
mandatory Powers in relation to the said
islands.
The seventh treaty adds a clause to the
Peace Treaty of the Pacific. Some islands
are excluded from the scope of the treaty
at the request of the United States and
Japan.
I think that this work, which was carried
on and brought to a successful. conclusion
at Washington, will mark an epoch in the
history of the world. I was happy to
learn that Canada was officially represented at that Conference, and I must congratulate the Dominion upon having had
as her representative the Right Honourable
Sir Robert Borden, a gentleman who had
the necessary qualifications to assert our
interests, and to meet on equal terms with
the representatives of other nations.
I have pleasure in proposing the ratification of these treaties, seconded by Hon.
Mr. Belcourt.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I desire to eupport
the motion which has been made by my
honourable friend opposite, who represents
the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
and seconded by the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt).
It is probably not necessary for either the
leader of the Government or myself to
spend very much time In adding to the information already possessed by members of
this Chamber. We all followed with a
great deal of interest the formation of this
Conference at Washington, and the mode
of operation which was adopted there. We
have all been advised more or less fully of
the results of the Conference, as seen in
the treaties which were framed and which
have been .alluded to by my honourable
friend. This being so, it is not at all, necessary to go into the details of the Treaties.
What strikes one first in regard to the
results of that Conference, is, I think, the
great onward step taken by the United
States, one of the greatest Powers of the
world, towards the elimination, as far as it
can possibly be done by agreement between
the Powers, of the causes of destruction,
which, if not eliminated, might result in
great wars, or a repetition in part at least
of what we have already gone through. It
was therefore encouraging to every lover
of peace, and to that extent discouraging
to every lover of the old system of war,
to see so great a nation as the United
States throw her influence in the balance
on the side of peace. That, I think, is one
of the greatest results which has accrued.

It has given heart to all friends of peace,
and it bas taught all enemies of the new
methods of settling international disputes
that they are up against the great moral
influence of the British peoples in this contest which is going on between the old
methods and the new. It bas strengthened
every adherent of the League of Nations,
because the influence and example of the
United States seems at this moment to
have been, if not necessary, yet very useful in bringing the fifty-one nations who
belong to the League of Nations to a realization of the fact that the United States,
though not a member of the League, is
still marching along step by step with the
cardinal principles and the main ideas of
the League. We may have different views
as to just how the ultimate peace of the
world is to be brought about; -but it is a
great thing to have removed a prejudice or
a presumption that the United States, by
holding herself aloof from active union
with the League, was not in sympathy with
the principles of the League. That idea
cannot have any further existence.
The other great thing that bas happened
through that Conference is that the United
States of America bas removed a very
great obstacle from one of the cardinal
principles and aims of the League, namely, the diminution of armaments. That
was especially stressed in the programme
of the League of Nations as set forth in
the Covenant; but the practical difficulties were impossible of being surmounted,
and the problem was insoluble so long as
the United States remained outside of the
League of Nations and at the same time
did not give her views and indicate her
position with reference to the diminution
of armaments. Take naval armaments,
for instance. That was the difficulty that
faced the League of Nations in all its
Council meetings and in the two Assemblies which have already taken place. How
was it possible to carry out disarmament
under the existing circumstances, when the
United States had proclaimed and put into
process of construction a naval scheme
which, when carried to its fulfillment a
few years hence, would make ber fleet the
most powerful in the wide world? It was
impossible then that Britain or France
or Italy or Japan could consent to disarmamer& or the diminution of their naval
forces unless they knew what would be the
sentiment and the action of the United
States. That was all cleared up at Washington, and the remarkably practical,
clear, and courageous plan which was

SENATE

720

placed before the Conference, and which
gained at once the assent of Great Britain
and Italy, and to a large extent the assent
of France as well-that proposition had
behind it the 110 millions of people in the
Republic. It was carried to a successful
conclusion. It set the pace with respect
to naval diminution and bas taught the
lesson that on the whole question of possible disarmament the United States is in
perfect accord with all the other peaceloving nations of the world.
There is one further advantage which
ought not to be underrated, and that is
the position taken by those Powers in
Washington towards China, that great,
widely distributed, immensely populated
country on the Asiatie coast, which has
been torn asunder now for five or six
years; which had been previously a prey to
national exploiters and adventurers and
had suffered-perhaps unavoidably at that
time-from the interference of greater and
more powerful nations than herself, from
almost every quarter of the globe. The
expression of friendly feeling which was
made at Washington and was a notable
feature of that Conference, bas heartened
China and has cleared away a great many
of those difficulties without the clearing
away of which China, in the near or the
more remote future, as she healed ber domestie differences, would have found it hard
to make the progress which is to my mind
ber due. No one who visits China and travels
through it, as I have had the opportunity
and privilege of doing, comes out after his
short or longer journey in that immense
continent, without having been impressed
with its wealth of human labour, patient,
diligent, docile, and intelligent as well;
with its resources as great as, possibly
greater than, those of almost any other
country in the world; with the long line
of traditions and history behind it-traditions which in many respects have been
noble and elevating; and a history in
science and in literature which might well
be envied by many other nations. That
vast conglomeration of peoples, though
lightly held together by the ties of actual
national loyalty, is unconquerable. Foreign
Powers have not conquered it in the way
of assimilating themselves in China up to
the present time. The visitor to China is
impressed with its vast possibilitie and the
effect they may have upon the world. I do
not doubt that the problems of China have
been brought considerably nearer to a
solution and its possibilities to development by the action which was taken at
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

Washington by the consent of the different
Powers.
On the Pacifie Ocean, Japan and China
will continue to be the two great powers.
With the wonderful later development of
Japan, with her versatility, with the
strong cement of nationality that binds
her people together, with her quick and
easy adaptation of improved and western
methods of civilization and of industry,
and with the firm position that she holds
there to-day, with an army strong and
well disciplined and a navy large, powerful and modern, it is quite within the
range of what is natural and right that
Japan should have a commanding position
on the Pacific. Just opposite to ber is
ber great, big, sprawling neighbour, not
yet brought into unity and compactness of
force, not yet welded by a strong feeling
of national unity. She ought not to be a
prey to a superior menace, or, what would
be still worse, a prey to active and propagandist efforts on the part of ber neighbour. It is of interest to the world, I
think, that those two nations should remain together in a position of great
strength on the Pacifie Ocean-as neighbours, not as enemies; yet as two distinct
civilizations, each powerful and strong in
itself, and without that kind of combination which would make them a strong inimical force, possibly, in the development
of the world as a whole.
The sympathy and the spirit and the
trust and confidence that were shown at
Washington by the other great nations of
the world with regard to the future of
China, and the respect which was shown
to the national development of Japan, will
have a steadying and stimulating effect;
stimulating to the Chinese and steadying to
the Japanese nation. That force, mingled
as it has been, and expressed and put into
active running channels, will have a mighty
influence in preserving peace on the Pacifie
Ocean.
If peace can be preserved on the Pacifie
Ocean, and on the Atlantic seaboard and
in Europe, and if we can get back to the
love of peace and in due time. the practice
of it as well as the theoretical assertion of it,
there is a bright prospect for the future of
the world. The forces of war will gradually
diminish before the forces of peace. There
will be a grand unity of sentiment and
desire among the great, forward nations
of the world, and an actual working
towards the common purpose. There is a
silver lining to the cloud of unrest and
discontent and disorder which hangs over

Hon.

Mr. ROCHE.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
I do net think there is much necessity for
a lengthy explanation of these protocols,
which are simply amendments, made at the
last Assembly of the League of Nations at
Geneva, in order te get over certain difficulties of procedure. They deal with procedure entirely. They do net touch any
vital principie of the Cevenant; they are
intended simply te make the procedure of
the Assembiy more definite and more practicai than it is at the present time. The
Articles whjch are amended are Articles
4, 6, 12, 13, 15 and 26.
Article 4 of the Covenant of the League,
ia one of its clauses, deals witb the duties
of the Council, and provides for the appeintment of four members of the Council
representing the four great nations. The
other four members of the Council are te be
elected hy the Asscmbly itself.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I thought there

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

the United States did net corne, there are

these four members are te ho elected hy the

by wbich those elections are te be carried
out; cunsequently the Assemhly fouad itself

When ratifications to the requisite number
have been received, the amendment to the
Covenant goes into force.
Twenty-two
months are given as the time limit during
which members of the League may ratify,
if they have not ratified within that time,
the amendment falls. Any members that
do not ratify after the twenty-two months
are notified, and given one year more in
which to assent. If they do not assent
within a year, they cease to be members of
the League.
There were amendments included in the
protocols of Article 16, which has to do
with the economie force in relation to the
bringing to bear of influence to prevent
war and to perpetuate peace. It is not
proposed at the present time to ratify
these protocols; both Great Britain and
France have asked that they be left over
until another meeting of the Assembly.
Consequently, it is not necessary for us to
.take those up at the present time.
As I have said, the amendments that it
is proposed to ratify are eminently practical, having to do entirely with methods
of procedure.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: At first it was
desired that five of the great
Powers
should have a majority in the Council, and
the United States not joining, only four
were left. Were not four more then
elected in a group-for instance, Spain,
Holland, Denmark, and another countryand did they not elect one man?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How were the
first four elected?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The first four were appointed by the four
great 4owers. The first election was at
the first Assembly of the League of Nations.
Every delegate to the League of
Nations wrote the name of a candidate
upon his ballot paper, and deposited his
vote in the box. The votes were counted
afterwards by the tellers or scrutineers,
and the results were announced by the
President. The members were not elected
by groups at all: they were elected by
the individual votes placed, as I have
stated, in the urn by the chief of each
delegation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask another question? Canada bas been paying
$200,000 a year up to the present time;
South Africa has been paying about a
quarter of that amount. Will the right

any difference in the value of the vote of
the one or the other? I mean to say, has
Canada any more power in the Assembly
than South Africa?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
As I explained before in this Chamber, this
is a particularly democratic League. The
smallest country belonging to the League
bas one vote and the largest country belonging to the League has one vote; and
the representatives of the smaller countries
as well as those of the larger countries
have an equal freedom and an equal right
to express their opinions on the floor of
the Assembly. A greater influence naturally inheres in the Power which occupies
the strongest position in the \vorld, and
the position which it occupies in respect to
the calibre and the adaptability of its delegation. The same is true of all bodies.
Whilst you may have a hundred members,
eaeh with one vote, there may be very different degrees of influence exercised upon
the assembly by the different members.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting was resumed.
CONFERENCE OF THE TWO HOUSES
CANADA TEMPERANCE BILL AND CANCELLATION OF LEASES OF DOMINION
LANDS BILL

The Hon. The SPEAKER presented a
message fron the House of Commons requesting a free conference with the Senate
to consider certain amendments made by
the Senate to Bill No. 132, an Act to
amend the Canada Temperance Act, to
whieh amendments the House of Commons
bas not agreed, and upon which the Senate
insists; and to ýconsider also any amendment which at such conference it may be
considered desirable to make to the said
Bill or amendments thereto.
The Hon. The SPEAKER presented another message from the louse of Commons
requesting a free conference with the Senate to consider the reasons for the House
of Commons insisting upon its amendments
to Bill No. 153 (Letter Y2 of the Senate)
intituled "An Act respecting Notices of
Cancellation of Leases of Dominion Lands,"
and to consider also any amendment which,
at such conference, it may be desirable to

The readjustment of the Customs Tariff, to
the consideration of which much time bas been
given, will, it is hoped, meet in a considerable
degree the desire for tariff revision, while not
creating any serious disturbance of industrial
conditions.
The attention given to the question of transportation costs, the recommendations of the
special committee of the House of Commons
which bas so fully lnvestigated the whole problem, and the resultant legislation, will effect
immediate substantial reduction of freight
rates in a mannelr which cannot fail to be of farreaching benefit to all parts of the Dominion.
The measures passed to aid or control the
marketing of certain farm products, and the
manufacture, marking, and sale of fertilizers;
for the expansion of cold storage facilities, and
for further experimental and research work in
the control of fruit diseases and the eradication
of bovine tuberculosis, should prove of substantial service in the development of the grain, live
stock, dairying, and fruit production industries
of the country, and in further protection against
their natural foes.
Pursuant to representations made on behalf
of the prairie provinces, legislation has been
adopted for the re-establishment of a Wheat
Board, which it is hoped will meet the desire for
a more equitable method of marketing Canadian
wheat.
The special committee of the House of Commons appointed to examine into the questions
and problems related to the welfare of soldiers
and their dependents bas submitted many usefui and important recommendations on pensions,
insurance, land settlement, sheltered employment, and other aspects of re-establishment,
which, together with the legislation based thereon, should do much to ensure the fulfilment of
the just and patriotie purposes these measures
are intended to serve.
The co-ordination, under one ministerial head,
of the defence forces of Canada, in a single department of National Defence, is certain to increase efficiency, and at the same time effect
a much-needed economy in these branches of
the national service.
By amendment to the election laws, full freedom of the franchise has been secured for additional thousands of Canadian women. Important
temperance legislation has also been placed upon
the statutes.
Substantial progress has been made in the
negotiations which have taken place with respect to granting the control of the natural resources of the three western provinces to their
respective provincial governments.
It is gratifying to observe that the depression
of business is gradually becoming relieved, and
that unemployment throughout the Dominion
has correspondingly decreased. The conference

Members of the House of Commons:
In view of the approval you have given to

I humbly thank Divine Providence for the

pray that when Parliament reassembles, the
prospects, at present so bright, will have been
realized in all parts of the Dominion.
