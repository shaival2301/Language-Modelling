Sir,
1 have the honour to informn you that His
Exceflency the Governor General will arrive at the

it has been signlfied that ail la in readlness, will
proceed to the Senate Chamber to open the
Special Session of the Twenty-Second Parliament
of Canada, whieh has been called for that date.
I have the honour to be,

Your obedient servant,
LIONEL MASSEY,
Secretary to the Governor General.

The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon, W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, first let me say how pleased I amn
to see so many honourable senators in attendance today and looking in the best of health
and spirits. We did flot expect to return to
Ottawa before the regular session in January,
but international affairs have made it necessary that we meet at this time to consider
certain legisiation affecting world events.
We shall hear more of this when the Speech
from the Throne is read this afternoon.
The Senate is assembling this morning in
accordance with its customa of meeting before
the formai opening of Parliament in order to
81541-1

dispose of routine proceedings. We shall reassemble at 2.15 this afternoon, and in the
meantirne the doors will be open and the
public wiIl be admitted to the gallery.
I have had a discussion with the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig); and
the tentative plan for the business of the
house is as follows. At 2.30, as we have
heard from the Honourable the Speaker, the
Governor General will read the Speech from
the Throne. Thereafter there will be the
usual business of the house-the presenting
of a pro forma bill, and motions.
Honourable senators will recail that unfortunately during the period of prorogation
we have lost five of our members. We feel
that our flrst order of business should be a
reference to these members; and the Leader
of the Opposition and I are suggesting that
that should take place th.ts afternoon, after
the Speech from the Throne has been read
and a decision has been made as to when the
debate on the speech shail be proceeded with.
It is not the intention-although this is
merely a tentative arrangement-to proceed
this afternoon with consideration of the
Speech from. the Throne. The Leader of the
Opposition and I thought that it would be
better to postpone this until tomorrow. So
the arrangement for today is that, after the
reference to our deceased members, we shall
adjourn, to meet tomorrow afternoon, probably at 3 o'clock, to proceed with consideration of the Speech from the Throne.
I therefore propose that we now rise, to
reassemble at the caîl of the bell, at approximately 2.15 this afternoon.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The Senate met at 2.15 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At 2.30 p.m. His Excellency the Governor
General proceeded to the Senate chamber and
took his seat upon the Throne. His Excellency
was pleased to command the attendance of
the House of Commons, and, that House being come, with their Speaker, His Excellency
was pleased to open the Fourth (Special)

Canada with the following speech:

DECEASED SENATORS
TRIBUTES TO THE LATE SENATORS HACKETT,
GODBOUT, STEVENSON, ROSS AND PIRIE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, since we last met in this chamber
five of our colleagues have been called to
the Great Beyond. Some of them had been
in the Senate for many years, others for much
shorter periods. In fact, one had been a senator just slightly longer than one year. The
senators who passed away were not our oldest
members, nor were they the youngest; they
were of various ages.
Senator John Thomas Hackett died on the
15th of September, at the age of 72.
Senator Joseph Adélard Godbout died on
the 18th of September, at the age of 63.
Senator John James Stevenson died on the
21st of September, at the age of 84.
From the dates which I have mentioned
you will notice that three of our colleagues
died within one week.
Senator John Henry Ross died on the 26th
of September, at the age of 78.
Senator Frederick William Pirie died on
the 3rd of October, at the age of 63.
We lost five senators in less than three
weeks' time. Some of them had been in comparatively good health immediately prior to
their death, while at least one had been in
failing health for some time; all of which
goes to show that:
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea
And rides upon the storn.

May I refer to our deceased honourable
colleagues in the order in which they passed
away?
The Honourable John Thomas Hackett, who
died on the 15th September, was born on
June 12, 1884, at Stanstead, in the province
of Quebec, the son of Mr. Justice M. F.
Hackett and Florence Knight Hackett. Senator Hackett, you will recall, appeared to be
in excellent health and in exceedingly high
spirits when Parliament was prorogued, in
the middle of August; in fact I recali that
the last day he was here he said that the
year he had spent in the Senate had been one
of the happiest years of his life. He seemed to
enjoy greatly his work here; and I know that
we all enjoyed having him as one of our
colleagues.
Senator Hackett was educated at St.
Charles Seminary, Sherbrooke, Quebec; at
Loyola College, Montreal, where he received
the degree of Bachelor of Laws, and at McGill University, where he obtained the degree
of Bachelor of Civil Law. He received many
81541--1

honours which were the mingled expression
of respect and affection. Among these honours
was the degree of LL.D. honoris causa from
McGill University, the University of Montreal
and St. Francis Xavier University. As you
all know, he was an eminent lawyer who
acted as counsel in many of the most important and difficult cases which came before
the courts. Shortly after being called to the
bar his young associates of that day elected
him President of the Junior Bar Association.
This was in 1919. Approximately twentyeight years later, in 1947, his associates of
that day elected him President of the Canadian Bar Association. In the year immediately previous to his election to that
important appointment he had held the high
honour of Batonnier of the Bar of Montreal.
Subsequently he was made an honorary member of the American Bar Association, the
International Bar Association, the American
Judicature Society, and the American Society
of International Law.
Senator Hackett was a member and officer
from time to time of many welfare societies
and organizations which were set up to recognize and encourage the cultural aspect of
Canadian life.
In politics he was a Conservative but he
had many friends of the opposite political
faith, amongst whom was our present Prime
Minister, who along with himself had enjoyed
a distinguished career in law.
Senator
Hackett contested the general election in
Stanstead County in 1925, but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, he was successful in 1930
and he sat in the House of Commons as the
member for Stanstead from 1930 to 1935. In
1945 he was again elected in the County of
Stanstead and sat in the House of Commons
until 1949.
It is interesting to note that in preConfederation days his grandfather, Albert
Knight, represented Stanstead, and that the
senator's father, the Honourable Mr. Justice
M. F. Hackett, was elected for the same constituency on three occasions.
Senator Hackett was summoned to the
Senate of Canada on July 28, 1955, and was
therefore with us as a colleague for just a
little more than one year. He took a great
interest in all the work of the Senate, and
seemed to enjoy his work here amidst new
surroundings. We enjoyed having him with
us. In his passing we have lost one of our
outstanding members, and Canada has lost a
distinguished lawyer and politician who, in
almost half a century of public life, became
one of Canada's foremost advocates of racial
tolerance. But the greatest loss will be that
suffered by his widow, his son and two
daughters, to whom we extend our deep
sympathy.

SENATE
May I now refer to the Honourable Joseph
Adélard Godbout. He was born on September 24, 1892, at St. Eloi, Quebec, the son of
Eugène Godbout, who was a member of the
Legislature for Témiscouata from 1919 until
1923. Senator Godbout was in comparatively
good health when we last saw him in August,
and he passed away very suddenly.
Our late colleague had taken the course in
classics at Rimouski Seminary in his early
days but his great interest was in agriculture.
He was truly a cultured Canadian.
He
attended the Agricultural College at Ste. Anne
de la Pocatière, and took further courses in
agriculture at the Agricultural Colleges of
Massachusetts and of Cornell, and finally at
Cornell University.
In 1929 he was first elected to the Legislature of Quebec for the County of L'Islet, and
in 1930 he entered the Government of Premier
Alexander Taschereau as Minister of Agriculture. He held this portfolio until 1936,
when he succeeded Mr. Taschereau as
Premier of the province. At the ensuing
elections in the same year his Government
was defeated, but he retained his seat in the
county. In the provincial elections of 1939
his Government was again returned to office,
and once again he became Prime Minister.
Not only did he carry on the onerous duties
of Premier, but he also held the portfolios of
Agriculture and of Colonization. In 1944 his
Government was once again defeated, but he
continued as Leader of the Opposition until
the elections of 1948. At that time he was
not returned for his constituency. He was
appointed to the Senate on June 25, 1949.
Senator Godbout was honoured by a great
number of scientific institutions. In 1929 he
was President of the Association of Canadian
Agronomists; in 1933, President of the Association of Agricultural Technicians of Canada;
and also commandeur de l'Ordre du Mérite
agricole de la province de Québec, commandeur de l'Ordre du Mérite agricole de
France; Docteur ès sciences agricoles des universités Laval et de Montréal; Doctor of Laws,
honoris causa, McGill University, Bishop's
College, and Massachusetts State College;
Doctor of Veterinary Science, honoris causa,
University of Montreal, and honorary professor at the Faculty of Agriculture of Laval
University.
During his term of office as Premier of
Quebec the Honourable Adélard Godbout was
responsible for enacting many important bills,
probably one of the most important being the
statute which gave the vote to women in the
province. Legislation was also passed giving
free education and text books in public
schools. When his Government was in office
the Montreal Light, Heat and Power Company

came under public ownership, and in 1944 an
important piece of legislation was passed,
namely, the Labour Relations Act.
Senator Godbout is survived by his widow,
two sons and three daughters. In expressing
our sympathy to them, I thought I might do
so in his native tongue, for although Senator
Godbout was one of Canada's greatest orators in both English and French, I am told
that he excelled himself in French. May I
therefore close my tribute to him in the
following words.
(Translation):
In the person of Senator Godbout, I have
lost a personal friend, a very dear colleague
and a fellow citizen for whom I had the
greatest esteem and admiration. Mr. Godbout's reputation as a gentleman was well
deserved; his courtesy and moderation were
well known. Equally well deserved was the
reputation he had earned generally of being
an ardent defender of national unity. At all
times he was essentially a man of principle,
a man of duty, and he did not hesitate, in the
most difficult hours of his public life, to place
the interests of his country above personal,
local or party considerations.
I have already expressed my deep sympathy
to Mr. Godbout's family, and I feel sure that
my colleagues in this chamber would wish
to join with me in paying this public tribute
to his memory.
(Text):
I refer next to the Honourable John James
Stevenson, who was born on May 11, 1872,
at Russell, Ontario, of Scottish and Irish
parentage, and received his education at
Russell and Ottawa.
Senator Stevenson spent the first 21 years
of his life in Ottawa, with the Edwards Lumber Company, but in the early 1900's he left
Ottawa and went to western Canada, where
he established his own lumber firm, at Tyvan.
Arriving at Tyvan, he immediately took a
great interest in the community life of the
district, and shortly thereafter was elected
to the Legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan for Francis constituency. He then
left Tyvan and moved to Eston, Saskatchewan. He took a great interest in that
community also, and after living there for
a short time he was elected once again to the
Legislature of Saskatchewan. Some years
later he moved to Regina, where he took
up residence. In 1940 he was appointed to
the Senate, and since then he spent most of
his time in Ottawa, while still maintaining
a residence in Saskatchewan.
Senator Stevenson was indeed one of our
western pioneers. He had an extensive
knowledge of farming, business and social

NOVEMBER 26, 1956
conditions in western Canada. He had heeded
the advice of Sir Wilfrid Laurier: "Go west,
young man, go west." He went west, and
made good, and although he lived for the
last 25 years in Ottawa he never lost interest
in western Canada, and spent a part of each
of those years out there. He had a host of
friends in the west, and he was admired and
respected by them all. He was indeed a friend
in need, and I am told that during the 1930's
he lent a helping hand to many of his old
friends who needed help during those difficult days.
Senator Stevenson took a great interest in
the work of the Senate, more particularly in
that of the Divorce Committee, of which he
was long a most faithful member, until illness
prevented him from continuing his activities.
Senator Stevenson's wife predeceased him
in 1955. He leaves to mourn his loss one
daughter, three sons and seven grandchildren,
to all of whom we extend our very deep
sympathy.
Honourable senators, I now refer to the
Honourable George Henry Ross, who died
on September 26 last at the age of 78 years.
Senator Ross was born on the 13th day of
June, 1878, at Bedeque, in the province of
Prince Edward Island. He was educated at
the University of Michigan, where he received the degree of LL.B. While a young
man he also heeded the advice of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and went west. He went to western
Canada for the purpose of earning enough
money to study law. In his early days there
he was employed as a cowboy. He rode the
ranches of the west, and I am told he was
one of the most skillful cowboys of his day.
Senator Ross later became a barrister and
solicitor, and had an eminently successful
career in his chosen profession. He was created a King's Counsel in 1913, and had,
therefore, at the time of his death held that
distinction for 43 years. He was also recognized by members of his profession by being
elected and re-elected on several occasions
a Bencher of the Law Society of Alberta,
and on more than one occasion he was President of the Law Society of the city of
Calgary. Throughout his life he took a great
interest in the welfare and training of our
youth, and for a number of years was a
member of the Senate of the University of
Alberta.
In 1913, while still a young man, Senator
Ross offered himself as a candidate for the
Legislature of Alberta, but was unsuccessful;
nevertheless, 27 years later, in 1940, he was
elected to the House of Commons for the
constituency of Calgary North. With one
exception, he was the only Liberal who has
ever been elected in that constituency since
it was created, in 1903.

Our late colleague was summoned to the
Senate on December 1, 1948, and in the
years since then he took a keen interest
in all the work which came before this body.
He faithfully attended most of the committees, and was a very valuable member
of the Standing Committee on Divorce, of
which, I am informed, he headed a subcommittee.
Senator Ross was married in 1911, and is
survived by his widow and two daughters,
to whom we extend our very deep sympathy.
The last of our members to pass away
during the recess was the Honourable
Frederick William Pirie, who died on October 3, at the age of 63 years. He was born
in 1893, at Red Rapids, Victoria County,
New Brunswick. He attended the Grand
Falls public schools and Mount Allison University, where he received the honourary
degree of LL.D.
Senator Pirie took a great interest in the
development of his province, in which he
had many business interests. He was a director of the Maritime Trust Company, the
Maritime Insurance Company and the Canada Cement Company. At the time of his
death he was President of his own company,
the F. W. Pirie Company Limited, Grand
Falls, and also of the Atlantic Chemical
Company. I think it can be said that he
was one of the most sucessfull businessmen
in the Maritime provinces, and a consistent
advocate of Maritime rights. He assisted in
the development of trade with the West
Indies, the United States and other parts
of the world, particularly in agricultural
products.
Senator Pirie throughout his life had been
keenly interested in politics, and was elected
to the Legislature of his native province in
four consecutive elections, namely, 1930,
1935, 1939 and 1944. After the 1935 election
he entered the Dysart government as Minister of Lands and Mines. In 1945 he was
summoned to the Senate, and he took an
active part in the work of this assembly.
Senator Pirie leaves to mourn his loss his
widow and four children, to whom we extend
our deepest sympathy.
Honourable senators, I have referred briefly
to our five colleagues who have passed
away. Every one of them was faithful to
his task on this earth, to his country, his
family and his church. I am sure each has
now heard the words:
Well done, thou good and faithful servant
Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I may not refer to our departed colleagues
in the order which my friend the Leader of
the Governixent (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has

SENATE
followed. However, I would thank him on
behalf of all of us for the able and complete
reference he has made to these gentlemen
whom we all knew so well.
I am reminded, as always at a time such
as this, that it is a little more difficult for
the Opposition leader who is the second
speaker to make full reference to those who
have passed on, because the historical facts
have already been enumerated. And there
are many notable things to be said about our
departed colleagues, all of whom have had
outstanding lives. One reason why we think
so much of the Senate is that it is made up
of men and women of wide ability and experience, which they bring to the work of
this chamber. The members of this house
represent a breadth of knowledge and experience not possessed by any other body in
this country. That was particularly true of
the men whom we are speaking about this
afternoon.
I first want to say a word or two about
Senator Hackett. Naturally I liked John
Hackett. Soon after he came here he and I
had quite a discussion upstairs about our
names. I mentioned that I did not like my second name and he said, "That is an insult to
me." I asked, "How do you make that out?"
He replied, "That is my second name". I then
said, "Well, let me have your first name, and
I will give you my second name in return,
so we will be fifty-fifty."
John Hackett was the type of man whom
Canadians admire. They will always remember him for the great contribution that he
made to the progress of this country. In this
chamber we are always happy when a man
of his ability and experience thinks enough
of his country to devote his time and service
to public affairs. I might say that the hardest
problem which a democratic country has is
that of getting men and women of experience
and ability to devote themselves to the public
service-and that is easily understood, for
in doing so they make a very great sacrifice.
I have been in this chamber for quite a
number of years and I speak from experience
in this matter. I know, as I think everyone
here does, that regardless of the salary or indemnity that we receive as members of this
house, if the same energy and industry that
we apply here were applied to one's own business the return would be far greater. All
of us are delighted when a man of the ability
and character of the late Senator Hackett consents to devote his talents and ability and his
heart to the life and progress of our country.
Senator Hackett was a native son of the
province of Quebec, an English-speaking son
who could speak French as a Frenchman

speaks it. He interpreted the English-speaking people to the French-speaking people of
Quebec as nobody else could, and he interpreted the English-speaking people of
Quebec to the people of the other provinces.
I say to his widow-I knew her well-and
to his children, two of whom I met and knew,
that we miss his going, but we congratulate
them on having had a husband and father
who made such an immense contribution to
the life of his country.
I came to know the late Senator Godbout
after he entered this house. I knew his
record and I liked Senator Godbout. I could
go over to his desk, wherever he happened to
be sitting, which latterly was just across the
aisle from where I am, and ask him about
something and he would promise to attend
to it. No letter from him was needed to
confirm that promise: I knew he would carry
it out to the letter, in an even better way
than I could suggest. He was a scientific
agriculturist, a practical farmer who had
gained in the course of his life great agricultural experience, which he shared widely,
not only with his own province but with the
rest of Canada. The farmers of our country
are greatly indebted to him for the contribution he made to the agricultural progress of
Canada. I did not know his family, but I
say to them that they are honoured in having
a husband and father who has left such a
heritage to his country, for scientific agriculture is the essence of agricultural development in Canada.
I would now like to say a few words about
Honourable
the late Senator Stevenson.
senators, I served on the Divorce Committee
for many years with John Stevenson, and I
think that if he had had his way there would
not have been a single divorce granted by
Parliament, provided he could get the man
and wife together and convince them to go
on living together and be happy. The question of divorce worried him more than it did
most of us. I could name some other members who did not seem to worry a bit about
it, but it did worry him. His own family life
had been so happy so delightful, that he felt
very keenly that other people should be
happy too.
Senator Stevenson was a great personal
help to me when I came down here. I liked
him very much. His was a name that was
loved in Saskatchewan, so much so that
whenever criticism was levelled at the Senate
and some disparaging remarks made, the
people of Saskatchewan would only retort
that the Senate must be a mighty fine place
so long as John Stevenson was a member

NOVEMBER 26, 1956
of it. As a senator from western Canada it
was delightful for me to have an associate of
that kind with me.
I knew Senator Ross, and also his wife.
She is the granddaughter of the Reverend
Dr. McDougall, the first Methodist minister
who went to western Canada to do missionary work among the Indians. Her grandfather had a distinguished career and in
United Church circles today his name is
greatly honoured. In the early pioneering
days of western Canada the Reverend Dr.
McDougall was very welcome wherever he
went. I remember women who had lived
on western farms telling me, after they got
older and had moved into the city of Winnipeg or Brandon, "My, it was wonderful to
have the Reverend Dr. McDougall come and
spend the night with us and talk to my husband and me." Similar remarks were heard
about the Reverend Dr. Robertson, a Presbyterian minister of pioneer days, who used to
visit the outposts and tell them about the
world outside.
Senator Ross' wife was
brought up in that environment and she
always exhibited the kindly traits of her forebears. She is a noble woman. You know,
honourable senators, I may be a "esky old
rascal but when I meet a senator I like to
know if he is married. If he is I like to meet
his wife, for then I will soon know pretty
well what kind of a senator he is. A man
can fool other men but it is very difficult for
him ta fool his wife. You can learn a lot
about a man from the way his wife speaks
of him. Sometimes I did not like George
Ross very much. I did not hold any personal
grudge against him, but he made some
speeches with which I did not agree; I
thought he was a little wrong. Then I would
meet Mrs. Ross upstairs, and any resentment
I felt disappeared out of the window: by the
time I left the room I thought Ross was the
greatest man in Canada.
In truth I liked George Ross. He was a
real westerner. He started life as a cowboy;
then he became a lawyer, then a member
of Parliament, and afterwards, a senator.
I do not know whether everybody thinks
that that is a good road ta travel, but ta
my way of thinking it is a pretty fine way
ta go through life. I pay my greatest respects
ta Mrs. Ross and the family, and say to
them that their husband and father was a
pioneer of western Canada and that we from
the west are proud that such men as he
form part of our Canadian life.
I did not know the late Senator Pirie as
well as I know many of my colleagues. On
weekends, when we westerners and some
easterners have ta stay in town, he, like
some members from Quebec and Ontario, was

usually away. Sa our little group who remained here did not have an opportunity of
getting ta know him and exchanging our
family secrets. However, we knew him as
an outstanding citizen and one of the ablest
businessmen in New Brunswick, one who will
be sorely missed in that province.
Like the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), I am glad ta
have been here to meet these men and ta have
been associated with them. They have left
with us memories which will last as long as
our lives. They have left Canada a heritage
which this country will never forget. We
may not know why the spirit of our country
is expressed in this way or the other, but men
such as these have made an abiding impress
on the national life. In years ta come, even
those who criticize the Senate on various
grounds will acknowledge that many fine
people, such as our departed colleagues, have
been members of this body, and that the
reputation of Canada has been greatly enhanced by their lives and conduct.
Hon. W. M. Aseline: Honourable senators,
I wish ta associate myself with everything
that the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) have said with regard ta these departed
members of our chamber. It was a great shock
ta me, as it must have been ta us all, that sa
many men whom we had known intimately
and long departed this life within so short
a time.
I do not intend ta speak at length about
any of them, but I thought I should say
something about the late Senator Stevenson.
He came from Saskatchewan. I knew Jack
Stevenson as long as, if not longer than, any
member of this chamber. I remember that
many years ago-longer than I care ta recall
-he came ta my office ta ask me ta draw up
a contract for him in connection with the
breaking up of 640 acres of new prairie land
which he had just started ta farm. I think I
did a good job for him, and he mentioned
that fact many times after he came down
here. Of course, at that time neither of us
ever thought we would be members of the
Senate of Canada. It was too long ago for us
ta have entertained such thoughts. Jack
Stevenson was a fine fellow, a real western
pioneer who started farming in our country
before there was any railroad or method of
communication, a time when farmers had ta
haul their wheat thirty or forty miles ta
market. He made a real success of it and
was highly respected by everyone in that part
of Saskatchewan. I could tell honourable
senators many things he accomplished. He
had a great influence with the powers that

SENATE
be in Ottawa. When we were thinking of
establishing a Prince Albert National Park
in the northern part of Saskatchewan he was
one of the chief advocates of that project and
it was to his credit that the park was established. Today it is one of Canada's finest
national parks.
Before moving to Saskatchewan Jack
Stevenson was a pioneer in the lumber business in eastern Canada. He spent one whole
summer and winter investigating the timber
and pulpwood possibilities in the Hamilton
River district of Labrador. He gave me a
stirring account of the many hardships that
he experienced in that part of the country.
I was, of course, intimately acquainted with
Senator Stevenson during the time he was
a member of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, of which I was chairman for a
number of years. You could always depend
on Jack Stevenson, and although he did not
know much law he was blessed with more
than the average amount of good, solid, common sense. Whenever he heard a case you
could always depend on him to arrive at a
fair and reasonable conclusion.
I should like to repeat that he was a splendid man in every respect. His passing is a
big loss to this chamber, to the people of
Saskatchewan and indeed to the whole of
Canada. I personally miss him very much
and I extend to his children my deepest
sympathy.
I also want to say something about that
distinguished westerner, Senator George Ross,
who was another very faithful member of
our Divorce Committee. As my leader (Hon.
Mr. Haig) bas said, Senator Ross was first a
cowboy, then a lawyer, then a member of the
House of Commons, and finally a senator.
My leader intimated he also had followed
that same career, but I never knew that he
was once a cowboy. I also followed that
same career, except that instead of being a
zowboy I was a farmer.
George Ross was a fine man and a good
friend. He had a wonderful wife to guide him
through life and he made a grand contribution to the public welfare of this country. I
extend to Mrs. Ross and her family my
deepest sympathy.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I thoroughly appreciate what the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
bas done in the eloquent statements he bas
just made about our departed colleagues. It
was a sad task well performed. I thoroughly
agree with him in what ho has said about my
late deskmate, Senator Pirie, about Senator
Godbout, whom I knew very well and admired; and about Senator Hackett, who was
indeed an eminent member of this chamber

and an eminent member of the Law Society
of Canada. However, my chief reason for
rising at the moment is that, as Chairm.an of
the Standing Committee on Divorce, I think
the members of that committee would like
me to acknowledge the services given to it
by the Honourable Senators Stevenson and
Ross.
On many occasions Senator Stevenson acted
on the subcommittee of which I was chairman, and I had an opportunity of knowing
him in that capacity far better than in any
other. One perhaps can judge what real
interest a person has in public service by
what he or she does in the committees of
this house where no publicity is possible, and
where few see the work that is actually done.
In the chamber it is easy for someone to
make a big play or to perform some prominent
service that wins acclaim; but in our committees, and particularly in the Divorce
Committee, there is no glamour attached
to the work. There everything is quiet,
unobserved and motivated solely by a high
desire for public service. That was particularly the case with our departed colleague
and friend Senator Stevenson. He was, as
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has said, and as the member for Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has so eloquently expressed it, a sound man with good judgment.
He had something more than a knowledge of
law or other professional knowledge: he had
a knowledge of life and a heart behind that
knowledge. We shall all miss Senator Stevenson in the Divorce Committee, and I am
sure the members of that committee join
with me in an expression of sympathy for
his family and a warm tribute to his memory.
With regard to Senator Ross, words fail
me to express the regret we all feel in his
passing. During these last few years he
was not in good health, and yet-sometimes
perhaps unduly-he gave of himself to the
work of the Divorce Committee. He was
chairman of a subcommittee whenever he
served during my time, and he performed
his task with skill, knowledge and heart. I
agreed with him in his judgments. I did
not have occasion, as the Leader of the
Opposition has said he had, to disagree with
him at any time to any extent. I felt grateful
to him for the way in which he gave of
himself: even when he was not feeling well
he carried on with the work of the committee.
Senator Ross came to the House of Commons in 1940, the same year that I did. He
was then a veteran lawyer, having been
called to the bar as long ago as 1911, and, as
the Leader of the Government said, he was
created a King's Counsel in 1913. I preceded Senator Ross to the Senate, in 1945; he
came here in 1948, but he became a member

NOVEMBER 26. 1956
of the Senate Divorce Committee before I
did, and he was a member when I assumed
the chairmanship. At that time he was not
in good heaith, but nevertheless he was a
faithful, highly educated, and most valuable
member of that committee.
I arn sure that my colleagues who are
members of the Divorce Committee will ail
join with me most heartily in expressing cour
sympathy to Mrs. Ross and the other members
of his family, aur regret at his passing, and
aur grateful tribute ta hilm as a notable public
servant.
Hon. William H. Golding: Honourable senators, I arn sure we were ail shocked since
the last session to hear that some of aur
most valued and worthy members had passed
away. On this occasion I want ta endorse
the fine tributes which have been paid by
aur leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and others
who have spoken. I wil not take up the
ie of the house by repeating those fine
tributes, but I wish ta take this opportunity
of saying a word or two in cannection with
my late roomn-mate and colleague Senator
Ross. When I came over ta the Senate I had
an invitation from Senator Farquhar ta
occupy a third desk in the room which he
shared with Senator Ross; that was in 1949,
and since then we had ail shared that room
together. Senator Ross was an interesting
character. It was mentioned earlier that he
had once been a cawboy. In the many
interesting talks we had together he rarely
spoke about himself, but he did- tell us of
the work he did as a sheep shearer and as a
railroad man. I am sure he performed those
duties efficiently and weil. Senator Ross was
a quiet man, and he would tell us stories
of his experiences in a simple, quiet and
impressive way.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) spoke of Mrs. Ross. I want ta say that
bath Senator Farquhar and I are going ta
miss Mrs. Ross a great deal, for she is a
woman of a very fine type. Indeed, she and
her husband were a splendid couple, for
whom one could, not heip but have the
highest admiration.
Honourable senators, I do not want ta
labour this point at ahl. I know that we al
feel keenly the ioss of aur five colleagues,
and 1 join with the leader and others who
have already spoken in expressing deep sympathy ta the bereaved f amulies and friends.

Senate has lost much by the passing of these
gentlemen. We all feel sad as we look at the
vacant chairs. I should like especially to
mention the former occupant of the seat in
front of me, the late Senator Hackett.
I came into this chamber the same morning
on which Senator Hackett was sworn in.
Throughout my acquaintance with him I
found him to be broadminded and generous
in word, thought and deed, ever willing to
help and advise to the best of his ability. In
saying this I pay my respects to a brilliant
mind and a great gentleman.
As a Prince Edward Islander I feel, as
do all other Islanders, a great pride in Senator Ross and what he accomplished in his

of courage and of constant devotion to duty

(Text):
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), as well as all other honourable senators who have spoken, have paid
high tribute to the memory of our five colleagues who departed this life since our last
prorogation.
I regard it a personal duty to express my
sympathy to the family of Senator Pirie, who
was an outstanding businessman in the Maritime provinces; and to express sympathy also
to the family of Senator Ross, who was indeed a grand old man. Senator Ross won my
heart from the first day I met him, and I
shall never forget the friendship which he
showed to me: his kindly smile was for me
always a great encouragement.
As to Senator Stevenson, he was my neighbour when I was appointed to this chamber
and we became, in this way, intimate friends.
We were always glad to meet each other, and
I shall always retain a good memory of his
many kindnesses.
I come now to Senator Godbout, under
whom I served in many political campaigns
when he was Premier of Quebec and later
Leader of the Opposition in the province. He
was a man of courage, a man of duty, a man
of honour, but what principally characterized
him for me was his sincere and deep love for
the land, particularly for his own farm. I
met him for the first time, oh, perhaps 30
years ago. He had not yet entered politics.
He was addressing a meeting of my students
in our Faculty of Commerce of the Université
de Montréal, and I said to myself, "This
young man will surely do something great,
this young man has a grand future". I felt
that way because, although I was born in the
city and had no experience at all in agricultural matters, I had never heard our good old
land of the province of Quebec praised in
such a way. It was not alone the words be
used that impressed me so greatly, but the
manner in which he expressed his deep, deep
love for the land of good old Quebec.
And now I come to speak of the senator
with whom I was even more closely associated than the others, my very dear friend
John Hackett. We did not belong to the
same political faith, but I knew him for, I
think, more than forty years, and never for
one minute, never for one second, did I have
any reason to complain of John Hackett, in
81541-2j

politics, in cases we were arguing against
each other at the bar, or in our business relations. He was a champion of what I would
call religious and racial harmony in his native
province, and on this point he was in a
different camp serving the same cause as was
Adélard Godbout. At the end of his life
Adélard Godbout also lived in the eastern
townships.
John Hackett was a good Christian, a good
Quebecer and a good Canadian. He loved
his country, and he loved in particular his
own Stanstead which was his home village
and for which he had indeed the greatest
devotion.
He was proud of his own part of the province of Quebec, he was proud of the beautiful
mountains which surround the area from
which he came, and it was with very deep
regret that we went up to Mount Saint Mary
Cemetery, where he was laid to rest in a
beautiful landscaped setting. He was a great
friend of mine, and I am made very sorry by
his death.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: Honourable
senators, I rise to endorse what has been
so well expressed here today 'by my own
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig),
as well as by the others who preceded me.
Senator Jodoin paid a very eloquent tribute
to the late Senator Adélard Godbout, and
as she was speaking I realized that I, an
English-speaking native of the province of
Quebec, should add a few words of tribute
also. I was already a menber of the Senate
when my husband first received voting
papers with respect to property which I
owned in that province, so I do have some
appreciation of the difficulties which women
in Quebec had to contend with.
The Leader of the Opposition said that
Senator Godbout's word was as good as his
bond, and I well know that to be a fact.
He promised the vote to the women of the
province of Quebec, and he was prepared to
go to the limit to fulfil that promise. He
said that his honour was at stake. We all
owe him a great debt, and I personally feel
that his passing is a severe loss to our
chamber.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I too would like to join in the
tributes that have been paid to our deceased
colleagues. I certainly can add very little to
what has been said so very eloquently already. Senator Ross and Senator Stevenson
I came to know in the Divorce Committee,
and I admired very much their attitude
toward the work there.

SENATE
I feel I knew Senator Hackett fairly well,
because he sat so close to my deskmate and
me and was so very kind to us on all occasions.
Senator Godbout I admired very much.
His career before he came to this house
was an inspiration, and he showed his experience and ability when he substituted
many times for our leader.
Coming from New Brunswick, however, I
feel that some special words should be said
about the late Senator Pirie, who was one
of New Brunswick's very outstanding sons.
I do not know if all of you realize that his
death was extremely sudden.
On the morning he died he started off for
his office, but before leaving he mentioned
to his wife that he thought he would fly
down to see the World Series baseball games.
On that day she herself had planned a trip
to Campbellton; there was no thought of
the senator's being ill at all. Honourable
members will be interested to know that
in his younger days Senator Pirie had been
extremely interested in baseball. He had
played in the minor leagues which are formed
of teams located close to the border between
New Brunswick and Maine, which activities
make for a very good feeling between the
people of the province and state. Sports of
that kind between people on both sides of
the border are very much worth while.
As to Senator Pirie's industrial activities,
he was of course an outstanding grower and
shipper of potatoes, and through that enterprise created a great business and brought
much employment and money into the Upper
St. John River valley. I have some special
knowledge of this, because for a number of
years my husband and I lived in the same
town as Senator Pirie, and he and my husband were great friends. At that time we
had a law firm, which did all of the Pirie
business.
The late senator's business ability and
integrity were recognized by everyone with
whom he dealt to be of the very highest. I
understood this even more clearly than before
when my husband and I accompanied Mr. and
Mrs. Pirie and two other couples to Cuba,
where we met a great many people with
whom the senator had commercial relations,
and realized that he had built up a reputation
for Canadian businessmen of which all of
us can be proud.
From 1935 on Senator Pirie was, for some
years, Minister of Lands and Mines in the
provincial cabinet, and he was regarded as
one of the ablest men who have held that
portfolio. Because, owing to the demands of
his own very large business, it was difficult

for him to spend sufficient time in Fredericton, our capital city, he purchased his own
pontoon-equipped plane with which he commuted back and forth between the St. John
River in Fredericton and the same river at
Grand Falls, a distance of about 135 miles,
to enable him to have sufficient time to look
after both his main interests.
To Mrs. Pirie and Senator Pirie's son, his
three daughters, and his sisters, I offer my
very sincere sympathy at this time.

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt:
Honourable
senators, according to a French proverb, what
is well understood can be clearly expressed,
in words that are easily found. But that is
not always so. There are sometimes great
joys or great sorrows which one can neither
express, describe, or even hide. One can
only look on, suffer, weep or love. That is
somewhat my position at this moment when
I recall one who had always been my friend,
Senator Godbout.
A while ago Senator Gouin claimed that
he had known Senator Godbout for thirty
years; I knew him when I was a youngster.
We were practically brought up together.
We lectured together at Ste. Anne de la
Pocatière. I had a share in all his joys,
his sorrows and his disappointments.
He entered politics in a tragic moment, and
attained the crest of success at the beginning of the Second World War. Whenever
he took any action he always said that he
did so for the good and for the unity of
his country, so that Canadians, whether they
came from Quebec, from Ontario or from
other provinces, in other words, Canadians
whose first allegiance is to Canada, might
work together to attain national unity and
to save Christendom. In so doing, he knew
full well that his actions would be misunderstood; but he knew, with his sincerity. his
magnanimity and his humanitarianism, that
he had done his duty, from which no one
was ever able to make him deviate.
The best tribute to him that I ever heard
came from the lips of a farmer-and how
he loved the farmers!-who told me a few
weeks ago how humane he was. He was
kindly with his family, in his home, at large
meetings with important or unimportant
people; his kindliness was always the same.
His kind feelings for his fellow citizens, his
country, his family and everybody showed
in his words, for he never entertained any
hatred against anybody.
He liked to discuss things freely and
He
afforded the same privilege to others.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's
speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. William M. Wall moved:
That the foliowing Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions
of Honour, Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada. May it Please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious speech which Your Excellency bas
addressed to both bouses of Parliament.

He said:
Honourable senators, may I be permitted
to express my thanks to the Government
and to the Leader of the Government in the

Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the honour
that has been accorded to me in inviting me
to move the Address in relpy to the Speech
from the Throne, a privileged responsibility
which I undertake for the first time.
Both houses of Parliament have been assembled for this special session "because of
the serious international situation arising out
of hostilities in the Middle East and the
events in Hungary".
We meet at a time of aggravated tensions
in the external relationships between nations
and groups of nations. Democratic governmental leadership solemnly warns us that this
is a period of near-crisis, which could well
precipitate another world conflict. As we
search for causative clues and for possible
solutions, none of us is likely to minimize
the gravity of the present situation, especially
in the critical Middle East.
It is in this perspective that we must assess
the widely-acclaimed leadership efforts of the
Canadian Government to implement its belief
that the permanent solution of Israel's relations with its neighbours-and the future of
the Suez Canal-should be reached by peaceful negotiations under the aegis of the United
Nations.
Events well known to you have moved
swiftly and the United Nations General Assembly has accepted Mr. Pearson's original
suggestion that the Secretary General make
arrangements for a United Nations force to
secure and to supervise cease-fire arrangements. This is a new and untried concept at
the United Nations, demanding the working
out of terms of reference for the United Nations force which would be acceptable and
functional. This is no easy task, and it is at
present being attempted by an Advisory Committee, of which Canada is a member.
It is hoped that this police force will contribute to peace in the area while a political
settlement is being worked out, through the
United Nations. To this end, it is hoped that
the United Nations will consider the future of
the Suez Canal and the future of Israel's
relations with its neighbours.
The continued development and practical
realization of this United Nations' intervention for peace in the Middle East will naturally demand sacrifices from all concerned;
and I am convinced that the Canadian people
will willingly meet these commitments, displaying the same calibre of thoughtful leadership and -concern for peace which were
demonstrated, in our name, when the Canadian delegation first advanced its proposals
at the current session of the General
Assembly.
Taking into consideration the inherent difficulties of accurately foretelling the exact
extent and specificity of the demands which

NOVEMBER 27, 1956
a constantly shifting international arena
would make on Canada-and we did make
a very honest attempt to fulfil our country's
obligation to our Charter Covenant by meeting necessary but often unanticipated United
Nations requirements in a spirit of loyalty
difficult to equal-I do believe that we recognize the fine record of public stewardship
which has characterized the Government's
efforts during the present critical situation, as
it has been unfolding. I respectfully submit
that the Government has acted with wisdom
and with requisite but judicious dispatch, and
that the necessary parliamentary approval
required for the continued implementation of
its policies in this regard should be favourably considered by this legislative body.
Let us turn briefly to the recent tragic
events in Hungary. What can one do but
register shocked disapproval and condemnation of the horror of Hungary's martyrdom,
which is still so fresh on our nerves and
conscience? We are confronted with what
appears to be a collapse of the beginnings of
some little measure of rationalization and
moderation of the communist system of
government, and the reimposition of communist minority rule in all its classical
brutality. The hypocritical promises-that
Soviet leaders were prepared to re-negotiate
their relations with Eastern Europe on the
basis of equality and non-interference in
their neighbours' internal affairs-were
dashed into shambled disillusionment and
eventual shocked realization that the Kremlin
masquerade of moderation was a temporary
ruse, to be followed by the application of
Soviet armed might to crush what indeed
was a spontaneous, passionate, and significant
outburst of national feeling. Moscow's will
bas been reimposed on Hungary by brute
force, obviously for strategic and indeed other
reasons. One has a right to wonder whether
this tough crack-down policy within Hungary
will be a permanent phenomenon, and
whether the Soviet Union is unable to devise
any alternatives to prevent the dissolution of
its colonial empire when many other submerged nationalities are pressing for a liberalization of the communist system or for
national separation and independence.
The eloquent statement of the distinguished
representative of Ireland at the current
United Nations Assembly session reflects very
accurately the thoughts of all freedom-loving
peoples. I quote:
For us in Ireland, and I venture to think that
for the people of many other of the smaller nations
represented here, any mention in the future of
national independence or anti-colonialism or the
right of self-determination by any spokesman of
the Soviet Union, will always evoke in our minds
a single name, a name on which the courage and
endurance of a very gallant people have shed a
great and undying glory, the name of Hungary.

In the Speech from the Throne we noted
this sentence:
You will also be requested to authorize the provision of relief for the victims of the recent tragia
events in Hungary.
To implement the Government's commitment in the light of the needs as they can
presently be assessed, the Prime Minister
announced that the total sum of $1 million
is to be appropriated for Hungarian relief
purposes. This action on the part of the
Government will meet with the generous
approval of the Canadian citizens, in view
of the dynamics released by an unprecedented
upsurge of outraged feelings and spontaneous
sympathy and a desire to help, which the
Hungarian affair has generated among our
people. We do realize that this sum is not
unduly onerous on us, as it amounts to less
than 10 cents per capita. However, compared
to the announced contributions of other countries, ours is a bold and generous offer,
which promises us a rich reward of international good will and national satisfaction.
Granted that this is not the first cry for
help that has reached us out of the chilling
night of totalitarian darkness, but it is one
of the most dramatic; and we do not want
it to re-echo, in the years that lie ahead, as a
challenging reproof to our values of
humanity and Christian brotherhood.
I respectfully suggest that the same spirit
of generosity should mark our action in
resettling and rehabilitating Hungarian refugees here in Canada. It is a source of gratification to all of us to learn that the cabinet,
on Friday last, gave the go-ahead signal for
completing arrangements to airlift refugees
directly to Canada. I suspect that other
transportation arrangements are also being
made, and my suspicion is confirmed by the
statement made by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in the House of
Commons. I, for one, hope that our entranceinto-Canada processing will be characterized
by wisdom and fairness-but by generous
fiexibility and speed-so that a large number
of freedom-seeking refugees will be enabled
to reach this democratic and Christian haven.
Honourable senators, permit me to make
these additional observations upon the problem areas in which I have indicated my
general approval of present governmental
policies.
Certainly it is abundantly clear that the
Canadian Government has committed itself
to the United Nations way of resolving pressing international problems. As I understand
it, in the name of our democratic and peaceloving people, and in harmonius continuity
with our policies since we became a member
of the United Nations, the Canadian Government has committed us to a hopeful reliance

SENATE
that the United Nations may be strengthened
into a useful supranational authority to maintain peace. This is in line with our historie
commitment to generous and wholehearted
co-operation in solving, through the United
Nations, other grave international problems:
disarmament, technical and economic assistance to underdeveloped countries, atomic
radiation, atomic power for peaceful uses,
and others.
The Prime Minister, in his historie and
important broadcast to the Canadian people
on November 4, underscored this commitment:
We realize, however, that a permanent settlement between Israel and its neighbours arranged
by the United Nations was the only way in which
peace could be preserved in the long run.

And later in the same address:
We have advocated that a settlement of the
issues relating to the Canal which directly affected
so many countries should be achieved under the
auspices of the United Nations and that there
should be no resort to force.

Now, although our reliance upon the
United Nations is honest, sincere and indeed
courageous, and although our support of the
United Nations is deliberate, open and conscientious, we are realistically alive to the
calculated risks we must take in working
through the United Nations. These risks
the Canadian people must know, and must
accept in a realistic manner.
For example, the effectiveness of the UN
Security Council can be immobilized by the
right of veto. The historie UN Security
Council intervention in Korea was possible
only because the USSR had absented itself
and was not present to exercise its veto
prerogative. This immobilization can and
probably will happen again unless a Charter
amendment were to remove the veto principle, which is not likely.
To by-pass a stalemated Security Council,
a two-thirds vote is needed in the General
Assembly. One can foresee the Assembly
rendered impotent by some coalition of
nations, even on the present Suez issue.
Further, any nation may deliberately
choose not to accept a majority decision of
the Assembly on some issue. For example,
the USSR and Hungary have refused, so far,
even to permit the UN to investigate conditions in Hungary, on the pretext or reason
that what happened there is a domestic
affair.
During the last parliamentary session I
raised an over-arching calculated risk always present when one considers the progress that can be made by a federation of the
now 79 national governments, namely, that

the reconciliation and harmonizing of multitudinous shades of opinions and expectations
is a slow and time-consuming business.
Knowing these risks, and predicating our
answer on past hisotry and on events which
have lately taken place in the Middle East,
we do face this pertinent question:
With all its weaknesses and imperfections,
is not the United Nations the only international vehicle which may yet be able to
forestall further aggressive intervention, get
the Canal opened, secure the withdrawal of
the armed forces from the Suez area, assure
the future observance of the spirit and the
letter of international law and the sequential
international freedom of the Canal without
endangering the security and sovereignty
rights of the Egyptian people and without
further antagonizing the Arab world?
What other international authority can conceivably be upraised to a level that can attract
and hold the allegiance of all the Middle East
contestants, and thereby eventually bring
peace to a very troubled area?
I may be accused of belabouring this point;
but truthfully, what is the realistic and logical
alternative to this near-universal forum for
multilateral discussion and negotiative settlement? In parentheses, are we guessing correctly that nations or even groups of nations
will hardly risk being opposed to an organized, international United Nations mandate, if
it is bulwarked by the determined support of
the peace-loving nations of the world?
It is imperative, too, that Canadians understand the cardinal importance of the role of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the
maintenance of international peace and
security. As we all know, this organization
functions as a 15-member agency for collective defence and as a further instrument for
the deterrence of aggression.
It may be well to quote two significant summarizing statements from the address of
General Charles Foulkes, Chairman, Chiefs
of Staff, at the annual dinner of the Canadian
Industrial Preparedness Association:
. . . NATO has achieved the defensive aim it set
out to do. It has succeeded in deterring aggression
in the NATO area, and the fact that the Soviet
Union la now busy doing an end-run around NATO
confirms the success that the alliance has accom.
plished in deterring aggression in the NATO
area . . .
. . . there are many advantages in belonging to
this kind of alliance; we believe that the best way
of defending Canada Is as a member of NATO.

The revived Soviet tough, cold-war tactics
and the Soviet threats of intervention appear
to have jolted the West into renewed preparedness, giving to NATO a new feeling of
purposive urgency. This renewed urgency
may enable the nations concerned to focus

NOVEMBER 27, 1956
increased attention on the strengthening of
the political, economic and social ties which
are needed to make this alliance more effective. Grave problems must be faced as we
attempt to work out the answers within the
NATO grouping, yet something must be done
and ail must be prepared to give and take.
Canadians must keep in constant focus an
additional unique arrangement within NATO,
which is so important to Canada. I arn
thinking of the Canada-United States regional
grouping for the defence af North America,
a mutual arrangement for defence collaboration, which originated 16 years ago in the
historic Ogdensburg Agreement in 1940.
May I suggest that international security is
not only buttressed by international organizations and the availability of adequate forces
to, sanction right which may be violated; it
requires also a moral and spiritual foundation.
In this connection I should like to refer ta
what I consider ta be a significant statement
of principle in the radio address af the Prime
Minister on November 4:
Our' alm is that the people of Eastern Europe
should be free ta choose their own form of government, a basic human right they have flot enjoyed
for many years.

Thoughtful Canadians welcome this reaifirmation of our basic moral and democratic
integrity, as it relates ta our efforts ta, see ta
it that justice and liberty are accorded ta al
presently-enslaved peoples.
We have witnessed a spontaneous and encouraging interest on the part af aur people
in the current struggle of Poland and Humgary for national freedom and a larger measure of justice. That is as it should be. I
hope that this interest remains alive, and
that we continue to examine the ways and
means by which this interest can 'be translated into purposive, effective, though peacefui, international action.
May I remind honourable senators of the
equally significant, less dramatie perhaps, but
infinitely more lengthy and equally determined struggle for a large ineasure of international freedomn and justice on the part af
those peoples who have been aptly termed
the "submerged. nations" within the TISSE.
It seems hardly necessary ta, remind aurselves
that ini Soviet Russia, which is a huge multinational empire, the constituent ininorities
have been oppressed longer and thereiore
subllmated, decimated, and Russified more
effectively. Perhaps that is one ai the reasons
why we hear less about them. I arn not
speaking in a sense af recrimination; but
when the Western world expressed deep sympathy for the severe curtailment and active
persecution af religiaus freedom i Poland
and Hungary, the shocking martyrdom and

destruction of the Ukrainian Catholic and
Orthodox churches engendered f ar less sustained interest or indignant reaction. Nor is
this the occasion for documenting the record
af communist Russia's colonial exploitation
and suppression ai national and human
rights, but this record does exist and it is
indeed a tragic story.
Now, when we consider the continued plight
of ahl these peoples and minorities, how
indeed do we interpret aur moral obligation
ta, bring dloser the day when the people ai
Eastern Europe might be free ta choose their
own f orm ai government, a basic human right
they have not; enjoyed for years? Is it
realistic that we may, on the international
arena, continue ta discuss the shocking reality
of the colonial subi ugation af the many idividuals, minorities and nations wlthin the
Soviet Empire, firmly challenging the Soviet
autharities ta continued ratianalization and
liberalization ai the communist system ai
rninority government-and reiterating aur
belief that a free vote be taken ta assess what
in iact are the real wishes ai these submerged
and effectively-muzzled
peoples?
Many
thoughtfui observers believe that this is the
challenge which the Soviet leaders are not
prepared ta accept, and one af aur recurrent
themes rnight well be an expression ai aur
hope that the professed stability ai the communist structure be subi ected to the free
existence oi apposition parties and the free
expression ai the considered will ai Its
peoples.
Hanourable senators, I commend ta yaur
attention the last paragraph of the Prime
Minister's letter ta Mr. Bulganin, dated
November 13, dealing with the Hungarian
situation:
The Government and people of Canada have no
desire to influence the formn of governmnent chosen
by the peoples of Eastern Europe. Our only aim is
that they should be f ree ta do so, and the governments sa chosen should steer their own independent courses, respecting the equal rights of ail
thel r neighbours and bearing In mind only the
needs and wishes of their own people In accordance with the principles and purposes of the
United Nations Charter.

Surely, toa, our people must understand
and remember that we have no validated
evidence ta disprove aur conviction that
Soviet objectives continue ta remain the
same; their simple and unaltered aimeventual
communist
world
domination.
True, Soviet tactics do zigzag, but these
manoeuvres depend on what the poweriul
state rnechanism. with its present oligarchical
leadership regards ta, be the most fruitiul
approach in effectuating its premeditated
calculus of conquest, whlch envisages the
destruction and the communizing ai the sacalled capitalist Western democracies.

SENATE
Generally, and until recent developments
in Hungary, communist tactics were directed
to removing our fears-to constantly emphasizing the recurrent theme of peaceful or
competitive co-existence-and, significantly
enough, never resigning from emphatical
statements that no co-existence was possible
between democratic and communist ideologies. Banking on our alleged lack of internal
discipline and staying power, Soviet leaders
continue to mount ever greater highly-disciplined efforts to outstrip the Western democratic world, especially in military and
industrial strength. With what motives,
pray?
Honourable senators, I recognize that my
analysis of some of the problem areas I
have discussed is inadequate. However, I
respectfully submit that all these things we
Canadians must be mindful of, as we bend
our efforts to strengthen our democratic
social structure-guided, as we must be, by
the principles of distributive justice operating
within the national and the international
framework of liberty, unity and human
brotherhood.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sarto Fournier: Honourable senators,
I received with a great deal of pleasure and
accepted with a deep feeling of gratitude the
invitation to second the motion so ably
presented by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) for an Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.
As this is the first time that I have risen
to speak in this honourable chamber, honourable senators must appreciate the necessity for me to call upon your generosity and
your most sympathetic attention at the outset
of the few remarks that I shall have the
pleasure to make.
Honourable senators, yesterday we had
the opportunity of listening to the speech of
His Excellency the Governor General, so we
are now in a position to know exactly why
Parliament has been called into special
session. We have been summoned here in
order to make a decision so important that
it will certainly have a direct bearing on the
immediate future of the world. A similar
proposition is being brought to the attention
of the governments of eighteen other nations,
in order to bring us together in a joint and
common action to prevent war and to secure
peace among those nations which have so
imprudently and, I think, so wrongly taken
it upon themselves to settle their economic
difficulties by resorting to war in the Middle
East.
We are also to be asked to vote a certain
amount of money, a million dollars, as
Canada's share to help the Hungarian people,

who are actually flung into the worst national
tragedy of our time. We shall be glad to
vote this money, for the sake of our country's
honour.
I listened, as you did, honourable senators,
with a great deal of pleasure and interest to
the speech just made by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg. For his elevation of
thought, his deep knowledge of the facts,
and his high intelligence of significance, we
owe him more than felicitations or congratulations. Indeed, I think it is our duty to thank
him sincerely for the brilliant and most useful contribution he has made at the outset
of this debate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: In order to follow a
well-established, and, I think, a rather good
tradition, and because of the fact that the
French language seems to be a little less difficult for me, I hope honourable senators will
gracefully permit me to proceed now in the
language of my mother tongue for the
remainder of the remarks that I intend to
make.
(Translation):
A few weeks ago, when the peoples of
the world learned of Israel's attack upon
Egypt, we all went through the whole gamut
of emotions, from surprise and anxiety to
astonishment and even terror. Several days
later, Great Britain and France took the same
action notwithstanding the most solemn commitments recorded in the United Nations
Charter. The reaction was both spontaneous
and universal. The eyes of the whole world
turned towards the United Nations, in which,
afiter the war, it had placed its hope and faith.
As soon as the problem was laid before it,
the United Nations opened discussions in
New York.
Speeches, accusations
and
criticism were made by each representative.
It looked very much like a panic, and instead
of rushing to put out the fire the UN put
the incendiaries on trial. And then it was
Canada's turn to express an opinion. It is
not the first time that our country has been
called upon to take part in this kind of
discussion, where the future of the human
race is at stake. Because of its contribution
during the war, Canada was entitled to voice
its opinion and at San Francisco, Canada's
point of view, as set forth by our representatives, had already begun ta create a
deep and reassuring impression upon the
other nations.
Once the United Nations
Organization was set up and after the world
realized the duplicity and bad faith of
Moscow's representatives, which could have
plunged the world into another deadlock,
Canada again raised its voice and suggested
NATO which, to this day, remains the

NOVEMBER 27, 1956
greatest co-operative for peace the world has
ever known.
Therefore, the prestige and authority of Canada's voice are recognized and established the
world over. And this time it was our representative again who saved the situation, by
suggesting the cease-fire and recommending
the setting up of a United Nations force composed of soldiers from certain member
nations.
Canada played a tremendous part. We made
it quite clear that nowadays good faith and
moral authority are not enough. The United
Nations must have at its disposal physical and
mobile forces strong enough to bring to order
the nations who see fit to stray away. The
United Nations military force has been
organized and some regiments have already
arrived in Egypt where the people greeted
them so enthusiastically and so cordially we
have reason to believe that the Egyptians,
like all the other peoples of the world, desire
nothing but peace.
The part our country played in this affair
is already a matter of history and it will be
both the present Government's and the Canadian people's glory to have had representatives capable of evolving and submitting at
the psychological moment the proper formula
to save the world from another conflagration.
We well remembered that the former
League of Nations' greatest weakness came
from its lack of physical strength. Let us
hope that this time we will remember our
lesson and that, mindful of the good results
of the use of this formula in Egypt, all the
nations will unanimously recognize that if
the United Nations Organization is to survive
it must remain armed. As long as there are
peoples whose governments are composed of
predacious men whose ambition is to bring
into subjection the weaker nations and whose
every thought and deed are motivated by
unjust and unreasonable economic or politicai
ambitions, the peace of the world will be
in jeopardy.
It is not up to us to solve the enormous
problem which has set up the Middle East
against two great Western peoples. History
alone, as the perspective lengthens, will be
able to assess responsibilities. The problem,
with its religious, political and economic
implications is extremely complicated. Since
the opening of the Suez canal, this waterway
has been the jugular vein of the Western
peoples' economie life. It is little wonder
that, faced with such an important economic
fact, the peoples whose interests are concerned may not always act as wisely as they
should. In the present case, we firmly believe
that the nations concerned owed it to themselves and to the world to refer the matter
to United Nations arbitration. Israel, Great

Britain and France who, like all the other
signatories of the United Nations Charter,
had signed the collective and solemn agreement not to resort to war, undeniably violated
their word. Canada, today, cannot understand such behaviour and cannot refrain
from severe criticism. It is undoubtedly with
deep regret and some bitterness, when we
recall the historie bonds of friendship which
bind us particularly to France and Great
Britain.
Justice should have and in fact has but
one measure: what is right for one should
equally be right for the other, and what is
wrong for one should equally be wrong for
the other.
What human conscience and the most
elementary honesty cannot allow us to condone in the case of Russia or Communist
China, we must also disapprove of, even if
the governments concerned are friendly
governments.
We admit readily that Egypt may have had
and in fact had her faults. It is common
knowledge that she was unfair and sometimes
uncompromising and that ber "flirtation" with
Moscow continues to cause anxiety among
us, but even so, that was not a sufficient
reason to warrant invasion. We are living
in tragic times. It seems obvious that the
very existence of the United Nations Organization is at stake, but we have every reason
to believe that this adventure will have a
happy ending and that if the UN agrees to
maintain an armed force, security and liberty
seem to be assured to the world.
In the series of events that followed one
another so swiftly, there was one that for
some may have seemed of minor or even
negligible importance, but which for Canadians is nevertheless very significant: it is
the remark made by Colonel Nasser about the
flag of the Canadian Regiment sent to join
the soldiers of eighteen other nations in
Egypt. We cannot pass upon the colonel's
intentions and motives, for the simple reason
that we know nothing about them; the fact
remains, however, that the flag of our regiment leads to a certain confusion and we
may be mistaken for others. It is a smarting
lesson that we have received and we, as
Canadians, are placed in an embarrassing,
not to say a humiliating, position. When one
sees all the nations of the world, even the
least civilized tribes on earth, unfold a
standard or a flag of their own, we in Canada
have nothing to unfurl but a flag showing in
its fold at the most honourable quarter the
flag in miniature of another nation. I want to
stress all the respect in which we hold the
British flag. It is the symbol of a great
nation and of a great civilization, but it is

SENATE
nevertheless their own flag and not ours.
Inasmuch as we are concerned, it is a disguise
that causes us to be taken for someone else.
It is a vestige of misplaced colonialism. It
is an identification mark which does not
identify us. For the last twenty years
Canada has grown and has carved peacefully
for herself a place in the world; we have
commercial relations with one hundred and
fifty countries; we maintain embassies, legations, consulates, offices; in a word we are
everywhere. However, the flag that we fly is
no indication of that fact, because we may be
mistaken for someone else.
I understand very well the difficult position in which this problem places the Government of Canada, and all Canadians realize
that the time may not yet have come to give
our country a totally distinctive flag, because
there are still among us certain reactionary
groups who have not yet been able to rid
themselves of an unfortunate complex of
colonialism. It is quite evident that a national
flag cannot come from one group or section
of the country. It is just as evident that
the imposition of a flag which would be
flown in some places and reviled in others
would, ipso facto, constitute a menace to
national unity. Such disastrous results would
be worse than obtaining the totally distinctive flag, that most Canadians seem to want.
As long as there remains any possible danger
of national disunity, the adoption of a
national flag would seem a dangerous and
practically impossible measure. Racial quarrelling would only adjourn the problem for
another fifty years.
Our friends of the Conservative party who,
toward mid-December, will meet in a national
convention to choose a successor to their
chief who was forced to retire because of
ill health, could surely, if they saw fit, take
steps which would definitely make it possible
for Canadians to have their own distinctive
flag. If their resolutions committee adopted
the principle of a national flag at the convention and managed to have it accepted by
the general assembly, unanimous agreement
on this question would be achieved and the
question of obtaining in short order our own
flag would be only a matter of routine. Far
be it from me to interfere in the internal
affairs of the Conservative party, but I deem
it my duty to advise them that in rallying
frankly and loyally to this principle they
would certainly make it possible for our
nation to enjoy this definite and final symbol
of national sovereignty and pride.
Our present flag recalls what we have been;
what we need is a standard which will tell
the world what we are at present. I firmly
believe that no standard would be more respectfully or sympathetically received by the

nations of the world where we have many
friends. Let us fervently hope, when the
time comes to choose its design and general
appearance, that white will predominate
among the colours of our banner, because the
history of Canada is spotless.
Honourable senators, almost every day we
are the anxious witnesses to some shocking
and desolating spectacle in this world of ours.
The greatest cause for sadness of our present
century, you will all agree, is the existence
of the communist world and the knowledge of
the countless abominations and crimes perpetrated by its leaders. Without a doubt, the
application of its diabolical principles will
remain in the annals of history the greatest
subject of humiliation for the human mind.
If communism were to spread to the whole
world, I really wonder if life would be worth
living. When I see that entire nationsformerly accustomed to freedom and dignity
and now living under Moscow's yoke in the
most abject conditions-prefer death and
exile to the sort of life imposed upon them,
I do not think so.
We have the great satisfaction and joy of
seeing, on the other hand, the existence and
advantages of another civilization which
originated twenty centuries ago and to which
we have the good fortune to belong, our
Christian civilization.
The second reason for which we have teen
called and are actually gathered in session in
the Canadian Parliament is to allow the people of Canada, through their representatives
in the House of Commons and in the Senate,
to take a step which, in truth, does honour
to mankind. The ancient civilizations of
Egypt, Greece or Rome, however brilliant they
may have been, remained impervious to any
charitable motive. Today, the Christian world
has given free rein to its emotion and to its
tangible compassion before the terrible trials
of Hungary and the sight of this nation in
agony. Along with other countries, we shall
be able to help this nation, because there
are today certain governments whose thoughts
and decisions are inspired by the Gospel.
Canada is accustomed to helping the unfortunate, wherever they may be. In some
circles our Government has, I know, been
severely blamed for its generosity towards
other poor and unhappy countries, suffering
from want in far away lands.
Honourable senators, I would like to remind you that the benevolence of Canadians
has not made them any the poorer. Indeed,
Canada now stands third among the trading powers of the world. Canada entertains
commercial exchanges with other countries
and among our population of barely 16 million, more than 5ý million labourers earn

our country lias become a subject of admiration, of gratitude and of respect. It would

Han. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not intend ta continue the debate this
afternoon, but I wouid like ta say a few
words in order that there may be no misunderstandîng when I speak tomorrow.
Usually when honourabie senators,1 especiaiiy members of the Opposition, enter the
discussion on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne they talk about any
subject they choose. On two previous occasions during rny rnembership in this house
Parliament was cailed in special session. I
was a member of the Opposition party here
in 1939 when Parliament was called and
deciared war against Gerrnany. At that time
the Leader of the Opposition confined lis
rernarks to the issue o! the day. In August
o! 1950 1 had the honour of being the Leader
o! the Opposition in this chamber when
Parliament was called into special session
to deai primarily with the railway strîke.
On that occasion, when taking part in the
debate on the Address in reply ta the Speech

from the Throne, I limited my rernarks ta
the subi ects outlined i the Speech. In taking
part in the present debate 1 intend ta follow
the same course.
I would like to refer ta a few of the
subjects which. ordinarily I would have deait
with but which I arn gaing ta refrain from
discussing on this occasion. I arn doing
this in case somebody miglit later ask, and
quite properly, "Why didn't the Leader of
the Opposition deal with such and such a
subject?"
Honourabie senators, if this were not a
speciai session the first subi ect with which
1 would deai would be Canada's financial
situation as it affects aur governrnents at
dominion, provincial, municipal and school
board levels.
Another subject with which I ordinarily
would have deait is trade. Canada is at
present buying more goods on the world
market than it is selling. Uniess there has
been a change in the situation in the last
two or three months-and I doulit it-indications are that this year the value of our
imports will exceed the value of exports
by the iargest amount in aur history. This
is a subi ect I should like ta have discussed
in detail.
There is aiso a probiern with respect ta
current interest rates. This is a topic that
is being widely discussed riglit across
Carnada. I amn ot saying that the Goverament is ta blame, but I do think its whole
policy on interest rates, and the reason for
the present higli rates, shouid be autlined ta
the people. I arn not referring particuiarly
ta 'the interest you or I may have ta pay
on money we borrow from a bank or elsewhere, but I arn thinking of the whole
financiai structure of aur municipal governments, school boards and sa on, whose
development depends greatiy an the terms o!
loans that they need.
Another matter: the sarne aid prabiem that
has faced the Prairie provinces for the iast
two or three years is stili with us. As of
Navember 1 there were 825 million bushels
of wheat stored in aur grain elevators and
on aur farms, waiting ta be sold. Some of
this grain is part o! at ieast a two-year-oid
crap. Many people compiain that the farmers'
problerns are always with us, but this particubar prabiem is mucli more important ta the
Prairie provinces than the other provinces,
especiaiby Ontario and Quebec, seern ta
realize. However, as 1 do not intend ta deal
with the problem now I amn not going ta
suggest how it should be soived.
I want ta say quite candidly that I arn
very pleased that the Governrnent lias proposed ta aid Canadian culture by setting up a

SENATE
Canada Council to administer funds to assist
Canadian university construction. I understand that the Government also proposes to
ask Parliament to double the federal grant to
universities. On a previous occasion, when
the annual grant was set at $8 million, I
argued that it should have been at least
doubled. Well, now it is to be $16 million,
and I am sure it will be doubled again in the
lifetime of most of us in this chamber. As to
the amount of $50 million for university
construction, I feel this will be far from
sufficient. I am not exaggerating when I
say the amount should be $500 million. I
know something about the administrative
problems of universities. I happen to be
Chairman of the Board of Regents of a certain college which is affiliated with the University of Manitoba, and I know of the problems facing that university, which had to
turn away a large number of students this
year.
I am not enough of an artist or a musician
to make any comment about the university
scholarships and bursaries that are to be
provided to help Canadian painters, musicians
and dancers.
Another subject with which I would like
to have dealt is inflation. Now, I do not think
anyone should criticize a Government about
its handling of a certain problem without
making a reasonable suggestion for solving
that problem. I have heard a lot of suggested cures for inflation, and I have thought
of many myself, but I am not offering any
at this time. Inflation affects people in every
walk of life, particularly elderly pensioners

who find that their financial burdens increase
proportionately with the diminution of the
value of the dollar.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
talk about any of these subjects tomorrow.
Instead, I shall deal only with the matters
discussed by the mover (Hon. Mr. Wall) and
the seconder (Hon. Mr. Fournier) of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
Incidentally, this afternoon when the
seconder used the words "the honourable
senator from Winnipeg" in referring to the
mover of the Address, I was reminded of the
first debate I heard in this house. That was
in January of 1936. There was then a certain
member of this chamber who for many years
had been known as the honourable senator
from Winnipeg. I, too, was from Winnipeg
and when His Honour the Speaker had occasion to point out that "the honourable senator from Winnipeg said so and so"-meaning
me-the other gentleman from Winnipeg
rose and said, "Your Honour, I did not say
so and so. It was the junior senator from
Winnipeg". Again this afternoon it was the
junior senator from Winnipeg who spoke,
and he made a very good speech indeed.
I thank the house for allowing me to make
I will

On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

East today than in anything else I have

considerations. First, there are such quesThe Senate resumed from yesterday, con- tions as what the United Nations might have
sideration of His Excellency the Governor done, or what the United States should have
General's speech at the opening of the session done, what Britain and France did, and what

SENATE
Russia and certain other world nations did
in the particular circumstances. There is
the further major question of whether we
are just at the beginning of a world struggle,
or at the end of one. That question causes
deep concern to a great many people.
There are in our country people descended
from Scottish, English, French, Dutch and
many other racial origins. I took the trouble
the other day to look into the ancestral heritage of my sons. Their great-grandmother
on one side was born and educated in
France, and the one on the other side was
born and educated in Ireland. Their grandmothers were born and educated in Scotland
and their mother comes from Scottish parentage. I give that as an example of the
reason for the interest on the part of Canadian
people in the background of the problems
that affect other nations today.
I am thinking also of the people in Quebec,
whose ancestors for the most part are French,
although one finds in that province many
people who spring from Irish, English and
Scottish parentage.
If we go back in history we learn that
during the past two or three hundred years
Great Britain and France have been the
outstanding nations of the world. True, they
have at times stood on opposite sides, but
they have been outstanding in the conduct
of world affairs. For instance, at the outbreak of the Second World War it did not
take Churchill long to go to France and
assure that country that Britain would join
it in its fight for freedom and liberty. He
did not do that because of any false modesty,
but because he knew the French people,
knew that they loved their freedom of religion, of language and of assembly as dearly
as did Britain, and that they were determined
to stand against the Nazi ideology of life.
A similar situation exists today. But into
the world of today has been thrust an element
that even the best of us, men of the strongest
courage, cannot cope with, and we cannot
estimate what the future holds for any of us.
Those of us who have had the pleasure
and honour of attending at the United Nations
Assemblies, no matter in what capacity, have
learned that Russia herself-her satellites do
not count-seems to be unable to convince
other people that she is genuinely in favour
of doing the things that the free world thinks
ought to be done. Russia cannot be led to
believe that ber word ought to be as good as
her bond, that she should encourage freedom
and allow men and women of all classes the
right to lead a normal family life as people
do in other parts of the world. Apparently
the extension of communism depends on suppressing these things.

Now, let us look at the situation in the
Middle East. What were the conditions there
before Britain and France moved in at all?
It must be remembered that for mýany
hundreds of years Israel had been occupied
by the Arabs, but they were pushed out,
largely through the efforts of the United
States at the time of the settlement, when the
Israeli people were put in. Now, it must be
admitted that the Israelis did have a claim
on that country, for it was their former home.
But the Arabs will not admit it and do not
want the Israelis to stay there. Then apparently the United States has refused to
acknowledge its obligation to maintain things
in the Middle East, things that only she and
Russia can take care of. We might as well
look the situation straight in the face and
admit that a great world struggle is going on
and may go on for many years to come.
I cannot help thinking of the message General Gruenther gave us here in this very
building, in the Railway Committee room, a
year or two ago. In reply to the question
"What would happen if Russia attacked?"
he said, "In half an hour our bombers, loaded
with bombs, would be up in the air and on
their way to bomb Russia". He repeated
that warning here the other day. We have
not got over that feeling.
And now this is what we are up against: a
dictatorship
was established in Egypt.
Nasser is a dictator. I say that without fear
of contradiction.
We know now that he
hoped that the United States and Great Britain would lend his government the money
with which to build a dam across the Nile
and make more water available to produce
cheap food in his country. I have no firsthand knowledge of why the United States
refused the loan. It may be because it found
out that, behind its back, Egypt was dealing
with one of the Russian satellites for the purchase of war materials-which in fact were
provided, and with which Nasser intended to
assert what he thought were his rights against
Israel. I am not here to defend Israel. But
if Israel, which was established by the free
nations of the world, presents any problem,
it is for those nations to find some way of
dealing with it in the light of their own best
judgment; it is not for Russia to dictate what
shall be done.
As soon as the United States found out that
Egypt had acquired these armaments, it
ceased to supply her with money. What happened then? Israel attacked. I do not know
just why, but I do know that had I been
in their place I would have attacked too,Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.

NOVEMBER 28, 1956
Hon. Mr. Haig: -because Jordan and Egypt
were preparing for war, and other adjacent
countries were opposed to Israel. Selfdefence has always been considered justifiable. The Israelis, knowing what was coming,
moved in on the Egyptians, and the Egyptians
simply faded out. No other expression
describes it. They made practically no
defence; some 54,000 men surrendered, with
arms and munitions worth millions of dollars
which had been supplied by Russia's satellites.
Previously Nasser had nationalized the
Suez canal. There are differences of opinion
as to whether he did so in pursuance of a
legal right, since the company in possession
has a contract which runs another eight or
ten years. If the Egyptian Government had
paid the operators in full there might have
been some ground for the seizure. I am not
going to argue the matter, because it does
not enter into the subject of debate. But
what followed? The canal was blocked with
boats filled with cement and sunk by Egypt.
That was no evidence of peaceful action; it
indicated a determination to make it impossible for France or Britain or any other
nation to use the waterway.
So Britain and France, faced with these
conditions, and knowing that Russia was
supplying arms and munitions to the Middle
East-we now find that Syria is ready to ally
herself with the communist states-took positive action. It may be that they should have
notified the United Nations, Canada and
other powers of their intentions. But let me
remind honourable senators in this connection that, but for the absence of Russia frorn
the Security Council meeting when the
Korean situation was being considered, the
United States would never have been allowed
to enter Korea, because if Russia had been
present she would have vetoed the resolution
for United Nations action.
My next point is this. In recent months,
before the Suez incident, Russia had made
a deal with Poland which was carried
through. Then, at the time when British and
French troops moved into the canal zone,
Russian troops took over Hungary. The United
Nations voted condemnation of Russia, but
what else have they done but pass pious
resolutions? We are now about to provide a
million dollars in aid of the Hungarians who
have been driven from their native land, but
the United Nations did nothing, and the
United States did nothing.
I hold in my hand two editorials from New
York newspapers. If anyone objects to my
reading them I will not do so.
An Hon. Senator: Go ahead.

Hon. Mr. Haig: One is headed "Death"; the
other, "Stalin Lives Again in Death". One
appeared in the New York Times, the other
in the New York Herald Tribune. I will read
only a sentence or so:
"Helpi Helpt Helpi"
These were the last words heard by a shocked
world as Red barbarians strangled the last free
voices in martyred Hungary.
What the writer is saying is simply this,
that the United States ought to have moved
in and defended Hungary, that it should not
have been content with pious resolutions
which could have no effect on Russia.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Do you mean the United
Nations should have moved in?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. I am not blaming nor
praising the United Nations. The UN is
an experiment which in my judgment can
be a success only if every member is willing
to do its part. The United Nations has
no force to command at will. What could
it have done in Hungary? The only nation
which could have intervened effectively is
the United States, and it did not do so. That
there was an election pending at the time
is not to the point. Probably the Russians
counted on it as likely to prevent action. I
do not know. But the United States is in
fact the United Nations: there can be no
question about it. Admittedly more than
seventy other countries are represented in
the United Nations, but if the United States
will not act no other country can be counted
upon to do so. Now Nasser has the audacity
to demand that the canal which was blocked
by his action should be cleared by the United
Nations, and that if the British and French
do not pay the cost, the United States should
do so. It is things like that which make us
wonder why people depend on the United
Nations so much. I am not saying that it has
no value, for it helps in the matter of negotiations, talks and interviews. It may help
to keep the peace to some extent, but you
cannot maintain peace between two great
nations like Russia and the United States,
if they finally come to grips, for those two
countries are never going to sit down together until one of them is master of the
world. You can take it or leave it. That
is the truth, and nothing we can do will
prevent this situation from developing. There
is no use in saying that Russia is not going
to allow this to happen. If she gains control
of the Middle East as she now controls the
eastern part of Europe, she will be in a
position to control the world, and poor little
Canada will say, "Yes, yes". That will be
the end of it.
I return now to the editorial to which I
was referring earlier. It says that the United

SENATE
States should have asked the United Nations
to do something about the situation in the
Middle East and that if the United Nations
failed to take action, then the United States
herself should have done so. Everyone knew
that Russia was sending arms into Egypt,
just as everyone knew that Nasser was a
dictator. Everyone knew what the Arabs
wanted, and that Russia was going to back
them. The United States knew that, and
now her President says he wants to hold
a meeting with leaders from Britain and
France in order to keep the three Western
powers-the United States, Britain and
France-together. Well, these three powers
will not be kept together if Europe is made
to starve for oil.
Hon.

Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my friend
a question? As I understand it, the
he referred to said that the United
not the United Nations, should have
to help Hungary.

Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it did not say that. It
said that a move should have been made
to help settle the Middle East situation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My question bears on that
too. If the United States had made such
a move, does my friend think that it would
have led immediately to a general war?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think so. I do
not think Russia would get into a general
war unless she thought the dice were loaded
in her favour.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a matter of opinion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: General Gruenther is right.
The dice are not loaded for Russia yet, but
they will be if Russia is allowed to move
into the Middle East and take over control
of the oil supply in that part of the world.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do not point at me.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, you are the honourable gentleman who asked me a question.
Russia will not move in now. If what General Gruenther told us was the truth, and
I presume it was, the United States would
be ready within half an hour to retaliate
against any Russian attack. My honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) was
present and heard him say that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: A move by the United
States might have meant a general war.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It means one anyway. That
is the terrible part of it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That may be.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Neville Chamberlain
thought he could prevent a second world war
by yielding to Hitler's demands at Munich,

but he was wrong. He had a chance to deal
with Hitler in another way, but he trusted
him.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And you applauded Chamberlain at that time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The words "Don't be a
Chamberlain" will go down in history. Our
people seem to be afraid to go to war, but
I don't think we will have to. As General
Gruenther said, there won't be war as long
as Russia knows we hold the position of
supremacy, but the minute she thinks she
holds it she will go to war. Everybody
here knows that to be the fact.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not agree with all that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When it came to a showdown I think the least Canada should have
done-I may be entirely wrongHon. Mr. Euler: You probably are.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, the stand that I take,
and I am persuaded it is the stand of the
majority of the people of Canada,Hon. Mr. Euler: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend says,
"No", but I do not know. He would be surprised.
Hon. Mr. Howard: What is the stand?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it is the stand of
the majority of Canadians that when the
chips were down Canada should have stood
four-square with Britain and France.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sometimes when certain
issues have been raised men and women have
said to me, "Senator Haig, I have FrenchCanadian blood and I feel the action that
is being taken now is strongly pro-British.
I don't think we should do so and so." At
other times people have said, "I think this
matter is very pro-French, but I am proBritish and I do not think we should do this."
But that sort of thing does not apply here
at all. This is a vital question that affects
Canadian descendants of both French and
English, yet our Government is taking the
attitude that Britain and France have done
wrong. Throughout history these countries
have always fought for freedom. Everybody
knew what was happening in the Middle East,
and Britain and France took steps to prevent
it, but the plain fact is that the United States
refused to offer any help. It never moved in.
It took no responsibility at all, yet the United
States was one of the countries responsible
for the establishment of the State of Israel.
I admit the British were in favour, but not
too much so. In the early twenties Britain's

NOVEMBER 28, 1956
Balfour was for it, but not so much the
present generation. The Balfour Declaration
was put into effect and was lived up to, but
the British have really been more favourably
disposed to Jordan and the other Arab states.
That is the situation.
This whole matter is going to be a vital
issue in Canada's next general election. Make
no mistake about that. When I vote I will
have to decide whether or not I support those
who condemn the stand taken by Britain and
France. That will be the issue. Having the
knowledge that Russia has put arms into the
Middle East and that Nasser, the dictator,
bas deliberately wrecked ships in the Suez
Canal in order to block oil supplies to Britain,
France and other European countries, am I
to turn around and condemn Britain and
France for moving into the Middle East? Do
you think the United Nations would have
given Britain and France the authority to
move into the Middle East to deal with the
canal situation, or to stop Russian arms going
into that part of the world? The Arabs could
not operate their own machines and Russians
were sent to help them. Those are solemn
facts. I do not speak for anybody else, but
as long as I have the strength to draw a
breath I will stand on the side of England
and France, and not on the side of Russia.
That is the whole issue.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is not the point at all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: These fundamental facts
will face us and our descendants as long as
Russia stands as a threat to humanity. People
say Russia would not do these things, but she
did in Hungary and in every other part of
Europe she has touched. We thought a new
co-existence would be possible between the
Western nations and Russia after Stalin's
death, but things are worse now than ever
before. All Stalin did was to kill off some
of his own countrymen, but his successors are
killing men, women and children of other
countries. It is a terrible situation. Canada
has never been confronted by anything like it
before. We faced the threat of war in 1914
and again in 1939, but we are now facing the
most difficult situation of all times. You
have only to read press dispatches and listen
to the radio to learn who is running the show.
Nasser is running the show. He says, "We
will let these men come in-provided so and
so; otherwise, out they go." That is what his
representative told them the other day at
the United Nations. The Prime Minister, or
the Minister for External Affairs, received a
letter saying that he did not mean that, but
nevertheless he said it. It was a challenge to
the world that Nasser could run the canal,
that Britain and France would pay the costs,

and that the armies of the United States and
Russia should chase them out. Those are
things which are just a little too much for
me, and I think they are a little too much
for most Canadians. I say that quite candidly
and determinedly. I will do anything I can
to re-establish the name and the honour of
Britain and France in Canada, so that the
people of French or British descent will feel
proud of their ancestors and of the countries
from which they came. I may be all alone,
but I will do my best to do that.
I now come to Hungary. What can we
say about Hungary? I hear criticism here
of the French and the British. I hear very
little criticism of Russia, although that country not only overran Hungary but murdered
many of its people. I have not heard the
Government of Canada say much about that
at all, or make any great row about it at the
United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Did you read the
Prime Minister's letter to Mr. Bulganin?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but that was after it
was all over. Anybody can write letters, but
they do not mean much.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What is your
proposal?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I do not know; I am
not paying too much attention to that. What
I am saying is that at the United Nations
there was not the same condemnation by
Canada of Russia's action against Hungary as
there was of Britain and France, by not
voting in their favour. That is what the
people of Canada do not understand, and
they are worried about it; they want to know
why. Only a couple of weeks ago a reporter
from the CBC said that the intellectuals of
Great Britain were opposed to the Eden Government, but that the man on the street was
for the Government; and he said that the
popular polls would show that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The by-election did not
show it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The by-election was all
right; the Government candidate had a larger
majority than in the previous by-election.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I disagree. The majority
was tremendously reduced in that by-election.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The majority in a byelection is always much smaller than in a
general election. It is generally about nine
per cent less, and this time it was only five
per cent less; that information was given
over the air by a man who was opposed to
the Government. That is the situation, and
I do not care whether the honourable member
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) or anybody

SENATE
else thinks otherwise. I do not think this
country will stand for our condemning
Britain and France and at the same time
being very lukewarm in our condemnation of
Russia's attack on Hungary.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my friend?
He has no right to make the assertion that
Canada or the Secretary of State for External
Affairs bas not joined in condemning the
action of Russia.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This is a pretty good campaign of interruption. My honourable friend
has the right to speak when I am through.
Hon. Mr. Euler: When you make incorrect
statements I will interrupt every time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not afraid of your
interruptions at all, but on a subject like this
I like to feel free from little attacks as I go
along. Of course, you may interrupt if you
wish. I admit that the majority of this bouse
is very one-sided, but I do not mind that;
that is not the problem. The problem is what
the people of this country think. In my judgment the majority of the people think as I
have stated, and I am persuaded that that is
the view that posterity will take.
Honourable senators, I have no objection
at all to voting money for the people of
Hungary who have been thrown out of their
homes, or to the policy of the Government
in admitting refugees into Canada. I think
it is a fine idea. I also think that the Minister
of Citizenship and Immigration is doing a
splendid job in preparing to receive those
people here. When the time comes, I will
vote for it. I thought that the original amount
of $100,000 was too low.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, not $100,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Was it $200,000?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. You are speaking of the immediate payment; it was never
intended that that was to be the total
payment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that $200,000
was the sum first mentioned, and that then
it was raised to $1 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It was intended to
be $1 million from the beginning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The press statement which
I read was that $200,000 would be given toward the relief of the destitute in Hungary.
I agreed to that, and also agreed when the
amount was raised to $1 million. I do not
object to that at all. But I do not think we
fully realize the situation that Britain and
France found themselves in, facing, as they
thought, certain possibilities in the Middle

East. They moved in to try to prevent those
from developing. Whether they were right
or wrong, posterity alone will decide. In
my judgment, posterity will decide that they
were right, in the whole circumstances of the
case. I think it will also decide that the
United States was, as it always has beenand I say this advisedly-late in coming in.
She was late in World War II. Pearl Harbor
had to be attacked before she would come in
at all-about a year after the war had started.
She was late in World War I, declaring that
it was not her business; but a great and
wealthy nation has as part of her business
certain responsibilities to the rest of the world,
and must see that those responsibilities are
carried out. Editorials have pointed out that
the United States does not seem to realize
that she has grown up and should take her
share of the responsibilities.
As far as Canada is concerned, I am glad
that the Minister for External Affairs moved
for a police force in the Middle East, but I
am afraid it was too late. Nasser said he
would not have our men there, that their uniforms looked like British uniforms. It was
Nasser, mind you, and nobody else, who said
he would not have them. It was stated in
the other place that it was because our fiag
is the same as that of Great Britain that he
did not want them there, but the truth is
that Nasser said our uniforms reminded
him of the British soldier and he did not
want that kind of thing there.
It puzzles me why Canada should allow a
man like him to tell us what we should do
or should not do. When the matter was
being debated in the United Nations why did
we not object to his stand? A police force
was asked for, and we were prepared to
contribute our share with a contingent of
1,000 or 1,200 men. Instead of that we were
told we would be allowed to send clerical
help, stenographers, dishwashers, cooks and
potato peelers, but no fighting men. Why
should we listen to any such suggestions from
Mr. Nasser?
For those reasons, honourable senators, I
think we are making a grave mistake in the
stand we have taken in this whole affair.
I am absolutely opposed to any condenmnation of Great Britain and France. With all
the facts before me and in calm consideration
I would have supported fully the action
taken by those two great nations.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, my first remarks must be to congratulate
the mover (Hon. Mr. Wall) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Fournier) of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. This is indeed a very critical time in our history, as

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
the Honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) lias said, and we are therefore most fortunate in the selection of honourable senators to move and second the Address.
1 f eel it was most appropriate that the
honourable junior senator from Winnipeg, as
the Leader of the Opposition referred to hlm
yesterday, moved the Address. He was born
of Ukranian parents. He has a wide knowledge of conditions in Eastern Europe and in
Asia, and can speak feelingly on what is
taking place today in Hungary. In his speech
lie told us that in the land of lis parents there
are conditions similar to those in Hungary
today, wliere there is no freedom and the
people are under the iron heel of Russia.
The honourable junior senator from Winnipeg has also a wide knowledge of Canada.
Furthermore, lie lias been one of Canada's
delegates to the United Nations, and the experience gained through mingllng with representatives of many countries of the world
made him ail the more qualified to move, as
he did so eloquently, the Address ini reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
I wish also to say liow very pleased I was
to liear the address by the seconder, the
honourable senator from de Lan-audière (Hon.
Mr. Fournier). I liad the privilege of liearing
hlm speak in the House of Conimons, and
therefore anticipated an outstanding address
from him. The main part of lis speech was
in Frenchi, and in that language I shall now
congratulate hlm and make a brief comment
upon one of the points that lie made.
(Translation):
I wish to congratulate the lionourable
senator who seconded tlie Address in reply
to the Speech from tlie Tlirone. As we al
know, lie is an experienced parliamentarian,
so that the ciarity and excellence of the
remarks lie made botli in English and in
French surprised no one and we would like
to express to hlm our sincere appreciation.
In thie course of lis speech yesterday, the
honourable senator fromn DeLanaudière mentioned that we should liave a distinctive
national flag and I arn sure tliat most
honourable
senators
agree
wltli
hlm.
However, as we have lad occasion to note
recently, public opinion on this point is far
from being unanimous in the different parts
of Our country. I think we are ail of tlie
opinion tliat a national flag miglit lielp to
unify our great Canadian nation, but it
slould not tend to divide us or cause dissension among us. Tliere is no doubt wlatever that the moment Canadians can agree
on the question, Canada will have its own
flag.

(Text):
Honourable senators, the Leader of the
Opposition ini lis opening remarks yesterday referred to certain subjects whicl lie
would not discuss at this time because this
is an emergency session of Parliament. I am
grateful to hlm for giving me notice of the
subjects which lie proposes to discuss when
Parliament reassembles in January, and I
assure hlm tliat lie will be well satisfied
witl the action the Government is taking in
regard to ail these matters. Tlie Government
is giving full consideration to a satisfactory
solution of these problems lie mentioned,
and when we meet here next session Canada
will stili be one o! tlie most prosperous
countries in the world and one of the most
desirable in whicli to live.
I do not; agree witli ail that the Leader o!
the Opposition said in his speech today. He
said 'le spoke for himself, and I hope that
is true, because I do flot believe lie spoke
for any large segment of the Canadian people.
I doubt very mucli that lie spoke for his
party; certainly, lie did not dlaim to do so.
I would have preferred that lie did not make
tlie speech lie made today, because I belleve
that if Canada and the other nations liad
taken the attitude whidi lie advocates we
would have now been involved in a world
war.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Wliat if we are involved
in one anyway, sooner or later?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Leader o! the
Opposition suggested that the United States
and Russia miglit come to grips. Now,
lionourable senators, I am sure that if those
two countries come to grips it will mean the
end of the world. That is the very situation
we are trying to avoid. Canada, in ail lier
actions, lias done nothing to injure eitlier
the United Kingdom or France. Our every
effort lias been not only to save the United
Kingdom and France from a world war, but
to preserve peace for the world. 1 shahl refer
in more detail later to some of the other
remarks whicli my lionourable friend made
wlien, as lie said, lie was speaking for
limself.
However, I did agree witli the lionourable
leader opposite wlien lie said that we are living in very difficuit times. Quite apart from
wliat lias taken place in the Suez area, we
have witnessed as brutal and criminal a
betrayal o! the Hungarian people as lias ever
been known in the history o! the world. Those
people are asking for nothing more than the
riglit to run their own affairs free from, communistic colonial domination, but yet Soviet
tanks and Soviet guns were sent into that
country and many tliousands of those
wonder!ul people were mercilessly butchered.

SENATE
Fifty thousand, sixty thousand, or seventy
thousand refugees have left Hungary, but
Hungary still lives, and I am satisfied that
most of us in this chamber will live to see
the day when she will be free again.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That will be one of
our aims.
Now what did Canada do when Hungary
was being overrun by these Russian hordes?
Previously we had become signatories to the
covenant in the United Nations Charter. We
attended the United Nations Assembly and
we joined in the strongest terms in condemning Russia for its treatment of Hungary.
Also, as I mentioned during the speech of
the Leader of the Opposition, our Prime Minister took it upon himself to write a letter
to Mr. Bulganin appealing for a halt to the
butchery practised by the Russian soldiers
in Hungary. We did all in our power at that
time to stop the massacre. Since then, we
have thrown wide the doors of Canada to
Hungarian refugees.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No country in the
world has opened its doors wider to Hungarian refugees than has Canada. We welcome them. To facilitate their movement to
Canada we have sent all the planes at our
disposal to Austria, to which country large
numbers of the refugees have fled. We have
waived medical examinations and other usual
requirements; we have even advanced loans
to pay for their transportation.
Honourable senators, what more can we do?
If any honourable member can suggest anything more that Canada can do to help the
refugees from Hungary I assure you that the
Government will implement his suggestion,
if it is at all practicable.
We have done our best as a Government,
as your representatives. And Parliament now
is doing its best. There remains one thing
that we can all do, and that is to assist these
refugees when they arrive in Canada. They
have had a hard time, have suffered many
privations, and it is our duty and responsibility, yours and mine-the duty and responsibility of all the people of Canada-to
welcome them here and to help them become
established in their new homes.
Now, honourable senators, I think I should
refer briefly to the steps which have been
taken at the United Nations to assure, as far
as possible that we should have peace in
the world.
In the first place let me point out that we
are members of the United Nations Organization, we are signatories to the covenant. We
passed an act of Parliament in this chamber

by which we undertook to do certain things.
Therefore, we just cannot say "Oh, we don't
care now about the United Nations," or
"We should not be in the United Nations".
The fact is that we are in the United Nations.
And even if we had not signed the covenant
but had only given our word, surely our
word is as good as our bond.
After the trouble arose in the Suez-and
I am not going to condemn anyone because
of what took place there, for I know the
Israeli people were hard pressed-what did
we find? We found that we were nearer to
a world war because of what was happening.
So the United Nations assembled, and the
first proposal that was made was for consideration of the Suez problem. That is the
proposal which, I take it, the Leader of the
Opposition objects to.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: No, that is not correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What else could we
do? The proposal was that this matter of
the Suez should be considered by the United
Nations. Now, was not one of the main
reasons for establishing the United Nations
that it should deal with such matters? Could
we have said, "Oh, no, this thing should not
even be mentioned by the United Nations"?
That is the attitude of the Russians: they
want to do everything on their own. But,
true to our covenant we voted for consideration of this matter by the United Nations.
And when it came before the assembly the
first proposal was a resolution for a cease-fire.
Now our purpose, notwithstanding what has
been said by the Leader of the Opposition,
was that the world should get out of this
crisis without a war and without violating
the principles and Charter of the United
Nations. That was our main aim, to keep
the world at peace. Another and equal aim
was to hold the Commonwealth together. That
at all times has been one of Canada's main
purposes, and I say this country has played
a creditable, indeed a marvellous, part in
this respect. Indeed, but for Canadian action
I do not believe the Commonwealth would
be as secure as it is today. Ours is and
will continue to be a great association of
peoples, and Canada will do all in its power
to keep the Commonwealth as great as it is.
The first resolution which was brought
forward for the cessation of fighting was
one which we did not approve. We thought
it had been introduced too hurriedly and
that it would not have the desired effect.
There was a second cease-fire resolution,
which had as its object not only to bring
fighting to an end but to prevent military
aid from being accorded to various other
countries, because it might encourage them
to line up on one side or the other and so,
almost inevitably, precipitate a world conflict.

NOVEMBER 28, 1956
We did not believe the cease-fire resolution went far enough and we abstained from
voting on it. But immediately thereafter
we proposed by resolution that fighting should
cease and that a United Nations police force
should go into Egypt to supervise the maintenance of the peace. This is the resolution
under which the present force has been set
up and made effective. It was provided that
the Secretary General should report back
in 48 hours with a plan for the setting up of
the force. At the same time an Asian-Arab
bloc of 19 states brought forward a resolution for a cease-fire and a withdrawal, but
fortunately Canada, through the instrumentality of our own great Secretary of State
for External Affairs, was able to get through
the General Assembly prior passage of his
police resolution. It was carried unanimously.
That is, 54 nations voted for it; and although
19 nations abstained, not one opposed the
Canadian proposition for the setting up of the
force. Surely neither the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) nor anyone else can say that we were not acting in
the interests of the United Kingdom. In
fact, our Secretary of State for External
Affairs had been in touch with the British
representatives, and the spokesman of the
United Kingdom at the UN made this
statement:
The first urgent task is to separate Israel and
Egypt and to stabilize the position. That is our
purpose. If the United Nations were willing to
take over the physical task of maintaining peace
in that area no one would be better pleased than
us. But police action there must be to separate
the belligerents and to stop hostilities.
Clearly then, we were working in accord
with the wishes of the United Kingdom. It
is true that both Britain and France abstained
from voting, but it is also true that both
Governments subsequently expressed their
appreciation of the initiative which was
shown by the Canadian delegation and which
resulted in the adoption of the resolution.
The Asian-Arab resolution was subsequently
carried by 59 votes against 5.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
stated in effect that the United Nations is
just an organization for "talk, talk, talk" and
"words, words, words". Well, in so far as
Canada is concerned that has not been the
case to date. Immediately the resolution to
set up a UN police force was adopted, Canada,
whose representative had done a great deal
of talking up to that time, immediately took
action and volunteered to provide a regiment
to form part of the force. Is not that action?
That is not "words, words, words". And the
regiment is ready to go. Who stopped it
from going?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Nasser.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: President Nasser? No,
it was not be who prevented the regiment
from going. Who is heading this UN police
force? A great Canadian, of whom we are
all proud, General Burns. It was he, and no
other, who stopped the contingent from going.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Because he was told.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
seems to know more about what took
place between General Burns, the Secretary
General of the United Nations and others
than the rest of us do. But I can assure him
that the Canadian force takes orders from no
one except General Burns. It was he who
decided what force we should send. When an
infantry battalion is needed, and when
General Burns says it ought to go, it will go.
In the meantime what are we doing? We
provided an airlift. Some of us here may
consider ourselves to be great military strategists, may think we know more about running
General Burns' job than the general himself
does, but it was he who told us that what
should now be sent was, not a thousand
infantrymen, but as many aeroplanes as we
could get to carry our people from Italy to
the Suez. Should we tell General Burns that
he does not know what be is talking about,
that we are not going to provide aeroplanes,
that we insist on sending soldiers? That is
what the honourable Leader of the Opposition
suggests. If that were done, what kind of an
army would we have; what kind of a job
could General Burns do? He would be helpless. I can assure honourable senators that
we shall be pleased-and I know they will
back us up-to carry out every request that
General Burns, and he alone, makes of us.
The Government having decided to send
this force, Parliament was called. You may
ask, why was Parliament called? When Parliament was in session in 1950 in connection
with the sending of forces to Korea, the
Prime Minister gave an undertaking that in
the future whenever forces were to be sent
out of Canada for any reason other than the
Korean war, an order in council would be
passed and Parliament would be summoned
within ten days to approve or disapprove
of the necessary expenditure. That undertaking was given because the terms of the act
establishing the Korean force were so wide
that under them the regular armed forces of
Canada could be sent at any time to any part
of the world for United Nations' purposes.
The Prime Minister gave his word that he
would respect the provisions of section 33 of
the National Defence Act, which reads:
Whenever the Governor in Council places the

Canadian forces or any service, component or unit

thereof on active service, if Parliament is then
separated by such adjournment or prorogation as
will not expire within ten days, a proclamation

SENATE
shall be issued for the meeting of Parliament
within ten days, and Parliament shall accordingly
meet and sit upon the day appointed by such
proclamation, and shall continue to sit and act in
like manner as If it had stood adjourned or
prorogued to the same day.

So, in accordance with that undertaking,
and an order in council having been passed,
Parliament was called to approve or disapprove of the Government's action in passing
this order in council and in providing for
the expenses of sending troops to the Middle
East.
The Secretary General of the United
Nations was required to make a report within
48 hours as to what the United Nations forces
should consist of. Well, he made his report
within 24 hours, and a resolution was subsequently passed by the United Nations
approving what he had done in setting up
this force.
Let me remind the house that it was a
resolution proposed by Canada which set up
the United Nations Police Force. It was a
Canadian who was elected as the General of
that force, and when an advisory committee
of seven member nations was appointed to
work with the Secretary General, Canada was
named as one of them. So once again Canada
is playing an important role in maintaining
peace in the world. I might mention that
this committee consists of representatives
from Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Colombia, Norway and Canada.
On the same evening that the resolution
was passed approving of the action taken by
the Secretary General, a nineteen-power
resolution demanding immediate withdrawal
of forces from the Suez district, from the
whole area, was passed by a vote of 65 to 1,
with 10 abstentions. Israel was the only country that voted against it. The United Kingdom and France did not vote against it; they
abstained. There was no objection to the
resolution, for the forces were being withdrawn. The United Kingdom and France had
already commenced to withdraw their forces,
so there was actually no reason why the
resolution should have been passed. The word
"immediately" was already inserted in the
resolution-requiring that the forces were to
be withdrawn immediately. Canada refused
to vote for the resolution unless it was explained whether the word "immediately"
meant that the United Kingdom and French
forces would not be withdrawn before the
United Nations forces had been moved there
and were operating satisfactorily. And that
is the position Canada takes today.
There were two more resolutions moved,
but I do not think I need to refer to them
here. The position we find ourselves in today
is that as we are moving the United Nations

Police Force into the Middle East in sufficient strength and with sufficient organization, the United Kingdom and the French
forces are moving out. And who is objecting?
Not the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is approving all that is being done. As
their representative said at the United
Nations, "When there is a force sufficiently
well organized in there, we will move out".
The United Kingdom is living up to the terms
of the resolution.
Honourable senators, in conclusion I wish
to say that I think at this time Canadians
have every reason to be probably the proudest
people in the world for what their representatives have done.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cannot speak too
highly of our representative the Secretary of
State for External Affairs. His task has been
a most difficult one. Primarily, the minister's
task has been to do his best to maintain
peace in the world, but he has also striven for
maintenance of the feeling of friendship
and helpfulness which has always existed
among the Western democracies. Oh, I regretted to hear the words of the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) today when
he criticized our great neighbour to the south,
the United States, for the two countries have
always worked well together in the past, and
we have both worked well together for the
peace of the world. The Leader of the Opposition, however, used infiammatory words
which would tend to cause ill feeling, malice
and hatred between Canada and the United
States. I am sure that no honourable senator
in this chamber wants any ill feeling, malice
or hatred on the part of this country toward
the United States.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We have lived in
peace and harmony with the United States
over the years. We do not necessarily do
what they want us to do. If the honourable
leader opposite followed the debates in the
United Nations, which apparently he has not
done, he would find that we have not supported the United States resolutions at all
times. We have an independence of our own;
we act in a Canadian way, and at no time
take dictation from the United States. I
feel that we have played our part well. We
have come to the aid of Hungary to the
greatest extent that we can; we want to help
those people, and we are ready for further
suggestions. We have done what we offered
to do under the terms of the United Nations
Charter, and we have been faithful to its
covenants. We are doing our best to live in
peace and harmony with the nations of the

NOVEMBER 28, 1958
world, and we are doing oui- best to continue
good relationships among the great Commnonwealth of Nations. I think honourable senators mnust agree with me that, considering
ail that has been done during the last month,
Canada has played a magnificent role in
maintaining the peace of the world. I hope
it will continue to be maintaîned.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. H. de M. Molson: Honourable senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, ini
speaking on the Address in reply to the
Speech fromn the Throne, I do so with some
hesitation, partly because of the very brief
time I have been a member of this chamber,
and partly because I realize that my contribution will appear drab, indeed, in comparison
with the eloquence of my colleagues wvhom I
have been privileged to hear.
Nevertheless, I arn encouraged to say my
piece by the wonderfully warmn welcome and
friendly reception accorded by honourable
senators to us when we came here last session.
That welcome, foilowed by wholehearted co-operation and sincerely offered
friendship, is more deeply appreciated by me,
and I am sure those appointed with me, than
I can say.
Honourable senators, at this special session
the Speech from the Throne deait with only
two subi ects; first, Canada's participation in
the United Nations Emergency Force for the
Middle East; and, second, provision for relief
for the gallant Hungarian victims in their
desire for freedom.
In the Middle East, for some time now, we
have had an anti-European dictator trying to
build himself an empire. His apparent aims
were to 'become the "Fuehrer" of ail Ai-abs
and to exterminate the State of Israel. The
way in which he disregarded the Suez Canal
Treaty and obtained vast quantities of military supplies from. the Russian areas showed
the inevitability of trouble in those countries.
For years provocation succeeded provocation.
Finally Israel decided-rightly or wronglythat her only chance of survival lay in miiitary action.
There is no doubt in my mind that the
vacillations of American foreign policy were
in large measure responsible for these
developments. It is also true that the United
Nations showed itself incapable or unwiiling
to stop the constant armed skirmishes and
the denial of the Suez to Israeli shipping.
With the Israeli advance into Egypt Britain
and France felt that their own survivai depended on the security of the canal. There
81541-3

were perhaps even stronger reasons, such as
another Soviet liberation of the whole Middle
East-I use the word "Ilberation" in the
Russian sense. I have not been told those
reasons, s0 I cannot judge.
At this stage Canada was faced with perhaps one of the most important decisions of
her young international 11f e, when the United
Nations met to deal with these emergencieswhether to follow the heart and let loyalty
to the two nations which gave her birth
dictate her actions, or to adhere to the United
Nations Charter, which she had signed, and
which denies war as an instrument of policy.
That was a truly agonizing decision, but I arn
one of those-perhaps because we were neyer
fully informed by oui- Allies-who believe
that the British Commonwealth and perhaps
the United Nations might not have survived
the loss of confidence which any decision
other than the one taken would have entailed.
I was very proud of Canada for coming Up
with the resolution for the formation of the
United Nations force which. was so warmly
received at that time of crisis at the United
Nations, and wîthout in any way accepting
any political implication, because I am not
ashamed of being an Independent. I was
extremely proud of our Secretary of State
for External Aiffairs for his handling and
presentation of our responsibility at the
United Nations Assembly.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, we
are now considering our action in the light
of the United Nations' effort to restore peace
and order. Perhaps I am not a particularly
good judge of the wishes of the people of
Canada. Certainly, I am the poorest authority on matters political. However, for what
it is worth I believe that the duty of this
honourable Senate to the people of this counitry is to deal with this matter as one of
national urgency, to leave out politics and to
act as efficiently and expeditiously as is
within our power. Our position in the outside world will be a reflection of our actions
now.
Honourable senators, I now come to the
second reason for the calling of this special
session, to vote relief for the Hungarians.
It is difficuit for anyone brought Up as
Canadians are to speak rationally on this
issue. Believing in God as we do, and accepting murder, rape, slavery, deportation, starvation, brain-washing and any f orm of torture
to be weapons employed only by barbarians,
how can we view the magnificent courage,
the suffering and endurance of these Hungarian heroes without emotion? And, conversely,
how can we look on the actions of Russians
without emotion?

SENATE
Perhaps the time has come for us to invite
the Russians in our midst to go home. We
have experienced, thanks to one Russian with
a conscience, Igor Gouzenko, the Russian
interpretation of friendship for Canada. Most
of us have had no illusions as to the reasons
for the vast Russian embassy and staff in
Canada, quite out of keeping with the
exchange of trade, culture or visitors between
the two countries. Perhaps we should add
our voices to the chorus swelling through the
Iron Curtain from all over Eastern Europe,
and say "Ivan, go home."
Incidentally, I noted by the press that a
member of the United States Senate suggested not only a rupture of diplomatic relations between his country and the Soviet
Union, but that all countries of our way of
thought should break off diplomatic relations
with Russia, apply sanctions and in fact
isolate the Soviet Union until such time as it
complies with the United Nations resolution.
The suggestion made on Monday by the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) that we rise for a minute of silent
prayer in sympathy for the Hungarian people
may have broken precedent, but my reaction
was that never was precedent broken for a
better cause.
We are so fortunate in this country that we
probably will never appreciate what it means
to be oppressed. We talk glibly about democracy, but I wonder how hard we would
fight for it until we had experienced the
misery of a life without it. We have not
been occupied by alien forces who find it
simpler to shoot first and talk afterwards.
On this point I do not forget that my
French colleagues could remind me that
British forces occupied New France a couple
of hundred years ago. But I know that they
would be the first to say that relations, policies, results and every other condition were
so different that no basis for comparison
exists.
All the Hungarians wanted was to choose
their own form of government and to decide
for themselves their relationship with foreign
governments. Think of the irony of it! The
United States were doing exactly the same
thing at the same time. So far as I have
heard, the American people elected an administration and the representatives of their
choice without the loss of a single life. But,
under the benevolent system hailed by the
Bolshevik slave masters as enlightenment,
all that the gallant Hungarian people got was
a blood bath, the like of which has not been
seen in modern history.
It should be remembered that this is not
the first time the Hungarian people have had
to fight for their freedom. At least three

times previously they have fought against
oppression: the first was five hundred years
ago when, under the leadership of John
Hunyadi, 'they threw off the yoke of the
Turks. A little over one hundred years ago
the people rose up again to demand proper
recognition under the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. The third occasion perhaps had less
bloodshed but it was their first experience
with communism. That was in 1919. Perhaps
we have forgotten that communism was
imposed on Hungary right after the First
World War by a minority led by the Russiantrained Bela Kun. It was on this occasion
that Admiral Horthy led the White forces
which drove out communism.
It is obvious, therefore, that when on this
occasion they rose against their communist
and Russian oppressors the people of Hungary
did so with no illusions as to the cost to themselves, although it is probable that the majority of the people were sadly disappointed
that no aid came from the West. They have
written in blood the value of freedom, which
I am sure will be felt throughout the world
for many years to come.
Honourable senators, what can we do?
Very little, I am afraid. The only way to stop
the butchery would be to drive the Russians
out of Hungary. We cannot do that. And by
starting a third world war in this way no
group of nations would be doing any favour
to anybody, least of all to the Hungarians.
We can only lend our full and unstinting support to the United Nations. We can only open
our doors and our hearts to those Hungarians
fortunate enough to have escaped the tender
care of the Russians. We can only open our
purses to give a little mite of relief from
suffering to those who survived within
Hungary.
Surely there are no political implications
in these inadequate acts of mercy; and, if
this be true, let us give the necessary legislation our ungrudging, unstinting and unanimous support.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it is not my intention at this hour
to attempt to address you in connection with
the great issues that lie before us. I cannot
allow the opportunity to pass to congratulate
the honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Molson) upon the remarkable and excellent
address which he has just delivered. He is
a comparatively new member of this house,
and I understand this is his maiden speech.
For his own gratification I would call to his
attention the rapt attention with which he
was heard, and the round of applause with
which his address was closed. His very wide
grasp of public affairs, the effective language

NOVEMBER 28, 1956
in which his sentiments were expressed and
the excellent viewpoints which he placed
before us proves at once that he is indeed
in his right place here among the elder
statesmen of Canada. I wish him a long
and happy sojourn among us. If he continues to give us the benefit of his wisdom
and literary ability, I am sure he will occupy
an important place here and make a great
contribution to the welfare of Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before moving the adjournment of the debate, I should like to
express one further thought, that is, to repeat
the observation of the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) when
he said he regretted the speech that was
delivered this afternoon by the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I have for the Leader of the Opposition the
very highest respect. I have more than
respect. I have a certain affection for that
honourable gentleman, and my relations with
him have been the most cordial and friendly
over the years. But I think that his address
today was ill-considered, and if his statements were in accord with the impression
that was left on my mind-and I shall wait
until I read the text before coming to a
final conclusion-I think the time will come
when he will regret them. They were reminiscent to me of experiences which I
suffered many years ago when the little
die-hard Tory clique of Toronto wrapped
themselves in a blood-red flag and, with a
self-righteousness that was superb, impugned
the patriotism of all their fellow citizens.
Hon. Mr. Horner: More politics.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Now I do not say that
the honourable gentleman who heads the
Conservative forces in this house did that
very thing, though it came close to it. I said
his remarks were reminiscent of that kind
of thing which I thought had passed away: I
thought that we Canadians were now Canadians in our own right with a confidence in
the loyalty and integrity of our fellowcitizens.
When the honourable gentleman said that
the issue before us was whether we stood
with Britain or Russia he surely had his
tongue in his cheek, and he failed, I should
think, to appreciate the insult to his fellow

81541-3j

citizens that was implicit in those words.
Not only that-and I do not want to be
too severe nor will I attempt to reply to
these statements until I have at least read
the text and re-read it in black and whitebut I would call his attention to this, and
let him absorb the fact, that the day of the
little Canadian has gone by. Today Canada
is a grown-up nation, unable now to cast
her responsibilities upon the statesmen of
Westminster but under the obligation of taking her own place among the nations of the
world and of assuming the responsibilities
that go with that status.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We are grown up. We
are no longer in tutelage to any other nation
and it is ours to discharge our responsibility.
I fancy the honourable gentleman did not
really mean to say that Canada should not
have done what she did in the United Nations
or that the constitution of a police force
was in any way wrong or unwise, because if
he did he stands aloneHon. Mr. Aseltine: That is not correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He did not say that, but
he came pretty close to it, and if he does
say that he stands alone, because practically
all the nations of the world have agreed, to
Canada's suggestion.
If he did say that
what we did was right and wise in constituting a police force to keep the peace
of the Middle East, then why those belligerent
statements that would involve us in a global
war in which millions might die in atomic
and hydrogen warfare?
When speaking to the Senate of Canada
one's words should be well weighed, and
particularly so when saying things that might
bring about the disaster of another world
war which Canada bas striven during so
many years to avoid.
I hope I have not misinterpreted my
honourable friend, for he is a friend and I
hope will continue to be so, but I do regret
that he made that speech.
And now, honourable senators, permit me
to move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

FELICITATIONS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
I am not going to speak about the international situation. I am going to speak about a
happier occasion. I wish to offer congratulations to a most gracious and charming member of this chamber, the honourable senator

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Wall, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Fournier, for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear,

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I commence my
remarks this afternoon by following what has
become a tradition, in both this house and the
House of Commons, that is, by tendering my
congratulations to the mover and the seconder
of the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. In this instance, I do so not as a
mere matter of form, but rather because of
the genuine admiration I feel for the statesmanlike moderation, expressed in classical
English, of the mover of the Address (Hon.
Mr. Wall), and as well the marvellous eloquence and fluency of the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Fournier).
I feel that little would be gained if I attempted to repeat the sentiments expressed in
preceding speeches with which I agree. In
this debate it is impossible to deal fully with
the present international situation, but I wish
to submit some thoughts in connection with
it which I think are worthy of consideration.
May I commence with a broad general
observation, that is to say, that in international affairs the leaders of the nations require both enterprise and courage-enterprise
to formulate sound policies and courage to
carry them out. I submit with all due deference to those who may disagree, that the
members of Her Majesty's Government at
Westminster exhibited an enterprise which
is remarkable, in taking advantage of the
passing situation to regain their bargaining
position in connection with the Suez Canal
and the natural resources of the Middle East.
Now, to those who would be unduly critical
of the actions of Great Britain and France
on that occasion, I would say let it not be
forgotten that the Soviet bloc was stockpiling
in Egypt arms and munitions of war in huge
amounts, valued at many millions of dollars,
for the obvious purpose of seizing control of
the natural resources of the Middle East and
obtaining f or itself a strategic position
in that area, one which spelled disaster to
the civilized countries of the Western world.
Usually Britain's diplomacy is superb in
the carrying out of her various enterprises.
But on this occasion I am not impressed with
the skill and diplomacy which characterized
the actions of the United Kingdom and
France. For instance, they failed to commit
the member nations of the Commonwealth to
the enterprise in advance. They lost the
approval of India, of Pakistan and of Ceylon;
they were outvoted in the United Nations;
and, worst of all, they entered upon that
most serious and grave action which they
took opposed by a very considerable section
of their own people in the United Kingdom.
So I say, and I think I have reason for
saying it, that the action taken, no matter
how sound it may have been, was not in the

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
best of diplomacy. But, honourable senators,
the rightness or the wrongness of great historic decisions is flot; to be judged by the
diplomacy with which they were initiated or
carried out.
I suggest that those who would be rather
too critical at the moment resist the temptation to draw conclusions too early until they
know the facts and ail of them. Great enterprises in world affairs are usually judged by
their success, and what has been accomplished on this occasion by the United Kingdom and others involved is still veiled in the
mists of the future. But I arn bold enough
to predict that when the tale is told it will be
found that the United Kingdomn did what
was right under these circumstancesHon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -and, furthermore,
when ail the counters are on the table, that
they followed the only course that was possible or wise under the circumstances.
I arn rather tempted to quote at this point
ini my address from the Bard of Avon these
words by Polonius in his advice to bis son:
Beware of entrance to a quarrel;...
My thought is that the members of the
United Kingdom cabinet thoroughly canvassed the facts before taking action. I think
they did "beware of entrance to a quarrel",
and did not enter upon their course lightly
or without due consideration. However, I
think the words wbich follow those I have
quoted are perhaps more opportune and
appropriate at the moment:
But being i, bear't, that th' opposed mnay beware
of thee.
And now being in, as Great Britain is, and
as ail of us in the West are, I would say:
"Bear it, that those opposed shail beware of
thee. Do not; weaken."
I may quote appropriately these words
from. the Book of Joshua:
Be thou strong and very courageous...
That is what we should be today.
Honourable senators, I arn just about tired
of the role that the West has been playing
vis-à-vis Russia ever since the explosion
of the first atomic bomb. We have been so
intent on avoiding an atomnic or a hydrogen
war that we have been victims of blackmail
on countless occasions. Now, God knows
that I arn no militarist and arn far from
being a Jingo. I abhor war and would go a
long way to avoid it. But I arn unable to
consent to the principle of peace at any
price.
I noticed an article in the Toronto Globe
and Mail of November 7 which from some

points of view expresses my sentiments on
this matter. It reads:
A TIME FOR COURAGE
For eleven years now, the Western Powers have
been paying moral and atomic blackmail. . . .Both
kinds of blackmail had the same effect-to prevent
the Western Powers from using force where and
when force needed to be used. The moral blackmailers said to them that the use of force would
be "aggression", that it would 'shock world opinion"
(meaning, New Delhi opinion), that the only right
way to settie disputes was through the United
Nations. The atomic blackmailers said to them
that the use of force might start a war; that if a
war started. the Russians or the Americans might
get into it; and that if the Russians or the Americans
got into it, they might use atomic weapons. Thuswe quote from 5,789,634 speeches inside and outside the UN-"bringing about the end of civilization
as we know it".
So the Western Powers paid. And as with any
other kind of blackmail, new and higher payments
were constantly demanded. It got so that the most
miserable banana republic, the scrufflest littie
dictator, could do anything he liked to the mighty
Western Powers. He could steal their property,
maltreat their nationals, tear up his agreements
with themn-anything. And they could not raise a
finger to stop him-save In the UN, which could
not raise a finger to stop him, either.

I think I arn right in saying that I arn
about tired of that sort of thing.
1 have another clipping, a news item frorn
this morning's paper, headed:
Egypt Hints at War Unless the Invaders Go
And some adviser of the dictator of Egypt
delivers himself i words like these:
Egypt has asked the UN Secretary General
Hammarskjold to fix a time limit for withdrawal
of British-French-Israeli troopa from Egypt.

He goes on to say:
If the invaders Ignore the decisions of the UN,
Egypt can take many steps, whieh we cannot
divulge now, but I cannot guarantee that these
steps will flot lead to a world war.

That is to say, we are to do what Egypt
tells us, or otherwise she threatens us with
a world war.
Well, 1 must say that 1 am afraid of a
world war. I do flot want a world war, but
1 do think that the dictator of Egypt has
much more to fear from a world war than
we have.
He should remember what happened to some other dictators on other
occasions in the course of a world war. While
1 arn ready to go a very long way to avoid
military clashes of any kind, I arn not prepared to be dictated to by a "«scruffy" little
dictator of that kind and have our policies
formulated in Cairo on the veiled threat o! a
world war or of an attack by Russia, the
threat being handed to us by somebody on
Russia's behaîf. On the other hand, I like the
statement made by the Right Honourable R.
A. Butler recently in the British House of
Commons, when, in answer to a question, he

SENATE
said that Britain would not be blackmailed
by anybody. I hope he meant it, and I think
he did.
In this connection of being blackmailed by
the fear of Russia, may I recall that I was
in Berlin in 1948, having gone into that city
on the airlift. Honourable senators will
remember that at that time the Soviet authorities had decided to push the Allies out of
Berlin and to make of the former capital of
Germany a Russian city. For that purpose
they had blockaded the highways and railroads that ran between Berlin and the Western states. It will be remembered that the
Allies responded-rather diplomatically, I
thought-by organizing an airlift, and it
became the duty of General Clay, who was
then Chief of the General Staff of the Allied
Powers in Germany, to tell the Russians that
if they interfered with the airlift we would
shoot our way through. Well, we didn't
shoot our way through, because the Russians
did not interfere with the airlift. They
desisted, and the airlift remains today an
historic element of pride to ourselves and the
Western world.
I had an interview with General Clay at
that time and I remember one of the sentiments which he expressed. It was a pearl of
wisdom distilled from his own recent experience. He said, "The men in the Kremlin are
good bluffers but they are not gamblers." I
have thought of that remark many times since
as the occasion has presented itself-that
these men in the Kremlin are good bluffers
but are not gamblers. It seems to me, my
honourable colleagues, that if Russia is planning a world war with the Western Powers
she will commence it in her own good time
and that we will not be able to prevent it,
certainly not by weakening ourselves or our
position in the meantime as a result of fears
on our part or by reason of threats on her
part.
I say this because I would like to stress at
the present moment the utter worthlessness
of appeasement.
I follow that comment with this question:
what do the Russians plan? Do they plan at
this moment a global war in which we will
all be involved? I do not believe it. I am
not the least impressed, of course, with the
Russian humbug about their love of peace,
democracy and that sort of thing; but I do
believe in their love of their own hides, and
I judge that the men in the Kremlin have
not forgotten what happened to Hitler. As
General Clay said on that occasion, they are
not gamblers. If it is true, as has been
reported, that President Eisenhower bas told
the Russians that if they send "volunteers"

into the Middle East the United States will
oppose them, then the Russians will not send
"volunteers" into the Middle East.
I am not prepared to say-simply because
I do not know enough of the facts and I cannot see far enough into the future-that Great
Britain and France should remain in permanent control of the Suez Canal; but, if they
should remain in control of it, I trust they
will have courage to carry out their convictions. I will say, however, from well-considered knowledge of the situation, that Great
Britain and France should not withdraw their
troops from the Middle East until a satisfactory arrangement has been completed for the
international operation and control of that
highway vital to the shipping of the world.
They should not withdraw their troops from
the Middle East in its disturbed condition
until the security of Israel has been assured
and until there is a sufficient United Nations'
force in the locality to assure that the guarantee is observed.
Perhaps my colleagues will bear with me
if I comment on the many references to
Israel as an aggressor in this recent Sinai
campaign. Honourable senators will remember that I spent nearly a month in Israel just
one year ago, studying that nation and its
problems. Arab raids were going on while
I was there, and I have the advantage of
some little touch with the victims of those
raids. I fancy there are few Canadians who
have had the requisite experience to realize
what it means to go to bed every night with
the question unanswered as to whether you
will be murdered before morning.
On November 29, 1947 the British withdrew from the responsibilities of their mandate in Palestine, and the new State of
Israel was created and ber borders defined
by resolution of the United Nations. On
May 15, 1948, less than 6 months after the
passage of that resolution, five armies-in
defiance of the United Nations' resolution, in
defiance of a world mandate, and in defiance
of world public opinion-five armies, from
Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Iraq,
marched across the established borders of
Israel intent on conquest, plunder and murder. The invading armies were exceedingly
well armed, while the local population was
almost unarmed, yet by some miracle, which
I have never been quite able to understand,
a heroic citizenship in that little state defeated
all five of those armies and drove them out.
I am not wrong when I say that the feat was
accomplished by some miracle, but it was
accomplished, and is proven by the armistice
agreements which were signed through the
mediation and genius of Mr. Bunche of the
United Nations.

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
In spite of the signing of those agreements
and in violation of their ternis, Egypt and
her allies deciared that a state of war
against Israel stili continued; they refused
ail intercourse with Israel or her nationals,
they blockaded the borders of Israel, and
tbhey were guilty of a long succession of mean,
unneighbourly acts. Not only so, but Egypt
closed the international highway of the
Suez Canal to Israeli shipping, and as weiI
the Gulf of Akaba which, as honourable
senators know, is a brancb of the Red Sea,
and which gave to the city of Eilat on the
Gulf of Akaba a port of entry to Israel. And
even worse, for eight long years Israel's
neigbbours have been sending marauding
bands of bloodthirsty thugs across ber borders.
who under the cover of night have burned
the bouses and barns of her settlers,
destroyed property, carried off everything
that could be stolen, and murdered the local
inhabitants.
Driven to desperation, the
Israeli Government bas counterraided, but
in ber case witb organized miiitary under
strict command; not in attacks upon women
and children, but rather against the military
establishments of the governments responsible for tbe vil-lainous murderers wbo invaded
ber country.
Israel dlaims that 500 Israeli ýcitizens bave
been killed or wounded between the
armistice and the first of Mareb 1955-500
innocent citizens of that country! Since tben
the rate of kiliings bas greatly increased, and
not long ago I noticed tbat 24 Israeli citizens
were murdered in a single week by tbe mining of bighways, ambushes, and indiscriminate sbootings. Israel bas boped during al
these years that time would cure, or at least
alleviate, tbe despicable *bate that prompted
these crimes, and she chose to disregard the
boastful tbreats of the Egyptian dictator,
that Israel wauld again be invaded and this
time ber population massacred.
But these tbreats and tbe increased tempo
of the raids could no longer be disregarded
wben, in September 1955, Russia intervened by delivering to Egypt, and tbrough
Egypt to the otber Arab states, vast quantities
of arms and munitions wbich were purcbased, at least by Egypt, witb the avowed
intention of attack upon Israel.
Tbe climax came recently wben Egypt
agreed witb Syria and Jordan to a unified
command of their combined forces for the
declared purpose of annibilating the people
of the State of Israel. At the saine time Egypt
stepped up the tempo of these illegal and
murderous night raids of marauding gangs.
In my judgment, the purpose of the raids was
to disorganize the economy of Israei, and as
well to provoke tbe State of Israel into some

act of desperation wbich. later migbt be used
as justification for the impending invasion.
Unfortunately for Egypt, the provocations
were more successful than she had calculated,
and, on October 29, 1956, the armies o! Israel
marcbed over the borders o! Egypt into tbe
Sinai Peninsula. Witb the events whicb. followed bonourable senators are very f amiliar.
Tbe story o! the Simai campaign would be
interesting ta relate, but I do not intend to
induige in sucb a recital. The events are too
recent to be made into history. However, I
feit tbat a recital of the events wbich preceded that campaign, witb wbicb I bave a real
familiarity, was wortb wbile, because, in
spite of the facts, the press and athers have
cantinually spoken of Israei in the 5mnai campaign as an aggressor.
Honourable senators, it was not Israel wbo
saught ta strangle Egypt by illegal blockade
and by the destruction o! bier sbipping; it
was not Israel wbo sougbt to ruin Egypt by
murderous raids upon ber citizens and
centres. It was not Israel who tbreatened ta
annibilate Egypt by armed invasion and massacre. It was Egypt wbo bas been responsible
for these barbarous acts and tbreats against
tbe State of Israel.
It is weIl that we realize the situation as
it has existed because, I submit, it justifies
the opinion 1 expressed in my opening sentence and tbe conclusion wbicb I now draw,
firstly, that Britain and France sbould not
leave the Suez area until satisfactory arrangements bave been made to operate the canal
under United Nations contrai; secondly, until
the security of Israel bas been guaranteed;
and tbirdiy, until a sufficient United Nations
force is in that vicinity to ensure that the
guarantee is observed.
In conclusion, may I say that I look forward, as do ahl my fellow senators, ta the
time wben tbe nations wfli beat their swords
into plowsbares.
I beartily approve the genius of our Secretary af State for External Aff airs in bis efforts
ta preserve the peace, and to bring about the
rule of law in tbe East. But I say ta my
feliow senators, the rule of law without the
power to enforce it is futile. I have from
my friend the senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) this quotation:
There is only one thing worse than Injustice,
and that is justice without her sword in her hand.
The time must came when we shaîl have
a tribunal estabiisbed to pronounce justice
among tbe nations of tbe eartb, and endowed
tvith the power ta enforce its decrees. If we
of the Western world are the anly anes wbo
must bow ta the decisions af tbe United
Nations, so that aur teetb are pulied wben
we are attacked, and its decisions bave no

SENATE
binding force upon those who oppose us, then
the sooner we get out of the United Nations
the better. But the hope of the world is that
the United Nations shall remain and be
strong, and armed with a police force, ever
ready to go where justice requires it in all
parts of the world. The time will come, and
we in Canada may have helped greatly in
bringing it about, when international justice
will rule in the world.
While we all look forward to the time
when the nations of the world will beat their
swords into plowshares, they are not doing
it at the present time. They are not observing
justice; they are observing power. The only
possible way to bring about a world safe for
humanity, justice and democracy is through
a United Nations, acting in a judicial capacity,
and with power sufficient to enforce its
decrees.

In the meantime, honourable senators, you
and I who have some little influence in
national affairs must see things as they are;
we must live in the world as it is, not as we
desire it to be. We must not desert our
friends. We must be ready to take the chances
that are always present to those who act
justly. We must be strong, and being strong
we will be much more safe than if we are
weak.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity a question? I
understood him to suggest that there should
be some guarantee for the safety of Israel.
Was there not an agreement between the
United States and Great Britain that they
would go to the assistance of either Egypt
or Israel, whichever one was attacked?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There was a statement
by the three powers, Great Britain, France
and the United States, to that effect. But
I call my friend's attention to the fact that
arms and munitions to the value of millions
of dollars were stockpiled on Israel's border,
and border raids continued without any
action whatsoever by the three powers. That
statement was a pious one rather than a

Hon. Mr. Euler: That is quite apparent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My statement was that
an arrangement of the kind mentioned must
have force behind it to ensure that the

Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, in rising to make a small contribution to
the debate on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne I wish first to compliment, as preceding speakers have done, the
mover (Hon. Mr. Wall) and seconder (Hon.
Mr. Fournier) of the Address in reply to the

brief but important document. As I listened
to these honourable gentlemen speak, I
wondered if they were as nervous as I was
when I had the honour of moving the Address
in reply at the opening of the session in
1942. My remarks on that occasion were
by no means world shattering, but I felt terribly bucked up when an elderly senator
came up to me, looked me in the eye and
without cracking a smile said, "That is the
best speech I ever heard delivered in this
I might have continued to be
chamber."
proud of myself if a week later I had not
heard him say the same thing to another
senator on the other side of the chamber.
Like the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), and being a plain,
ignorant fellow-which of course the honourable leader is not-I was unable to follow the
speech of the seconder of the motion who
spoke in the French language. When I am
listening to a speech being made in French
a couple of lines of a familiar old hymn
come to my mind:
Tell me the story simply,
As to a little child.

But I knew from the way the honourable
senator was gesticulating, and the smiles
upon the faces of those who understand what
I call rapid-fire French, that he was making
an effective and interesting speech and I
wish to congratulate him. I would also congratulate the honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Molson) on the excellent speech
which he made in this chamber yesterday
afternoon.

Honourable senators, it is not my intention
to discuss at great length the Speech from
the Throne. I do feel impelled, however, to
make a few remarks to explain the position
in which I found myself, along with possibly
many other British-born Canadians, when
Britain and France took war-like action to
stop the fighting between Israel and Egypt
which resulted from the invasion of the
Sinai Peninsula on October 29 by Israeli
troops.
Before becoming involved in the Middle
East problem, I would like to say I am in full
accord with everything that we, the Canadian
people, are doing for Hungary. The attack
on Hungary by Soviet Russia was brutal and
cruel. About fifteen years ago I was in
Hungary for several days and I well remember the beautiful city of Budapest, where I
spent a weekend, and the kindness and hospitality of the Hungarian people whom I met.
It is frightening to realize that despite the
convention on the crime of genocide passed
by the United Nations on December 9,
1948, Russia could overrun Hungary and
murder many of its people, and we were helpless to do anything about it.

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
What I want to discuss mainly at this time
however is the Middle East situation. I am
free to confess that for a brief period I was
bewildered by it. I was very doubtful of the
wisdom of the action taken by Britain and
France, although I was convinced that it
was not taken with any imperialistic designs
upon Egypt, but rather in what they fully
believed to be the interests of peace. They
were trying to stop the fighting between
Israel and Egypt and to save the Suez Canal
from serious damage.
I had to remind myself that Sir Anthony
Eden was an experienced and level-headed
statesman, that he had had a long and distinguished diplomatic career, including many
years as Foreign Secretary of Great Britain.
I also reminded myself that he had been
chosen by the people of Britain to succeed
the great Sir Winston Churchill as their
Prime Minister, and that, in a general election, he had been endorsed by the nation and
given a majority of some 60 seats in the
House of Commons. Furthermore, honourable senators, I reminded myself that Sir
Anthony Eden was a Knight of the Garter,
that great English Order of Chivalry whose
carefully selected members are generally expected to be more pure in their motives, more
valiant in their actions and more humane in
their conduct than ordinary men. I had to
remind myself too that Britain's present
Foreign Secretary, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, with
whom I had a delightful chat at the Rideau
Club reception last spring, is a brother Welshman who also has a distinguished career. In
his position as Recorder of the old Roman
City of Chester he had for some years been
making important judicial decisions. These
two men and their cabinet colleagues are not
hot-headed, impetuous, unreliable men. They
are great statesmen, and I am sure they did
not forget for one moment that any action
which they might take should be very carefully weighed and considered.

Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) told us
yesterday, if we do not bring about a peaceful solution we might be facing the end of
the world. I am strongly in favour of the
United Nations Police Force and am proud
that Canada was responsible for its formation. I am also proud that it is being headed
by a Canadian general. I will say something
about an international police force a little
later.
Before I do that, however, I would like to
say something about the pressure that was
being put upon the British Governrment and
the quiet but, nevertheless, unmistakable inferences in some newspapers to the effect that
the people of Great Britain expected Sir Anthony Eden and his Government to look after
their interests, come what may.
It is perhaps fair to say that Britain and
France did stretch clause 52 of the United
Nations Charter when they sent armed forces
into Egypt. In view of the seizure of the
Suez Canal by Colonel Nasser, however, and
the possibility of injury to the canal if a major
war broke out between Israel and Egyp†,
France and Britain might have felt that they
were acting in defence of their own rights to
some extent. It is a moot question, on which
arguments have been presented by both sides
in the British press. We must not forget,
however, that the Suez Canal is of much more
importance to Great Britain and France than
it is to either Canada or the United States;
therefore their thinking is no doubt somewhat different.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable gentleman one question at this point?
Could he, from his knowledge of affairs in
England, give any information about the Suez
Canal Company and the financial control of
it since 1888?
Hon. Mr. Davies: The Suez Canal Company's
head office is in Paris. There has been considerable discussion in the press about the
company, and perhaps there bas been a good

SENATE
A few of the British papers were severely
critical of Sir Anthony Eden and his Government right from the time that Nasser seized
the Suez canal and the British Government,
as a precautionary measure, began to send
troops to Cyprus. They talked of "sabre
rattling" and tried to persuade themselves
and other people that the dispatch of troops
to Cyprus was done with a sinister purpose.
They had said similar things at the time of
and after Munich. These papers are never
friendly to a Conservative government, and
this was a good opportunity for them to throw
a few bricks at it. As I have said, Sir
Anthony Eden is a Knight of the Garter, and
he would not have that distinction if he were
not an honourable man. During the week
of August 6 Sir Anthony broadcast a speech
on the Suez canal. What he said can be
summed up in three paragraphs which were
quoted in the London Sunday Times of August 12. This is a paper, with which many
of you no doubt are familiar, owned by Lord
Kemsley. Sir Anthony said:

government of the day, had a leading editorial on Tuesday, August 14, in which it
pointed out the very difficult position Great
Britain would be in if its supply of oil from
the Middle East were seriously interfered
with. It pointed out that before the Second
World War most of Great Britain's oil came
from the western hemisphere, and even as
late as 1947 two-thirds of it was drawn from
the Caribbean and the United States; but eight
years later, by 1955, four-fifths of Britain's
imports of oil were received from the Middle
East.
I am trying to point out some of the
important economic difficulties which faced
Great Britain as a possible result of the
seizure of the Suez canal by Colonel Nasser.

In 1955, nearly 1,500,000 tons of oil from

the Middle East were used in steel-making
in Britain; 300,000 tons for the making of
glass and ceramics; over 500,000 tons for gasmaking; 176,000 tons by the Central Electricity Authority, and over 800,000 tons for
central heating. Last year 67,000,000 tons of

Nasser and criticize what the British Government was doing. It quoted a number of
authorities to show that in the eyes of responsible political leaders in Britain the seizure
of the canal by Colonel Nasser was a very
unfriendly act towards Britain and was very
much resented. It quoted Mr. Gaitskell, the
Leader of the Opposition; it quoted Mr. Herbert Morrison, another great labour leader,
who claimed that Nasser had acted contrary
to the law of nations and contrary to international good faith. Mr. Morrison was very
severe against those people in Britain who,
having spent many years in denouncing
jingoism, imperialism and excessive nationalism in respect of Britain, and having enjoyed
the advantages of living in Britain, were now
spending their spare time in praising countries like Egypt. The Times was very censorious of the persons trying to sanctify
Makarios, who was exiled from Cyprus, and
of those seeking to get people to believe that
British soldiers when endeavouring to preserve law and order in a turbulent area are
cruel and oppressive. The newspaper went
on to say that colonialism in the minds of
some people was all a matter of water. If
Russia, China or any other continental power
overran, captured, dictated to or even destroyed a neighbouring country, apparently
everything was well. In such a case the most
elementary freedoms could be exterminated
and the most outrageous excesses committed
and there would be silence. This was written
before the rape of Hungary by the Soviet
Union troops. But, said the Times, if Britain
seeks to keep law and order in some territory
that she is bringing along to self-government,
where she is trying to teach the people to
walk before they can run, a great cry of
colonialism goes up.
Honourable senators, let me quote further
from this same article, to show what I call
the indirect pressure that was exerted on the
Prime Minister of Britain and his Government, and which no doubt influenced them
in their decision to join up with France and
send troops to Egypt. This is what the Times
said:

And note this sentence:
Nations live by the vigorous defence of their
interests. Even Mr. Nehru, who so conscientiously
sermonizes the rest of the world, does not let a
trick go in Kashmir.
And, applying indirect pressure on the
Government by reference to days gone by,
the editorial concludes by saying:
As G. M. Trevelyan reminded us many years ago,
the sun of Venice set because of the double event
of the Turkish blocking of the caravan routes and
the discovery of the Cape route and America.
Doubtless it is good to have a flourishing tourist
trade and to win Test matches. But nations do not
live by circuses alone. The people, in their silent
way, know this better than the critics. They still

want Britain great.
That was the London Times. I have a fairly
large file of clippings from other papers
here, many of them along much the same line.
Is it surprising that when the great London
Times, known for many years as "The
Thunderer", told the Government that the
people still want Britain great, Sir Anthony
Eden wondered if he was fulfilling his duty
in not preparing Britain to take some action
in Egypt if the United Nations did not quickly
do so?
I am not saying that Sir Anthony Eden,
Mr. Selwyn Lloyd and others did the right
thing. I am saying, however, that they did
what I think the majority of the press and
the people of Britain expected them to do.
When the British air forces started to bomb
Egyptian airports, there was, naturally, a
great protest-a protest in many British
papers as well as in the papers of other
countries. But that feeling is not nearly so
vociferous in Britain today. Many papers
there were saying that what the Government
did was contrary to the wishes of the people.
However, the latest public opinion poll
shows, according to a Reuter's dispatch of
November 15, that 53 per cent of the people
of Britain now support what Sir Anthony
Eden and his Government did.
Honourable senators, I am sorry to have
spoken so long. I had no intention of doing

so when I started to prepare my remarks.
But as I progressed I felt that I should try
to explain that in my opinion the action of
Sir Anthony Eden and his Government was

in the British House of Commons. To show
you how confused opinion was on this great
issue, when the first vote of confidence in
the Eden Government was taken, three of
the six Liberals went into the Conservative
lobby to support the Prime Minister and
three went into the Labour lobby to support Mr. Gaitskell's vote of censure.
I am very happy that this great problem is
now in the hands of the United Nations. It
was disturbing to read in the Ottawa Journal
last evening that a young Ottawa captain
now in Egypt has said that the Queen's
Own Rifles cannot sail unless Nasser
changes his mind; but it was stated in the
same paper that France had withdrawn an
infantry company and a naval commando

troops in Egypt within two weeks. It is
unfortunate that the United Nations did not
build up a police force for just such emergencies as the present one many years ago.
Everyone knows that an international police
force is no new idea. I was writing editorials
twenty years ago on the proposal to establish
an international police force in connection
with the League of Nations. This proposal
was put forward by the New Commonwealth
Society which was founded in 1932 by the
late Lord Davies of Llandinam, and of which
Sir Winston Churchill was at that time the
president. Lord Davies wrote several books
on the subject, copies of which he sent to me.
Lord Davies spent much of his vast fortune in
promoting international peace. He built a
Temple of Peace and Health in the city of
Cardiff, the capital of Wales, at a cost of £1
million. This distinguished gentleman was no
relation of mine, although we were of the
same generation and were born and brought
up in the same county in Wales. There was,
however, a very decided difference between
the two families. Lord Davies' grandfather
and father made a vast fortune out of coal
mines and the building of railways and ports
in Britain; my grandfather and father did not
make a vast fortune. My grandfather was a
very successful merchant and at one time
had five prosperous businesses in North
Wales. But he made the mistake that many
men make after they have accumulated a
little bit of money: he thought he could farm.
He did not know anything about farming,
but he bought himself a mansion and several
hundred acres of land, and be set himself up
as a gentleman farmer. As the honourable
member from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
well knows, if you are going to be a successful farmer you must know something about
farming. We lost all our money, and, strange

as it may seem, for that I am truly grateful,
for if we had made money instead of losing
it my father would not have brought his little
family out to Canada in the early nineties,
and my brothers and sisters and I would not
have had the great privilege of living our
lives in this wonderful country.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: While I am making personal references, perhaps honourable senators
will pardon another one, which, to me, is
rather interesting. When my father decided
to bring his family out to Canada be went
to the public library in the little Welsh town
in which we lived, and he said to his old
friend Charlie Jones, the librarian: "Charlie,
have you got any good books about Canada?"
Mr. Jones looked over the shelves, and he
picked out one and said: "Walter, I think this
is about what you want." So my father came
home armed with a book entitled Roughing
it in the Bush, by Susannah Moodie. Sixty
years later my son Robertson was asked to
write a play for the centenary of the Peterborough district, and it so happened that the
book be chose on which to found his play
At My Heart's Core was this same Roughing
it in the Bush, not knowing that it had played
a part in our family many years ago.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, let me
express the hope that the great difficulties
facing the world in the Middle East will be
settled without any more bloodshed, and that
before many months are past the sun will
shine upon a Hungary that is enjoying the
freedom that has been bought so dearly by
the heroic people of that country.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few remarks on one or two
matters, but at the outset may I say that it
will not be necessary to speak at any length,
because the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) covered the
ground fully. I agree with almost his entire
remarks, and they were in much better form
than I could put them.
I congratulate the mover of the Address
(Hon. Mr. Wall), and also the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Fournier). Both gentlemen spoke very
well. I also wish to compliment all others
who have taken part in the debate, particularly the new member from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Molson). While I sympathize with his feeling
that possibly the time has come when we
should ask certain gentlemen to get out of
this country, I think it would be a mistake
to take that step, for sometimes I wonder
how such people can live in this country, even
in large numbers, without receiving some
good influences. I doubt if the people of the

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
world can be brought together in understanding if they are fenced off entirely into
different camps. I understand that the Russian Ambassador to Canada attended the
Calgary Stampede, and I do not know how
any man representing a dictatorship could
attend that event and remain quite the same,
because that is a place where a democracy
has full sway and one man is as good as
another.
Honourable senators, I propose to touch on
a little bit of history. I recall the great hopes
we had of the League of Nations, when it
was declared that World War I was a war
to end all wars. I also have in mind the
Fourteen Points enunciated by a former
President of the United States, and his great
effort to secure for them the support of the
American people. I often think how different
a place the world would be to live in today,
and how much greater power the United
Nations might have to create and maintain
an international force, if in those days the
United States had joined the League of
Nations. I must say that I am critical of the
whole Eastern policy of the United States. I
also am dubious of Canada's part in it, as
well as of certain activities of the Secretary
of State for External Affairs, for it seems to
me that on several occasions we have not
been permitted to make a move without the
permission of the United States.
Honourable senators will remember that
when Mussolini set his armies in motion to
rape the kingdom of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie,
the little dark, bearded emperor, begged and
pleaded for assistance. At that time, Dr.
Riddell, whd represented Canada at the
League of Nations, promised that we would
impose sanctions against Italy immediately.
I regret to say that Canada's role at that time
was certainly nothing for any Canadian to be
proud of. The Italian Ambassador appealed
to the Canadian Government, and the Prime
Minister of that day repudiated Dr. Riddell's
statement and said that Dr. Riddell did not
speak for the Canadian Government. Thereupon Haile Selassie, having begged in vain
for assistance, said, "All right, you are going
to see many thrones topple in Europe, and I
will be back on my throne before any of
them are restored." His prophecy proved to
be perfectly correct. The emperor also said:
"Many of you will never return. I can stand
before God, my conscience is clear, but I
cannot be expected to fight against tanks
and planes with barefoot soldiers."
As I said, I agree with the sentiments of
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity.
As a man having six sons-thank God, all
medically fit-I am all for peace, but like the
honourable senator, I am not for peace at any

price. I agree with him that we have been
blackmailed in every direction. I think that
we were lax, and the United States too
was lax.
We shall probably have spent in the neighbourhood of $500 million by the time we are
through with that great enterprise in the
northern tundra and in the barren west of
Canada, partly for ourselves and partly for
the United States. It is being done by the
most expensive method possible, and Canada
will have to pay her share. We were jockeyed
into that unfortunate position. I believe the
money spent there would have built the
Aswan dam for Egypt and would have brought
about other favourable developments in a
country where people can go about with little
clothing and there are immense resources of
oils and minerals. Had that been done, we
might well have avoided the impasse we are
facing today.
I am critical of the United States because
it was the last to come into the picture.
I resent its attitude in connection with the
Suez Canal affair. What sympathy has it
shown Britain in her very difficult time in
Cyprus? What has been its attitude through
all this crisis? I say the United States has
done nothing but cause embarrassment to
Great Britain.
With respect to the Suez Canal, the international agreement under which it was
operated had only ten years to run, and the
Egyptian Government could well have waited
until that time expired. But no, it chose to
block the canal. The honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
yesterday disagreed with me when I said that
it was Nasser who was telling General Burns
what troops he could bring into Egypt, how
they were to be dressed and everything else.
What a humiliating position for the Western
powers to be placed in! I left the chamber
and went directly to my room, and there I
read the news headlines which confirmed
what I had said.
Let us look at the confusion which Nasser
caused in Canada. The Canadian soldiers
were flown from Calgary to Halifax, where
they marched up Citadel Hill and marched
down again. The ship on which they were to
sail had all its armaments removed. The
men were required to wear a plastic arm
band and a coloured ribbon. Perhaps they
were equipped with a night stick instead
of a rifle. I ask you, of what use can a
police force of that kind be?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They have a psychological effect!

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. With all due respect, I say we are placed in a most humiliating position. I have great admiration for
the British Government in the stand it bas
taken. I hope and believe that history will
prove its decision was right. It had inside
information of the build-up of arms which
was taking place in Egypt.
Honourable senators, I hesitate at this time
to say anything that might make conditions
in the world more difficult.
So far as our giving aid to Hungary goes,
I am all in favour of it. But surely it would
be possible to make an arrangement whereby
our representative and a staff might be allowed to stay in that country to assure an
equitable distribution of the funds and clothes
that are being sent in. According to the
reports I hear, and they appear to be authentic, the Russians are taking over even the
money and clothes that are being sent by the
Red Cross. Of course, the Secretary General
of the United Nations has asked for permission to enter Hungary to inspect conditions
there, but the puppet government of that
country, backed by Moscow, has refused to
permit this.
Canada is perhaps able to and may give
more than a million dollars. We are taking
a calculated risk in making this contribution,
but I am not complaining about it. I do not
criticize the suggestion that we should waive
medical examination of refugees from Hungary. It may well be that in the exodus
from that country we shall get some undesirable persons. In the circumstances, we must
take that chance.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Calveri C. Pratt: Honourable senators, I am glad to have the opportunity of
saying a few words at this time. It is difficult
to appraise the finer points of policy which
are involved in the subject before us. Without an intimate knowledge of the facts from
a close association with the problems, one
cannot speak with full assurance on many
aspects of the case.
However, in the overall problem we are
united in one thought, namely, that the great
need is to work towards world peace. There
can be no division on that policy. More
particularly is that true of today, when we
cannot think in terms or methods of the
past. We have to realize that nations have
grown together, that geography is no longer
important, that rapid transportation and communication have for all practical purposes
eliminated distance, and we simply have to
learn to get along with one another as best
we can.

The complex situation in the Middle East
has been built up by the rapid events which
have taken place. Within a short time we
have witnessed such disturbing happenings
as Israel's invasion of Egypt, behind which
there had been irreconcilable conflicts. We
have seen the intervention of Great Britain
and France, the resurgence of Arab nationalism, and the belligerence displayed by
Nasser. A further complication was caused
by the contribution of armaments by Russia
and other supporting groups. This was followed by the seizure of the Suez Canal and
the bombing of Egyptian air bases.
Arising out of these and other events there
are bound to be conflicting views among
nations which I would regard as nations of
good judgment, peace and intelligence, and
with a will to co-operate. We know who
the great opponents are, and we know the
general divisions in the world today. Knowing that, we shall make a serious mistake
if in these days of emergency and stress
our eyes are focused too closely on the issues
between nations of good will.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prati: That is a point, honourable senators, which we must keep in mind,
and not allow ourselves to be carried away
by matters of policy which in the overall
picture are minor issues.
In the Middle East an actual war has been
in progress. True, it has been localized, but
it was fraught with the very great danger
of spreading out into a world conflict.
The United Nations Police Force which
was accepted by the General Assembly of
the United Nations, I understand, without
a dissenting vote-there were some abstentions, but not one vote against it-was certainly not to be a fighting force in the full
military sense. It was introduced, however,
as a contribution towards law and order and
a token of the will and determination of
nations to exert their influence and strength
to maintain peace. And I think, honourable
senators, we have every reason to be thankful and to appreciate the leadership which
was given by Canada in the introduction of
that policy in the United Nations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: The immediate result of it
is that four countries that were engaged in
military operations have agreed to a ceasefire. They have not agreed to a cease-fire
because of force, but because of this evidence,
we might say, of earnest intervention, or
earnest attempt to bring them together; and
except for the leadership given by Canada

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
we might have found by this time that a
world conflict was more evidently before us
than it is now, if indeed it was not actually
raging.
Honourable senators, some of the remarks
about the police force were in my view uncalled for. It has been referred to as a conveyor of typewriters and so forth, instead of
an armed force. Well, I think that sort of
talk gets us nowhere. The result so far is
that it has had an arresting effect, and that
is worth a tremendous lot. True, there has
not been a solution of the great difficulties
involved, but at least the trouble up to this
stage has been arrested. Who can honestly
look lightly upon that achievement? What
is ahead of us no one knows. However, I
think we can be thankful that that arresting
step at least has been taken.
The issues before the world in these matters and the consequences of them baffle the
imagination. As has been repeatedly said, if
earnest and co-operative efforts toward peace
are not made by the great powers, there may
be a war of extermination. For there is no
longer a possibility of victory for one and
defeat for another. The day for that kind of
thing is gone. This fact makes co-operative
efforts toward international good will absolutely essential. Reference has been made
in this chamber to the Munich Pact and so
on, but where does that get us? Honourable
senators, that belongs to the past. Today we
may look upon the attempt of appeasement
that was made only a few years ago as a
mistake, but we must not forget that the
atom bomb was then only in the realm of
speculation and the hydrogen bomb was not
even dreamt of. So these references to the
past are meaningless in the present situation.
Let us recall for a moment what was probably one of the most significant statements
ever made, a statement which will be remembered down through the years. It was
made for publication by that great scientist
Einstein just before he died and might be
regarded as his last message to the world. I do
not remember his exact words, but the substance was that he regretted the progress
that had been made in atomic science, seeing,
as he did, what might be ahead.
I bring this matter up because I feel our
thinking ought to be influenced and guided by
the changed circumstances of life. Honourable senators, as was said here just now we
should not advocate peace at any price; nevertheless we must work harder and more realistically for peace with honour, and perhaps
sacrifice more for it, than at any time in
human history. It is true we must have a
proper balance, but we should do nothing

which would in any way thwart an honest
down-to-earth effort to try to get the nations
together and resolve their difficulties.
We have heard it said, and it is true to a
certain degree, that there is a rift between
the Western nations. An honourable senator
said he regretted the attitude of the United
States to the Middle East question. I know
that his intention is good and sincere, but I
think it is a mistake at this time to express
recriminations which might tend to separate
us from our neighbours. If we are really
separated let us try to get together, not keep
apart, since it is only by working together
that we can possibly solve the tremendous
problems now facing the world.
There is one other phase of this matter to
which I would like to refer. I think that
public affairs today, in terms of party issues
and the conduct of our political life, must
be subordinated to the cause of international
co-operation. I do not speak from the viewpoint of any party in saying that partisan considerations should not be allowed to affect
our thinking on this matter. It may be that
a general election is not far off, but, whether
it is or not, while these great issues must
be discussed freely and publicly they should
be excluded from the realm of party politics,
because they rank in importance far above
such problems as we discuss and contend
about in our local communities.
I would like to mention from a non-partisan standpoint and pay tribute to the work
which has been done by our representatives
at the United Nations, and to express pride
at the place this country is taking in connection with these momentous affairs. Without respect to party, or to any political
affiliations whatsoever, all possible encouragement should be given to those who, facing
the tremendous issues of the hour, are doing
their best to act as mediators and co-ordinators. And that, I believe, is exactly what
our Canadian representatives are trying to
do, and I believe with very helpful effect.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
wish in the first place to congratulate sincerely our junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Wall) and my good friend from De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Fournier) upon the
excellent speeches they delivered in respectively moving and seconding the motion which
is now before us.
I have listened with great interest to this
debate, but for me to attempt to compliment
all who have already spoken would take too
long. I listened with particular interest to
the remarks so well presented by the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald).
My contribution will be brief. I simply
want to express my opinion on the role played

SENATE
by Canada at the United Nations since the
beginning of the double crisis which now
confronts the world.
In the Middle East the Arab nations have
never reconciled themselves to the existence
of Israel as an independent state. Our
honourable colleague from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has explained elaborately
the situation, which may be summed up in
the statement that peace has never been
restored to that troubled area of the world.
The purpose of the Arab states is simply
to drive the Jews into the sea. Tragic incidents have multiplied during the last months.
Aggression, of course, called for retaliation,
at first on a minor scale and then with increasing frequency and rapidity. Although
Israel, in trying to obtain redress for her
grievances, may have made some errors, she
also endured intolerable provocations, manifested in deeds as well as words. For instance as was noted by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity, she was denied
the use, to which she was fully entitled, of
the Suez canal. On that point Egypt refused
to comply with a decision of the United
Nations; and suddenly, on July 26, Colonel
Nasser violated the treaty of Constantinople,
of 1888, by forcibly taking possession of all
the assets of La Compagnie Universelle du
Canal de Suez. He then nationalized the
canal, although the company was entitled to
manage it until 1968.
This breach of the obligation which arose
under the treaty of 1888 was, in my opinion,
the immediate cause of what followed. Israel
started a so-called preventive war. But
under the Charter of the United Nations
resort to armed force is now allowed, though
only in the case of repelling an armed attack
against a given country. Such is the provision of article 51. I believe in the rule of
law in international as well as in domestic
matters. Preventive war cannot be justified
under the United Nations Charter, and this
principle applies to Israel, to Great Britain,
to France, and to all countries. Those two
great countries to which we are se closely
attached felt that it was in their vital interest to resort to armed intervention in
the Middle East because hostilities between
Israel and Egypt threatened the freedom of
the Suez Canal, which is literally a lifeline to
Great Britain and exceedingly important to
France.
I appreciate all those facts, but I deeply
regret that Great Britain and France invaded
Egypt before they had exhausted all peaceful
means of settlement-illusory as they may
seem-provided by the Charter of the United
Nations. I regret, too, that this military
action was taken by Great Britain and France
without their consulting other members of

NATO, and especially, in the case of Great
Britain, her sister nations of the Commonwealth.
This action seems to have endangered the
existence of NATO and the Commonwealth,
but thanks to the efforts of our Prime Minister and thanks to the splendid and prompt
action of our Secretary of State for External
Affairs, the Honourable Mr. Pearson, a solution was found-the only practical solution
in these tragic circumstances. The United
Nations General Assembly accepted Mr.
Pearson's original suggestion that the Secretary General make arrangements for a United
Nations' force to supervise cease-fire arrangements and to replace the Anglo-French forces
in Egypt. This Canadian proposai saved the
situation, and a United Nations Police Force,
under the very able command of a great
Canadian, General Burns, will ensure the
cessation of hostilities in the Middle East,
and, with the help of God, may make it
possible to bring about a permanent settlement between Israel and Egypt, which is
something we are ail hoping for.
Canada has thus played a role of world
leadership in the deliberations of the United
Nations. Her action has kept the Asian members of the Commonwealth from leaving this
great voluntary association of free nations
to which we are so proud to belong. Canada
bas greatly contributed, also, to healing the
breach which has momentarily separated
Great Britain and France from the United
States.
The Canadian Government fully
deserves our congratulations for what she
has accomplished, and it should be given
our support in the difficult days ahead. At
the meetings of the General Assembly of the
United Nations it was towards Canada that
the majority of member states were turning
for guidance. This marks a historical occasion which should be a source of legitimate
pride for all Canadians.
The case of Hungary is pitiful. I feel
powerless in the face of such drama, and
as a lover of democratic freedom I am overwhelmed with emotion when I think of the
brutal aggression committed by communist
Russia.
Hungarian hospitals have been
shelled, Red Cross ambulances have been set
afire, and thousands upon thousands of Hungarian men, women and children, have been
killed, wounded or deported. Those brave
people were able to regain their liberty for
only a few days, but we are confident that
time will prove that the Hungarian workers
and students who fought for freedom will
not have shed their blood in vain, and that
these tragic days will mark the dawn of a
new freedom for all Hungarians. In the
meantime the Canadian Government is doing

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
everything in its power to assist Hungarian
refugees who want to come to Canada. The
gates of our country are open wide to them,
and so are our hearts. We are confident that
once these people reach our shores they will
be proud to become Canadians. In this country they will share our liberty, happiness
and prosperity.
Canada is not one of the world's great
powers, but she is a land of freedom where
the rule of law is supreme. Under the
premiership of Mr. St. Laurent, Canada has
assumed the role of a champion of justice
and human brotherhood. The name of our
country is respected throughout the world
as that of a peace-loving Christian nation
which fulfils religiously all ber obligations
under the United Nations Charter, and which
endeavours earnestly under all circumstances
to set a good example for the rest of the
world.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
may I compliment the mover of the Address,
(Hon. Mr. Wall), who gave, I think, one of
the most scholarly and informative addresses
that we have had the pleasure of hearing in
this chamber.

country, and implied, perhaps, that because
of a certain sentiment, which is quite understandable, they might be disposed to support
Britain and France in the actions which they
have taken in Egypt. Without for one moment impugning the sincerity of anyone who
takes the attitude that the Leader of the
Opposition has taken, I suggest that a Canadian who is not a member of either of the
dominant races can discuss the matters before
us objectively, without prejudice, and with a
reasonable degree of the saving grace of common sense.
May I also say, as one who does not always
see eye to eye with the Government, that I
take a real pleasure in finding myself in
agreement with it in so far as its actions in
the Middle East and in the United Nations
are concerned.
I need not deal with the matter of Hungary,
for it bas already been discussed. However,
I think I should say that in spite of what
my honourable friend across from me saidand I do not believe he really meant it-I am
confident that the Senate, the Commons, the
Government, the Parliament of Canada, and,
indeed, everyone in Canada is entirely in
sympathy with the people of Hungary, and
that all are willing to do everything possible
to assist her unfortunate people.

SENATE
of the United Nations shall be approved;
whether Canada shall observe its pledge as
a faithful member of the United Nations. To
me it is just as simple as that. We, together
with others, must support the United Nations
or it will die, and with it will perish the
one chance of maintaining peace. To me that
seems important, for once we condone the
action of any country or countries which,
in violation of their pledge, proceed on their
own to begin hostilities and establish the
very vicious principle of preventive war,
the United Nations will die; for this is war,
although, quite unconvincingly to me, it is
called a police action. The United Nations
can play no favourites. If powerful nations
can repudiate the vital principles which they
are pledged to observe as members, yes, as
leading members in the organization of the
United Nations, then in the future any one
of the 79 member nations can attack any other
country for grievances, real or imaginary, and
the whole purpose of the United Nations will
be defeated. Then the UN will die, as the
League of Nations died after it refused to
intervene when Mussolini attacked Ethiopia.
To my mind it would be a crime if Canada
were to assist in the destruction of the only
organization that has at least a prospect of
avoiding a world war. I disagree entirely
and emphatically with the defeatist and
depressing prophecy of my friend the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) that there must be,
as I think he called it, a show-down or a war
between Russia and the United States, and
that either the one or the other will control
the world. I do not like that thought.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
member a question?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What action has the United
Nations taken against Russia's attack on
Hungary?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have not commented on
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Both countries are members
of the United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Quite so. I am not saying
the United Nations is perfect, but I maintain that it is the only organization from
which we can gather any hope of preserving
the peace of the world. That in itself is
ample reason for preserving the United
Nations.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am sure there is not a
member of this chamber so pessimistie in his
outlook as to believe that inevitably Russia

and the United States will go to war, and
that as a result one or other will rule the
world.
May I say, with respect to attacks on
smaller nations, that the day of so-called
gunboat diplomacy is gone, and the more
powerful nations must realize that threats
against smaller countries will no longer
be effective, provided the United Nations
observes the principles upon which it is
founded.
My friend the Leader of the Opposition
made some reference to Mr. Chamberlain,
one-time Prime Minister of Great Britain,
and his trip to Munich to make an agreement
with Hitler. My friend was not very complimentary to Mr. Chamberlain; he even used
the expression "Don't be a Chamberlain".
I would remind my friend that at the time
of Mr. Chamberlain's return from Munich
to London the people of Great Britain and
Canada and, indeed, the world at large,
rejoiced at what he had done. The experiment, as my friend called it, was unsuccessful. Unfortunately, that is so, but it is
easy to be wise after the event. At that time
the world thought Mr. Chamberlain had done
a wonderful thing in ensuring "peace in our
time".
In passing I might mention the fact that
Mr. Eden, as he then was, was Foreign
Secretary in Mr. Chamberlain's cabinet.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And he resigned.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, be resigned in protest against what he called the appeasement
of Hitler. Well, Mr. Eden, now Sir Anthony,
has tried another experiment: along with
France and Israel, Britain has invaded Egypt.
I am very sure that if something were not
being done to modify the results of their
action, that experiment might have proved
more disastrous than Mr. Chamberlain's
negotiations with Hitler.
What have been the results of this adventure against Egypt? It has brought about the
very

things which

the attackers

professed

they wished to avoid. One of the reasons
advanced was that they wanted to preserve
the Suez Canal. But they did not preserve it:
it is now out of use for six months and
perhaps longer. The pipe lines through Syria
have been partially destroyed. Not only are
Britain and France deprived of the use of
necessary oil, but all the nations of Western
Europe are in the same position, and may
continue to be for a long time.
Let us look at some other very undesirable
results of the action. There is the slaughter
of thousands of people in the attack made on
Port Said and elsewhere. It has resulted, I
regret to say, in the humiliation of two proud

NOVEMBER 29. 1956
nations, Britain and France. It is a great
shock to the world that they, of all countries,
should have repudiated their obligations to
the United Nations. It has created hatred in
the hearts of the Arab people. We may not
regard them as important, but they are human
beings and in some number. Not only that,
but it has caused distrust among hundreds of
millions of people living in the Far East. A
still more unfortunate result is the extreme
danger of disunity in the Commonwealth. Mr.
Pearson himself said in the House of Commons that there was an imminent danger of
a breach between the member countries of
the Commonwealth. A further result has
been the very unfortunate rift between
Britain and the United States.
My friend the Leader of the Opposition
has said some rather unkind things about the
United States. I have not always been in
favour of the actions of that country; in fact,
in this chamber I criticized very severely the
conduct of Mr. Dulles, its Secretary of State,
for certain actions which he took, and
by which, he boasted, he brought his country
to the brink of war, and then avoided it. I
disapprove very strongly of such actions. But
let us not forget the unalterable fact that
Britain and France cannot afford to get along
without the friendship and assistance of the
United States.
I come to the last and most serious result
of the action taken in the Middle East,
namely, that through our actions we are playing directly into the hands of Russia. To
offset all these unfavourable results there is
no gain that I can see.
I detest war. As a matter of principle, I
suppose everyone claims to detest war, but
in practice many people do not follow that
principle. Surely the last two wars have convinced us that no one wins a war, and that
everyone loses.
Some years ago I attended a gathering of
prominent men, among whom was a statesman well known to most of you. The Second
World War was threatening at the time, and
the discussion was with regard to Danzig, the
Baltic German port, which was taken from
Germany and ceded to Poland under the
Treaty of Versailles. During the discussion
this wise old statesman said, "Surely we are
not going to war on account of Danzig". One
of the younger and less wise men there said,
"Oh, there are worse things than war". I
asked him, "Just tell me one". I received no
reply.
During the current debate there have been
quotations from some philosophers. Believe
it or not, in the past few weeks I have been
reading the works of some of the great
philosophers. I recently read with much

interest some of the writings of that outstanding Frenchman, Voltaire, and noted with
special interest this observation:
War is the greatest of all crimes and yet there is
no aggressor who does not colour his crime with
the pretence of justice. It is forbidden to kill;
therefore murderers are punished unless they kill
in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.

Honourable senators, my criticisms today
may not be received favourably by all, but I
am sincere in what I say. I rose to speak
solely for the purpose of saying that Canada
must adhere to its pledges in the United
Nations, whose Charter we signed, and which
is the one organization today that has any
chance of bringing about peace. May we hope
that the situation may yet be saved. It is no
disgrace to admit a mistake; it may indeed
be a noble thing to do.
The erring countries-and I use the word
advisedly, because I think these nations were
wrong in invading Egypt-have agreed to
withdraw. I am glad of that. Let them as
quickly as is reasonably possible retire from
an untenable position, regain the respect and
the good will of the world, and co-operate
with the United Nations in pursuing the purposes for which it was established. When
that is done, when the hot blood and the
passions have cooled, I belleve the matter
of the Suez, together with the other difficulties
of the Middle East, can be adjusted with
justice to all.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. W. DeB. Farris: Honourable senators, I did not intend to speak in this debate.
I arrived here only this afternoon after being
up all night on a plane. I have been tied
up with other work and so have had no
opportunity to prepare notes on the subject
under discussion; and it is something on
which one should not speak without very
thoughtful preparation. However, a remark
of my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has prompted me to go on record
with just a word or two. There is a higher
law even than that of unvarying loyalty to
the United Nations, and that is the law of
self-preservation. When nations like England
and France take action in the honest belief
that events are moving that will threaten
their existence, and when Russia and certain
other members of the United Nations voice
their disapproval with tongue in cheek, I am
not prepared to accept the suggestion that
Britain and France have repudiated their
obligations.
The motion for the Address was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Ordered that the
said address be presented to His Excellency

SENATE
the Governor General by such members of
this house as are members of the Honourable
the Privy Council.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I understand that the Address bas received
approval in the House of Commons and that
that house is now in committee of supply
and may dispose of its business this evening.
I would therefore suggest that this chamber
now rise, to reassemble at 9.30 this evening,
or earlier at the call of the bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8.00 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 7
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 2, an Act for granting to
Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1956.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I move the second reading now.
This bill provides for the payment of the
sum of one million dollars.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Have copies of the bill
been distributed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; the bill has just
come from the Commons and it is impossible
to have it printed and distributed this evening.
As far as I know, thus far no bill of this
kind has been based entirely on the contents
of a Speech from the Throne. Honourable
senators will recall that the Speech referred
to two matters only: one, the setting up of a
police force under the United Nations; the
other, provision for the grant of a sum of
money for Hungarian relief. The present
bill deals with both these matters: it is to
provide one million dollars for Hungarian
relief. I do not know whether on a previous
occasion I explained how that sum will be
spent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You did not.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I intended to ask about
that before the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) resumed
his seat.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I might answer it now.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I was going to ask the
honourable Leader of the Government to
tell us what form this grant of one million
dollars is to take. Is it to be in the form of
a grant of wheat, or of flour? I should like
to see some wheat sent over. Will the provision be of goods or of money? And how
is it to be distributed? What agency will
handle it? Will the honourable gentleman
give us the fullest particulars he can in regard to these matters?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think that is a fair
question and I will try to answer it as completely as I can.
If I recall correctly, when the honourable
Leader of the Opposition spoke on the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne
he referred to a grant of $200,000. In so
stating it he was correct. That is the amount
which was originally mentioned, but it was
never the intention that there should be no
more. It was made up of two definite sums
of $100,000; and the arrangement which we
hope to carry out is to remit $100,000 in cash
to the International Red Cross, which is already operating inside Hungary, and $100,000
to the United Nations Commissioner for
Refugees. The remaining $800,000 may be
paid in cash or may be in the form of supplies.
A definite decision in that respect bas not yet
been reached. Probably distribution will be
made as recommended to the Government by
the Secretary of State for External Affairs
when the situation has been more completely
studied.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Will some of this million
dollars be expended to advance fares to
refugees, or will such advances be apart from
the present million dollar grant?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I doubt very much
whether any of the million dollars will be
used for advancing fares to refugees. That
is not the intention. The Department of
Citizenship and Immigration has funds for
that purpose. It is expected that a large
portion of this money will go for the alleviation of suffering among the refugees who are
already outside Hungary, living in emergency
refugee camps in Austria.
I think I should emphasize the fact that any
money which eventually will be administered
or used for relief purposes within the borders
of Hungary will not be handed over to the
Hungarian Government or to any of its
agencies, but will be carefully administered
by the International Red Cross, which, as I
have said, is already operating within Hungary itself. I mention that because during
the debate it was suggested, I think by the

SENATE
I know the provincial Governments would
listen to a request from the federal Government more than they would from some of us
fellows in opposition here and in another
place.
I happen to know a few European refugees
who settled in and around Winnipeg after
the Russians had overrun their countries a
One couple came from
few years ago.
Germany, where the woman had been a
dressmaker and the husband a tailor. When
they arrived here a group of welfare workers
in Winnipeg got the woman placed in a home
as a domestic. Under the regulations she
had to work as a domestic for one year, then
she was free to take employment elsewhere.
She is a very clever dress designer and is now
operating a profitable dressmaking establishment in Winnipeg. There are many similar
cases.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There bas been an
alarming shortage of farm help in this
country and it has been almost an impossibility to get hired help on farms in Saskatchewan this fall and winter. Many farmers
have moved into the city and have vacated
comfortable farm homes. It may be that
with financial assistance some of these
Hungarian refugees could acquire a bit of
stock and move onto these farms and start
a new life in that way. I am sure that if
there are any experienced farmers amongst
these people they will have no difficulty in
securing farm employment in the West. This
may also be so in eastern Canada.
Hon. Mr. Howden: I believe it is one of
the functions of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration to help place people
like these. It is to my definite knowledge
that the department has done a good job in
settling many immigrants in Winnipeg and
elsewhere in Manitoba, and I am quite sure
that it could make satisfactory arrangements
to place these unfortunate Hungarians in
homes throughout Manitoba and other parts
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wonder if it would be feasible to have a
part of this relief aid take the form of
credits? I have in mind the use of some of
our surplus food supplies. In the district
from which I come there are large piles of
wheat lying around in the open. I spoke to
a farmer just a few days ago who said he
had 200,000 bushels of wheat and his neighbour had 250,000 bushels, which they could
not sell. It would be a great help to everybody if some of this food could be used for
the relief of the Hungarian people.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
first, with regard to the co-operation which

the Department of Citizenship and Immigration is receiving from the provincial Governments, may I say that I am sure that the
Honourable Mr. Pickersgill and his officials
welcome wholeheartedly any assistance and
co-operation which may be received from
any provincial Government in Canada. I recall, as the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) said, that the Ontario Government
has sent its Agent General in London, England, Major J. S. P. Armstrong, to Austria,
and I noticed in the press today that the
honourable Mr. Frost, Premier of Ontario,
sent one of the members of the Legislature
to Austria to assist. If other provinces would
like to do so, I can assure the Leader of the
Opposition that they will get all the help
it is possible to give them from our Immigration Department in Vienna, and also that the
department will welcome them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It may be possible
to use a portion of this money to send supplies from Canada. The sum of $800,000
will be used in the way which is deemed
best, and the advice on that matter we will
take from our Department of External Affairs,
which is in close touch with the situation in
Austria and in Hungary. I am sure that the
Leader of the Opposition and others who
have spoken will all feel confident that this
money will be handled as quickly as possible
for the relief of these people, and in the best
manner possible.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is there not an item there
for one dollar?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is for the United
Nations Police Force, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; there are the
two items.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think some of our
members understood that. I have had the
advantage of seeing that and looking it over
carefully.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I intended to say,
and I thought I did say, that the bill covered
the two items referred to in the Speech from
the Throne, that is, $1 million for Hungarian
relief, and $1 in connection with our contribution to the expenses of the United Nations Police Force-one dollar being voted
because we do not know yet what the cost
will be. It is included in the present grant
of $1 million for national defence, so $1
will be added, making a total of $1 million
and one dollar.

NOVEMBER 29, 1956
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: May I have the
privilege of drawing to the attention of
honourable senators a clipping from a newspaper I have just received today with reference to relief which is being offered in Newfoundland for the Hungarian refugees who
are passing through

Gander

airport?

The

relief is being organized by the Canadian
Red Cross Society; and the Salvation Arrny,
the Canadian Legion, service clubs and other
organizations in Newfoundland, under the
society's direction, are very actively engaged
in this work. These organizations are calling
for men's, women's and children's clothing,
which will be offered to the refugees as they
are passing through Gander airport, and
the response of the people has been so
generous that, as the newspaper says, the
organizations were "bombarded with clothing" and can scarcely cope with the large
quantity that has been received.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that when the Senate adjourns this
evening it stand adjourned until Tuesday,
January 8, 1957, at 10 o'clock in the forenoon.
The motion was agreed to.

NEW SENATORS
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

I have the honour to inform the Senate that
the Clerk has received certificates from the
Secretary of State of Canada showing that
the following persons, respectîvely, have
been summoned to the Senate:
Hon. Sydney John Smith,
Hon. Austin Claude Taylor,
Hon. William Albert Boucher,
Hon. Henri Charles Bois.

Senate that there were senators without,
waiting to be introduced:
The following newly-summoned senators
were severally introduced, and presented Her
Mai esty's writs of summons, which were read
by the Clerk Assistant, and took the oath
prescribed by law, and were seated:
Hon. Austin Claude Taylor, of Salisbury,
New Brunswick, introduced between Hon.
Mr. Macdonald and Hon. Mr. Burchili.
Hon. Henri Charles Bois. of St. Bruno,
Quebec, (Electoral division, Montarville),
introduced between Hon. Mr. Macdonald and
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt.
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that each of the two newly-summoned senators named above had made and subscribed
the declaration of qualification required by
the British North America Act, 1867, in the
presence of the Clerk of the Senate, the
Commissioner appointed to receive and witness the said declaration.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
unfortunately the other two new senators,
the Honourable Sydney John Smith and the
Honourable William Albert Boucher, cannot
be here today, but it is expected that they
will arrive before the beginning of next
week.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon, W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, at this point perhaps I may announce
the business that it is proposed to deal with
in the Senate for the remainder of this week.
Honourable senators will observe that the
chamber is arranged for the formai opening
of the new session this afternoon. It will
take a long time to re-establish our desks,
for the facilities for moving them are not
good. In the circumstances, it is unlikely
that much work can be done satisfactorily
here until the beginning of next week.
I have asked Senator Vaillancourt to sit
at my right, as Deputy Leader of the Government, when the desks are properly set up.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He will take the place
of Scnator Godbout, who passed away shortly
after the close of the last session.
I understand that His Honour the Speaker
proposes to open the new session this afternoon with prayers, after the Governor
General has read the Speech from the
Throne. There will then be the usual formai
motions, one of which will be to set up
the Selection Committee, composed of the

JANUARY 8, 1957
same members as were appointed to it last
year. I would suggest that that committee
meet tomorrow morning. Its report would
then be brought in tomorrow afternoon, and
considered on Thursday.
One committee that would like to start
work as soon as possible is the Divorce Committee. I suggest that tomorrow afternoon we
could approve the report of the Selection
Committee with respect to the Divorce Committee only, so that that committee may meet
on the following day for organizational purposes, if the Chairman so desires. If that were
done he would be in a position to bring in
his first report on Thursday. The other committees would not be approved until Thursday.
Honourable senators will have noticed that
I did not refer to the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne. I do not think it
would be fitting to proceed with the Address
while the chamber is in its present condition,
and I suggest that we proceed with it next
Tuesday evening. I have asked Senator Bois
to move, and Senator Sydney Smith to second,
the Address. Of course, this is all conditional
on any other legislation which might come
to us, although I have no notice of any such
legislation.
Honourable Senators, this is a tentative
program which I hope will meet with the
approval of the members of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I wish
to thank the honourable leader for his clear
statement. I think it would be most helpful
to all of us if this procedure were followed
more often.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that the Senate rise at this time, to
resume at the call of the bell, at approximately 10.55.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

memory of Sir Robert Borden, on the lawn
west of the West Block of the Parliament
Buildings, will be unveiled.
The actual unveiling will be shown on television screens set up at the entrance of the
Hall of Honour in the Centre Block, where
continuing ceremonies will be held immediately after the unveiling.
Honourable
senators and members of their families are
cordially invited to attend.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
