OFFICIAL REPORT
THE SENATE
Thursday, January 26, 1928.
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the despatch

of business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
OPENING OF THE SESSION
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from
the Governor
General's
Secretary
informing him that His Excellency the
Governor General would proceed to the
Senate Chamber to open the Session of the
Dominion Parliament this day at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At
three o'clock His Excellency the
Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne.
His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the
Second Session of the Sixteenth Parliament
of the Dominion of Canada with the following
Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Memnbers of the House of Commons:
It affords me much pleasure to meet you
at the commencement of another session of
Parliament and to be able to congratulate you
ulpon the marked prosperity of the country.
The volume of trade and of building construction, the growth in employment, the increased
railway receipts, the expanding revenues, and
business conditions generally, all bear testimony
to a sound economie development which
promises nmuch in the way of substantial
progress.
The celebrations of the Sixtieth Anniversary
of Confederation, held during the past summer,
were of a memorable character. They evoked
in ail parts of the Dominion a spirit of national
pride and patriotism.
Related to the commenoration. and outstanding among the events
of- the year. was the ývisit of Their Royal
Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Prince

George, and the Prime Minister of Great
Britain. The welcome everywhere accorded
the representatives of the Royal Family and
the representative of the British Parliament
evidenced the strength of the ties which unite
in a common allegiance the members of the
British Commonwealth of Nations.
Striking recognition has been accorded
Canada's position in the League of Nations
through the selection of Canada by the
Assembly to a non-permanent seat on the
Council of the League.
As contemplated by the conclusions of the
Jiperial Conference of 1926, provision was
made on July 1 for direct communication
between His Majesty's Government in Canada
and His Majesty's other Governments of the
British Empire. The further implementing of
tiese conclusions which aim at more effective
consultation through personal contact by the
appointment to Canada of a representative of
His Majesty's Government in Great Britain is
being discussed between the Secretary of State
for Dominion Affairs in Great Britain, who is
at present in Canada, and members of my
Government.
By agreement between the
Governments of France and Canada and the
Governments of Japan and Canada it is
proposed that each of' these countries shall be
represented in the other by a Minister
Plenipotentiary.
Following the announcenent made during the
last Session of Parliament, a Conference was
convened at Ottawa .in November between the
Dominion Government and the Governments of
the Provinces of Canada. It is the opinion of
my advisers that this Conference proved of the
utmost value in facilitating a full and free
exehange of views between the participating
Governments on problems of mutual interest
and coneern. Your attention will be invited
during the present Session to some of the more
important matters discussed at the Conference.
As a result of the Dominion-Provincial
Conference, my advisers have decided, pending
a complete revision of the financial arrangements as contemplated by the Duncan Report,
to reeonmmend the continuance to the Maritime
Provinces of the money grants made at the
last session. In the liglit of the discussions at
the Conference, my Ministers are continuing
negotiations with the Prairie Provinces for the
return of their natural resources and are
giving consideration to the restoration te the
Province of British Columbia of the lands of
the railw'ay belt and the Peace River block.
Consideration is also being given to the railway
problems of the several provinces, as outlined
at the Conference.
The work of reconditioning that portion of
the Hudson Bay railway previously constructed
bas been finished. After most careful examination and consideration, and upon the best
advice obtainable, Churchill has been selected

provincial centres have already been establislied for the reception and distribution of
British youths for agricultural work, and a
constructive settlement scheme bas been put
into force for settlers of this class.
The opening of new territory by the
construction of branch lines of railway is
proceeding rapidly, and is providing wider
opportunities for settlement.
Harbour Commissions have been established
at the ports of St. John and Halifax. This,
it is expected. will facilitate and expand the
movement of traffic through Atlantic seaports.
The volume of trade at other Canadian ports
duiiring the past season bas increased. In grain
shipments, the Port of Montreal attained a
pre-eminent position among world ocean ports.
Much progress bas been made in the
development of aviation in the Dominion. An
organization has been established for the
administration of civil aviation, distinct from
that of the Air Force. To assist in the
developinent of transoceanic air routes, a site
for an airship base lias been purchased near
Moutreal. Ait airship mooring tower will be
erectel and a public air terminal for aeroplanes
provided.
In the postal service the year bas been

That the following Address be presented to

the thanks of this Huse for the graciaus Speech
yvhich he has been pleased to make to hoth
Houses of Parliament,' namely:
To His Excellency the Right' Honourable

He said: I arn ful'ly appreciative of the
lionour conferred upon me in being chosen
as the mover of this Address, and 1 would
that I were riper in years and richer in experience that I miglit do justice to tlie demands
of the occasion.
The Address which lias been brouglit down
may *be divided into two phases, the retrospective and the prospective. To me it is
particularly important in its rehearsal of the
historie features of tlie past year, for I believe
that too inuel stress cannot be laid upon the
celebration of the Diamon-d Jubilee of Confederation and upan the part played in that
celebration by representatives of the Royal
Family and of the Britisli Government.
56109-lij

We are all boastful of the present prosperity and the unparalleiled prospects which lie
before Canada to-day, and we are perhaps too
prone to look upon that prosperity as of our
own making and to forget the "main chance"
in an atmosphere of eommercialism. Where
would we be to-day and wliat would be our
prosperity had it flot been for the broad
vision and the self-sacrificing citizenship of
the fathers of Confederation, out of whose
labours was born our heritage of to-day?
What the fate of that lieritage will be in the
years to corne rests with us to-day, and is
dependent on our vision and our capacity to
bequeathe that vision to the next generation.
It
seems particu-larly fltting that the
celebration of our sixtieth birthday should
have taken the f orrn of a tlianksgiving, a
thanksgiving tliat was a family affair, and that
the Queen of Empire and Mother of Pa.rliaments shou.ld have graced the family circle
in the daughter's house. Truly the daugliter
has come into lier own, and lias won recognition in the Council of the League of
Nations. It is a matter of congratulation,
too, and an lionour to this House, tliat the
responsibility af that representation lias been
ably borne by the honourable leader of the
Government in this bouse. All Canada is
justly proud af this further contribution of
the Province of Quehea which lias given so
many men to the public life af the country,
men who have rendered and are stili rendering a distinct service to the Dominion.
I
repeat that a distinct lionour lias come to tliis
House.
The past year, too, lias seen a furtber
deveiopment of the co-operative idea taught
by Confederation in that we have had the
conference between the Dominion Governme-nt and the Governments of the Provinces
of Canada-a conferenlce marked by hiarmony,
andi out of which will come greater uniýty
and a stili greater spirit of good wilI.
On the material and prospective sie we
have every reason ta ýbe proud. Canada,
twenty-fourth, among the nations of the
world as to population, is to-day fifth as to
trade.
Our agricultural and live stock devel'opment
is such that we m-ay hope some day in the
not far distant future to be-come the greatest
food supply house in the worl.
Coming from the county of Middlesex,
wliere I arn ratiher largely interested in farming, and at the same time extensively engaged in the marnfacturing and business life
af the ýcity of London, I gladly weicome any
line of attion on the part of tihe Governffment

My remarks, honoiîrablc gentlemen, will be
confincd to a few personal considerations which
have been suggested to me, -dîrectly or indirectly, ba' the Speech froma the Throne, and
which I shall makc as brief ais passible.
There is to be noted in the first place a

whil', most ocher counitrîrs, particularly t-hose

JANUARY 31, 1928
Notwithstanding the creative power of gold,
however, honourable gentlemen, we must not
stop at the thought that the great¶1es and the
progress of a race, a people, or nation are
based solely upon material prosperity. There
is another aim, whieh' 1 consider stili -more
necessoery for the welfare of our country: it
's the cultivation of a common mentality, the
adoption of a truly national credo, and, in
matters of special concern, the deveiopment
and expansion of essentially Canadian thought.
This ideal towards whirlh we shouid aiways
strive, as Canadians fully conscious of our
civic responsibility, is founded upon a spirit
of understanding and mutu-al confidence,
respect for minority rights, and friendly feelings towards each other on the part of the
different groups composing our vast country
and the different element.s inhabiting it.
We have been piaced by Providence on this
North American continent to live and prosper
side by sîde. Two great races predomi-nate,
one of Gailie origin, the other of Anglo-Saxon
descent. The former is here by right of
discovery, the other by right of conquest. To
the one belongs the glory of hýaving been the
pioncer and evangelizing race, ta the other
the credit of having organized, developed
and brought to successful completion many
great undertakings. The two represent the
finest in modern civilization, and the duality
of language, art and literature is and wili
remain one of the most precious advantages
of this Canadian la.nd.
"Catiline is at the gates of Rome and we are
deliberating"! exclaimed on a memorable
occasion an ancient legisiator. Thanks to the
friendly relations we have maintained with
the outslde world for many decades, honourable gentlemen, our country is free from invasion, and no horde of barbarians threatens
our institutions, thougha our frontiers extend
unfortified for more than three thousand miles.
But other enemies endanger our future as a
nation, and these are within our gates: they
are the base exploiters who systematically
endeavour to keep race prejudice, ýreligious
bittemness or local susceptibilities aroused, and
who take an infernal deiight in stirring up
such subversive feelings, which undermine the
very foundations of our Canadian community.
A truce to ail these u.npatriotic, anti-Gliristian,
anti-sociai tacties! Would it no't be folly on
our part, 'honourable gentlemen, to waste our
time in petty, ehildish squabblcs amongst ourselves when Providence calls us and urges us
on to a destiny more and more glorious? Let
us aIl then generously agree to live in perfect
harmony and to maintain the most scrupuloUs
respect for the constitution which governs us.

5

Let the aine Canadian provinces, industrious
and prosperous in their respective spheres,
study their problems in the light of a national
spirit and deal with them ini the same way.
Under these conditions Canadian Confederation, the Diamond Jubilee of whicha we have
been celebrating with such spiendor in the
year 1927, wîii -continue to be the brightest
jewel in the Britis-h Crown; Canada will be
the most important centre of that glorious
commonwealth of free nations comprising a
vast Empire whose dominions extend to the
end,é of the earth, and on which the sun neyer
s-ets!1

Allow me, honourabie gentlemen, before
ciosing, to make a respectful personal allusion
to those distinguished members of this Chamber who in recent months 'have passed away,
and particularly to the kindly personality of
him wbom I have the honour to succeed, Hon.
Senator M-cCoig. Honest and irreproachabie
citizen, friend of the farmer, steadfast defender
of the rights of the peop le, "Archie"-hc wouid
not allow of being called ýotherwise, even
after his political chiefs had recognized his
value and menit in having 'him elevated to the
Senate-will long continue to live in the
memorv of those to whom he was ever a wise
counseilor and unfailingly loyal and devoted
frienci. May the administration of ou-r public
affairs be entrusted always to representatives
as able, as sincere, as broadminded and as
unselfish!
Honourable gentlemen, I dlaiým also, as the
Benjamin of this Huse, the privilege of
off ering to the grand old man who is its dean,
the honouraýbie Senator from St. Hyacinthe,
the tribute of my respect and sincere admiration. To succeeding generations he is a
magnificent, living example not only of
phys;ical vigor, but aiso and especially of civic
integrity.

Before resuming my seat, honourable gentlemen, I desire ta express pubiicly my thanks
to the iGovernmen-t of my country for the
courageotîs gestîîre it has made in recngnizing
the dlaim of the French group in Ontario to a
fairer representation in officiai and administrative circles. I am quite embarrassed that
its choice Ëhould have fallen upon my young
and humble self. I appreciate what new
responsibilities this great honour involves. I
come ýto this Chamber with ail the fire and
enthusiasmn of youtb. In contact with your
wisdom and experience, honoiirable colleagues,
I hope shortly to reach a "good average" as
a legisiator, and to be able to give sufficiently
intelligent and sensible consideration týo the
questions laid before t-his Chamber for final
settiement, especiaily as I shall have beeii
traîned in a good sehool.

Certain other subjeets are faintly adumbrated in the Speeoh from the Throne. I

Further than that, there is some suggestion
of the development of the St. Lawrence; but
owing to the fact that this matter lias gone
to the Courts, it m-ay flot be one for early
disposition by Parliament.
Then there is the question of provincial
riglits. It is a little difficuit to, say what the
Government propose doing on that question,
because it covers flot only such metters as
the centrol of naturel resources by the
Northwest Provinces, but also various dealings
with the Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island. However,
until the Government bring down something
specific, I do not think it is possible for eny
man to say more than that tliey will be
expected to carry out their promises in
accordance with the Duncan report; but until
they produce sornething definite it is impossible for any one to say just what Vhey are
doing.
Aaaother subject on which I feel rather
strongly is with regard to government
embassies in foreign countries. I have my
own views on that subj ect. 1 neyer believed
in them, anid do not believe in them now.
1 think there is a great deal of danger
connected with embassies. No one can say
what may happen any day. An embassy in
a for'eign country is a ticklish thing, for an
ambassador may say or do something thet
wvili get the Government into trouble. We
have only to look across the line and remember a letter that was written by a British
ambassador during an election. H1e got lais
congé the next day.
Such trouble has
happened more than once on the other side
of the line. If you have embassies in Tokîo,
in France, or in the United States, one of
those representatives may do an indiscreet
thing, andi what are we going to do about it?
We are in no position to deai with sucli a
situation like an independent nation thet has
ber own army and lier own navy. The whole
thing reminds me of the dog grasping at the
shadow: there is nothing to it et aîl. There
is nothing at aIl to justify us in esteblislaing
these embassies. They will involve us in a
great deai of eepense, $100,000 liere and
$200,000 there, ail of which wiIl lielp to increase taxation. What we could very well
afford to have in ail these f oreiga countries
is a first-class business man, and a staff, who

what is proposed, what wiil we get? If you
go to Washington, for instance, what happens?
Letter-writing begins, and it takes a week or
ten days te, get at something that a trade
commissioner couid find out inside of an hour.
I 'had thought of referring to the deveiopment of the St. Lawrence, which is a very
important matter, but inasmucli as it is before the courts, perliaps it is better to drop
it for the present.
I want týo say a word or two with regard
to the scientific research whicli we are promised. Frank-ly, I may say that I arn in favour
of scientifie research, upon a certain condition,
namely, that it is conducted along lines tliat
are not being followed by other nations who
are as ricli or richer than we are. You can
get an illustration of duplication of research
in our agricultural stations, and men in the
other Cliamber who know those stations wiil
corroborate wliat I say. Take, for instance,
the investigation into the growing and feeding
of steers. It is simply nauseating. Every
country in Europe lias worked et that problem, every State in the American Union has
worked et it, andi every province in Canada
bas done likewise. It is e sort of monkey
business-because one station does it, every
other station follows suit. Tlien, from that
tliey pass to egg-laying contests, which may
be a goori enough tliing for one or two
stations to work et; 'but it is ridiculous for
tliem ail to be et it, especially wlien the
ground lias already been covereri in almost
every civi-lizeri country in the worid. Tliey
have struck the right note in England in this
regard. There, in connection with the investigation of pests, it came to light that the
Government of New Zealand were investigating in their institutions the extermination of
certain pests, so the British Government said,
"AIl rig.ht, you go ahead with that; we will
drop it, and go on witli something else." On
condition that wisdom and common sense
are used, I arn in favour of scientifie researchi.
No country can expect to go aliead to-day
that does not realize the value of science and
scientifïe researcli; but let us mix with it some
common sense instead of wasting our money
in doing things that aidready have been donc,
or are being done by others, j ust as well. as
we can do thern. Let us turu to something
else, and then exchange idees.

TherTe are fourteen representatives; in the Council, and when, on tbe
evcning of the day affer thbe elction ef
Cainadla, a journalist camne and asked me:

JANUARY 31, 1928
"What will be the attitude of Canada on the
Councils?" My anewer was that it would be
that of the thirteen other members. The
matters confided to the Counocil are differonces between côuntries, complaints from
min-orities that ýlaimn to have rightis under
treaties made after 1918, a.nd wh-ich gives
them some guarantee or some protection; and
flot only is it the duty of the Council to
try to settie the difficulties that arise, but
to prevent their taking an acute form.
This is not the time to enter into a detailed
statesnent of the activities of the Council.
We may have some occasion during the
Session to speak of the doings of the Assembly
at the time of its last sitting in September,
1917, and of the action of the Council in
vari-ous matters. AIl I desire- to say for the
present is that the election of Canada to the
Council was hailed with favour by most of
the delegates present. Though the maj ority
of Canada was email, 1 may say that, generally speaking, outside of those who were
special -rivais of Canada in this regard, Canad
encounitered no enmity, but found friends
in every quarter of the Assembly.
My honourable friend, if he read again the
Speech from the Throne, would find that there
is oonsiderable matter not only 'historical but
relating to things that will need to be treated
by thie Parliament. He will have n-oticed
the paragraph which speaks of the Conference betwec-n the Dominion Governnient and
the Provincial Goveraments. This was a very
interesting meeting, and I *may say that I
was struck with the marked degree of broadening in the national outlook and spirit of
the members constituting that Conference.
Honourable gentlemen wiIl remember some of
the past Conferences in w.hich every Province
stood upon its rights and claimed that the
compact of 1867 had as ite basis a financial
arrangement which constituted a contract, and
that no one Province was entitled to an
increase of its ainual subsidies from the
Federal Exohequer un-less c-ach and every
Province obtained ýimilar treatment. For
instance, when in other conferences the quest,îon arose of the control by the Western
Provinces of their natural resources there was
a dlaim by the Eastern Provinces for compensation for those assets which would be
given to the Western Provintces.
Up to this last conference there se'emed to
be a clear indication that each Province stood
by its rights, and did not intend to allow any
advantage to its neighbours without compensation to itself. It was a very great
pleasure to me to sec a totally different spirit
permeating this conference, and 1 was quite
proud -to hiear the representatives of the larger

9

provinces, Ontario and Quebec, declare that if
the East needed a supplementary amount in
order to maintain its administration, if there
existed a just grievance because of the present
situation, unforeseen at the time of Confederation, or if it was necessary to do something in
the way of a return of natural resources to
the West, then Ontario and Quebec were
ready to agree to a re-adjustment of conditions, financial and other, and would make no
claim for compensation.
This to me shows that we are growing; it
bespeaks an evolution in our economic and
material situation. Undoubtedly, it is easy
to discover the cause of a reluctance to grant
an advantage to a neighbour when one is
himself in dire necessity; but the development of Canada, the enrichment of the larger
provinces, the fact that for a greater number
of years they have achieved financial success,
allowed them to take a broader view of things
and turn to the smaller or newer provinces
and say: "We are ready to look with sympathy
upon your needs, and we will flot dlaim, as
we were wont to do in times gone by, a comnpenrsation for whatever advantages you may
derive from the generosity or the spirit of
justice of the Federal power."
My honourable friend has spoken of the
establis'hment of legations abroad. He has
expressed bis dissidence with regard to the
exehange of ministers or ambassadors between
this country and others. He sees some danger
in our foreign representation. He gave as a
reason for lis fear the fact that we are not,
like other countries, in possession of an army
and a navy. Well. 1 confess that in seeing
Canada develop its representation abroad I
have feit no tremor because we were without
an army or a navy. I would point out to the
honourable gentleman that, to make a modest
estimate, the position of two-thirds of the
nations of the world in relation to the greater
powers is similar to our own. Those nations
of the world that are called the small powers
may have a few iships and an army of some
kind, but I would ask my honourable friend
if that constitutes a defence and gives themn
security. If my honourable friend will look
around the world hie will see that two-thirds
of the nations have no possible chance of
defence in the event of a clash with one of

Thry rely upon the new spirit that animates
the wvorld, a spirit of fair play and justice.
These are the principles that govern the dealings of nation with nation, and it is this bigher
standard of civilization that will gradually
permit of a reduction of armie:s and navies

upon the poliey of Canada in the League of

Thiat is a wonderful head te have given the

lîike te believe that the Emipire stands preeininently for peace.

JANUARY 31, 1928
Our own necessities happen to be on the
same lines as the necessities of humanity, and
it is aur duty to preach, and continue to
preach, the gospel of arbitration. between
peoples. It is not an easy matter for the
great nations to forego their power and place
themselves on a level with the smaller nations
before a world court, but I cannot help
thinking that it is the only way in which we
can make any advance towards permanent
peace throughout the world.
Reverting ta the speech from the Throne,
iuy honourable friend (Han. W. B. Ross) bas
cxpressed the hope that we may carry into
cifect the whole of the Duncan Report. I
would point out ta hitn that, though preaching
ecanomy and a reduction in taxation, he has
expressed his approval of a larger expenditure
towards meeting the needs of the Maritime
Prov'inces. He wiIl have ta cansider with
similar sympathy, the dlaims of other provinces or other parts of the Dominion and
recognize the necessity of some expendituTes
which may prevent taxation from being
reduced as rapidly as it would if we were
not obliged ta meet those many demands on
the Federal exchequer. He will have also
noticed in the Speech from the Throne that
cansideration is being given ta the railwey
problems of the several provinces, as outlined
at the conference. This again may require
some capital expenditure, the ýneed for which
will be lef t ta the wisdom of the twa branches
of Parliament.
The question of immigration is not an easy
one. My honaurable friend said that instead
of maney being spent in a search for
immigrants an effort should be made ta
retain farmers' sons upon the land. That, I
may say, is but -a piaus wish. I would like my
honourable friend ta try to devise a scheme
whereby that cauld be done. I have myscîf
devoted considerable time ta the effort ta keep
farmers' sons on the land by offering them
farming land outside their own neighbourhood
where they could thrive and raise a family.
I have suggested that printed forms should
be distribuled throughout the country, ta
pastmasters, mayors and secretary-treasurers
of municipalities, that they should f11l in with
the names of any persans whom they heard
had any sort of inclination or intention I o
leave the country, and that the Departmnents
in the provinces or at Ottawa should offer such
persans some alternative solution of their
difficulty which would keep them here. This
plan bas been carried out in variaus ways and
applied in different districts, but there will
always be, as there bas always been, that
powerful magnet on the other side attracting
aur population.

i

I have heard the argument that in the
course of a year we had brought into this
countrv hundreds of thousands of immigrants,
but thýat in the end we were no farther ahead
-that we had barely maintained our population by natural increase. If we lost one
hundred thousand persons in a year and did
flot in the same period replace themn with a
like humber of newcomers, there would
undoubtedly be a net loas. At ail events, if
we are to lose 100,000 of aur people in a
year, there is some consolation in feeling
that we are attracting a similar number from
abroad and that our population is flot
diminishing.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Thiey are flot of the
same class.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend cen find a way-and none has been
found in the last fifty years--to prevent t~he

Hon. RUFUS H. POPE: Honourable gentlemen, as it has always been the prîvilege, I rise

12

SENATE

to congratulate the mover and the seconder of
the Address, and from their remarks I judge
that they will be useful members of this House,
when it seems possible for them to find matters
of interest in this Speech from the Throne.
We have often had such speeches that did
not carry much weight, but in this respect I
think the Speech we are considering to-day
should take first prize over anything we have
had in this Dominion.
The honourable gentleman who has just
taken his seat referred to different phases of
the Speech from the Throne.
He spoke of
the celebration of Confederation.
I suppose
it is quite proper to refer to that event relating to sixty years of the existence of the
Dominion; and, so far as I am concerned,
belonging as I do to the old families of Conservatives who brought about that wonderful
event, it was certainly a triumph in my own
family life and in the history of the party to
which I belong. The reference in the Speech
from the Throne is another endorsement of
the life work of those gentlemen who went before me, and before others who sit upon this
side of the House, so we cannot find any
grievance in that connection.
Speaking of Canada's position in ihe
League of Nations. I suppose we will not
quarrel about the fact that we have a very
worthy representative there, in the honourable gentleman who leads on the other side
of this House. As he bas said. he will be
succeeded by others, and I trust that we will
always hav'e in that position an equally
worthy man to represent Canada.
In regard to having diplomats representing
Canada in the other nations of the world,
ny honourable friend emphasized the case
of the United States, saying that that office
n'as created by Sir Robert Borden. While
I have a very great regard for that gentleman, evidently he found that he had created
a job, but that it was not best to fill it;
so he left it vacant. and my honourable
friends on the other side of the House went
to work and invested half a million of our
dollars down there in a building to cover
a man of ordinary ability. I do not believe much in this gold-braid stuif. I do
not believe we should pay too much for it;
I do not believe the finances of Canada are
sound enough. I do not believe the taxes
of Canada have been sufficiently reduced up
to the present time to warrant us in going
into this extravagance. My honourable friend
speaks of communications having taken place
place by boat in days gone by, but I do not
think we had to go to France very often,
and even if we did take a trip across the
lHon. Mr

POPE.

ocean once in a while in order to unravel
Ome difficulty the expenditure involved would
be but a fraction of what is going to be imposed upon us by the proposition we have
under consideration.
In regard to ipast expenditures, I have been
looking around this city since I came here,
and I find expenditures being made of which
the people know nothing. I have noticed
where buildings have been torn down, where
property bas been bought, and much money
invested for no reasonable purpose. I do not
say that the City of Ottawa should not be
beautified as a great Capital some time,
when we are not burdened by extraordinary
taxation; but for years we have been building beautiful places and making driveways
quite sufficient for the amount of moncy
we had at our disposal. Until taxation is
relaxed again and we are able to get more
people in the country, I think the expenditurc should be limited until our per capita
tax can be lessened, and we can afford the
tremendous expenditures that are proposed
in and about this city. But our expenditures
are not confined to Ottawa; we are building
hotels bore and there, and among theni an
unnecessary one in Halifax. This is done
with the people's money, and any deficiency
that arises in the operation of the National
Railways comes back to us to pay. Nobody
cones in from England or the United States
or other places to pay those bills; there are
only Canadians to make good those deficiencios.
The question of immigration is perhaps one
of the most important of the day. The
qualitv of Canadian citizenship is perhaps
oun country's most important asset. The
other day the Mail and Empire of Toronto,
which we all recognize as a serions newspaper, had an editorial extending advice to
the Education Department of Ontario to
prepare teachers to go into the northcrn country and off-set the Red doctrines
that are being taught there. I have liera
an article from an American paper, the
13oston Transcript, that was sent fron Toronto. It is very long, but I would like to
put it on hansard if permitted to do so. It
deals with this question practically, and it
shows that there is propaganda in Toronto,
Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver, teacliing the doctrines of the Reds, showing that
there bas been a systematic arrangement,
and that we have been guilty of bringing inta
this country a class of citizens that are unworthy of the future of Canada. In Montreal I have been told that undesirables can

citizens there for smuggling in undesirablescitizens that would be refused admittance
under the law of the land. I was t.old that
upon such good authority that I repeat the
report in this House, in order te draw the
attention of the Government te the fact
that undesirables who teach such doctrines
as are mentioned in this newspaper are being
allowed to spread their views throughout the
length and breadth of this land. This is the
article from the Boston Transcript of last
week:

Subtle Anti-Religious Propaganda
The propaganda that is carried on against
religion is more subtle. The following joke,
harnless in itself, was reprinted in the "Young
Conrade." Its significance lies less in the story
itself than in the fact that although net in
any sense a child's stery it is used in the
Comnr ade.
"The boat was sinking"-the story goes"The captain reached up te the crowd of
passengers. 'Who among you can pray?' 'I

.

"'Then pray, mister,' ordered the skipper.
'The rest of ye put life preservers on; we
are one short.'"
This joke, standing out in heavy type frorn
the rest of the page, is headed in large capital
letters: "Who Is Safer-God or the Life Belt?"
"Do you teaci the children that there is no
God?"
"We teach theni science, and science is
opposed te religion."
"But what is the attitude that you teach
theni towards God?"
"We don't teach thein about God," said
MacDonald.
"Wlien we teaci them science, the idea of

has been accomplished, they are criticized for
not giving an outline of wihat is to be
nccomplished. In other words, those who
oppose ought to ho t'hankful, and should have
a lively sense of favours to corne, and accept
as Godgiven what le past.
The Speech from the T-hrone this year is
just like ot-her Speeches from the Throne.
Some honourable gentlemen who bave been
membere of a Governrnent know what it is to
sit down and endeavour to frame a Speech
from the T'hrone. It is nlot an easy taek. I
may say to my honourable friend frorn Montreal (Hon. Mr. Smeaton White) that it le
something like runýning a nowspaper-it ie
perbaps more diffleuit to judge what to beave
out than what to put in.
The question of immigration bas bren mentioned. I arn afraid 1 arn not orthodox on
immigration. We complain that our population is nlot increasing with sufficient, rapidity.
I arn afraid sornetimes that we are frarnlng
our laws to keep people out rather than to
induce them to come in. To a certain extent
it is right that there should be a critical eye
kep't on the quality; but there is a ýpossibility
t.hat with ail our criticism and examination
and inspection and oversight corne people who
might make splendid settiers are afraid to
corne to our shores, or even to start the
prelirninaries to becoming immigrants. Some
of our organizations meet and pase resolutions
mndieatîng a number of questions that should
ho asked of ail immigrants before they are
admitted. I have read corne of these resolutiens pas3ed by various organizations. Why,
bless tlieir dear hearts, if ail this catechism.
had been required. a few decades ago, very few
of you would have been here, and perbaps
fewer of us. I know I should not bave been
here if rny parents -had to answer corne of the
questions that certain well-rnea.ning people
now propose for immigrants. If Canada is to
develop properly we must have more people
per square mile in this country than we have
now, no matter how we get them. If our
railwaye are to bo utilized to their full
capacity wo must have more people, not only
to ho carried by those railways, but also to
produce the goode to ho hauled by them.
Apparently the natural increase of population
is not rapid enough in the Dominion of
Canada outside of the province of Quebec.
One honourable gentleman, perhaps two,
urged strongly that there should ho soe
method of transporting people from one part
of Canada to another. Theoretically that
sounds well and it would read well in a book.
But lot us take Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
or any other province, as 'an example. Nova

17

Scotia is now doing its utmost to induce immigrants to corne jnto that good old province
by the eea. What would bo thought of a
government or a party that would introduce
a policy or start propaganda in Nova Scotia
which would have the effect of assisting people
now in that province to leave it? If people
intending to move anyway were to apply
voluntaeily to the Federal Government for
help, I xnight see sorne common sense in
the proposition-if you will allow me to use
that terrn; but even in -t-hat case the Government of Nova Scotia would immediately initervene and say, as my honourable friend rernarked, " We want to keep ail our own people
and to get more people in, and here you arE
taking our taxes to help our people to go out
into another province." If people did move
to another province and live there for six
rnonths, a year, or two years, and were not
successful there, they would waat the Government to move them back to their own
province again, or to some other place. The
scheme, whulo it may sound well, is not praeticable.
The sound policy of immigration for Canada, I believe, is, under certain fair restrictions, to admit ail people of robust health and
good character who have a littie cash and
more willingness to work and are ready to take
off their coats and become Canadian citizens
by toiling as our fathers did. Those are the
people that we want in this country.
May I refer for a moment to the Jubilee
celebration? I want to thank my honourable
leader for his kind references to the work of
the Jubilee Executive. It struck me that
the success we had in the work of that coinmittee resultod from the co-operation given
by the Government and the municipalities
of every province, and through these by the
people of Canada. The fact that the people
on the Atiantic and those on the Pacifie were
saying the same things about Canada at the
same hour of the same day, were singing the
came songs at the same hour, ail about Canada, and on the came Sunday, and so far as
possible at the same hour, joining in a nonsectarian thanksgiving service, created from
one end of Canada to the other a spirit of
brotherhood that perhaps nover existed to
the same extent before. If the reenît of that
Jubilee celebration is to make continuoue the
spirit that has boen developed during the
past six months in Canada, thon I say, honourable gentlemen, that more good bas resulted from our efforts in the past year than
bas beon accomplished at any previous time
since Confederation for the unification of the
people of Canada. I will not dwell on the

possible, but this is tise view ta which I desire
ta draw attention, and which, if my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will allow
me, I would impress upon the Gavernment.
Notwithstanding any criticism, do flot rush too
rapidly at this thing. It means more than any
of us realize. It may not came in my time,
but it will came. But let us know on what
grounds it is ta be done, and where we shail
be at when it is done. Above al, do not
allow any people ta get any of aur rights by
paying a littie of their money.
Now, this is what I would suggest -to the
Government. The National Advisory Board
was appointed foi a purpase. The United
States Government appointed a board of thse
sane kind, with Mr. Hoover at its head; but
-I say it wi.th ahl respect-Mr. Hoover's
Committee made a repart before it had thse
report -of tise joint engineers in its en.tirety.
There were two engineering boards, one for
the United States and one for Canada, but
these met together and formed a joint board
af investigation. The S.spectiv-e National
Advisory Boards, on the twa aides of the
lime, were absolutely different, and tisey neyer
met together. The distinct purpase of one
was ta ascertain and advise the United States
Goverument whether or not it would be in
the interest of that country ta have tise work
done. Tise other Advisory Board was ta meet
independently and advise thse Canadian Government whether it would be in the interest
of Canada. Now I say, with ail madesty, thM.
it is impossible, even at this date, ta give a
direct answer to those questions. The National
Advisory Board for Canada already lias be56109--2j

fore it the entire report of the engineers, with
the appendices. It already has bef are it, if
flot ini f arm, at least ini substance, the very
extended reports of what we eaUl the Interdepartmental Committees. But beyond that
there is sometbing which I believe ought to
be investigated before the Goverument gives
an answer ta the proposai. What is that?
The econamie question, wiii it pay Canada?
We have somne statisties, but statistica do not
always prove the proper thing. I mean by
that that statisies ean bie so arranged that
they show misdirected energy. We have in
Canada very large shippers of grain. So far
as the growing of wheat is concerned, Canada
is the granary of the world. My own view
Ï3 that before an attempt is made to answer
the United States the leading shippers, who
make the grain trade their life work, should
be called before the Advisory Board or the
Government to give their views. Will it pay
the country to carry out the proposai? Shall
we get a returu fer the money expended?
We export sa many million bushels of grain,
and sa many million bushels go down the
St. 'Lawrence, at such a cost. How many more
millions would go down the St. Lawrence
if it were deepened? And what would be
the saving? The Government or the Advisory
Board ought to cail the representatives of the
railways, in which we have so much .money
invested, and ask them: "Are you interested
in this? Give us your views."l They ought
ta caîl in also the owners of shipping. It has
been said, you know, honourable gentlemen,
in many places, that the owners of the ocean
shipping would nat permit their vessels to go
up as we are prophesying they will some
tâme; that it would not pay tiser ta permit
ýtheir vessels to go up into tise fresh water for
so many miles, taking so many chances and
spending so much time. These mnen should
be called before the Government or before tise
Advisory Board and asked whether, if the
projeet is carried out, they will utilise it, or
whether it is practicable ta utilize it, and, if
so, what benefit it will be ta the people of
Canada. There are a thousand aLlier questions that might be asked.
That relates ta tise question of navigation,
with which the Dominion is primarily concerned. Then as ta power, we have a great
deal of technical knowledge on wisat the development would cost, and how much power
could be developed, but have we a market
anywhere for this power if we spend this
mon11ey in developing it? Maybe we 'have;
maybe we can induce manufacturera ta corne
fromn other places if we haVe cheap power.
That is a matter of industrial investigation.
I think that is another thing that ought ta

before eithcr is asked to proceed further. I
arn very much interested in this St. Lawrene
proposai, and think we should proceed with
great caution and care about saying Yes or

reference to the Supreme Court is ail] right;
then the ground will be cleared, and perhaps
we shafl know hctter wherc we are at. In

NATIONAL RAILWAY13

RETURNS FROM BRANCH LINES

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: An inquiry was
made yesterday, as ta the earnings and expenditures of the Canad-ian National Railway Branch Lines. I have here a letter from
the Deputy Minister, which reads as follows:
I have taken cagnizance, fram yesterday's
Senate Debates, of Senatar Ross' question as
ta a return of the earnings and expenditures
of Canadian National branch lines.
I will coinmunicate with the management and
see whether it is possible ta males such a
return, and advise you at the earliest oppartunity.
Yours very truly,
Gea. W. Yates,
Assistant Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: There is something
in connection with these railways about which
I am very much at sea, and about which I
think the country sbauld know something.
When the Canadian National Railways desire ta raise money tbey issue their own
bonds, and the Government endorses them.
Daes that charge appear in the annual account of the Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not ask
my honourable friend ta put bis question on
the Order Paper, but I will secure an answer
for him.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I tbought probably
the honourable gentleman could give me tbe
information. As I understand it-I may be
wrong-under the aid system, when tbere was
a deficit on tbe Canadian National Railways,
it was paid out of current incame during the
year. Formerly we used to pay as much as
$70,000,000 a year. Now, I understand bonds
are issued by the Canadian National Railways for any amount desired and the Government endorses them, and tbey are not
taken inta consideration as a debt of the
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND: My bonourable
friend -is dealing with twa questions. The
first is tbe financing of the railway when it
bas a deficit. In times gone by, when a deficit occurred, it was the debt of the country;
but now there is no deficit, s0 the question
of financing ta mneet it does not exist. The
question of bonds being issued on capital
accaunt for equipment, or for building
branches, is a different matter. If my honourable friend is directing bis question ta the
method of financing the expenditure on capital accaunt, I would nat like ta answer him
off-hand, but will obtain an answer fromn the
Department.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I think iny honourable friend is in error about the deficit.
There bas always been a deficit. There may
not be a deficit on operating expenses, but
there is on the payment of interest on the
bonds.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: This matter was before Parliament tbree or four or five years
ago, and the present Prime Minister explained
the policy of the Government with regard ta
it. Thase bonds are not charged as part of
the ordinary annual expenditure of the Government; they are kept clear and are charged
to capital account.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Are they charged
ta the liabilities of the country at ail?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: My honourable friend
may be able to get some information with
regard to whether any part of the deficit is
I cannot see that it
charged to earnings.
would be, because whatever the deficit is,
there it stands.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is it concealed?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would not say that.
1 thought at the time, and I stili think, that
the explanation given was a fairly good one.
1 was satisfied with it at tbe time.
LIEUTENANT AIMÉ LAMOTHE
MOTION FOR RETURN

Hon. Mr. TESSIER moved:
That an address do issue for a return of the
file with regard to the request of Lieut. Aimé
Lamothe of Quehee for a pension following his
services at the front during the war, together
wvith the evidence produced with the request and
the deeision taken hy the Federal Board of
Pension Commissioners.
The motion was agreed ta.
Althougb the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
motion bas carried, 1 am not quite clear as
to the principles that bave been laid down
in relation ta the action of the Board, or
whetber Parliament bas made any ruling an
the propriety of producing that evidence befoare either Branch of Parlianment. I will
inquire as ta the procedure tbat bas been
laid down or the regulations that bave been
made.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: This is tbe ordinary
way of securing information. I knaw very
well that tbis young man enlisted as a soldier.
He was promated framn the ranks during the
war, and after being overseas three years he
came back sick and incapacitated. He às
stili sick, and bas been unable ta get justice
from the Board. I cannat blame the Board

22

SENATE

for what they have done without seeing the
record. I want the record produced so that
1 may judge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The difficulty
is as to the principles that may have been
laid down in connection with these judgments of the Board. Has Parliament dcclared
that it would deprive itself of the right of
appeali n these matters, or are these matters
left to the sole discretion of that tribunal?
1 will inquire into the matter and see if
there is any difflculty in producing the evidence.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think, even
though the 'law regards the decision of the
Appeai Board as final, that that would flot
prevent any honourable gentleman asking for
the record of the case. It would seemn to me
v~ery peculiar if Parliament were to be deprived of information concerning any Departinpot of the Government that it might desire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say that Parliament may have deprivedi itself of the right
to review the decisions. We have deprived
ourselves of the right to appoint part of our
own staff; we have delegatcd that authority
to bbc Civil Service Commission, and wc have
done it voluntarily. I bave not looked at
the Act to ascertain whetber or not Parliament has declared that the door should be
closed to any appeal. If there have been
100,000 or more cases reviewed by the Board,
Parliament bas pcrhaps feît that it would be
unseemily for members of either branch to
:tsk for a furthor review, or for a reversai. of
bbe decisions of that tribunal. I do not know.
I simp]y make that reservation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
But ail that
the honourable gentleman from Quebec (Hon.
Mr. Tessier) seemns to seek is an opportunity
Io inspect the record, and sureiy he should not
be deprived of that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; it is the
production of the record.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the Session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Little for
an Address in reply thereto.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, it is not my intention
to take up a very lengthy period of the tirne
of this Chamber. I have been pleased to sec
the interest which has been taken in the discussion upon this resolution so far. I have
thought more than once since becoming a
member of the Senate that perhaps as a
Senate we were not taking full advantage of
an excellent opportunity, and not contributing
ail that we might well be asked to contribute,
in passing the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne without a full discussion.
The opportunity is one which occurs only once
in the Session of this Chamber. It is an
opportunity for a general discussion and a
contribution of the criticism and suggestion
which may well be expected from a body constituted as this is.
The Speech from the Throne is supposed to
contain a brief summary of the important resuits of the past year from the policies of the
Government, and especially to outline in a
general way the Government's policy and
plan for the Session just opening and the
work of the administration for the future. I
have an idea that the capacity and capabilitics of a Chamber like this are particularly
resourceful for a contribution of service to the
Government and Parliament and that the
opinions and suggestions of this body on matters of public interest may give the country
a lead. We have in this Chamber some
ninety members, drawn from all parts of the
Dominion, representing almost every section.
We have as constituents of this Chamber men
of large experience and long experience in
almost aIl the activities of our country. We
have on the constitutional. and legal side men
of first-class ability, equal to any in the
Dominion, learned in the law and well experienced in the practice of the law; we have
captains of industry and promoters of industrial activities, among the best in Canada;
we have in this Chambpr, besides, distinguished
representatives of most of the other professions, and especially we are cognizant of the
fact that as regards administrative aiffairs,
municipal, provincial and Dominion, we have
here a large number of gentlemen who have
had varied, wide and long experience in these

SENATE
matters. In other words, this is a body whichi
oughit to be able to give a lead to tbe Government of tbe country by way of constructive
criticiLrn, comment and suggestion, and the
opportunity is afforded us at a period in the
Session xvhen we are not nverhîîîdened with
work frorn the other House. It is with those
facts in view that I express the satisfaction
that I have biad, ani we ail bave had, in the
discu'sjýon whicbi bas so far taken place.
I aFsociate rnvself with honourable gentlemen
who bave already aildressed this Chamber in
paying a compliment, weil (leserved, te the
two new members of the Senate who rcspectively inoxed and seconded tise Address. Knowing their biusine,ýs experience and their affiliations, we expected froni thein a fairly good
contribution, and I do net think we have
been iii aîîy way disappointed. With reference f0 tIse new Senator frein, Essex (Hon.
Mr. ILacasse), over and above the matter of
bis discourse, I want f0 (engrat ulate bir on

country wîll have the effect of preventing
thoso industries fromn putting back into
them a sufficient sum from their surplus
earnings, for rcplenishment and extension,
zn
consequently for the graduai
utr
increase of industrial operations.
If those
surplus earnings of industry are milked to
tee great an extent, a restriction is put on
industrv itseif, which lias its effeet net oniy
uplon that induistry but upon the industrial
expansion and development and if e of the
wbole Dominion. andi Huis prejudiciallv affects
ail activities of social and material develepment witbin the country.
Anether source of revenue, and one which
s very much resortcd te by ail finance ministers. is the liguer ilidiistr.
which pays
very heavy taxes, botih in customs; and in
ilxcise, and makes up a very large proportion
of the yearly income of the Govorament.
Now, there is an observation te be made on
,hat lino, wbichi you wouild oxpeet te cornte
freont me, but which I tbink might oqually
well cone frein the oconomist himself. If
there is ie our count.ry an induistry, large in
development and widely distributttd, which
commences with the destruction of primary
articles of food. and converts thcm inte somcthing whiebi. ie the most liboral initerpretatien, may contributo te the satisfaction of a
certain proportion of our community, but
which in its gene-ral effect is the inevitable
and wide producer of inefficicncy ie productien, you are gaining revenue fromn a source
whichi resmhts iniiiefficiency in ptroduction,
aed consequently bears heavily tipen the real
factors of national pregress and development.
Any country wbich takes a proportion of its
rev-enue eut of an industry which doos net
add te the officiency, and strength. and power
ef production, but which tends vcry largely
te tlitnijsh tbeýe qualities, is net the best
kind tof an ieidtrtry, and we had better net
base our prospects for the future ton much
tipen revenues se tlori%ýod. It bas its reflex
of destructive action whicb contribtites net bing te iw)re(lttion or te efflciency, but is a
constant ant iiuniform encmv te both.
Those tbingsý we must tako inte consideratio
ienta reasonable way, and we must base
ocur views as te the permanence of the
foundation of our revenue and of our expan.sion of trade ie connection with tbe peints
tliat I have brougbt forward.
Now, let mie for a moment corne te
,nteùltr peint, the, allusion je the Speech te the
.sixty years of Canatlas growth. I feel quite
sure that mention ef that ovent shotrît appear,
wit did, je the Speech fromn the Throne. To
tnv miind it xvas a most notable ex-cnt, and
ltin, Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

aIse a mest opportune one. We had gone on
tee long witb a gencral idea in Canada that
we are bore under certain circumstances, a.nd
hiad cerne jet0 possession of certain reseurces;
but I consider that we did net have a very
strong feeling, and a preper spirit and understanding as te bow we came by them. Four
thiegs have resulted
from that Jubilee
Colebration. The first is the general stock-taking
by the whole community of Canada as te, our
reseurces and our present position. Here and
now, and without shame, I make a confession
and I think it is a confession t.hat could be
made by most of us.
I think I have followed
the history of this Dominion, and have been
as nearly as possible au fait witb uts pregress
and its resources; but je two or three menýths
in this Jubilee year I learned more of the
reseurces of Canada, of its richness, of its
pr-omise, of its potential greatness, and received
a deeoper impression of thema upon my mind
thian I ever had before.
And if that confea,ýion rnay ho made by ne who follows things
pretty clesely, w-bat they learned must have
been a revelation te a very large proportion
cf the people of Canada.
I have heard men
anti women, boys and girls, over and ever
again, say', aftcr the subjeet had been brought
te their attention and recapitulated, that it
wvaq a revelation te them.
It is a fine thing
that we bad such a steck-taking.
It bas
pttt energy and hope and confidence into
millions of our people in a degree ie which
they nover beforo possesed them. That is
oee thing it 'bas dene.
Another tbing it bas donc is te operate,
net only upon the grown-ups, but especially
uipon the little folks, the young people of the
country.
What the eIders are talking about,
takes the attention of a boy or girl.
During
ibis few weeks of the celebration cverybody
was taiking about Canada, and its wonderful
progress and its growtb, its connections with
tire past, and the path by whicb it had travelled up te the present.
Every boy and girl
heard tlte conversations on that subjeet, they
t-ead of it in the newspapers and magazines
ex er-ywhere, and wvbat evcrybody is talking
abotut the beys and girls arc very anxieus te
know sometbing about toe.
So, dating from
tîrat, Jubilce celebration there bas cem*menced
ain epech of information and understanding, a
ital inerest in Catnada as our coutntry, and je
is traditions and the great story of its wonderfuIl pi-ogrezss.
No peecil can caiculate the
zeed that bias rcsulted, and I arn absoiutely
te lino with my honeurabie friend Who spoke
yesterdav. ie saying that that impetus sbouid
net ho allowed. te subside, and that every year
wo oug-ht te have the day of our Cenfeder-

FEBRUARY 1, 1928
ation, the day of our starting on the national
race, commemorated in as wide and as effective
a mariner as possible.
But a third thing bas reulted-I have
already alluded ta it ini part. 7 he man of the
present who, through negleet or any other
cause, is dissociated from the past, out of which
he has sprung is in a position of disadvantage
bath for himself .persanally and for bis service
We often talk nowadays of
ta bis country.
But
a statua into which. we have emerged.
let us always be careful ta keep ini mind what
we -have emerged fram, and ta remember the
path by which we -have corne te the preeent.
It is the keeping of, and the vitalizing of a
sentiment that we have been connected with
a past, and the impression wbich it makes
upon. the young generation of this country, and
their zest in delving inta it and following
it out that is going ta have a unifying and
linking-up influence, that is going Wakeep us
in line with the culture and the spirit of the
race from which we sprang, with the men and
wamen of the olden times, Who, by their
sacrifices and their protection, have made aur
present passible for us. In ail these ways I
tbink the Jubilee year was a splendid event.
ht was an inspiration ta aur national life, an
impulse which will nlot soon fade aut, and in
the nlot far distant future, it will lay entirely
at rest this interrogation which occasionally
arises: Has Canada a national consciousness?
Canada has a national coneciousness, and nothing has been done whioh will stiinulate it
more or give it a greater impulse in growth
than the Jubilee celebration and aIl the associations whioh clustered about it.
Now, leaving that, let me say one word
with reference to that paragraph in the Speech
which refers te the position recently assumed
by Canada as a member of the Council of
the League of Nations. The verbiage in the
Speech is both 'happy and correct. I could
wish that wvhat is emnbodied in that would
become the interpretation nlot omly of the
pa.rty wbich supports -the Government, but
of every other section in the Dominion, because it truthfully etates how we reaohed. and
wby we now occupy aur responsible and
bonourable position in the League of Nations.
Striking recognition has been accorded Cariada's position in the League of Nations through
the selection of Canada by the AsseýmblY ta a
non-permanent seat on the Council of the
League
'rhat is the correct interpretation. Canada
did not get that seat on the Counicil at the
last Assembly because ber statua bad beeri
cbanged in any way. Canada laid the foundatien for that -position wben she e.ntered and
passed througb four years of war with sa

27

much sacrifice of men and of money, and such
a soldier-like exhibition of courage and cool'ness. Upon that work ini the war Canada based
ber dlaim ta, arid received at the Peace Conference ber full equality with every other
nation-member of that Peace Conference.
Then and there rights and privileges were
accorded ta ber, first, by the War Cabinet
of the British Empire, secondly, by the Peace
Conference; and upon becoming a member,
with the statua that she then had, not only
had she a rigbt ta ail tbe distinction and
honour eonferred upon her, but she undertook ta carry out ber obligation, wheresaever
it led ber. Since then, for eight years, Canada bas been a worker in the League of
Nations, and bas been aasociated with the
member-nations, f orty, forty-five, fifty-five in
number; and in confidence and in trust
she made ber place amangst them so that
when the time came when tbat association of
nations t.hougbt Canada should occupy a place
in tbe Council of the League of Nations she
was elected ta that position. Too muchbhas
been said of that position being given ta Canada because in the interim something bad
happened ta change ber statua; and an
attempt bas been made te read inta that
action of tée League of Nations a recognition
of the new statua of Canada. This admirably,
bonetly, and well-Pwarded section in the
Speech bas set tbat at rest forever, sn far as
the Gaverrimenut is concerned, and 1 hope
sO far as aIl are concerned wbo bave taken
an interest in tbe League alnd the status of
Canada therein.
I corigratulate my bonourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) upon being one wbo bas bad
the honour and the distinction, as well as the
responsibility, of being appoi.nted the represeritative of Canada. And let us keep this
plain fact in mmnd, that when a nation is
elected ta membersbip on the Council, the
nomination of ber representative is in the banda
of the Government of that nation., and furthermore, that the representative of Canada
bas ta look not eimiply ta what be thinks
Canada would like, but bas ta keep in mind
tbe facet tbat he represents tbe wbole association of nations in the League.
I listened yesterday ta the reasonable
statement of my honourable friend the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. W. B. Rom)>
wben be expressed the hope that Canada
would not be let in for anything that was
not right, and I appreciated the answer that
was made by my bonourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I agree with him
that the presence of Canada's representative
on the Council of the League of Nations wiil
be rather a protection than otherwise, and

that wc rnust depend upon the Canadian
Goveriment and upon ber representative at

and the necessary duties of aur country are

That ieads me ta the question of representation. I ain flot, able, and therefore do
not unldertaike ta argue the legal question. 1
leave that wjith the lawyers. The situation is
simplY tIîis.
The Prime Ministers cf the
ox-erseas Dominions, of the British Government, and of thc Free State, meet together,
and in a conference in which they go over
the %choiematter they came ta certain conclusions as ta the resuit of the uniform and
progressive deveiopment that bas taken place

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But that remark
of my 'hanourable friend would apply ta ail
the component parts of the British Commonwealth.
Right Han. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Yes, but I am addressing myself now to one
of the component parts, and to an honourable
leader of the Government in that component
part. I listened very attentively ta what the
honourable gentleman laid down yesterday
as the basic reasons why we should undertakce
these diplomatie alliances or arrangements,
and he did not satisfy me at ail. He gave
us a stoï7 of the ambulatory and tutorial excursions of Sir Joseph Pope in Washington: it
was interesting, but I could not help wondering whether such little difficulties as were
met there could not have been overcome by
a less drastic and less perilous excursion inta
tbe field of foreign diplomacy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But that was
the action of my right honourable friend and
the Borden Government.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
We know that, but, aifter alI, there were many
policies advocated by the Borden Government
to which the present Government bas not
feit itself obligcd to conform. It is not the
best foundation for my honourable friend to
place himseli and bis Government upon, to
say that Sir Robert Borden made such action
possible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He settled aIl
the conditions and the policy.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Naw, 1 desire ta say just two or three things
with reference to that matter. Let us conaider it just as a set of reasonable people,
dissociating it entirely from party views or
anything of that sort. Take the history of
diplomacy in the past, and consider what it

What were the objects af the old diplomacy,
and what the conditions under which it was
carried on? The appointment ai diplomats
grew out of the aId custom oi the monarch
of onc country sending ta the monarch of
another a special ambassador laden with
sweet spices and other presents and bearing
the message: "I hope you will be a friend
of mine, as I desire to be a friend of yours."
Those monarcbs made tbemselves acquainted
in a pleasant sort of way, one with another.
Centuries intcrvened and ultimateîy there developed the appointment of resident or permanent diplomatie representatives of the
sovereigns. Read the records of tihe diplomnats,
read of the conditions under which tliey
worked, and you will sec that diplomacy was
the means wbereby states which were in
rivalry with anc anather, or which sought
alliances in order ta proteet dynasties from
aggressive operatians, became acquainted and
arranged concessions. The diplomat was sent
ta Russia by a British Government first ta
keep the British Government in touch with
the policy af the Russian Government as regards sccurity ai nationalities, as regards the
alliances that mîght be entered into with
cantemporary sovereigns, or as ta how these
alliances miglit affect British interests. The
diplomat was ta obtain and transmit ta bis
Government tbat kind of information, aIl of
it looking tuwards war or peace, or towards
the alliance which was necessary in order ta
protect material interests and national houndaries. Those are in brief, tbaugh very ineffectually stated, the purposes and duties
which diplomats were appointed ta fulfil.
Always there bas been the idea that danger
might corne ta their territories if suoh and
sucli countries were ta ally thernselves against
tbem; that tliey must prevent such offensive
alliances and must try to get as many nations
as possible in sympathy witb thernselves and
in support ai their policy. If was witb war
and dynastic interests and all that sort ai thing
that the diplamacy af aid and tbe diplomacy
up ta the time of tbe Great War, was concerncd, and it is most illuminating ta read
the revelatians contained in the histories or
biographies ai the diplomats.
Such conditions no langer exist. The aId diplomacy
is gaing out ai date and the new diplomacy,
widely different from the old, bas taken its
place. To-day, if there is a hint of difficulty
in Serbia, we will say-ii Jugo-Slavia and
Italy are not on the best ai terms, the diplomat, if lie can be useful at aIl, may possibly
be useful in negotiatians at Belgrade or at
Rame. But the present diplomacy does not
wait for that. The tbing that is done now
is not ta eall in the diplomat, but ta push

SENATE
him to one side and to have Mr. Briand,
of France, or Sir Austen Chamberlain, of
Great Britain, get beside Mr. Mussolini and
talk out the question with the principals in
the dispute, without a diplomat or other gobetween to complicate matters. A personal
conversation between the heads accomplishes
now what the diplomats failed to accomplish
before; it brings about accord and respect for
each other's position and a mutual desire to
compromise the matter in such a way as will
not break the peace.
Now, what bas Canada to do with that
kind of thing? My honourable friend says
that it is proposed to have a plenipotentiary
in Paris and another in Tokio. For what
reason?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before my right
honourable friend enters into that field, may
I say that we have asked the Commons to
be with us at a quarter to six, and if hi
remarks are net coming to a close I would
suggest that he adjourn the debate. I de not
think we should sit this evening unless my
right honourable friend desires it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think I could finish in half an hour.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But before the
ceremony we should take recess for about
twenty minutes, as there are certain things to
be done. Perhaps my right honourable friend
cannot finish in ten minutes. I do not desire
to press him. His statement is very interesting.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do net want for a moment to interfere with
that fine ceremony in honour of my colleague
(Hon. Mr. Dessaulles), and if there are preliminaries which will occupy the intervening
time, I would move the adjournment of this
debate.
On motion of Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster, the debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

PRESENTATION OF PORTRAIT ON
HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY

HIS

The members of the Senate and the House
of Commons being assembled, Hon. Senator
Dessaulles was escorted to the Speaker's chair
by Hon. Raoul Dandurand and Hon. William
B. Ross.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK, Speaker of the
Senate, read the following address, the Senators and visitors standing:Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

To the Honourable George C. Dessaulles,
Senator for the Rougemont Electoral
Division of the Province of Quebee.
Dear and Honoured Sir:
We, your colleagues in the Senate of Canada, desiring to mark the attainment of the
great age of one hundred years by one who
has retained alil his activities as a Member of
the Senate up to this time, have resolved that
the event be signalized by placing in our
gallery a painting which will enable future
generations to behold and study the countenance with which we are so happily familiar.
We desire to call attention to some points
which show over how wide an historical field
Born in
your life's journey has extended.
1827, during the reign of George IV, when
Canada was divided into Upper and Lower
Canada, and Nova Scotia was an entirely
separate Crown Colony, you have lived during
tþe reign of five sovereigns in Great Britain;
have seen the two Canadas united as one in
1841 and again strengthened by the formation
of the Dominion in 1867.
You have been
able to watch the growth of the Dominion
from the union of four Provinces to that of
nine, and the development of the national
status of the Dominion to the position that it
holds at the present day as the elder of a group
of sister nations within the British Commonwealth of Nations under His Majesty King
George the Fifth.
Born in Canada, at St. Hyacinthe, on the
27th September, 1827, you commenced your
life of service to your country when you
were chosen as a City Councillor for St.
Hyacinthe in 1858, and retained that position
till 1868, at which time you were elected
Mayor, and continuously held the Mayoralty,
except for a break of six years, until 1898. In
1897 you were elected to the Legislative Assembly of your Province, and in 1907, at the
mature age of eighty years, you were called to
the Senate.
In the Provincial Legislature, and in the
Senate, you have devoted your talents and
energy to parliamentary work with the single
purpose of the good of the people, and especially in your own part of the country you have
been prominent in promoting and assisting
the industrial and agricultural work of your
Province.
The Members of the Senate appreciate
having in your person a wortby representative
of those French speaking families whose distinguished good manners, high culture and
social virtues left a deep imprint on the community of which they were the acknowledged
leaders in your Province.

FEBRUARY 1,192
During the time you have aecupied a seat
in this Chamber, you have been assiduous
in your attendance, both in the Chamber and
on the Committees, and have endeared yourself to ail whomn you have corne in contact
with by your graclous and kinly manner and
your desire to attain your object without
hurting or doing violence to the feelings of
others, consequently, the present action of
the Senate is unanimous and gives expression to the sincere sentiment of your colleagues of ail shades of opinion, wha unite
in the hope that the Almighty may be
picased to proiong for years a life which has
throughout 'been lived with a continued consciousness of Ris Divine oversight.
HEwirr Bosioc.K,
Speaker,
On behaîf of the Members of the Senate.
The Senate, Wednesday, lst February,
1928.
Hon. G. C. DESSAULLES (Translation):
Mr. Speaker, honourable gentlemen of the
Senate and members of the Bouse of Comnmons, I highly appreciate the remarkable reception that you have given me on this occasion. I -have donc nothing extraordinary
in my life. I have always tried to do my
best for the prosperity of the country, and
particularly the prosperity of the littie town
of St. Hyacinthe, ta which 1 belong. I have
always appreciated the honour of receiving
visitors at St. Hyacinthe. They flnd it a very
beautiful town and are glad to corne and visit
it often. Honourable gentlemen, I desire to
express my sincere thanks.
I appreciate also the very great honour that
is doue me in placing my portrait in the
Senate Gallery, amangst those of Speakers
and Members who have rendered signal service to our country. I have tried ta be usef ul to my fellow citizens in the offices which
they have entrusted tn me, and I have been
infinitely compensated by the confidence
which they have reposed in me, and of whioh
you give me to-day another example.
Right Hon, W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker and Honaurable Gentlemen of the Senate: On behaîf
of the Bouse of Commons, may I thank you
very warmly for yaur courtesy in extending
to the members of our Bouse an invitation ta
be present with the members of the Senate
at this interesting and historie ceremony.
We are indeed praud ta have the honour
of j oining with yau in cangratulating Mr.
Dessaulles on the great age he has attained,
and an the service he hes given with se great
distinction to himself, ta his province, and ta

31

his country. It is an honour ta him, ta be
presented by his calleagues with this excellent portrait of himaself as a memorial of this
occasion; but we aIl feel, I think, that it is
an even greater honour ta ourselves to have
in aur inidet one wha has reached the great
age of a hundred years, and whose life bhas
heen so singularly useful and noble.
Whe-n we recaîl that at the time, just a few
months ago, when we were celebrating in
Canada the sixtieth anniversary af this Dominion, Senator Desaulles had been celebrating hie hundredth anniversary, we are
able to appreciate how appropriate it is
that we should for a few moments adjourn the
proceedings af the two Bouses in order ta
pay this slight tribute ta so distinguished
a member of aur Parliament.
It will be of interest ta ail af us ta know,
and to me personally it is a matter af special
interest, that at the time af the Rebellion of
1837, Mr. Dessaulles, then ten years of age,
was placed under arret, and though nat imprisoned was placed under surveillance for
the greater part of a year. I understand that
the Senator has at the present time a distinct
recollection of the stirring events ai those
days. His mother was a sister of Louis Joseph
Papineau. To have in aur midst one who, in
his personality relates the past with the
present of Canadian history ta the degree
which he docs îe something for which ail ai
us may weIl have reason Vo be proud.
I can oniy say, Mr. Speaker, that we of
the Commons re-echo in fullest measure the
sentiments which have been expressed s0 admirably and sa beautifully in tîhe addrees
which you have just presented ta Senator
Dessaulles. It is a source ai pride and satisfaction ta us that there will be preserved
for other generations the splendid portrait af
himseli which is being presented ta Senatar
Dessaulles to-day. The presentation is ane
for the Senator, but two for the Senate, because I understand that the portrait is ta remain here.
May I, in conclusion, say ta Senator Dessaulles that we, who are members of bath
Houses ai this Parliament, feel towards hiin
aIl the pride t-hat it je passible ta, feel tawards a citizen af our country who has done
is so great bonour by oea long a lufe of usefui public service, and that we feel towards
him nat only the respect that is owing ta
ye-ars, but the veneration that camnes ta, gres.t
age when great age is its own benediction
upon a lufe devoted ta, noble work. That
Time and Care may deai gently with him
thraughout his remaining days is the wish
ai all in whose name I have the honour ta
speak.

doubt that our Brother Dessaulles can look
away back beyond Inkerman, if flot quite to
Waterloo. I noticed one feature which distinguished ail of those mèn whom. I interviewed-the age of most of them was about
,eighty-there was only one man who approached anything like a hunidred year-that everything controversial or bitter that
may have characterized their earlier years had
passed, away, and they were getting a new
and kinder disposition. I have no doubt that
this remark would apply to our friend here.
On behaif of the members whom I represent
in this Chamber, I desire to extend to him
our hearty wish for long continued years,
and the enjoyment of good health.
The sitting of the Senate having been resumed:
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, with the consent of the Chamber,
I move that the report of the proceedings
that have just taken place in celebration of

and be extended in Hansard.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3p.m.

THE SENATE
Thuraday, February 2, 1928.
The Senate met et 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.

Expenditures thus authorized include:
(a) Interest on securities, notes and other
obligations: rentals for lease of lines;
(b) Equipment Principal Payments. Sinking
Funda; Miscellaneous Maturing or Matured
Notes and other obligations secured or unsecured;
(c) Operating Income Deficit, whenever incurred or ascertainad;
(d) Construction and Betterments, includîng
co-ordinations; acquisition of real or personal
property.
The amounts so required may, at the discretion of the Governor-in-Council, be provided by
wvay of loans in cash of by way of guarantee,
or 'partly one way and partly the other. This
optional form of financing was adopted by e
previous administration during the fiscal yeai
1921-22, and bas simply been continued by thE
present Government.
Cash provided by the Government is a charge
on the Govarnment's financing for the year in
question. Amounts raised by the railway by
guarantea are not, and neyer have been, taken
into account as inereasing the public debt.
Senator McMeans refers particularly to
deficit on interest account. The railway, in
recent years, bas been able to meet the interest
due the public. Interest due the Government
bas not been met, but is charged into the
debt of the railway to the Governement each
year as interest accrues.
Senator McMeans also asks whether the deficit is concealed.
No feature of Canadian National financing
is concealed. The railway estimates go before
a special committee of the flousa of ('ommons
each session. The committea cails before it the
principal officers of the railway, who give the
members of the committee any necessary information as to the operations of the previons
year and the proposais concerning the forthcoming year. The proceedings of the eommittea
are printed. The committee also bas before it
annuel report of the railway as laid on the
Table by the Ministar of Railways each year,
and a statement of the year's financing is to be
found in the report of tbe Président and Chairman of the Board. while tbe details of fresh
financing are supplied by tbe statement of
f unded debt as set out in the report.

The financial requirements of the Canadian

5610"REVISED
EDITION

34

SENATE

Rigbt Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
What reason, I ask, what necessity compeiled
the entrance of Canada into this diplomatie
field-in Europe, for instance?
What las
in any material way will be incurred if
Canada does flot enter the field? In the
old conditions she had no part nor lot; she
had noa interest in their institutions; she had
flot inhcrited them in any way or degree.
The aid conditions have cbanged materially,
are changing from day to day more and more
rapidly, and the new diplomaey whicha is
taking its place is not on ail fours with the
old diplomacy. Why, then, should Canada
enter in and assume to berseif the habiliments which are being laid aside?
There is one other point. The whole system of diplomatic representation rests upon
the undou'lted and absolute sovereignty of
the power whieb accredits, and the power ta
which the plenipotentiary is accredited. It
will be difficaît for European and Asiatia
countries ta understand how we cani p-ossibly
sail under those colours with conditions as
thcy are. Take, for instance, the two countries withi which the Govcrnmcnt proposes to
enter lipon this heightcned diplomatie status.
France is a country which pretty well understands-botter. perhaps, than any other
country in Europe ar Asia-the peculiar constitution of the British Empire. Sh bas been
closely connocted witb the mothor country,
and bas a sympathetic and intimate relation
with CanaÀda itself. To France, as ta the
United States, the situation of Cannda as a
part of the British Empire, and the peculiar
circumstances under which that Empire has
developed from century ta century, are understoad, even though týhcre be an anomaly in
those connectionýs.
She understands pretty
well froua a political point of view about how
the system works out. What. then,' do we
Iack in France itself under the present system
that wc would gain hy adopting the system
of plenipatentiary representation?
There is
no contiguity of boundaries and consoquently
thore are na differences such as are hiable
ta arise between countrios having a boundary
in comman. I have nover found that France
itself bas, raised any bar against the froc
and full admiission af aur Canadian reprosentative ta bier departmnents because hae
<lacs not wcar the braided caat of a minister plonipotontiary.
In my exporience in
France. extending aver a goad many years,
I have neyer found it difficuit ta get an introduction ta any departmcent or ta any mcmber of the Government. If that were sa in
the alden times, it bas became more and
mare a feature of Canada's present trade and
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

commnissarial representation in Paris. To my
inmd, plenipotentiary powers conferred on
aur present lligh Commissioner, or on anyanc cisc ta take the place of the High Coinmissioner, wauld not facilitate the freedomn
and intimacy which now exista in communications between us a'd the French Government.
If, then, there is no demand from France for
it, or if there is no bar upon aur easy acceas
ta Departments and members of the Go)vernment in France in relation ta whatever
quezstions may arise, we will set that a.side.
I think honaurable members will agrce with
me that on neither of those counts do we
need ta make a change from the present
situation.
Plenipotentiaries and ambassadoirs are the
indices of political affiliations; but we have
no political affiliations with France or with
Japan. and we do not wisb ta allly ourselves
by political affiliation or connection with
either of those countries.
Then why sbould
,we put forward and carry out a system which
lias its very esqsen.ce and, foundation in the
fact that there are or may came political
differenes, with qdjustments ta be made on
aceount of those that m.ay arise?
Surely we
do not anticipato eitbcr of those from the
public of France.
The intereste that exist
botweon France and Canada to-day are interests cf a business and economic nature,
and nio other. The gaod-will wbich is injectod
in:to business and economie relations may well
be expressed hy the trade commissioners as
they exist to-day, and as they have been
fumctioning and by individuial business mon
and corporations of traders tbrough the trade
eommisusionoerships.
What more is really
needed?
Do you need ta pdace a minister
plenipotentiary in Paris in order that hie may
answer questions as ta how a certain article
in a French treaty works upon a certain
business or indrustry whidh wisheEs ta, export
ta Franco?
Ail such matters came wcll under
the trýide commissîonership, and are well attende(d ta at the present, time; therefore to my
mind thore is no nee-d of setting up a plenipotentiary aushassadorial
est-ablel-hment in
Paris ta answer any littie queistions or adjust
any differencos which take place in reference
ta the operation of a tariff.
As ta the formation of a ariff, wbhicb must
ba founded uýpon experionce and information
wj'th roference ta resources and commodities
whidi may be profitably interchangcd between
the two cauntries, and about which certain
tariff and custams regulations may be useful
ta carry out systemnatic communications that
mnay le neessary, these thing are amply
providýed for ýto-day by trade commissioner-

ships. Il you fake a good trade commissioner
wbo is doing bis duty now, and doing it we'll,
and dress him up in the habiliments of a
plen.ipotentiary, and give him tha~t heightened
idea of himself and his position, it is as if
you were to take an honoet and industrious
labourer, rernove bis smook-frock anid working
clothes, and dress him up in a Sunday. suit,
and put hima on exhibition. You would then.
have destroyed bis usefuiness rather than added
t0 it.

Now we corne down to the question as to
what benefit is te be gained over and above
what we now 'have; and t&he put on the
other side certain possibilities and contin,
gencies which are la>ble to take place. Every
point of contact you make with a foreign
nation on the line of an embassy or plenipotentiary minister involves contingent
conflict,'
possibly actual conflict. We have the British
Empire, witb ifs plenipotentiary; and the
British Empire includes the Dominion of Canada. The British Empire is a sovereigu
power,'
undeniabdy and undoubtedly, îand ifs representafive acte in a capacity that is germane
and pertinent to the conditions of the institutioniswbich if bas founded. Sidb by side
with that embassy we bave another embassy,
that of Canada, and we -have the people of
every country asking how that is. We do
nlot know the temperament of the man wbo is
f0 represent us, nor that of the man who
represents thbe British Government; and as
between fliese two in a foreign court every-,
tbing depends upon the temperament of those
fwo men. Tben we bave ail other ambassadors
and plenipotentiaries, and the newspaper press,
and we may bave statements -made, flrst by
one and then by anotber, and queries rmi"e
first by one and then. by e.notber, unfil the
possibilities for *misunderstanding grow and
grow.
Why is if necessary for us to multiply
these points of possible misunderstanding?
When we corne te the real kernel of the
matter, wbat I atated a moment ago la true,
that fhe very essence of ambassadorial and
plenipotentiary representafion is the absoluf e,
undoubted. and acknowledged sovereignty of
the stafe wbich accredifs f0 the state t0 wbicb
the représentative ia accredited. In ail the
galaxy of ambassadors of the four different

worked out some mechanism by wbicb these
inconsistencies may be reconciled, and these
points of difference brought f0 a termination.
Whaf causes apprebension in my mmnd is
thaf this train that bas been started, and is
now being accelerated with an impulse that
wilI become greater and greater, wil corne
some day f0 the point wben Canada will bave
f0 choose wbef ber f0 buttress up ber positions;
wben there will arise certain contingencies
in view of wbicb she will say: "We are nef
now absolufely independent, but we can soon
become so, and we will take measures f0 bring
thaf about." I arn eorry, and I regret that
that train cf tbougbt, and thaf impulse of
tendency, bave been contributed f0 by the
Government which isnow in power in the
ostentafious parade of ifs new liberties, socalled, and ifs new status, so-called, and in
ifs feverishi anxiety f0 make better relations
and f0 weld stronger links between itself and
f oreign powers on that status, -and to delay
what seems f0 me to be the absolutely
necessary obligation of making stronger those
links, and fies, and leanlings, and connections,
whicb are f0 be the only guarantee that tbis
Empire will remain a unify, and thaf we sbail
remain wifbin it as a part of that unity.
That is why I bave made these commente,
and wby 1 say to the Government: "You
bave now one foy that you can play with;
prove thaf you can play safely with that,
and let this proposed extension f0 other and
remoter foreign countries 'bide a wee' until
experience bas worked ouf the proper
methode for reconciling distinct incengruitico
wbich to-day crop up at every step we fake
along this pafh."
We are not ail of French descent and
English descent in tbis country, and from
fime f0 time as we proceed we shah bhave a
larger proportion of people outside of that
category. For thoee of us who are descended
from France and from Great Britain and
other Brifish countries, those long and strong
lines of culture intimacy remain imbedded
in us; fhey draw and hold and keep us
together; but every year thousands are commnginto fbis country wbo have not that
paf ernity, nor those bonds and links. To
that portion of the country these new ideas
go wif bout the restrictive influence of the
cultural and de6cent links which bind us
f0 the two mother countries. So my advice
f0 the Governmenf would be-and I for one
would feel mighfily relieved if if could be
carried ouf-thaf they should rest with that
one embassy whicb bas been founded, where
if con work ouf welI if anywbere, and where
if bas a heffer chance of working ouf becauee
of our proximify and our mufual understand-

SENATE
ing one with the other; and that the government do not progress towards this general
and political line of action which is not going
to add to the centripetal forces, but will add
to the centrifugal influences which are drifting
us away from the unity of the British Empire.
That is al, honourable gentlemen, that I
have to say on this point in comment upon
the Speech from the Throne. There will
probably be other opportunities during the
Session for a more extended discussion and
consideration of our foreign relations, and
also our international relations, whiclh I
should like to see dealt with in this and
the other branch of Parliament. Largely
without very much thought in the rank
and file of the people of Canada, a new
institution has been established-the League
of Nations. Canada has assumed obligations
under it, but in this and the other Chamber,
and of course outside of this House, there
is comparatively little adequate understanding of just what it all means-the obligations
that have been taken, and the tendencies
which are being pursued.
If such a discussion here leads to a deeper research,
broader information, and a more adequate
idea of what the League of Nations is and
what it is doing, I think we may congratulate ourselves that there has been started
along those lines an influence which mnst
spread through our people, and mould their
thinking. If the peace of the world is ever
to be assured, and war-that barbarous
absurdity for the settlement of international
disputes-is finally driven out from this
world, it must be by such influences as these.
Honourable gentlemen will have seen this
morning an announcement from Washington
that a new treaty, to replace an old one, of
arbitration and conciliation between the
United States and France, has been agreed
upon and is ready for signature, and will
shortly corne to the Senate of the United
States for its approval. At the head of that,
and as one of the lights under which that
treaty has been developed, and as one of the
advertisements that that treaty gives to the
world, there is the stateinent that France and
the United States admit that war, as an instrument of national policy, is wrong, is barbarie,
is an obseletism at the present tinie, and
that they set their faces against it. That
is at the present time the doctrine of the
League of Nations, fifty-five in number, who
at the last Assembly, after cight years of
practical work for the peace of the world, and
after one of thei most dignified and wellsustained debates that I have ever read, came
to the unanimous conclusion to brand aggressive warfare as a crime against humanity and
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

declared that it is the duty of every one of
the fifty-five members of that League of
Nations to imbed that doctrine in their admiinistration, and imbed it as well in the
mentality and conviction of the units of the
country te whicli they belong. I look upon
it as a gratifying and hopeful sign that the
menta:lity of the world is being aroused,
an international opinion formed against war,
and that the principles set forth and advocated once every year in a forum open to
the whole world, the great Assembly at Geneva, are produeing a moral in.fluence and
bringing about a revolution of methods of
international dealing in se far as the settlement of disputes is concerned.
Now, for a moment, let me touch on the
last subject upon which I intend to make
a few remarks; that is the question of immigration. I have long thouglit that probably
we did not get the full import of a great
national question when we simply talked of
immigration and set our minds to a consideration of methods by which immigration into
our country might be increased. The great
fundamental question, to my mind, is this:
how shall we best conserve and increase the
population of Canada? Immigration is only
one part of that great question, and perlhaps
we have done less useful and progressive work
along the line of our endeavour because we
have separated immigration froin the great
question of which it is only a part, and have
made it almost the only question.
Our
native population at the present time runs
up close to ten millions. The conservation
and the increase of that native population are
the major part of the problen of retaining
and increasing the population of Canada.
Who does net admit that one native-born,
brought up from childhood under Canadian
conditions, is worth more, much more, than
an adult net raised in Canada, but brouglit in
frein a foreign country, and consequently of
alien thought, alien culture and alien tendencies, fully and thoroughly developed. That
is no condemnation of alien culture, alien
ability, or alien adaptability, but it ncans
that the newcomer has something to learn of
Canada, which he undertakes to learn in his
riper years, and it implies also an in.ability on
his part to compreliend Canadian conditions
and work in with Canadian tendencies and
culture. I think no one will doubt the fact
that to keep one native Canadian as a continuing citizen in our own country is worth
more than to bring in one adult, maybe two,
naybe more, from a foreign country. Whatever tends to conserve the native-born population is a matter which should occupy the
attention of Government.

FEBRUARY 2, 1M2
But, after al], there is anot-her factor in
the problern. 0f two Canadian citizens born
and brought up in Canada one may be 100
per cent efficient and the other 50 per cent.
Which is of the greater service in production
and the upgrowth of the country? Efficiency
must be considered as well as numbers. People
who, are fully efficient produce better results
than twice as rnany others only 50 par cent
efficient. lIn order to conserve the efficiency
of the people who have been brought up in
our own atrnosphere we muet make the conditions of lîfa agreeable to them. That involves
health considerations and a variety of other
factors, and the effect of policies of either the
federal or the local governrnnts bears rnightily
upon the solution of the problani.
To leave out all other factors for the saka
of brevity, one of the things that militate
strongly in favour of the conservation of oui
citizenship as we have it within tha country,
and that bear also upon the productivity of
the race as far as our native population is
concerned, is the proper sort of econornia
conditions. They should ha made as favourable as possible, so that in the first place a
man rnay ba induced to raise a farnily, and
in the next place his family may be kept
around hirn, or at least within the country.
There cornes in the quiestion of employrnent.
Now, you are flot a free trader and I arn not
a protetionist as I arn arguing this matter
to-day: we are common citizens of Canada,
one just about as good as the other,' ahl thinga
baing taken into consideratien. Let us argue
out ýthis question. Is it not reasonable that
the parents of a farnuly should have sorne
assurance that when their child*ren'have grown
up they will ba able to enter upýon sorna ernployrnent which will provide thern with a
substantial sustenanca for the future?
We talk a great deal about farmars' sons
leaving the farms and going into the cities.
That condition prevails now to an extent
parhaps greater than before. No year will
pass in Canada in which you will net have
that problern with you. It was very well
stated by rny hQnourable friend the other day.
If a fa-rmer has a famuly of four boys and a
fanm of two or three hundred acres, can
thosa four boys rernain upon that one farrn
and rnarry and bring up farnilies? Is it possible for that farrner to brovide three farin
for three of tha boys and leave te the other
the paternal property? That is diffioult, perhaps impossible. So you rnay preach on that
subject until you are as old as rny honourable friand fTom Rougarnont (Hon. Mr. Dessaulles)-who looks as if ha is going strong
for another haîf century; you rnay talk about

37

it, but thare is a condition which is present
with us now and will be prasent rnora and
more. Add to that the further fact that today, owing to rnachanisrn skilfully invanted
and applied, one rnan upon a farrn can do aa
much as two or tbrea men in tha oldan tirnes.
Even with -the extension of farrns into landsa
that are net yet tilled and with the opening
up of new fanms, aach individual fanmer of
to-morrow and the day after will be able to
produce as rnuch as was produced in the
oldan tirnes by three or perhaps four fanmera.
You must provide sornething, must you not,
for thosa boys who de net want to, farm,
and for those who cannot becausa thay have
no farm? If wa can provide sorna amploynient for theni we shail ratain theni; and if
wa do flot provida employment we shaîl losa
them, becausa to-day, with the facilities for
in tencommuni cation, thay can hop off to the
country to the south of us, as people have
been hopping off for years and years, and will
to a certain axtent for years to corna. That
hopping off procass can ba retardad, if not
eliminated, only by sorne kind of ernployment being found in occupations other than
farming for that surplus of population. Now,
I arn not a protactionist and you ara not a
free trader: we ana on cornron ground. If
there is any policy by which the nesources
of the country can ha davelopad and utilizad
so as to provida arnployrnent for that surplus,
is not such a poliey tha one to adopt, and ana
you not kieking against tha pricks, and ineffectually, so, long as by mare argurnent you
sirnply uphold one theory or danounce
another? The practical point la, can we get
arnploymant for that surplus of our population? If we cannot provide it thay will seek
it elsawhere, and they will send back to, us,
as the produets of thair brawn and skill, and
at a highar prica, the very things which thay
rnight have produced hara for our consurnption if only tha capital and tha industny could
hava been providad in this country.
Sorneone talls me that last yaar 1,500,000
cords of pulpwood ware exported frorn
Canada, and that if it had hean manufactured in this country into the various
products into which. wood rnay ha converted
it would have produced a valua of $70,000,000
instead of the $15,000,000 valua at which it
was exported.
We have water-powars, we have capital, we
have brawn and skill and adaptability. Why
can we not adopt sorne polîcy by means of
which wa can bring our raw producte, in so
far as we must export thern, up to the topnotch of value bafore thay ana exported?
Why should thay ha bnought back te, this
country in flnished forni at a valua which is

38

from one hundred fold, and at the very ]east
tenfold, more than they bring into this
country in the raw state? Away with your
Free Traders and away with your Protectionists. Let the question of Free Trade or
Protection pass for the nonce as a miist in the
morning, and let us as sensible men ask ourselves whetber we cannot, by putting our
hceads together and by utilizing the unparalieled water-powers and other reseurces that
we have, provide industries wbich shall give
employment of a healthy kind to the surplus
population and keep them and the inducoments to family life witbin our own country.
Somehow or other there bas grcwn up in
my mind an impression of failure.
1 do not
know wbom to blame. I do flot know whether
the blame can be laid exactly at one point or
at another.
In view of the present co>-operative arrangements and facilities for immigrants coming fromn Great Britain, whicli we
diýd net have formerly, and under which the
expense of bringing- in immigrants and settling
them in this country is divided about fiftyfifty, bow is it that after two, whole yeare have

regard his recent promotion at the hands
of our leader as a recognition, in part, at
any rate, of the services he rendered during
the Jubilee celebration. May I say by the
way, that incidentally, and only incidentally,
the few steps I have been allowed to take
towards the sun are not due to anything
such as that, but are simply because I happen
to be the senior privy councillor who sits
on this side of the House.
Now I want to say something with regard
to the visit of the Prime Minister of Great
Britain, and the heir apparent.
It is a
matter for congratulation that at last a
British Prime Minister whilst in office bas
deemed it worth while to visit our Dominion.
His visit will no doubt tend to strengthen
the tie that binds us, one of its greatest
parts, to the Empire itself. I am quite sure
that what Mr. Baldwin saw in Canada was
a revelation to him, and that he went away
with a better understanding of our needs,
and of our hopes and aspirations.
The
subsequent visit of the Prime Minister of
Australia, the recent visit of the Premier
of the Free State, and the approaching visit
of the Secretary of State of the United States,
are bound to bring about great advantages
to Canada. These visits will cause a sort
of rediscovery of Canada, if I may put it
that way, not only to Canadians but to the
world at large.
They will show to our
visitors the grandeur of our country, of our
lakes and rivers, our magnificent natural
resources, our unlimited potentialities, and
will cause them to look upon our future in
niuch the same way that we do ourselves.
The fame of Canada during last year spread
over this continent and the old continent in
a manner which was altogether new, and I
would wish that the Government of the day
would not lose any opportunity for the
renewal of such visits.
I agree with the view expressed that great
benefits are bound to accrue from Provincial
Conferences such as we had during the
summer. The oftener our ministers and
leaders come in contact with one another,
and the more frequent their exchange of
views, desires and ambitions, the better will
the autonomous provinces become known to
each other, thus our country will be more
fully appreciated. What is needed in Canada is greater contact not only of governments and leaders, but of individuals. It
is extraordinary to have to admit that in
this country we bardly know one another,
that, for instance, the two great races have
learned less than they should know about
one another; and they will not become
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

intimate and more united unless opportunities
are afforded of more frequent meetings and
more constant contact.
I should like to say a few words in regard
to the development of the St. Lawrence River.
I have not made up my mind as to whether
I shall support or oppose the proposed scheme
of development. I do not think I can come
to a reasonable conclusion unless I am furnished
with a great deal more information than we
have now. I think it is fair to say that we
have at present little or no information on
the subject. We must remember that we have
already by treaty granted important rights
to the United States with regard to the
navigation of our Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence, and I confess I am rather chary
about increasing those rights. I am afraid
to give our American friends larger control
than they now have. To my mind the St.
Lawrence river is the greatest Canadian asset.
there is no other that can for a moment be
compared with it in value. The St. Lawrence
is the open door, and is the key to the largest
part of North America. Are we going to
increase the hold whicb the republic to the
south already has on this great asset without
having sufficient data, or without having
proper guarantees, and sufficient means for
implementing such guarantees We may get
a guarantee which on the face of it may appear
safe, but the question is whether it can be
carried out. We should remember that the
whole American Union bas not been able to
prevent the city of Chicago from causing great
damage by altering the level of our lakes. If
we increase the control which the Americans
already
have over
our waterway,
what
guarantee have we that we can enforce any
guarantees which they may be willing to
concede?
Honorable gentlemen on the other side have
referred to what should be done in the way
of increasing the population of Canada, and
keeping our sons within our own borders.
They have expressed the desire that practical
steps should be taken in regard to the two
different aspects of what is really one subject,
namely, immigration and keeping our people
at home. Now, I have a suggestion. Our
farm lands are being abandoned because they
cannot provide employment except for a
certain proportion of our farmers' sons. They
have not the extent or possibilities that permit
all farmers' sons to stay at home and find on
the farm a livelihood and financial advancement. I want to -uggest that the Government
of Canada or the Governments of the provinces-depending very largely on the opinion
which will be handed down by the Supreme

FEBRUJARY 2, 1928
Court on the question whether waterpower
falls under the jurisdiction of Federal or
provincial authorities -that
those goverfiments, separately or together, shauld utilize
some of our magnificent waterpowers for the
purpose of supplying farmers with artificial.
fertilizer. It seems to me that that is the
one and only thing which will keep the
farmers' sons on the land. When they are
able to cultivate intensively 100, 200, or 300
acres of land, they will remain on the land,
and they will find employmeint, which is not
now available, right on the ancestral farm.
With the aid of fertilizer they will be able
to cultivate with success the entire ancestral
holdings.
We know that in France and many other
countries of Europe farmers who have only
ten or fifteen acres of land are. able to make
nlot only a decent -living but to set money
aside, simply because they carry on this
intensive cultivation for which I arn agitating,
but which cannot be conducted without fertilizer.
We have given protection to ail sorte of
industries, but we have comn(plotely neglected
the basic industry of this country, agriculture.
If there was justification for ixnposing dutiies
and granting bounties to other industrial enterpriso, surely agriculture is of the firet inportance, and bas the best right of ail te
protection. Here is a plan -by which protection can he given to the farmer, and by
which the farmrnes' sons mey be permnanoently
ke'pt in this coun&ty.
Consider what that means for Canada and
the wo.,ld. Canada te-day in recognized M~
t.he gransry of the world. If we could culItivatte the whole of the faxraing lands of
Osmada, and xnake tAiem produce to tiheir
caaity, we would be adoiting the beet
nghiod of making Canada greater and more
proqffroSw, and it seems te me that the expeçiditurie involved would be aamply justified.
I baid a good deal te do soine years ago with
the beginning of the developnient, which is
now about oompleted, of the water power on
the Saguenay river at the out-let of lake
St. John. The underttaking wae prompted by
M-r. Duke, of New York, whose .money went
alinot exclusively into it. His plan at first
was to estabolish a fleet of 60 steamers of
10,000 tons capacity, te take th-_ phosphates
from the rivers in }e'orgia and the Carolinas,
and bring them up to Chicoutimi, for the
purpose of turning them into fertiliser. The
proposition involved this large carrying capacity. Other capitalists found it to their
advantage to take up this power and use
it for other purposes, else there would have
been an excellent opportunity for putting

41

m.y suggestion into practice. But there are
many water ,powers yet undeveloped, that
could fumeish millions of horse power, aind I
suggest that they .be utilized for the objeot
wîhkh we ail desire, the increase of our population.
May I say a few words on the eubject which
engsged the attention of my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Sir George Foster) for
the miost of bis speech, te wbich I listeaied
with great interest and profit. I refer te the
a'ppointmnent of representatives of Canada tc
foreign countries. I cannot see how the carrying out of tii policy is un any way inconsietent with our relations with the empire and
the Goverument of Great Britain. Nothing
in our constitution is oppoeed te -,uch action
heing taken. Repr4'sentatives or piFnipo'tentiaries could have been appointe1 as early as
the let of July, 1867. We are not to-day
exercising, or atitempting te exercise, any
power or autbority whicb oould not have been
exercised at any turne sînce the Confederation
Act -was adopted.
However, I did not understand my right
honourable friend to dispute the rigbt or authority of Canada te do tii, but he did net
seem te think it wise or prudent to appoint
those representatives. Well, that is an opinion
which of course must be respected; bowever,
it is one which I cannot, adopt. The reasons
upon wfiich the right honourable gentleman
relies, at least saine of tihem, were not quite
clear to me, or perhaps I sbould say not convincing. Re seems to think that the diplomatic function has very greatly changed in
our day from what it was in centuries past,
or perhaps up to within a half-century of
tihe present. I cannot ace in what way it hias
changed. It is true that in the M.iddle Âges,
-and for some centuries after, the function of
tihe diplomat was mainly concerned with war
and peace. ln those days with aIl diplemats
the main or perhaps exclusive function was to
try te, secure the friendship of tihe neighbouring
nations or sovereigns, but that was because
of the conditions of the world at that turne.
Conditions have changed in rnany respects,
and it is neoessary to add to the functions
that were perforrned in the Middle Âges;
yet in the present age we still have te
consider war and peace. lIn fact, peace '
the thoughy wîth which my right honourabl
friend lives every day; it is peace which fills
up the mort of his if e to-day. There is
no change in that; there is as much reason
to-day as there .wae four or five centuries ago
to have diplomatie rélations with regard to
peace.
What bas ehanged, and what rny
right honourable friend, seerna to forget, is

SENATE
that in our day, because of the tremendous
discoveries -that have been made, whicba annihilate time and distance, and the great facilities which have been furnishied the world at
large to trade with one ariother and engage in
commerce and other hum-an activities, the necessi'ty for representatives between one country
and another seerrs to bave grown rather than
lessenied.
If Canada wishes to take full advantage of
the opportunities which are naw offered te
ail nations, it is goiog to make mucli more
progress by having some representative in
one or more of the capitals of t.he world ta
remind the country ta ivbich he is accredited
what Canada holds, and to eall attention not
only ta trading and commercial rela!tions, but
ta make known the great resourtes of our
country, and give an insight ino aur future.
We should bave a representative wbo cao
secure froc access ta the bead of the country
ta wbich lie is sent. This lutter funictian is
one of the most important, for no mere comnmercial man could to-day interview' 'Mr.
Briand on trade conditions in France: he would
not be received. A minister of foreigo affairs
-Mr.
Briaod in France, or Sir Austen
Chamberlain in Eoglaod-wauld not think of
drnying il plonipotentiary or a high commissianer wbo wvas sent ovor as reprcsenting
Canada. Sa I repeat that the requirements
of diplomary seemn ta me ta be greater ta-day
than they wore at iny time ta which my riglt
honourable friend reforred.
My riglit bonaourable f riend seemed ta think
tbat tble anly reason for appoioting a representative ta a foreign country would be
becauso its territory was contiguaus ta tbat
of Canada. Weil, as far as aur relations witb
the UTnited -States are concerned. tbere would
prabably flot be very much reason for aur
appointing a represeoitatie ifthewoe
inatter must be' judged mierely by considerations of thiat kind. But I submit there is
no country in the world in which. we require
a resident plenip)otentiar-y more than n'a do
ir, the United States, with which. we do s0
nuch. of aur bus~iness. But tbere are many
occasions for a plcnipotentiary ta advance tbe
interests of Canada abroad, apart from merely
trade and commerce. There arc questions of
immigration tbat miay invoolve very seriaus
international problems. We bave had posaibilities of great difficulties with Ja;pan in that
vcry regard. Wou!d flot the presence ýof a
diplomat at Tokio, devoting bis time, attention. a.nd talents, ta, creaýtiog a better understanding bet,veen Canada and .Iapan, make
botter known aur views and desires? Would
nat that serve the country's interests in a
very marked way? I put the question to
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

my righit bonourable friend (Rigbt Hon. Sir
George E. Foster). I wauld go so far as ta
say that because of those great international
difficulties that may arise at any moment
thero is anr absolute necessity to-day ta hiave
right, an the spot a representative who can
daily commune witb the leaders in Japan
and put squarely and honestly before them
Ihle views of Canada and the difficulties of
this country in dealing xvith that subject.
C'ertainly we want the aiiy
of Japan.
May I bere ho permitted ta indulge in a
l.t.tle egotistical retrospection whcb lias ta,
do partly witb tbis subjeet and also with the
subj ect tbat I deait witb previously, that is,
,lhe benlefits ta be .dcrived from the visits
of leaders of the different parts of the Britishi
Empire and possibly of the leaders of thouglit
and the political leaders in other counitries.
In 1906, twenýty-two years ago, on the first
ciay of the Session, I moved ini the Commons
for an Address inviting lis Majesty King
Edward, the Great. Peacemaker, and Queen
Alexandra ta visit Canada, and I urged at
that time, )Àmiong other reasons, that as King
Edward had been successful i0 creatiog an

.nvited ta visit Canada a second time, in

the Unitcd States, Mr. Roosevelt, who, notw'ithstanding bis warlike inclinations and
(lirspositioik,, xvas at that time talking peace

I indu]ged in the hope,

nn exten-lon of the entente cordiale which
would takle in thle United States of Amnerica;

1FEBRUARY 2,1928
I recali that occasion to empliasize the
neoessity for dloser contacts of the different
parts of the British Empire with the outside
world and the mutual beneficial resuits wliich
are bound to arise from sucli contacts. It
als9o discloses another strong reason why we
should have on the spot a representative of
Canada who will ha constantly putting forward the advantagas of Canada, its patentialities, as weIl as its aspirations, and its willingnass to perform its shara of the duties which
the different nations of the world owe one
another.
My right honourable friend (Riglit Hon. Sir
George E. Foster), in dealing with tha confliet
which. ha considers inevitable between the
component parts of the Empire and Great
Britain, through the appointment of these
reprasantatives, forgot that action lias been
taken in this mattar with the fuiU consent and
co-oparation of the Government of Great Britain. The power which we have exarcisad for
Bnme years past in attanding international
conferences and in making our own treaties
has been axercisad with the approval, and, as
suggastedi by xny honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), the liearty co-operation of
the Imparial Govarnment.
My right honourable friand muet remember
this also, that the planipotentiaries appointed
to attend these international conferencas, as
well as the plenipotantiaries whom wa have
sent or propose toi send to foreign countries,
deriva thair power from the King himself.
They are accradited to foreign countries by
the King. It is true that the Ring does not
grant authority on the advice -of his imperial
advisers; it is on the racommendation' of his
Canadian advisars that lie does it; still nobody
has found any fauît with that sort of thing,
and there is no likelihaod of confliet of any
kind arising out of the exercise of that power.
The ides, lias been axpressed that the Imparîal Conferance of 1926 aitered our Constitution. 0f course it did flot aiter it. Technically and legaly the Constitution to-day is
just what it was on the let of July, 1867. The
King still hae the power toi disallow our legislation from beginning to end, whethar it applies to internaI or external affaire. The
Colonial Va'lidity Act is stili in force. Theoretically our Constitution is not changed in
the élightest partiùeular; and thare was no necessity for it ta lie changad in ordar that we
miglit axercise the powars which. we have
axercisad. We could have appointad plenipotentiaries in the year 1867, and wa could have
done it at any other tima, and without in any
way interfering with the Constitution. The
Imperial Conferance had no power ta alter
anything. It was merely a meeting of leaders

43

of the diffarent Dominions and of Great Britain wjio conferred togather and. came ta an
understanding as ta what was the real relationship between the Government of Great Britain
and the Dominions. They sought a formula,
and found and declared a formula, applicable
ta the e3isting status. They teried to crystallize in words the situation as it was in fact.
That is aIl they did. The Conferance did niot
dlaim ta have power to do anything more.
It certainly procaeded on tha assumption that
it had no power ta do anything in, the way of
amending aur Constitution.
Thare has been a great deal of talk lately
on this subi ect, and some of it lias bean very
loasa indead; baose in many ways; baose ini
ideas and baose in ternis. For instance, the
words "nation " and "natianhood " have been
takan as synonymous with "state " and
' statahood. ". Anyone wha thinks for a moment wilI see that there is a tremendous
difference. Autonomy and savereigncy do
not mean the sanie týhing at all, yet these
tarms ara usad abtarnatively without any dis
tinction. Canada is an autonomous nation,
but it is not a sovaraign state, and wibl not
ha until it choosesl some day-if it ever does
-ta declare its independence. It cannat bie
a soveraign state otherwise. So it seeme to,
me that a great deal of unnecassary discussion of a purely academic nature lias been
indulged in. Not onby are we not a sovareign
state, but we are probably not exarcising the
bargast measure of autonomnous rights that can
ha exercised by a country which is not a
sovereign state. A state may be -composed
of savaral nations. The diffarenee batween
"nation"- and "state" and the true maaning
of thase terms may ha illustrated hy the example of Switzerband. In Switzerband there
are thraa different nationalitias, the Frenchi,
the Italian and the German, but there is only
ana sovereign state. In discussing matters
of this nature it is of the utmost importance
that wa shoubd always ha pracise and particular in the ternis we use; atherwisa the
rasubt mnay ha andlass confusion.
. The situation miglit be put, again, in this
way. De jure aur Constitution is not that
of a sovaraign state, but de facto we are
axarcising some of the autonomous funetions of a savaraign state. However, it seems
ta me thýat there is no use in continuing the
discussion of this matter, and 1 refar to i-t
mareby in the hope that by domng 80 1 May be
able ta correct false impressions whieh have
been ereated throughout the community by
boosanass in the use of termes with separate
and distinct meanings. Otherwise I would not
hava considared it necessary ta engage ini a
long discussion on the eubject.

SENATE

44

May I point out further that the Government of Great Britain bas never placed the
slightest obstacle in the way of our exercising the fullest measure of autonomous rights,
but bas trusted to our loyalty and our desire
to remain an integral part of the British
Empire. We have been allowed to go practically to the limit in the exercise of national
or state power, and there is no reason in the
world to think that Great Britain is now
going to adopt a policy different from that
which it bas followed hitherto. From statements made in the House of Commons at
Westminster we know that there is to-day
practically nothing that we could ask Great
Britain to allow us to do and that Great
Britain would refuse us. Mr. Bonar Law,
not many years ago, when he was Prime Minister, declared in the House of Commons that
if we asked to-morrow for separation from
Great Britain there would be no hesitation
in granting it to us.
That brings me to another subject upon
which I would like to say a few wordsthe power to amend the Constitution. which
has been demanded by some sections of
Canada. There are a great many who do
not at the present time wish Canada to acquire the power to amend the Constitution,
and I say frankly that I am one of those.
I do not think the time is opportune to
amend the Canadian Constitution. As I have
repeated several times this afternoon, I think
our present Constitution is all-sufficient for
our purposes. We can, I think, do everything
that we may legitimately desire to do under
the terms of the B.N.A. Act, and, frankly, I
hope that the power to amend the Constitution will not be granted ta our Parliament
until such time as we have created throughout Canada a proper national sentiment and
a proper condition of national unity. We cannot ignore the fact that there are many problems, territorial, geographical, social, moral
or intellectual, that we have not yet completely solved, and it will be several years yet
before wc have created the spirit that will he
necessary for the permanent and equitable
solution of these problems, some of them
purely material and others of a spiritual kind.
The two great races who form the basis of
this Confederation hardly know each other
yet. and consequently do nnt thoroughly
iinderstand each other. Not until there is a
willingness to be tolerant, to approach the
solution of our problems in a spirit of honourable compromise and to deal with them in
the only way in which they can be dealt with
adequately, properly and permanently, should
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

the power to amend the Constitution be
granted; for once it is granted there will be
no limit to the exercise of that power.
I must add that in principle I have no
objection to the amendment of the Constitution. To my mind it is merely a matter
of time and opportunity. Canada is progressing sanely and satisfactorily. We have
recently been making tremendous progress.
We have taken means to add to the development of the country by putting to fruitful use
the great natural resources which God AImighty bas given us. I think we should not
be ton much concerned with purely academic
powers, but should be content to proceed
with our existing powers, which as I see it,
are quite ample to permit of the completion
of the development that we have undertaken
with so much success, particularly within
recent years.
Before I sit down may I express my
approval-not in a partisan way-of the
action of the Government in the larger
spheres of administration, and of the saneness
with which they are proceeding? The Government of to-day is a stable Government.
It bas been something very different for a
long time past. The Government was chosen
by the people. It took the reins of office
when the country was in turmoil, and when,
to my mind, we were in dire need of stable
government, whether Liberal or Conservative.
If I may be permitted ta do so, with the
greatest humility I would ask the Senate to
co-operate heartily and cordially in all the
measures of the Government ta which they
0
can gi e their support. I think it would
add to the dignity and reputation of the
Senate ta pursue such a course.
With regard to the dignity and reputation

Now, in the Journal of Electricity, of June,

experts is an authoritative calculation of the
definite numericai correlation between the
ameunts of electric power developed by a
new deveiopment and the average of new
employment--new lobs-additional workmen
empioyed-and general growth of population,
as weil as new annual wage payments which
would resuit from it. The figures which
appeared in this interesting calculation were
based on units of 1,000 horsepower, and were
as follows: that a total of 3M5 new employees
-as I have said, new jobs-would resuit froin

developed;
and,
furthermore, that these 385 employees would
draw in wages-new money put into circulation-the sumi of $581,100 per annum. On the
basis of one aotive workman suppeýrting an
average of five souls, inciding himself, his
family and the ordinary auxiliary population-which I think is a fair basis in the area
tributary to the St. Lawrence-we get the
stirprising resuit that each 1,000 new hersepower developed supports 385 new workmen
drawing $M81,100 per annum in wages, and
represents a new population of 1,925 seuls.
Now, let us apply this calculation te the
Canadian horsepower available on the St.
Lawrence river.
Four million horsepower,
approximately 'the
total Canadian-owned
potential power, is 4,000 units of 1,000 horsepower each, as used in the above calculation.
We find that the Canadian horsepower now
running to waste on the St. Lawrence river
would, according to the above calculation, if
fully developed and utilized in Canada,
employ a new population of 1,540,000 workmaon, supporting a new and additional population of 7,700,000, and drawing in actual cash
wagcs the stupendous sumn of $2,39-4400,000
per annum, ail paid for out of the product
of the deveiopment and utilization of this
power.
These figures, I submiit, are most astonishing.
I submit that they tend te revolutionize many

My right honourable friend from Brockviile

reference ta the St. Lawrence waterways and
ta the functians of the Advisary Board, of
which 1 have the honaur ta be a member, and
of which hie was a member and chairman
until about eighteen months aga. He bas
made certain suggestions with respect ta considerations which the Advisory Board or the
Govemoment shouid take inta cansideration
before arriving ýat a conclusion with respect
ta the policy ta be adopted in cannection

that my right honourabie friend desired ta

in the miinds of the citizens of Canada, that
the Adx'isory Board xvould presume ta make
recommendations ta the Goverament without
having the necessary data and information at
their disposai upon which ta base tbem; and
at once rnay I assure the right honaurable
gentleman, hanaourable gentlemen of this
t'hamber, an'd the country, that the Advisory
Board have had available, information on ail
points sîiggested by the right hanaurahie
gentleman, in sufficient v'olume and detail ta
enabie themn ta arrive at an intelligent and

FEBRUARY 2,1928
comprehensive understanding of the whole
question, as set out in the reference ta the
Advisory Board.
And here may I be permitted to refreeh the
memory of the right honourable gentleman
and hoijourahie members, as to what that
reference was, as given in the Order in Couneil
establishing the Board:
The Minister is of the opinion that it would
be in the public interest ta constitute a National Advisory Committee to consider generally
whether or flot the project would, if completed
be beneficial ta Canada; whether the benefits
which might accrue and the pecuniary returns
direct or indirect 'which may be anticipated
from. it are such as ta, counterbalance its disadvantages, if any; whether your Excellency should
indicate a readiness to enter into discussions
with the United States of Ameriea looking
towards the negotiation of a Treaty for the

carrying out of the necessary work, and what
should be the character of the stipulations which
any such Treaty should contain..
The Minister accordingly recommends that a
National Advisory Committee be constituted
for the purpose aforesaid.
I do not wish ta take up too much of thetime of this Ohamber in a lengthy explanation
of the nature and volume of the information
gathered by the Advisory Board, but may 1
say at once that we had the very exhaustive
and complete report of the International Joint
Waterways Commission, of which, the Honourable M.r. Magrath, now Chairman of the
Ontario Hydro-Electric Power Commission,
was Chairman. Under his able direction invaluable information was collectcd from grain
men, from shipping men, from Tailway men,
from power authorities, and from aIl who
might he directly interested in this project.
The net result of this thorough and extensive

inquiry was the conclusion as set forth in the
report of the International Joint Waterways
Commission in its summary of conclusions.
This conclusion is as follows:

and

fromi the highest au-

thorities regarding ahi matters ta which. the
right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) has referred.
We also had at aur disposaI a report by a
body known as the Inter-departmental Committee, made up of members fromn various
departmnents of Government which would be
affected in any way by the deepening of the
St. Lawrence Waterways. The fumction of
this body was ta gather information which
would hbave a direct bearing upon alI the
points refe-rred to by the right honourable
gentleman.
In addition ta the instances which I have
cited, we had at our disposaI the valuable
records of the Montreal Harbour Cammission
in regard to the trade and commerce of the
coun.try going through that port. And here
may I give some figures whieh I feel will be
of interest ta honou-rable gentlemen, as showing the increase and the volume of grain shipments through the port of Montreal:
1921........138,454,000 bushels
1922.........155,000,000

The right honourable gentleman has also
referred to the power question, and to the

gentleman must be aware of the investigations
into this question which have been made by
the Dominion Water Powers Brandi of the
Department of the Interior, by thc Ontario
Hydro-Electrie Power Commission, and by
other economists who have studied the question, and also of the conclusions rea.cbed by
the Dominion Water Powers Brandi that the
potential power available from the St. Lawrence watersbed would be ahsorbed in approximately 25 years; from whicha the conclusion must be drawn that the power fromi
the St. Lawrence wiil be required within a
comparatively short time.
Honourable gentlemen will wcll realize that
as a member of tie Advisory Board, iaving
submitted a ýconfidential report to the Govermureport up 10 the
ment of the day, wii
present lime bas flot been made public, it is
impossible for me to, discuss this great question in more detail than 1 have donc on this
occasion. But in conclusion 1 desire te assure
the right honourable gentleman froým Brockville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) and honourable gentlemen of this Chamber and thc
country, that in submnitting this report to the
Governmcnt, the members of the Advisory
Board fully appreciated the importance of the
ta.sk cntruslcd to therm, and gave it their hast
tiought and consideration.
There bais heen some qucry in different
parts of Canada as 10 the effcct of the decpcoing of the St. Lawrence Watcrways on the
national port of Montreal. For the benetit
of honouraile gentlemen of aIl parts of Canada wbo arc interested in thc future prosperity and devclopment of the Port of
Montre il, 1 give it as my considcred opinion
as Chairiiian of the Board of ilarbour Conionraand as the opinion of
inissioners of
thie technical staff of the Ilarbour Commission, wxho arc ini diily touch with shipping
and witi the inovernent of varions coinmodities in and eut of that port, tiat the
busine-ss of that port tvill not be diminiîtid,
but on the contrary will steadily inerease
frein year to year, and the proposed deepeningî of tîje St. Lawrene Waterxvays will greatly
accelerate thc rate of inerease in *the volume
of business handlcd by Canada's national port
1Ion. Mr. MeDOUGALD.

One of the main factors in
of Montreal.
achieving this beneficial resuit wvill be the
undouhted lowering of the costs on the ailwvater grain movement from the head of the
Lakes, the minimum estimate of which, arrivcd at by all aiîthorities, is a savirng of three
cents a bushel. Many experts say the saving
will be as high as six cents a bushel, but we
are sure it will be at least three.
I infer
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
that the r.-port that bas been made to the
Government, whatevcr it oontaains, i.s the resuit of reading the prior reports, and that no
original evidence bas been taken at ail?
Hon. Mr. McDOUGALD: I do not think
the honourable gentleman shoýuld infer that.
In addition to the available reports that we
had, withou.t going into, the detailed reports,
ivhich natuirnlly I arn not in a position to do
in a moment, 1 ýwould say that the report
prepared by the engineering body would be
very largely technical, and to, get further information un the engineering phases of it
would mean eonstituting a new board of
engmne*i'.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: I think
the honourable gentleman hardly understands
îny question, which is this: fias this Advisory
Board made original investigations, or have
they simply digested the previous reports of
the other bodies?
lion. Mr. McDOUGALD: To a very great
extent they bave digested the reports of the
other bodies who were given the power to
get ail the information available. The Advisory Board had no authority to spend money
in travelling through the country and getting
evidencee, as watt suggested by my right honourable friend.
Rigýht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No, I did not
suggest that.
Hon. Mr. McDOUGALD: In conclusion, I
would like to say that as a Canadian citizen
hs
whlia rcsided on the hanks of the St. Lawronce ail his life, and in the last few years
has been intimately in touch with the great
inoiveOiet of trade and commerce throug-h
the port of Montreal, I fully appreciate the
gr-eat heritage which we have in that migbty
rivýer. I alppreciatc the value of it as a national
asL-ot,, and I for one would not ho a party te
a, recommendation or an agreement that
would give any of our birtbrights 10 the

FEBRUARY 2,1928
With reference to the -St. Lawrence waterway matter, living on the St. Lawrence
river as 1 do, I perhaps know something
about this question. I agree that the right
honourable member from Brockville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), the honourable Senator
who has just taken his seat, and myself,
probably know more than any member of
this flouse with regard to this matter.
The right honourable member from Brockville was Minister of Railways and Canais
for a number of years, and he had unýder
him a staff of engineers making surveys
and getting data on this great undertaking.
The honourable gentleman from Montreal
(Bon. Mr. Mcflougald) has not only lived on
the St. Lawrence during his whole life-time,
but, as Chairman of the Harbor Commission
of Montreal, hie has had an opportunity of
understanding .thoroughly everythibg in conneetion with navigation. Persons.hly, 1 know
alimost every foot of the St. Lawrence river
between PreScott and Monlireal, as a resident
on that river, and also because 1 hod the advaavtage of being Minister of Railways and
CanaIs for a f ew years.
Engineers have been investigating this
work for the last fifteen or twenty years.
The chief man on the engineering staff in
connection with the report that is now before
the Governmnent has made an investigation
with others each and every time that one
has been made for the last number of years.
Now, 1 have taken the position in this
flouse, and out of it, strongly in favour of
this proposition. People in Eastern Ontario.
and I might perhaps say also in part of
Quebec, have for many years suffered in
connection with power. In addition to that,
I have always believed that the proposition
would be of great value in the way of navigation, not only to Ontario but also to
other parts of Canada. That is why I have
favoured this scheme.
I take this position because I have before
me the joint report of engineers of the
United States and Canada, which was made
to each Government, and their recommendations as to what should be done. These men
were appointed early in 1920, and their
investigation occupied. fourteen months. One
of the engineers on that Board was the late
W. A. Bowden, chief engineer of the Department of Railways and Canais. fie had the
advantage of being one of 'the engineers
who were e1uiployed on this work for a
number of years before his promotion to
the position of Chief Engineer. The other
engineer on that Board was Colonel Wooten,
head of the Army Engineers in the 'United
States.
5610"-

I have before me the report of those
engineers and the recommendations they
made after their own investigations, and
after having the benefit of ail the investigations that had been made for years by
the best engineers in Canada and the United
States. That report, wbich was submit'ted
to me, would justify me in agreeing to and
urging this waterway plan. 1 could neyer
believe that there could bie any other report
that would vary to any extent the one
submitted by the engineers who had done
this great work; therefore I have taken the
position that I have stated, and will continue to hold it until I see the report that is
now before the Goveriiment. I had thought
that the report would have been submitted
to the members of both Houses in order
that we might give it consideration, because
1 cannot believe that this great question can
ever be railroaded through this House. We
must have tîme to consider it. That report
was handed to the Government two or three
weeks ago. It is confidential, and rightly so
until they can lay it before the flouse; but
I have read newspaper statementa as to
what that report contains, and that is why
1 now hesitate to say that I will support
a Bill based on that report until I see what
is in it.
Now I will state two or three reasons why
I hesitate. In the first. place, the report I
hold in my hand states that this waterway
can bie constructed ail the way from Prescott
to Montreal, and will develop 1,400,000 horsepower. That would mean 720,000 horse-power
for Ontario or for Canada, and 720,000 horsepower for the United States. Later on, if
we wished, other power could be developed
in the Province of Quebec as required, but
I
this 1,400,000 would be international.
believe that was not an unreasonable amount,
especially as 1 instructed Mr. Bowden, who
was on that Commission, to make his estimate so that there could bie no doubt as to
it being exceeded, even at war prices, and
he gave me his assurance that his figure would
cover it. But newspaper reports say that we
must wait, and though 1 do not know how
true they are, they have made me hesitate.
One statement is that instead of the cost
being $252,000,000 it is to be $650,000,000.
That is only a newspaper report, but if that
story is truc, of course I would hesitate to
approve of an expenditure of that kind at the
present time.
Another reason why I hesitate, and a very
important one, is the rumour that we will not
have in Canada, in the international part,
our lock and our power. In the report made

EWEVXE XDITION

SENATE
in 1921 by Mr. Bowdcn and Mr. Wooten they
laid out a plan which shows that t hese will
be aIl on our Canadian aide. We have now
a waterway from Port Arthur to Montreal
through wvhich a vessel can corne without
touching American water, except a f ew miles
abuve Brockville, and we have our own
Canadian channel that would require only
$100,000 to $200,000 to deepen, according to
Mr. Wooten, so that we cnuld overcome any
diffieulty at that point. 1 would flot stand
up and advocate the St. Lawrence route
unless. when the work is completed, we can
take a vessel front Port Arthur to Montreal
in Canadian waters, as we now do; but there
are only a few miles where that condition
exists that I mentioned, and we should flot
injure our position so far as those conditions
are concerned.
The honourable senior mernber for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has said that we should
have power to assist our agriculturists. That
is absolutely right. That honourable gentleman knows better than almoat anyone cisc
that in Eastern Ontario we have neyer had
any power, and wc could not hcelp our
farmers; so that Eastern Ontario is in a
worsc position than any other part of the
Province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Wbholly neg-lected.

powcr if this (lcvelcp)ment takes place, and
prcdictcd that our population would be incrcased very materially; but I arn not so
nptimistic about 5,000,000 horsepower being
used within the time that he mcntioned. I
suppose it is probably twcnty years since
power was first devcloped at Niagara. yet I
do ot tbink that in the whole Niagara district there is more than 800,000 borscpower
used, including the cities of Toronto and
Hamilton as wvell as other places. 1 therefore tbink that the policy laid down by the
late Mr. Bowden and Mr. Wooten wxas lIte
proper one 50 far as the devclopment of
power is concerncd-go right through with
vour waterway, help the people frnrn the
ýWest' lielp evcry part of the country. The
nbject w'as to bring coal fromt Sydney to
Toronto, and bring traffic uip and down to
and front Montreal, and thus lower the coat
of transportatin.
That should be the main
question so far as this watcrway is concerned;
but of course power is a very important
feature, and must be considered at the samne
t tme.

I amn just as strongly in favour of this
waterway scheme going tbrough as I ivas in
1921 and in 1924, provided that the cnnditinns
have flot heen changed to such an extent that
the ititerests of Canada, have been interfercd
with; but I agrcc with the right honourable
gentleman from Brockville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) that we should have ail the reports
with regard tn it before we should be asked
to conte tn a conclusion about putting this
plan through. The rigbt honourable gentleman fromt Brockvillc said in his speech that
the Government of Canada agreed to appoint
an advisory cornmittee, that they Ivere to
consider the report and make recommendations to nur Government, and the Amnerican
Government were to do the samne tbing, but
before the report xvas made to each Governmient both tliese advisory committees were
to mec't and con to a joint conclusion, and
that would go to both Gnverrnents. I think
that is what the honourable gentleman said.

Hon. Mr. REID: Wholly ncglccted; but
that is th(, rcason. We could bave had plenty
of power long ago if wvehad bccn in a position
to exercise our rights, or if the Goveroment
coiild interfcre with the development at Cedar
Rapids, whcre they have 60,000 horsepower,
aIl of which goes to the United States for the
purpose of giving light and power to their
citizens for many miles. It rnay be asked
why we allow that condition; but their charter was granted in the Province of Quebec,
and that Province could not force the C'edar
Rapids concern to bring their power to Ontario, as that would be interfering with the
rights of another province. 0f course, the
Province of LQuebec could take anmte action
and for-ce them to do it. I remember that
when we wvanted a little power in Eastern
Ontario the Cedar Rapids people absolutely

FEBRUARY 2,1928
Hon. Mr. REID: I understood the honourable gentleman to this extent: that the
Engineering Boards were to get together, but
they have neyer held a joint meetingRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, yes, but they
did flot agree.
Hon. Mr. REID: But they did flot meet
before submitting Itheir final report to bath
Governments.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My honourable friend did not get that fromn anything
I said, as hie will sec if he wîll read it carefuily.
I said that they had made a joint
report, but so far s the appendices were concerned they had flot heen su'bmitted ta the
C overnments befoare the American Advisory
Board made its repart.
The Canadian
Advisary Board waited until it got the full
report of the Joint Engineering Board, with the
appendices that conipleted the report.
Hon. Mr. REID: I do not want to misrepresent the honourable gentleman.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 know.
Hon. Mr. REID: This is what hie saidI will read it from Hansard:
Now, this is what I would suggest ta the Gavernmýent. The National Advisory Boa~rd was
appointed for a purpose. The Unitedl States
Government
kind-

appointed a Board of the samne

that is, an advisory board-with Mr. Hoover at its head; but--I say it
with ail respect--Mr. Hoover's camrnittoe made
a repart befare it had the repart of the joint
engineers in its entirety.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: With the appendices.
Hon. Mr. REID: That js what I mean.
There were two Engineering Boards, one for
the United States and one for Canada, but
these met together and formed a joint board of
investigation.
The respective National Advisory Boards, on the two aides of the line,

were absoiutely different, and they neyer met
together.

Perhaps I did not understand it aright, but
that is the statement ta which, I was referring.
I have kept the Hause much longer than I
expected.
There will be an opportunity at
a inter date ta take up this matter, but I
say that until we can get thoee reports before
us we shouid take no action.
The Government shouid go slow and âbould give us that
information, and if there bhs been eny
variation from the report made by those two
engineering committees there should he some
explanation offered to; justify it.
I desi-re ta
thank the House for giving me the opportunity

CONTROL OF WATER POWERS
REFERENCE

TO SUPREME

COURT

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire ta lay
upon the Table a certifled copy of a report
of the Committee of the Privy Council, which
reads:
Certified copy of a Repart of the Committee
of the Privy Council approved. by Ris
Excellency the Governor General on the l8th
January, 1928.
The Committee of the Privy Council have
had before them a report, dated 17th January,
1928, from the Minister of Justice, submitting
that at the Dominion-Provincial Conference,
held at Ottawa in the month of November,
1927, the Premiers of certain of the provinces
questioned the right of the Dominion to dispose
of water pawers brought into being by the
erection of Dominion works for the improvement of navigation, and asserted a right on
the part of the provinces ta dispose of any
such water powers within the limite of the
province; and
That in the discussion which followed
regarding this dlaim, and also with regard ta
the whole question of the division of legislative contrai over and praprietary interest in
water powers, it was found impassible ta reach
any general agreement as between the Dominion
and the provinces, and in the resuit a request
was made by the Premiers of Ontario and
Quebec that the Dominion undertake ta refer
the whole matter ta the Supreme Court of
Canada for hearing and consideration.
The Committee, therefore, on the recomnmendation of the Minister of Justice, advise
that, pursuant ta the pawers in that behaif
eonferred by section 60 of the Supreme Court
Act, Your Excelle ncy may bie pleased ta refer
ta the Supreme Court of Canada for hèaring
and consideration the following questions:
.1. Has the province any proprietary interest
in flowing waters within the province, an,
if so, what is the nature of such- interest?
2. Does the ownership by the province of the
bed of any stream, whether such bed be tevèl
or sloping, give te the province the ownerIhi1ý
of water powers:
(a) created thereupon by Dominion works
for the improvement of navigation; or

52

(b) existing thereupon by nature?
3. Has the province any proprietary interest
in or legislative control over:
(a) the canails, with lands and water power
conîected therewith. and the lake and river
inprovenents which were conveyed to the
iiominion by section 108, Schedule 3. of the
British North Aierica Act, 1867, or in or
over the disposal of any water powers created
thereby or existing thereupon from timne to
time; or
(b) water powers created by works for the
iniprovement of navigation constructed by or
under the authority of the Dominion since
Confederation; or
(c) works constructed wholly for power purposes by the Dominion out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for such puîrpose?
If so, what is the nature of such interest
or control?
4. Has the Dominion exclusive legislative
power to regulate waters foi the purposes of
navigation:
(a) in navigable waters; and
(b) in non-navigable waters?
5. Where the Dominion, for navigation purposes, expropriates or uses any part of the
bed of any streain vested in the province, is
the province entitled to any compensation for
such expropriation or use?
6. Has the Dominion the exclusive legislative
control over and proprietary interest in water
powers brought into being by works authorized
.y Parliament to be erected in an international
stream for the purpose of carrying out an
agreement between Canada and any foreign
country looking to the erection of joint works
for the improvement of navigation in such
stream?
If not, what are the powers and riglts of
the province with regard to such water
powers?
7. Wliere the bed of a navigable streain is
owned by the province or by a private
individual. is the title of such owiner subordinate to the public right of navigation, and
to the provisions of any statute whicl may be
enacted froin time to time by Parliament.

THE ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAY
PROJECT
RFPORT OF TUE JOINT BOARD OF ENGINEERS
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to lay
on the Table the report of the Joint Board of
Eigineers for the St. Lawrence Waterway project, with appendices, accompanied by plates
giving an outline of the work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to ask the
leader of the Governnent if any attempt was
made to bring about a meeting between the
Governments of the Provinces of Ontario and
Quebec and the Dominion Governrment with
a view to coming to some arrangement in regard to the waterpowers, instead of having the
mîatter referred to the Supreme Court. It
seemîs to me that some arrangement might be
corne to, thus avoiding the delay incident to a
reference to the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There have been
nuimerous discussions between the Provinces
and the Federal authorities, extending over a
consiýderable length of time, but no agreement
has come of them. I do not know whether they
were carried on in writing or orally, but I do
know that in the last conference with the Dominion ,Mr. Taschereau made a very clear
request that the matter be referred to the
Supreme Court. I an under the impression
now that the Prime Minister of Ontario joined
in that request, and it is upon that request
that the Dominion authorities have acted.
Hon. Mr. REID: I quite understand that
if esuch a suggestion was made, and no attempt
was made to settle the matter by arbitration,
it imust necû-sarily go to the courts.
But
what I tad in mind was that iperhaps the
iggestion liad been made and urged by one
of the three Governnents that they should
mueet and try to settle the matter in the way
that I telieve it could be settled satisfactorily.
It would save a great deal of time in proceeding withl tc work, and would save also
a great deal of money. These questions, in
which tc Governments alone are interested,
could probably be settled by arbitration if a
serious attempt were made.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND:

Well,

it

is

mainly a quîstion of the interpretation of the

clauses of the Constitution. It is of such vast
importance tht I fear tc contending parties
would not be satisfied unless their rights
were clarlv

dcfined by

the highest judicial

auiithority in the land, or by the Privy Council.
The provinces claim the waterpowers. and
the Federal authorities claim that they belong
wholly or in part to the Dominion of Canada.
Lt would be very difficult to arbitrate such a
iatter, which has a wholly juridical aspect.
I believe thtt it is one of those questions
tat bhae to be decided by a judicial tribunal.

Hop. Mr. BELCOURT: As Chairman of
the committee of last year, I might explain
that the committee presented a report.
Honourable gentlemen will remember that 1
read it yesterday. It was on the Order
Paper for concurrence, but unfortunately prorogation took place before it was reached.
That i.s why no n4otice was taken of the
matter by cither the Public Works Department or the :Cabinet. Hence the necessity
for renominating the saine or another coinmittee ta deal with the mnatter.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAI'S SPEECH

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Sp.'ech at the opening of the Session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Little for an
Address ini reply thereto.
lion. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, may I at -once join in extending
a welenme t.o the hon-ourable gentlemen who
have recenty beoome associated' with the
Senate, and may 1 particularly congratulate
the two of them who participated in the proceedings of the first day hy mnoving an>d
Their work and
seconding the~ Address.
records have been commented upon by
previous speakers, and I shall therefore pass
on.
1 itntend ta be very brief in any reference
tao Imperial or internatioýnal relations. I will,
as my honatirable friend, the junior member
fromi Ottawa (Right Hotu. Sir George E.
Foster) suggested yesterday, absolve the Grovernmen-t s0 far as it is possible Vo do so, and
sQpeak very frankly my views with reference
ta subjects on which we are not in accord
wit.h the actioa1 they have taken. It would
be perhaps unwise to go ta the length suggesqted by my right honourable friend froin
Ottawa yesterday, of pouring the anoiniting
oul on too thickly, because the weather ie
cold and most members of the Govenent
are rather bgld-headed.
The hionourable gentleman Who mnoved the
Address stated in bis opening remarks that
toa much could not be said with regard ta, the
Diainund Jubilee which. was held last year.
May I in~passing make a few commente thereI think it was entirely fitting, it was

of Canada and of Canada's past, and

inspiring for the future, that the achievements
'both in peace and in war Êhould be brought to
the attention of the people as forcibly as they
were by the Diamond Juhbilee celebration. I
think very great eredit is due ta the right
honourable gentleman, the ex-Minister of Railways (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), who acted
as Chairman of the Jubilee Committee. The
arrangements were splendid, and the spirit
that prevailed Vroughout the celebrati-on and
the impression it made upon the people were
entirely in the direction of developing a
national sentiment and nation-al pride. It was
perfecetly right that aur people shouid lift up
their hearts in thanksgiving and ftheir heads
in ýpride because of the progress and achievements of Canada since 1867.
1 think, also, that the Government could
scarcely help celebrating in 1927 wvhen they
remem-bered the Gethsemane through which
they passed in 1926 and tJhe cross they had ta
carry for weeks and months during the long
investigation, and how when they were approaching their Calvary Vhey committed hanikari. To find themselves redeemed and ransomed, by the people 0f Canada, as they were,
must surely have been an occasion for great
rejoicing, and in their hearts and minds they
must have en'tered with en'thusiasm upon the
great project cd 1927. It reminded me a littie
of the hymn that I used to hear when 1 wau
a boy and scarcely able ta see over the back
of the seat in church. They used ta sing:
The year of Jubilee has corne,
Return. ye ransomed sinners, home.
Right Han. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: To continue for
a moment on the suhject of the Jubilcee mention can always fitting.ly be made of the

Just a word in
passing, with reference to international rellations. I shall be very brief on this point.
It bas been well covered by my honourable
friend who spoke yesterday. H1e deait with
it much more in dotait and rnuch more
effectivelv than 1 could hope to do. I desire,
however, to bring to the attention of the
Hou,,e and of the Government what I regard
,îs a very practical side of the question. We
have in this city a representative of the
Government of the United States, a dignified. (ourteous gentleman, who is carrying on
bis work without ostentation.

fiilly satisfied to reside in a dwelling which

had ex en authorized the sending of an
amnbassador to the United States the Government had purehased a $500,000 dwelling in
WVashington, which is said to have cost

.seems to me that Canada should ho careful

of embassies in ail the countries of the world,
because the cost is hiable to ho stupendous.
I thorouglily agree with my honourable friend
who spoke yesterday that the efforts of
Trade Commissioners skilled in their work
would do Canada far more goud thaîî could
ho donc by ambassadors.
J, have before me-I do net know whether
other honourable gentlemen have seen it or
flot-a photograph of the place where Cariada's representative will do his work in Paris,
tlîe new Canadian Legation. The photograph
is copyrighted by the Toronto Star, and
apparently it cannot ho published without
their permission. The building is situated
in the heart of Paris; it is five stories in
height, and is on the plan of what we sbould
caîl a flat-iron building, with balconies on
the front of each story, at the intersection
of the streets-a «wonderful place for the
Ambassador to presenit himself to throngs of
people who may want te hear about Canada,
1 presumne. Judging from the phetograpb, I
should think it likely that the cost would ho
equal te xvhat xve have already paid for the
Embassy in Washington.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend allow me?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Will my hionCertainly.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I visited the
place. It is simply one leased apartment on
the ground floor of that building.
Se my
honourable friend nee(l net be afraid of the
pirescrnt cost ef establishing a legation in
Paris.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I arn sure the
lieuse and the country will thank my honourable friend for the information, for it bas
been a matter of comment that the extravagance witli which Canada started eut te
furnishi embassies xvas hiable te lead us in
the direction of bankruptcy.
Lort what 1 have said ho sufficient for that
subjeet. I turri now to domestic matters,
whichi I regard as being- of much greater
importance te the humble peoOple, the everyday working people of Canada, than Imperia]
or international relations.
In business the method usually adopte-d
te ascertain results is to ýmake a comparison,
and it seems te me that if we are te measure
flie preýgress that Canada is making, a rofleetion on the past and a ceteparison with
the presenit wvill help us te reacb a proper
conclusion and ebtain a truthful picture. The
present Government have had the respensibility of carrying on the affairs of Canada
for seine six years past. It xvas impossible,

FEBRUABY 3,1928
and indeed unfair, to criticize tliem excepV
in discussing tlie principle and the anticipated
effect of measures tliat tliey brouglit down;
but no-w there lias been time to test some of
those measures wliicli were liailed ae being of
great benefit to Canada. The testing period
liaving paesed, it seems fair that we sliould
now refer* Vo tliem and bring tliem to the
attention of the flouse in order that we may
realize jugt wiat lias been tlie effeot of the
Government's policies and legislation.
Perhaps the most important and most vital
subjeot that affects ail the people is tlie
volume of trade and the quantiity of goods
tha-t Canada can produce in order that lier
people may have employment and prosper
as much as possible. It wa.s brouglit to the
attention of the Canadian Parliament some
tixne ago that tlie Government, proposed Vo
enter into, a reaty witb the Republic of
France, and it was stated that the proposed
provisions of that reaty wou'ld lie very beneficial to thLs country. France was Vo give
to Canada, and did give, preferential treatment on a nuier of articles; and Canada
was to give to France certain specific reductions on importe into this country. Sbortly
after the ink on tlie treaty was dry France
raised lier general tariff, wiping ouit the advanta-ges which Canada anticipated slie would
receive. I arn noV disposed to criticize the
gentlemen representing tlie Goveirnment that
made that treaty; I presumne tliey had confidence in the gentlemen with wliom tliey
were dealing; but apparently, for some reason
whicli suhsequently arose, France saw fit Vo
raise lier general tariff and take away the
advantage-s that Canada ýhad expected. The
Canadian part of tlie agreement being a
specific redudtion, there was no getting away
f rom its fui-filment, and tlie unfavourable
balance of trade in 1926, of 38,500,00, was
increased in 1927 to $13,500,000. Most of the
imports from France are in direct cosnpetition
wiVh similar Canadian products. This treaty
has been of real benefit to the Frenchi manufacturer and workman, and it lias been a
real blow to Canadian industry and Canadian
labour.
Trade agreements were made also witli
Australia and New Zealand. A great deal
of discussion oocurred, particularly in anotlier
flouse, relative Vo that proposed treaty, which
was urged by the Government and subsequently approved by Farliament. Now let
us see how it lias worked out. In 'the twelvemonth period ended in November 1926 we
expoirted to, Australia $18,300,000 wortli of
goods, and in 1927 we exported $16,984,000-a drop of approximately $1,500,000. We imiported from Australia in 1926, under this

55

treaty, $4,353,000 worth of goods, an.d in 1927
a total of $7,785,000. The balance of trade
in favour of Canada lias thus been reduced in
one year f rom fouiteen to nine millions, and
further, by reaison of a clause in that treaty
wherreby Canada agreed to raise the duty on
dried fruits against ail other countries of the
world, the Canadian consumens have in the
last year paid $1,500,000 in additional duties
on that particular commodity for the benefit
of Australia, ithougli very little, if any, of
the goods came from Australia at all.
The same features were extended to New
Zealand, which, as we ail know, enjoys its
summer while we have our winter. New
Zealand is to a very large extent a dairying
country, and I may say that the Government
are fully aware of the mistake that was made,
for New Zealand butter and other dairy products have corne into competition with Canadian farm products to sucli an extent that
the farmers of Vhis country have raised their
voices in protest.
Now, let us see what liappened Vo New
Zealand trade. In 1926 we exported Vo New
Zealand 315,401,000 worth of Canadian goods,
and $12,006,000 worth ini 1927-a drop of
$3,400,000. We imported from. New Zealand,
in 1926,33,874,000 worth, and in 1927,$5.563,000
wortli, and the favourable trade balance of
$11,500,000 was reduced Vo 36,500,000 with New
Zealand, the worst feature of ahl being that
the imports to this country have seriously endangered the Canadian dairy industry.
Hýon. Mr. BELCOURT: May 1 ask what
kind of goods were included in those imports
and experts?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 0f course, it is
impossible to give my honourable friend a
detailed statement, but our experts to Australia and New Zealand Vo a considerable extent were manufactured goods sucli as newsprint, automobiles, etc. I think it is true
Vo say, in furtlier answer to my honourable
friend's question, that Australia lias raised lier
tariff on automobiles to sucli an extent that
Canadian-manufactured cars no longer go
there in large quantities. As a result, our
export of automobiles iast year fell by $4,530,000, which is a furtlier incident that miglit be
mentioned in connection witli tlie Australian
treaty.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How about New
Zealand?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The same applies. Trade agreements have also been
entered juto witli tlie West Indies, which. is
nearer homne, looking to the encouragement
of trade. There were delegations, confertnces

56

SENATE

and banquets as well as forecasts of steamship subsidies, ship-building programmes, etc.,
looking to trade extension. What have the
results been? Quoting from the Government's
figures for one year, we find that a trade
balance of $500,000 favourable to Canada bas
been turned into an unfavourable balance of
$1,500,000; and, in addition, Canada is proposing to subsidize a line of steamships, the
cost of which will be roughly $2,000,000 a
year when the line is established, to carry on
that trade.
These, honourable gentlemen, are but samples of a number of treaties with other countries that might be mentioned, but these are
of outstanding importance, and were brought
before Parliament and diseussed here. Now,
in the light of experience and with the knowledge of what bas occurred, we say to the
Government that we do not think that their
experiments in the line of treaty-making have
been a very great success, or have resulted in
very great benefit to Canada.
Now let us turn to another subject, that of
taxation. Nearly seven years ago the present
leader of the Government, who was then
leading the Opposition, very violently attacked
the Government of that day because of what
he termed extravagance and misgovernment.
Indeed, to quote his words: the former administration was "full of intrigues and deceptions, full of broken pledges and shattered
ideals, of lost visions, of vanished faiths, and
contain the seeds of a nations decay." That
was the utterance of the leader of the present
Government, in the Session of 1921, respecting
the former Government which, during the
five-year period from 1917 to 1921 inclusive,
had collected from the people of Canada
$1,412,000,000 in taxes, and out of those collections had carried on the ordinary government of the country, and in addition thereto had paid $184,000,000 of the war obligations
out of current revenue.
That performance of a preced'ing Administration having been very d'istasteful to the
then leader of the Opposition, it might be
supposed that when given the opportunity
to govern, in view of the promises that were
made of retrenchment and economy, reduction of debts, reduction in the cost of living,
and all the rest of it, at least some of those
things would have been brought into effect.
But what has happened in the last five years?
Perhaps honourable gentlemen may be familiar
with the fact, or perhaps they may not have
had time to look it up; but the fact is that
during the five years following the date when
the present Administration came into power,
that is, from 1921 to 1926, they collected from
Hin. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the people, the sum of $1,623,000 000, that is,
they took from the pockets of the same
people, during a similar period, $211,000,000
more than had been taken by the Government that they condemned.
Now, one might suppose that at least that
$211,000,000 would have gone towards defraying the public debt. The war was over
three years before they came into power.
But what do we find? That on the date the
present Government assumed office the net
debt of the Dominion of Canada was $3,197.690,000 while on June 30th, 1926--the date
the Government committee hari-kari-the
debt was $3 ,2 88, 7 5 7 ,000-an increase of nearly
$100,000,000, with $211,000,000 more collected
in taxes. Yet we find this situation from the
Government's own record.
It is difficult to understand the reasoning
of our Finance Minister when on August 8
he made the statement that be had re'duced
the interest on the public debt by $10.000,000.
The interest payments by the Finance Minister on the public debt in the year 1921-22
were $169,723.000, and for the fiscal year 192526, for the same purpose, the interest account
loan paid by the same Finance Minister was
$171,471,000; so we sec that, notwithstanding
the tirade of criticism and condemnation that
was hurled at the preceding administration
by the present Government, and all their
promises that were made to mend matters,
that this, roughly, is the result.
But we shall be told: "Ah, but see the prosperity that has come to the country; look
at the expansion in trade; certainly we must
have an increase in revenue and taxation
because of the expansion in trade." Now,
let us look at that question for a little while.
Has there been any real expansion in trade?
I picked up a newspaper the other day and
saw the annual report of the Canadian Bank
of Commerce, one the largest and soundest
institutions in Canada, and the gentlemen
who presented the Board's report said, among
other things, that our surplus of exports over
imports was reduced from 8400,000,000 in 1926
to $236,000,000 in 1927, which is a drop of
$164,000,000 on our export trade in one year,
and is more than one-third of the total surplus of 1926.
I notice also by the monthly publication
issued by the National Revenue Department
that for the nine months of the present fiscal
year the money actually received from tax
collections exceeded the receipts of 1926 by
$14,458,000. One would expect that there must
have been an expansion in business to
warrant an increase in taxation, but, with a
drop of $164,000,000 in our export trade, our

FEBRUARY 3, 1928
people were taxed $14,000,000 more than they
were the year before. 1 have some difficulty
in associa.ting myseif with the general
enthusiasm over our passing through a time
of piping prosperity.
We find, also, that Canadian imports have
vastly increased for the nine months' period
just closed, judging f.romn the -National
Revenue Department's own record. The
increase in imports entered for consumption
for fine months of this fiscal year was
85W,000,000 -as compared with last year. In
other w&rds, we are purchasing from abroad
the produet of labour in other lands to the
extent of $56,000,000 more than we did a year
ago; and this in the face of factories that are
capable of producing those goods, and unemployed workmen waiting for an opportunity
to manufacture those goods if our own
country. We also exported $33,819,000 worth
less of goods to other countries of the world
than we did in 1926.
New, with our exports to other countries of
the world dropping by $33,000,000; with our
increased imports and purchases-our money
going out of the coun'try to the exýtent of
$56,000,000 more than during the previous
corresponding fiscal period; with the taxation
of the people in creased by $14,000,000 in nine
months, I ask, in ahl sincerity, where is the
prosperity which is so flippantly heralded
broadcast through the country? Is it not truc
that during the time that the peuple were
looking up, inspired by hope for the future
because of the achievements of the past, the
G overnment of the country was simply taking
a littie over a million a.nd a haîf dollars a
month out of the pockets of the people more
than they did the year before, and the
people's incomes were being decreased?
Let me refer to what I regard as a very
true barometer of national trade, that is,
transportation. If goods are produced they
are transported cit-her to home markets or
te foreign markets, and when that occurs
transportation reports and records show the
effeet -of it. Now, what do these records
show? We have heard it said durîng the
last few days that the gross earnings of
the railways were slightly increased and
their net earnings substantially reduced. The
Prime Ministeir himself said that this was
due to the decrease in rates and the increase
in wages. Just in .passing I wish to repeat a
statement I made isat year, that to-day on
the average, railroad employees. in Canada
a
are receiving a littie over M20 year less per
capita than the same employees receive in
the United States, and the American railroads
are enjoying rates which enable them te pay
their efmployees a more reasonable and
adequate wage.

5

Coming back to the basis of comparison,
what is our comparable situation in the
matter of railway traffle, in reference to the
transportation of goods which Canada has
produced? In the year 1922, the year this
Government came 'into power, all 'the
Canadian railways ýtransported 108,530,000 tons
of freight. In the year 1925, which ib the
last year on record-because honourable
gentlemen will know that the 1926 reports do
not come out until the Year Book of 19j27 is
published-the railroads handled 109,850,000
tons, or an increase of a little over one million
in four years. Now let us hark back a little,
and see what has been the development in
our volume of transportation in years gone
by. In 1900 our railways handled 35,000,000
tons of freight; in 1918-19, 127,000,000 tons
cfl freight; and in the year 1925, 109,000,000
tons.
Was it not
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
larger in 1923 and 1924?
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 am glad my
honourable friend asked that question, because
I1did not want to burden the record with too
mnany figures. In 1923 the amount was 106,000,000 tons, and in 1924 118,000,000 tons;
therefore the record of 1925 is 9,000,000 tons
less than 1924; and if my honourable friend
will refer te another record which is just out
to-day, distributed by the Bureau of 8tatistics, he will find that for the month of
November alone the quantity of freight
handled over Canadian railways was 37,000
tüns less than it was in the month of
November a ycar ago.
They
What do these figures indicate?
indicate that the goods are flot being produced
for transportation, and thait we are not cx
panding as we ought. The average normai
expansion in transportation and in trade from
1590 to 1921 was seven'per cent per year. I
leave honourable gentlemen to estimate what
the expansion has been since 1921.
.Let us refer now te another point, te alI
the new equipment that bas been put on our
railroads to accommodate passengers. Thousands of passenger cars, as palatial as any
that are to be found in the world, are
travelling back and forth across our transcontinental lines, and yet in 1925 our railways
handled, aîl told, 41,458,000 passengers, whîch
was 5,0,000 less than travelled on our roads
in 1013. That does flot justify this hilarious
wave of enthusiasmn in reference to the great
expansion of business.
Let me point out another fact, however,
which in my opinion tells the story, and is a
vital point. In 1920, according te the Government's ewn record, there were 185,177
Canadian citizens, or people residing 'nt

58

SENATE

Canada, employed on our Canadian railroads,
while in 1925 there were 166,027, a reduction
of 19,150 men employed in one branc of our
National activities alone-a decrease et 19,150 in four years.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Has the honourable
gentleman any statistics in reference to the
growth of motor travel generally, and motor
bus business particularly, showing how far
these may have interfered with the reports
which he gives of the progress of the railroads? That mode of travel has appeared in
recent years, but in 1913 there was none of it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
So far as I
know no government, Federal or Provincial,
hais any record of that volume of traffic. ln
answer to my honourable friend, I will say
that I do not believe that the number of
passenger trains doing the daily business of
tht country to-day is one per cent less than
bcfore the auto business came into existence,
but the cars are travelling only party filled.
One other point. I have shown that there
are 19,000 fewer employees in this one of our
activities, but in 1920 the wages that those
men earned Lmounted to $290,510,000. Railway men are just like everybody else: they
spend probably ninety cents out of every
dollar they earn, maybe more, to purchase,
first, the necossarics of life, and second, comforts for themselves and their dependents.
But in 1925, those same railway employees
reeeived only $237,755,000 for their services;
thus there %visa reduction in the purchasing
power of that one class of publie servants by
$52,000,000 a year. Now, if goods are not
produced, if they are not transported, if the
number of men employed in the manufacturing and transportation industries of Canada
are decreasing by thousands, how in the
world can we intelligently satisfy ourselves
that we are enjoying national prosperity?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Industries seei
to be employing a greater number of men
this year than before.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am glad my
honoura;ble'friend has menti-oned that point.
There is in existence a system whereby it is
suggested that the Government has information as to the state of unemployment. During
the time I had the honour to be Minister of
Labour, that system was inaugurated with a
view to getting all the information possible
on the subject, and we had, at that time, the
co-operation, of the employers in Canada te
a very marked degrce-at least 30 per cent
more of the employers were co-operating with
the Government than now, judging from the
number that are reported. It may be that
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the industries are not there, that they have
been closed. But the manufacturers reporting
to the Government number roughly twothirds of those who were reporting six years
ago, and those who are reporting indicate
ihat there is no more unemployment to-day
than there was six years ago-indeed, at this
season of the year the unemployment
situation is not quite so bad as it bas been
in the past. But what has happened during
these six vears?
Rougily 10,000 Canadians
a monti have exiled themselves fromn this
country in order to earn a livelihood; therefore there is net the unemployment that there
would be, if we had all our citizens here.
It has been said that we have a great
expansion in trade. Taking the same report
of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, we find
that in 1927 the exportation of Canadian
products of the farm was $77,000,000 less than
it was in 1926. The report gives this informaton in detail by commodities.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Mainly grain.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The details are
as follows: wheat, $29,000,000; oats, $11,000,000; flour, $10,000,000;
butter, $2,000,000;
cheese, 86,000,000, hay, $2,000,000; apples,
.2,000,000; cattle, $5,000,000; ham and bacon,
810.000,000; making a total decrease in the
value of farm products exported of $77,000,000.
Lunmber products exported showed a decrease
of $8,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: How does the price
compare with that of the former year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have net that
information before me. My honourable friend
will probably address the House and can give
tiat information if he has it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I have not got it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the price
of wheatiwas quite equal to that of the
previons year.
We find a decrease of $4,216,000 in the value
of automobiles exported, due, chiefly, to the
reason referred to a moment ago-the Austrahan situation. But the last attack that was
made on the tariff of Canada, touching automobiles in particular, touched the Canadian
manufacturer net only of automobiles but of
the parts that go into them, and as a result the
increase of automobiles imported into Canada
last year over 1926 amounted te $12,400,000,
of goods that might have been manufactured
here. Let me add that the drop in the price
in the United States was practically equivalent
to the drop in Canada, and it would not have
ruade a bit of difference if the tariff had been
left alone. The reult probably would have
been practicilly the same.

itself upon the back and holding jubilees, they
will seek to put their house in order and look
after their own business, and to adjust matters
to bring about results comparable to those that
Canada enjoyed in the days of prosperity in
years gone by.
I have burdened the House at too great
length already, but I desire to say a word
more touching the immigration question.
Science and invention are daily narrowing the
field of employment for labour. In inverse

solved by increasing the importations of
manufactured goods from other lands where
lower standards of wages and living exist.
High standards of living must be maintained
in Canada, or the emigration of Canadian
born citizens will continue to grow. Replacing them by the importation from continental
Europe of those who will work for a lower
wage and live upon a lower plane can only
make the situation worse. The ultimate aim
and hope of most of such immigrants is to
cross some day the border-line into a country
which they are now unable to enter. Such sojourners do not make good Canadian citizens,
nor do they help to build a Canadian citizenship. The cumulative effect over a period of
years of this migration of Canadians to the
United States, and the replacing of them by
continental Europeans whose only desire is
to get across the boundary if opportunity
permits, is not encouraging to the standard
of citizenship or the national spirit that ought
to exist in Canada, and the cumulative effeet
of twenty-five years of this practice will be
disastrous. Now, honourable gentlemen, I
am not a pessimist. I believe that these
things are all capable of correction; but I
believe that Canada has enjoyed a degree
of prosperity in spite of and not because of
its Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I hope the
majority of the people are in a happier mood
than my honourable friend.
Hon. JOHN S. McLENNAN:
Honourable gentlemen, I shall take only a few
minutes. I am conscious, in putting before
you the thoughts that have been running
through my mind during this debate, and
prior to it, that what I have to say will 'be
rather an anticlimax to some of the speeches
to which we have listened, and certainly there
will be no great vivacity on my part until
I have digested the figures which the honourHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

able gentleman who has just proceeded me
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) bas presented to us.
The line of the argument that I desire to
make is somewhat similar to that followed
by one or two speakers who have preceded
me, namely, that a great deal too much
attention bas been given to this question of
immigration-of bringing people into this
country. Once the people in this country
are prosperous and happy there will not be
the slightest difficulty in getting others to
come here, and in keeping them bere. It is
a by-lane, a blind alley, that we are travelling, and it seems to me that all the attention
that is being given to the question of merely
increasing our population will not make our
immigration all that we want it to be, and
will not keep here those who may bc
attracted to our shores. It seems to me that
the prosperity of the people of the country is
of vastly greater importance than the number of people. A population of one million
living comfortably and earning a surplus will
make a better country than a population of
a million and a quarter with only the saine
productive power.
In the course of some remarks which I
made last Session I illustrated the truth of
that principle, as I conceived it, by some
figures about Prince Edward Island, showing
thiat though in the twenty years ending at
the time of the last Census, in 1921, the
population of the Island had decreased by
about 15 per cent, yet the earnings in the
Island per capita were three times greater
than they were at the beginning of the period,
in 1901.
I think that the same principle
applies throughout the country.
We have, it must be remembered, great
natural resources and a very elaborate system
of transportation. We can produce far more
than will be absorbed by the home market
in, say, the next decade, however great may
bc the increase in population. In order to
keep our industrial enterprises busy and provide adequate business for our transportation
system we unquestionably need to increase
our production, particularly our manufacturing
and industrial output and our exports. We
have a volume of exports which is very
creditable, considering the population of Canada, but a large proportion of our exports
are not sufficiently advanced from the raw
state to give the utmost income to our people.
We must increase not only the volume, but
also the value, by sending out finished products rather than raw materials. In studying
and devising means whereby our production
may be increased, the country made more
prosperous, our people kept bere and other

DIVORCE

BILL (ONTARIO)

THIRD READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of Bill A, an Act to provide in the
Province of Ontario for the dissolution and
the annulment of marriage.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
Honourable
gentlemen, wben a Bill somewhat similar to
this was before us for consideration a couple
of years ago, I took part in the discussion and
dealt with it purely and exclusively from the
point of view of natural and cjivjl law.
At
that time I carefully abstained from obtruding religiaus or sentimental views of any kind,
and on this occasion I intend to confine myself in the samne manner.
I may at once say that I amn not labouring
under any delusion that the observations
which 1 am about to offer are going to make
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

63

one single convert to my view in this Huse.
If that were my purpose in making these
observations, I would not make themn at ail;
but I think it my duty to do su, not, because

of the convictions which I hold-convictions
which 1 know are shared by a great many

honourable gentlemen who are not Roman
Catholies, who, sit with me in this House.
I think practically all Catholies of Canada,
whether Roman or Anglican, share with me the
views that I hold upon this subjeet.
In order that my observations may be as
brief as possible and that 1 may net weary
the House, I have reduced to writing my
views from the legal aspect, and with the
permission of the bouse 1 will read this
epitome of what seem to me to be the
principles which must govern the matter of
divorce.
Before reading this summary 1 desire to
point out that there is apparently no demand
for this legisîstion. The public press bas
nlot mentioned the subjeet at aIl. We have
no way of ascertaining what is the public
opinion in the province of Ontario, to which
týhis Bill will exclusively apply. Whether a
Bill of this kind is desired or not is a matter of
mere guesswork. I had expected that the
opinion of the province would have been aseertained through the Attorney General, Who
would have been in, a position, to a certain
degree at aIl events, to Jet this bouse know
just what is the state of public opinion or
public feeling in Ontario with regard to this
jurisdiction being conferred on our provincial
courts. 1 am sorry that nothing of that kind has
been done. It might have served as a guide
to mysaîf and to others.
This is the resumné. I desire to read it, because I think every word counts, and I could
not be very sure of giving every word frorn
memory.
There is no obligation on the part of Parliament under the B.N.A. Act to hear or grant
applications for divorce, or to confer such
jurisdiction on the courts.
May I interpolate here that I quite understand the attitude of the honourable gentlemen who sit on the Divorce Committee, and
I heartily sympathize with their desire to
get rid of the business of 'hearing: applications for divorce. I do not think that is the
proper function of this Legisîsture or any
other, and I amn sorry that my attitude must
be in opposition to the legitimate desire of
honourable senators to be relieved of the
necessity of giving so much time te the hearing of divorce evidence. I can imagine how
wearisome and uninteresting the duties of a
mexuber of the Divorce Committee must be

SENATE
Diverce is net a natural or logýical fuinctien
et any legislature. It is the duty of legisbitures te maintain, net te disrupt, contracts.
Divorce is a violatien et the vested rights
ef society, family and home. Therefore it
is contrary te civil law, as it destroys rights
which have been legally acquired and which
cannot be compensated for in any way or in
any degree.
This Bill woulýd confer a jurisdiction which
is diametricahly epposed te the logitimate
fonctions of civic tribunals, whose fundamental function is the maintenance, net the
destruction, of contracts. The Bill dees net

who would bc gravely injured.

cause we may have one in Japan, I do flot
believe we need either of those; I hold,
however, that we do need to be represented
in British counjtries, flot by ambassadors who
are part of the empire, but by trade ernmissioners who can secure us ail reasonable
trade advantages.
I trust 'that honourable gentlemen wil
undersgtand that in rnaking these remarks now
I arn not trying to usurp the functions of my
honourable friend on the other side.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend did flot refer to the Paris relations.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I say we need trade
'relations witb France, but we have a man
there whom. I know personally, and I believe
that in everv way Mr. Roy bas shown hirnselif
capable, and I arn proud of the work be has
done. Hie wus a good servant to ail of us
during the war; he was kindiy and friendly.
I arn not saying that I could not select somebody in the world wbo would make a more
trained ambassador than he is, but on taie
other hand, even if I did, I might tread on
somnebody's toes, and I do not wisb te do that.
I ýcongratulate the leader of this flouse on
the great honours he brought to tbi 's Chamber,
and this country, as the result of his iast
visit to the other sida, and I arn very giad
to tbink that this flouse is bon'oured by his
appointment wbich is a credit not oniy to
hirn and bis friends but te the people of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, migbt I be ailowed to interrupt
the proceedings in this Ohamrber to state that
in Marcb, 1905-1 was Speaker of the Senatewith Sir Mackenzie Boweil I attended the
inaugural ceremonies when Mr. Roosevelt was
sworn in as President for the second tirne.
The Senate of the United States, on that
ocasion, adopted a unanimous resolution exte-nding to us the courtesies of the Senate,
inciuding the privileges of the flocir. We
highly appreciated this privilege and this
honour. The Canadian Senate has ne such
procedure or tradition. I may say on its
bebaif tbat when mnen of distinction býonour
us with a visit, as we are honoured to-day by
the presence of the Secretary of State of the
United States, the Hon. Mr. Kellogg, our
doors are thrown, wide open to welcome theni.
The Senate is happy indeed to greet Mr.
and Mrs. Kellogg within its precincts.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Henourable gentlemen, I arn very mu-eh pieased to hear the
rernarks made by the honourable, Senator from
Aima (Hon. G. G. Foster) who has just
taken*bis seat, because it indicates tbe new
5610"15

67

spirit that I hope is coming over the country,
and tbat is sornewhat reflected in this flousethat we aIl appreciate tbe prosperity that
this country is enjoying, and we are net
ashamed to acknowledge it.
Wdhen, tbe right honourable the junior
Senater for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster), began bis speech on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, I
tbought we had arrived at the political
mililennium in this Chamber, if not in the
country. The right he*
noumtble gentleman
began his address by saying that the a-tnisphere cf this flouse lent itiseif te a calmer
and more judicial consideration of the great
questions cf national and international import
before the country than did the atmosphere
cf the other flouse; that, because cf this
fact, and because cf the ripe experience and
practical knowledge of many of the Senators,
this Bouse sh-ould give a lead te the Government in ish poiicy and in its administration
by way oi constructive criticisrn and helpfui
suggestion that would bring desirabie results.
As the right honourable Senatopr proceeded
with bis address on our national affairs I rnust
franidy say that I was disappointed.
The
speeeb, to my mind, iacked the elements
wbich the rigbt honeurable gentleman himself
said it sbould possess, namely, constructive
criticism. and helpfui suggestion. The criticisrn
was miid enougb, but it was tee general te
be constructive or helpful, and When I tried
te get the honourable Senator te be more
specifie, ha declined ýte answer my questions,
or te, commit hirnseif.
The speech was weli phrased and welI
delivared, and when iV referred te or international affairs it was serieus enough te be
impressive; but was it? The right honourable gentleman szeems, te think that the poiicy
cf the Goverument and -the policy of the
Liberai Party is te gradually weaken and
finaily sever the tics of Empire, and thie
Commonwealth bonds cf the British nations
-and I was sorry te hear the honourable
Senator from Welland giving voice te
similar ideas--I venture te assert that nebody in Canada agrees with them, except a
f ew old ladies of both sexes, and a few political partisans, who consider such stuif good
party ammunition. Is it net time we got rid
cf such antiq-uated chiidishneas? In the past
the Conservatives won some eleetions by the
use cf such propaganda, and apparentiy the
eider men ameng them cannot get rid cf the
idea that the promulgation cf such views is
etiil g<od party policy. I sinoerely believe
that yeung Canada bas ne use f or such party
warfare.
I siinceraly believe that young
Canadians cf every enigin are tee busy build-

iigl np) a greatt nation on the northiern baif of
this North American continent to believe for a

the other haif, and to disrupt the commercial,
political and fraternal ties that hold together
this commonwvea1th of nations, and whicb are
as (lear to, the henart of every red-blooded
man and womnan in Canada as is life it.self.
The retention. of suoh icicas, and from tiie
to timie t.heir iteration, indicate grent povcrty
of vision, and show bow bard it is to discard
early prejudices.
The honourable Senator from Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Pope) delivered one of the first speeches,
if not the first, on the subjeet we are now
diseii.sing. The bonourable gentlemnan speaks,

protectionists.
know be is dogmatie; but here 1 wish to say,
if I may, tbat doitmatism is not always proof
of accuir:cy or tboughtfuiness. Let me illustrate. The bonourable gentleman made the
astounding statement that the Goveroment
of the U-nited States wculd build the St. Lawrence wat.erways, for us, "as wc say, where we
saLy, ,,nd wben we say, free of cost to the
poQp1e of Canada." 1 verily believe the honourable gentleman is too good a Canadian to
cntertamn sucb a tbought for a moment, or
give currency to sucb an idea, if be bad given
the subjeot any consideration at ail.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I am not too good a Canadian to use Yankee uîoniey for the benefit of
tbe Canadian people; 1 will say tbat.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The bonourable gentleman spoke witbout tbinking. Let me give
another illustration. The bonourable gentleman t.old us that unemploymnent here is greater
than in the United States. In other words,
there are more persons, coimparatively speaking, unemploycd in Canada than in the
United States. Woclf, this is anotber statement that lacks the essential element, and I
was glad to bear a Senator fromi his own side
of the House, the honourable Senator from
Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson), correct bim.
But more correction is not enougb. Under
the circumstances, I think I sbould give the
officiai figures to the House. Here tbey are,

The above tables show that the emnployinent situation in Canada, as conipared with

I now wisli to mrake a feu' observations on
the speech delivcred by the Honourable
Senator for Welland (Hou. Mr. Robertson),
any respects a rcmarkabie
was inii
wii
utterance. 'lhle bonourable gentleman seems
to possess tlie faculty of painting any subjeet
in the colour tliat suits bis views for the finie
beuîg,' anti lte man who coulci make the last
annuai stateînent of the Caniadian Bank of
Commerce tbe text to prove that Canada is
now in a bad wvay commercially, and that
tue outlook for the future is dark indeed,
must bave rem.arkable ability in bis eown fine.
Whv, Job in ail lais afflictions and Jeremiah
in his Lamentations, were veritable Mark
Taplcys in comparison witb the bonourable
senator from Welland.
Allow me, honourable gentlemen, to read
a few sentences fromn the speeches of the
Generai Manager and the President of the
Bank at the annual meeting referred to, and
you will thon sec wliat a powerful imagination our honourable colleague must possess.
Here are a few sentences froa flie closing
remarks of the Generai Manager of the Canadian Bank of Com-merce, at the annual meeting:
Iu conclusion-tue general business situation
is sotntî, the purchasing power of the people
of Canada is greater than it lbas ever been
before, andi the developmuent of the natural resources of the country proceeds apace. These
conditions miake for prosperity, and the generai
fraie of mmiid of tlic public is genîîinely optiîiistic.

Titis creates an ideal atmosphere

for

future progress. and, if we wvill buit give painstahing attention to otîr business and avoid ex-

FEBRUARY 7, 1928
casses such as overtra(ling or speculation, we iu
Canada eau face the future wjtb confidence and
certainly look fnrw'ard to another year of prograss and prosperity.
Now a faw sentences from the closîag observations of the Presideat of the samne institution, on the samne occasion:
The water-shed of North America, whicb lias
within Canadian territnry, has been tappad to
supply cheap power in enormous volume. From
a vast expanse of arable land thora bas beau
craated an agricultural estate which supports
over 3,000,000 people in a state of weIl-being
that is unexcelled elsawhere.
Adjacent to forests comprising nearly haîf of
the wnrld's most valuable soft wood area, several
thousand milîs have been erectad to provide
annually lumber worth about $125,000,000, and
to furnish over one-third of the world's supply
of newsprint. Some of the richest mines in
recent timas have bean davelnped along narrnw
stretches of what is now regarded as one of the
greatest minerai fields kuown. More than 20,000
inanufacturing plants have bean built to produce
gonds valuad annually at $3,000,000,000. Our
currency systemn and our financial institutions
bave been developed along the souudest lines,
affordiug a flexible monetary and credit systam,
available aven in the most remote hamiets. Our
laws have so been framed that the primary
rights of every citizen, aven the humblest subjeet, are raspected, and it is open to every one
to acquire wealth and to ratain it against illegal
aggression. And 120 counitries have learned of
the quality of our products, and now purchasa
them each year to the value of over $1,000,000,000.
We bave passed the stage of frontier life, for
we have reached a high and enviable position in
the world's economie organization, we have living
conditions that suit ahl classes nf people, aven
thosa of the most fastidious tastes, and we stil
possess physical assats which ara coiiutad upon
to supply the world with a large shiare nf its
essential requiremants. We must continue to
work bard and we should refrain from iîndue
speculation. because wa shall have new problems
to solve, arising from difficulties wbich will beset
even a country andowad with ail the material
gifts it could. raasonably dasira.
If we continue to apply oursalves as earnestly
as in the past. and maintain that spirit of unity
from which Confadaration was boru. Canada's
future 'will be revealad on a brighter page in
the next history of the world than is likely to
ha written of any othar country.
No wonder that bis colleague, the honourable gentleman fromn Sydney (Hon. Mr.
McLennan), who site near bima, said that the
figures and the speech of the bonourable
Senator for Wellnd so upsat bis nervous
syatemn tbat hae became almoat speechiess.
A faw yaars ago Dr. Tolmie, who was thein
organizer for the Conservative Party, told us
that the then leader of the party had been
an uiadertaker's assistant for anme years,
bence his attitude of mind and general outlook upon life. If the doctor's statement was
true and his diagnosis correct, the honourable
Senator for Welland must bave been general

69

manager in an undertaker's establishment for
many yaars. The honourable gentleman might
well exclaiRn with Hamiet:
The time is out of joint: 0 cursed spite,
That ever I was horn to set it right!
Mfter the effect which. the figures quoted
by the honourable Senator for Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) had upon the honourablc
Senator for Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan), I
hesitate to give any figures to the Housa',
yet, 1 believe I will have t.o take the risk
and quota some. Here they are, I wilI giva
our imports and expo-rts of raw materials, and
our imports and exports of manufacturad and
semni-manuf acturad gonods, for a considerable
numbar of years; but I will not weary you
with figures.
Our imports of raw materials rose fromn
$42,000,000 ia 1920 to $263,000,000 in 1927 or
practically 625 per cent. Our exporte of raw
materials during the samne period nf time rose
fromn $70,000,000 in 1920 to $578,000,000 in
1927, or practically 800 per cent. Now, let
us take the importa and exporte of manufacturad and partly manufactured goods, from
1920 to 1926 inclusive. Imports rose from
$129,000,000 ia 1920 to $676,000,000 in 1926,
or practically 525 par cent. Expor-te of the
saine classes of goods rose from. 398,00,000
in 1920 to $695,000,000 ia 1926, or practically
710 per cent.
These figures show the enormous development that bas taken place duriag the firet
quarter of this century, and thosa who are
in a position to i'ntelligenty forecast the future
say that our growth during the next quarter
wiJl ha stili greater. These figures also show
how steady and wafl-balanced this growth has
beau; that motwithstaading the enormous
expamsion in our agricultural exporte, which
are olassad as raw materials, our industrial
exports have undergone a similar expansion.
Our friands opposite sometimes admit that
our agricultural growth bas been very large,
but thev fraquently stata that our industrial
If
the
growth bas not beau satisfactory.
aboya figures prove anything thay prove the
falsity of these allegations.
Again, our friands opposite are very fond
of compariag Canada with the United States,
and always to the disadvaatage of thair own
country, in matters of Trada aad Commerce,
at aIl avents. I cannt for the life of me sea
any justification for this lina of conduct. We
ail agrea that agriculture is our basic industry,
that it ia, in a word, the foundation upon
which ail our other industries depead. Then
how doas this basic industry compare with
the sanie industry lu the United States I have
oaly to ask the question to get the answer.
We know that it comparas most favourably.

in regard ta the St. Lawrence waterway, ail

I do not profess to be an authority on the

as they appear ta me in relation ta it. We
have t.he St. Lawrence waterway, and we have

honourable member frorn Montreal (Hon. Mr.
McDougaid), who is Chairman of the Montreal Board d~ Harbour Commissioners, toid us
the other day that there are five million horsepower ta be deveioped some time, four million
of which are Canadian, and one million af
which belong ta the United States. I at once
say 1 amn in hearty agreement with the sentiments that have been expressed in regard ta
the resoiute 'holding hy Canada of ail lier

Lawrence and its incidentai benefits, shouid

say that in order that there may lie no daulit
-in regard ta wliere I stand on the subject.
At the sarne time tliere are other considerations which have been developed in týhis debate and which may lie reconciied with te
position that I have juat taken. The St.
Lawrence rails down from the Great Lakes.
The river and canais are a common highway
for the Canadian people and the people of
the United States. Sa far as I have been able
te ascertain, we have expended, or shail have
expended w'hen the new Welland Canai is
compieted, somewhere about $400,000,000 in
building the canais and improving the waterway. Canadian money haa done all that, and
the fact remains that after we have apent al
this rnone'y aur friends to the south, the
Arnerican people, have just the same rights
and privileges in using the river and canaIs
as have tlie Canadian people; and the Cana-

71

dian people suifer nothing in consequence. On
this aide of the House the other day it was
suggested by an honourabie gentleman who
ione d~ the oidest memrbers and lia long
experience and ripe knowiedge of publie affairs, that if it is desirabie to have the St.
Lawrence River and the canais deepened there
is an opportunity in the offing to have al
the work done, not at the expense of Canada
at ail, but at the expense of our co-partners
in the use -of the waterwa3P; that is, that the
American people would be perfectly willing
to corne over and spend their money on the
deepening of the river and the canais.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: And icave us the
power.
T-on. Mr. TANNER: That is what I understood-that for the sake of having a better
highway for themacives, and, I presume, of
deveIoping their own share of the power, they
wouid be wiiiing to make this large expenditure. I arn not giving this out; I arn simply
repeating the statement of an honourable
member who has large experience extending
back over many years, who has accesa, I believe, to sources of information as great as
those of any «other honourable member of this
House, if not greater, and for whose opinions
and statementa I have therefore a great deal
of respect.
On the other hand, it is said that that suggestion is altogether a dream. My right honourable frienil from Brockviiie (Right Hon
Mr. Graham), who is flot in lis seat at the
moment, undeptoak ta say that it was absurd,
or something to that effeet, and that if ever
the river and the canals are deepened and a
greater waterway made there it must be done
at the joint expense cf Canada and the United
States. My right lianourable friend from
Brockville may be rigbt, or lie rnay be wrong.
He lias had many years' experience in administration. I do net want ta say anything disrespectful ta hirn in his absence, but I arn
bound to say from my observation of his
public career that he was not always right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who la aiways
right?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Nobody. I arn bound
to judge lis opinion in this matter not oa
mueh by what lie said as by his reasoning ini
regard ta it, and if I rernember correctly lie
did liot reason it at ail. He disrnissed it
wi'tli a wave of the liand, and he advîsed the
Goverament not ta take any step without
gathering in a mass of information from
various angles, ta which lie referred. But a
short time afterwards the honourable reember
frorn Montréal (Hon. Mr. MeDougaii), wlio

72

SENATE

is on the Adx'isory Committee, frorn bis place
informed the right honourable member for
Breckville that aIl the information w'biea hoe
bad advised the Govereiment to gather in had
been before the Adx-i-ory Commiîtce xvcn
they made their report. In fact the bonourable member from Mentreal took thie enuire
underpinning away frem the argument of the
righit honourable menîber for Brockviilc. The
righit honourable gentleman wxas wrong theî'e,
and, as I say, bie mtîy bc wrong je the major
pr.opos.ition.
Now, what does it amnount to. after ail?
I am flot undertaking te sav that my honourable friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) is
wholiy right. H1e believes that hoe is righit.
There are 22 American States tint wint thie
righit of Nvay over the water. Tboy ivant a
great tîcal more than wc in Canada want. WVe
are flot se badly off just new. There is no
urgent need in Canada, but there is urgent
need in the United States, and anyone wbo
bas ever studied political inatters on tis
continent knows that tbere is geing te ho a
great deal more politicai urgenc 'v in thet
United States beforo iNovember 4. The presenit,
or tbo next few montbs. înav ho the very timie
wben our neiiburs te the seuth may be

FEBRUARY 7, 1928
Now, honourable gentlemen, I desire to say
only a few words in regard to the subject of
the natural resources of the Western Provinces. I arn pergonaliy in favour of the
proposition to transfer the natural resources
this year to the Province of Alberta, and
eventualiy to the other provinces.
I
mention the subjeet only for the purpose of
reminding the House that when those provinces were organized they were persuaded to
accept subsidies in lieu of the natural resources. They received special grants, as I
understand, to compensate them. Noýw, I
understand, they are to receive flot only the
natural resources, but also larger subsidies.
As I say, I mention this matter only for the
purpose of bringing that fact out and reminding the Huse that it is on record in the
Debates of the bouse of Commons on more
than one occasion that when the question of
natural resources in the western provinces
came to be settled new and fair consideration
should be given ta the rights of the other
provinces, particularly the provinces by the
sea. If the western provinces are given their
resources and additional subsidies, then the
whole subject will be opened, as it should be
opened, and fair treatment should be accorded
to the other parts of Canada.
I desire to refer to another subjeet which
is mentioned in the Speech frorn the Throne,
the question of the port on Hudgon Bay. It
appears that Churchill is to be substituted
for Nelson. I mention this not in order to
criticize, but for an entirely different purpose. Bath Governments, in 1896 and again
in 1911 and subsequently, settled an Nelson.
The torch of information in regard ta
Churchill was lit in the Senate. Although
both palitical parties in the House of Coinmans had agreed on Nelson, there were in
this Chamber some honourable members who
believed that Churchill wauld be the better
part, and I point out this fact in order that
credit may be given ta this Chamber, and
particularly ta aur late lamented calleague,
ban. George W. Fowler, who, it will be remembered, headed a Special Cammittee ta
investigate the subjeet. The Committee's
record and repart, I believe, farmed the basis
on which the Government of the day proceeded in its inquiry with regard ta the
subject of Churchill versus Nelson. I regret
that our ]amented colleague is nat alive taday ta see the fulfilment of his very earnest
and very successful work in amassing information that lias convinced the Government
on the respective merits of Churchill and
Nelson.
Honourable gentlemen, there has been a
good deal of discussion with regard ta what

73

are called E:mpire relations. I mention this
subi ect just for the purpose of making two
or three brief remarks. I am nat going ta
discuss the question of status. A great deal
lias been said and written on it. May I make
a general statement? I believe the public
mind was eanfused an that subjeet by the illadvised reparts of proceedings which went out
to the public when the Imperial Conference
had ended. Whether that was the fault af
the gentlemen engaged in the Canference
or of the newspaper press, certainly the flrst
impression on the public mmnd was that somns
great new thing had been created, same great
event had happened in regard ta Canada.
Ta-day we all knaw that nathing new was
created. My honaurable friend from Ottawa
(bon. Mr. Belcaurt) the other day made it
very clear that in lis judgment we are just
where we were in 1867 sa far as the law is
cancerned.
I want ta make anather general statement.
The statesmen and leaders of palitical matters
aver in England joined with the Canadian
leaders in expressing the decisians of the Irnperial Canference in very higih-saunding language. I think they meant aIl rigît, but I
dnterpret their attitude in this way, that the
time fias came in England when they feel,
and rightly feel, that in these Dominions we
must have the absolute cantiral of ail aur
affairs. We know that the feeling in England
ta-day is suaI that if this Dominian ar any
ather said ta the British Gavernment, "We
are gaing ta separate, and set up business for
ourselves," nat a hand would be raised in
England ta prevent. But they are desirous af
the cantinuity of the British Empire; and,
filled with that desire, they are prcpared ta go
any distance in making what appear ta lie
cancessians, or in setting the Dominions up
in 'business, or in extending the privilege and
pawers and autharitie6 of Dominion parliaments. They do not want far ane minute
ta 'be considered as standing in the way of
the develapaient of Dominion autharity, local
autharity. Consequently I say they know very
well that no -radical change at the basis las
taken place, but they join bande witl the
Canadian statesaien and say, "Go your awn
way; manage yaur own business and wc are
with you."
Now, out of all t.his inflation we are going
ta have ambassadors, and all tha;t kind of
thing. Well, like iny hanourable friend fçrom
Aima (Hon. G. G. Foster) I arn not in favour
of this ambassador business. I am not going
ta take up muai time in discussing it. I arn
firmly of the opinion that what we aIl profess and desire is ta perpetuate the British

\Ve have the posit ion, the history,
thec- hlood on which we build, but I arn
convinced that these will nlot suffice without

economie and tradc interests. XVe must learn

same blood, we must be of the same family as
traders; nlot that t'.e are going te cxclude
foreign busines 1)1t we must get together
and boilcl up empire trade. and convince each
otiet' that we are reall y useful to one another.
1 s'iv that tbis Conference w'ould have been
much better employed in discussý'iog that
fondamental malter, rather than in writing

Canada's Jubilee. Undoubtedly tbis country
litas made substantial progress during thie hast
ýsixty years. It would be a strange and remarkable lhing if il, did not, because we
bave the land, the sea, the lakes, the rivers,
the mines, the tiniber, and the greatest natural
tesources of tbe continent, and we also bave
Ille people. Therefore it would ho an astoîtnding thing if tbis country had flot made notable

I biad intended t0 make reference to the

and I think I can compress MY views, and
to-ake lhem very brief. I bave twvo pupoe

one is, to show that in no other province in
Caînada in 1927 ivas there more fervent or
nmore universai celebration of tlie Jubiiee of
The wboie
Canada than in Nova Scotia.

FEBRUARY 7,1928
sentiment against Confederation was swapt
away, and 'the people of Nova Scotia fromn
end to end of my province joinad hand-inhand in rejoicing over what was consurnrated
in 1867.
I have another purpose in mentiening these
things. There was ene stalwart man, among
many others in 1867, to whorn the bringing
of Nova Scotia into Confederation was due.
If Sir Charles Tupper had net been thare,
Nova Scotia would not have corne inte Confederation, and I venture to say thera would
have been no Confederation in 1867. He was
the man who lad the province in-his opponents said that ha drova tharn in; but if
Nova Scotia had not corne in there would
have been no Confederation. So ha was a
real builder. I mention this bacausa I think
that there should be a statue on this Parliament Hill to the man who did that for Nova
Scotia and for the Dominion. Statues have
been erected for others, but there was ne more
outstanding character in the public life cf
this country, particularly in those stirring days
and avants, than Sir Charles Tupper, and I
hcpa te sea the day when Parliament Hill will
have a statue to him in recognition cf what
ha did.
The later history cf Nova Scotia is writtan
to a certain ext cnt in what is called the
Duncan report. That brings us down te 1926
and 1927, and I only mention it because thare
are suggestions at tirnes that wha;t the Puncan
Report asks for the Maritime Provinces is
charactarized as a sort cf dole, and net as a
right; sornething tha)t is given te those provinces by reason cf the good-heartedness cf the
rest of the country.
Now, I want to j oin issue diractly with
that idea. I arn net going to elaborate it,
but just read what the report itself says in
oe paragraph on. that aspect of the matter.
This is what the Duncan Report says:
Tt follows frorn what wa have said, that both
in respect of grants for the machinry cf gevernments and in respect cf debt allowances, the
Maritime Provinces have satisfied us that they
have a genuine dlaim te a readjustrnent cf the
financial arrangements that exist betwean the
Dominion and themselves, and that in any
readjustrnent thair territorial limitations antitie
tham. te, still further considaration.
I arn just going to ernphasize that ene peint,
and Bay that we expect that Duncan report
to ha fulfillad to the letter; and we expect
moe.
We have more rights. When thasa
are provided fer, sny honourable f riend will
find us ready with other rights, which we will
axpeet to see carefully considerad and reasonably deait. with.
Hen. Mr. DANDURAND:
Weuld the
honourable gentleman declare right now that

75

he would be satisfied with the same Cernmissioners te continue the investigation?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do flot kn.ow. That
is not for me te say. I arn perscmally
acquainted with them ail, and they are very
estimable gentlemen, and they made a very
interesting report. I think my honourable
friend himself would make a very good. cernrnissioer for the Maritime Provinces. I think
he is large-hearted, and recognizes the difference between right and wreng; between rights
that are rights and rights that are flot rights,
so I have no fear whatever; but I would
likeHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Might I ask my
honourable friend if ha would indicate any
subject which is not covered by the Duncan
report., and which was mentioned, or diseussed, or subrnitted?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Well, rny honourable
friend sees that we have a very well-qualiýfied
provincial authority, so far as our Province
is concerned, and they are dealing ivith that
inatter, and I would flot like to, anticipate
just what views they have at the present
moment. Then we have the fact that a Proviýncial Conference has been held, but we
have not had an o>pportunity of studying their
proceedings and their report; therefore I do
flot think it would be very profitable for me,
off-hand, te begin to enumerate what my
hon-ourable friand suggests. But I would say
that in the steel and ooal and fishing industries we have subjects upon which the
Maritime Provinces, particularly the Province
of Nova Scotia, expeet, very prompt and very
effective action. We have been discussing,
for instance, the fuel question, a fuel policy
for Canada. It is high time we had a fuel
policy for Canada. If we are ever going te
make progress in that regard we must do
something, sornething practîcal, and we mnust
do it quickly. So it is with regard te the
great steel industry. The coal and steel industries are of direct interest to at least oneflfth of the population of Nova Scotia. We
hear a grat deal of talk; but what is wanted
down thare is action-prompt and effective
action.
I had ne idea, honourable gentlemen, that
1 would taka se much tirne. 1 wanted te
say a few words about the question of
population, or, as it is sornatirnes called,
immigration.
My honourable friend, the
Leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
took a rather dismal view when he said that
altbough many are geing out of the ceuntry
we manage to get in enough to fill thair
places. I do not think that is good enough..
While we have made substantial progress in

76

SENATE

eixty years, I say that we should have to-day
at least frorn fifteen te twenty millions of
people in this country. I ar n ft
going to
bother the House with statisties; but I say
that we should net ho losing, as we
undoubtedly are, se many of our own people.
As I see it, an extraordinary situation
exists in regard te immigration. There seerns
to be an attitude of mind in rorne quarters,
and it seerns to have a potent influence on
the Governrnent of the day, whichi, crystaliized. is soniething like this: that wc have
now more people in Canada than we need.
Hon. Mr. DA.INDURAND:
From where
does rny honourable friend take that statcment?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I will tell my honourable friend in a moment what I arn referring
te. I arn saying that there is, in rny opinion,
ain attitude cf mind in this ceuntry that we
have reallv rnore people than we nc<. For
instance, 1 read to-day the official report of
the annual conventien of the United Farmers
cf Alberta, whio cornplaincd that farci immigracia w~ere bcing duinpcd into that province
and were disi npting wlhole districts. I do net
say whether that is correct or net. That is
cne cf iv autiiorities.
The other day I
observed an honourable gentleman w-ho represents part cf Manitoba decl-îring that there
are more farmers in Manitoba than there is
roorn for. Net very long since I heard the
present
Leader cf
the Opposition, Mr.
Bennett, say that thiere were 10.000,000 acres
cf arable land in the West available for
settlernent, and a clay or twc later I read
the language of the Minister cf Immigration,'
Who said: "That is ail wrong, that land is,
not available at ail; it is helcl by individuals
and corporations"ý-and therefore settlers caonet go upon it unless they have a lot of
mcney. I arn putting these things together
because I want te shorten rny remarks.
I
say there exists a certain attitude cf mmid.
Take the Trades and Labour Congress. Thry
qucte with approval a speech madIe by the
Minister cf Immigration in which lie warne1
ag-ainst bringing in people unless there were
jobs waiting for them; and cne cf the res,-olutions cf the, Trades and Labour Congress
gees so far as te say that if a man is brought
icto Canada te w'ork at ccc thing and he gees
tc work at corne other job the Governrnent
should deport him. That is the attitude cf
mind which prevails here and there and everywhere-that we have net roorn for people;

portation problems, if necessary, or to protect it, as some sections are now clarnouring
to be protected. I know I arn receiving circulars fromn the farmers institutes in Nova
Scotia, demanding protection on butter and
cheese. I will hold up both hands for saf eguarding them; but if we are ever going to
build up population, we must safeguard and
protect industries of ail kinds 'by a truly
national policy. And I have no doubt that
if the national policy of 1879-I speak of it in
its broader sense-had been conscientiously
and persistently followed out there would 1e
in Canada to-day twenty millions of people
instead of ten millions.
Now, we will neyer accomplish that building up until we bave a government with convictions, a government with resolution. Therê.
is no use trying to do anything with a gos'ernment that stands at the crossroads waiting
for someone to beckon here or 'beckon there,
or to corne up and say: You must flot touch
that item of the tariff; if you do we won't
vote for you. There must be certainty and
there must be resolution. I venture to say,
honourable gentlemen, that there is nlot living
in Vjhis country to-day one man or one woman
who can tell us upon what prineiples the
government of the present day stands in regard to fiscal matters. Not one soul insido
or outside of Canada knows that. Its whole
policy is one of opportunism, of providing a
certain arnount of bait every year for certain
classes of people, ini order that the Government may retain office. That is not what we
want in this country. We want a goverfiment
that is strong, a governrnent with opinions
and convictions, a government that is willing
to risk its if e for the purpose of building up
the country.
You cannot hide these matters or shut your
eyes to them. The other day I read a most
eloquent address by the Prime Minîster. HP
went from place to place ini painting a picture
of the magnificance of the country, the greatness of its resources, its wonderful development during the past sixty years. It was a
wonderful word-picture. He flattered himself
by saying that neyer before in the history
of Canada had a Prime Minuster been able
to paint such a picture of prosperity and
greatness. Af ter observing this word-painting
I stopped, and I said to myseif - Is it truc?
If we have all these great resources, if we
have aIl these great means of making not oniy
a livelihood, but more, if we have all these
magnîficent opportunities in this country, how
in heaven's name is it that people won't stay
in it? that instead of remaining here they
pack their suitcases and go to the United
States of Arnerîca to get work?

77

There is something wrong, honourable gentlemen, sornething I arn unable to understand. The only explanation I can attempt
is the one I have already given: that in order
to build tihis country up and make it a really
great country we must bave nlot only a great
farming industry, helped in every possible
way, but we must bave a great industrial lufe
employing millions of people in our cities
And to bring that about we must see that
there is a sane and effective national policy
which will keep out the produets of the cheap
labour of Europe and that will provide work
for the people of Canada instead of for those
of the United States and the cheap-labour
countries of Europe.
Hon, W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I rise for but a moment to make a
few observations on one or two of the inatters
referred to in the Speech fromn the Throne.
I 'have listened with great pleasure to the
admirable speech of the honourable gentleman who has just taken his seat (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), in which he dealt with one or two
things to which I may refer. My observations will be extremely brief..
The Speech from the Throne rnakes allusion
to the fact that negotiations are t.aking place
witb regard to the return to Alberta of its
natural resources; and it is fioreshadowed
that there will be a new basis of adjustmentnot merely a return of the natural resources,
but in addition, although it is not deflnitely
promised, a continuation of the subsidy which
was granted, and which was supposed to be
given in lieu of the natural resources. You
will notice the phrasecology pertaining to this
subjet-"2the return of their natural resources." That language iruplies that those
resources neyer were the property of the
Dominion of Canada.
This is not the place to adduce a legal
argument, and in that connection I am going
to quote only very briefly from the Address
of the Parliament of Canada and the provisions of the British North America Act.
Lawyers rnuch more competent than I, the
hemn of wbose garments 1 would not dare to
touch, bold the opinion that I do, namely,
that, the Dominion of Canada neyer did own
at any time in its history the natural resources of the Prairie Provinces, and that
when it took over those resources it did so
as trustee for the Prairie Provinces.
As I have said, I will make only one or
two allusions to the constitutional phase of
this question. Everybody who is familiar with
the bistory of Confederation knows that our
territories were extended to include the Hudson Bay Company holdings and the North-

SE.NATE

WVestern Territory-in fact, ail the land north
of the United States-in one great union.
At that; tinie flec Hudson Bay Company
owned Rupert's Land, and the North-Western
Territory beloiiged to the Crown; but the
Fathers of Confcderation made provision for
their admission in Section 146 of tho British
North Ainerica Act., which, in part, reads as
follotvs:

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But all I am

Hon Mr. BELCOURT: Is that correct?
ifon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think the opinion
and feeling of the West were pretty well dis-.
closed by the attitude of Sir Clifford Sifton
and others in 1905, and there did not appear
.o be a very great disposition to do whaît
my honourable friend says.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I will neither
defend nor criticize the attitude of Sir Clifford
Sifton. Personally I happened to be a candidate in the province of Ontario for a seat
in the House when the school issue was a
paramount one, and I stood for the protection of the rights of the minority in
Manitoba, and, like others, had to accept
defeat in consequence. But I do say that in
Saskatchewan Sir Frederick Haultain, in my
opinion--and I am discussing the matter not
from the religious, but from the constitutional
point of view-was generously disposed
towards all classes. I think so, in any event.
However, that is only in passing. I have
referred to it only because that particular
issue seemed to submerge issues which to me,
in any event, and to the people of the West,
were more important, respecting our natural
resources.
The people of the East-and I am from
the East, for I was born in Ontario-may
think that we in the West are not only very
insistent on our rights, but always come down
here with a chip on the shoulder or a tomahawk in the hand. That is not the case.
Those who hold the sarne political opinions
as myself have no voice to speak for them in
the other House. There happens to be in
that House nobody representing those views
from the province of Manitoba, and there is
only one fron the province of Alberta, the
only one frorn west of -the Great Lakes and
east of British Columbia, who holds the
same political views that I do; and, while I
do not make this House a medium for political discussion, yet I feel that that saving
minority out there to whom I belong are
entitled to have their voice heard.

79

I desire to say also, on this phase of the
discussion, with reference to the remarks of
the honourable member for Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), that there is a misconception as to
the attitude of at least one of the parties
in the West on the question of protection and
free trade. Again I admit that I belong to
that saving minority in the West, but I
desire to point out that the Anglo-Saxon
people of the prairie provinces, other than
those who have come from the United States
and may be regarded as of Anglo-Saxon
descent, are at least 50 per cent Conservative. The foreigners who immigrated frorn
Europe, particularly during the Sifton regime,
to which allusion has been made, chose not
wisely, perhaps, but differently. With then,
of course, I do not class our French friends,
who unfortunately have come in lesser numbers to the prairie provinces, save the province of Manitoba. Nor am I criticizing the
foreign population at all. They to a very
large extent voted with the Government
now in power, and with the local governments whicli have been in power since 1905
and have shared the same political views.
The Conservative party in the prairie provinces have never to my knowledge, since
1897, lowered their flag on the question of
protection, or on the doctrine of such an
adequate safeguarding of the industries of
this country in general as was necessary in
order that the East might live, as well as
the West. We know very well that we in the
West do not gain as many advantages under
any form of protection as are gained in the
East. We are not blind to the economic
facts, but for the sake of Canada-for the
sake of you in the East, where some form
of 'protection to your industries is an absolute
and vital necessity, we on our part are perfectly ready to make concessions. All we ask
is that you look with reasonable indulgence
on the claims that we make, which are
naturally, more or less, related to agriculture. On many occasions in this House, and
honourable gentlemen will bear me witness,
I have defended, in some cases against the
views of my honourable friends on this side,
measures that the Government had introduced; and I may say that at all times,
while I am in this House, I intend to discuss
questions of legislation respecting the prairie
provinces in particular from a non-party
point of view, and if legislation emanating
from the Government js in my opinion in the
interest of the prairie provinces they are
going to have my support, as they have had
it on many occasions.
But I recognize the fact, to which my honourable friend has alluded to-day, that we

80

SENATE

have not an adequate diversity of industry
in parts of Canada at the present time. We
are beginning ta realize that there is not
sufficient diversity in the western part of the
country. We cannot live on agriculture alone.
It is perfectly true that in certain districts
of the West people have engaged in agriculture with perhaps as mucl profit as is done
in any other part of Canada, but we cannot
hold our own people in our towns and villages
and on the farms, as I know from very varied
experience, unless we have other occupations
besides farming. A farmer's sons or daughters
must have an inclination and liking for farm
life if they are ta stay on the farm. The
temperament of some people requires them
to follow another occupation, and the prairie
provinces are losing the sons and daughters
of farmers, and we are losing people from
our towns and villages, because there is no
other occupation than that of agriculture;
that is, we have no variety of industry in
which to absorb our young people. It is an
unfortunate thing. Take a passably prosperous farmer out there with three or four sons
and two or three daughters. I hope there
is no race suicide out in the West. You will
find almost certainly that one of the sons
will not wish to be a farmer, and perhaps
one of the daughters is not willing to marry
a farmer and live on a farm. What are you
going to do with them? Since we have not
sufficient diversity of industry to be able to
supply places for them, we are hopeful that
industry may prosper in the central and eastern provinces and that our young people,
instead of migrating ta the United States, will
find employment bere.
I am speaking much longer than I intended.
I would like ta deal with one specific thing
in connection with agriculture in the West.
I profess myself to be an Imperialist. I am
extremely desirous that our trade relations
should be established on a preferential basis
with our kin all over the world, so far as that
can be fairly done. I am aware of the difficulties that the former Government had in
attempting to negotiate a treaty with Australia; and I believe that Mr. Robb, too, had
difficulties before ho arranged the treaty with
that Dominion. In ail frankness, I really do
not think that he realized the consequences
of the treaty at the time it was made. The
complaint has come, from our western country
in particular, that he raised the duty on
raisins by 3 cents, tlhps increasing it by 23
cents. Our farmer friends in the West, at
least the Progressive element, have rebelled
against that, saying that they were paying
this increased duty. We realize that it was
necessary for the Government to make sone
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

concession to our Australian friends if we
were to get concessions in their market. The
Government thought that we undoubtedly
would develop a trade in dried fruits, and
I have no fault to find with that view at all.
I know how keen is the desire of our Anstralian friends to extend the sale of their
dried fruits, not only in Canada, but also in
other parts of the world. I had the pleasure
of being in Melbourne and meeting many
members of the Government in 1924, and one
of them, the Minister of Agriculture, presented ie wilh a sample box of dried fruits,
wbich I brougbt back to my own home city
and had exposed in a window, trying in my
humble way to show the people what the
Australians had. I do not find fault with the
Government in this respect, although the
result has not been what was expected. They
have exported only about 800,000 pounds, as
compared with 40,000,000 from the United
States. The Australians have to meet the
competition of an extremely well developed
and very prosperous industry in California,
and it is difficult to find a market.
Then we come to the question of dairy
products. Some gentlemen in this Chamber
recollect that when the Australian treaty
,was introduced it was figured that it would
have a very serious effect on the butter
business. So seriously did we think about it
that we held a little meeting. and it was
intended to bring the matter up for discussion in the House, but it was felt that
perhaps we might be looked upon as not
sufficiently imperially-minded. Sa, while we
thought we saw serious danger to our butter
interests, we forebore making our protest at
that time.
The Minister of Agriculture in another place
-I do not think this Session-and throughout
the country has pooh-poohed the idea of
inroads being made on our market by the
butter of Australia, and more particularly
that of New Zealand. Honourable gentlemen
will remember that when we made the treaty
with Australia we inserted a clause giving
the Government the right to extend similar
treatment to New Zealand. Perhaps there
was no serious objection to that, except that
in our treaty with Australia we presumably
got a quid pro quo; that is, we got a reduction
of duty on our automobiles and newsprint.
The Government by Order-in-council extended to New Zealand the privileges which
hitherto had been accorded only to Australia,
and we gave them those privileges without
money and without price. It was claimed by
members of the Government that New
Zealand was so far away that the privileges
would not amount to anything. But we have

FEBRUARY 7, 1928
a very authoritative statement from the
National Dairy Council. I took the privilege
of discussing this matter with the president
of the Council, not within a year, but at the
time of the treaty, and they are now asking
the Government:
1. That the Order-in-Council applying Schedule 2 of the Australian Trade Agreement to
New Zealand be rescinded at once;
2. That the dumping clause be immediately
applied on all butter sent from Australia to
Canada on consignment as well as on direct
sale;
3. That the Australian Trade Agreement be
terminated as provided in the Australian Trade
Agreement Act, 1925.

market to a very large extent and the
boundary cities are taking cream from Ontario. We have no cities south of the prairie
provinces that import butter at all, and with
the high duty on butter and cream exported
to the United States that is not an encouraging market. By the loss of our export and
home market a rapidly growing industry has
almost disappeared, because we cannot produce
the butter at the price at which they are producing in Australia, and as a result our farmers are going out of business.

DIVORCE BILL (ONTARIO)
THIRD READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
third reading of Bill A, an Act to provide
in the Province of Ontario for the dissolution
and the annulment of marriage.

Hon. J. J. HUGHES:

Honourable gentle-

men, before we proceed with the third
reading of the Bill now before us I wish
to take a little of the time of the House to
present my views on this question. Divorce,

I think, is admitted to be the greatest social
evil that afflicts the world to-day, and
unfortunately it is growing in nearly all,
perhaps I might say, all Christian countries. I
do not think I need labour that point at
any length in this House.

It

will be admitted too, I think, that

divorce strikes at the very foundations of the
State. The unit of the State is the family,
and there is no other social evil that so

demoralizes or injures the family as the evil
of divorce. Perhaps it would enable us to
realize the gravity of this- evil to compare it
with polygamy. There is not, I think, an
honourable man in this House or in the
other Chamber who would wish to legalize
polygamy in Canada. To my mind, divorce
is a still greater evil, having all the evils
of polygamy and some of its own in addition.
It is really successive polygamy. It has been
described as tandem polygamy, a description,
I think, that is fairly accurate. In my judgment polygamy is the lesser evil. It does
not strike at the family in the same way
as divorce, and to some extent at least
preserves the family life. This being the
case, it is a serious matter to legislate in
such a way as to increase the evil of divorce.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

to the courts of that province.

That the evil is increasing is shown by

the figures given out last year by the honourable member from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr.

Willoughby), when he said that in 1926 the
number of divorces granted in Canada by
provinces was as follows:
British Columbia.. ........
167
Ontario..
113
Alberta.. ..............
154
Manitoba.. .............
85
Saskatchewan.. ..........
48
Nova Scotia.. ............
19
New Brunswick.. ..........
12
Quebec.. ..............
10
Prince Edward Island.. ..
. 0...
Prince Edward Island, I am glad to say, will
have nothing at all to do with the thing.

There has been only one divorce in that

province since Confederation, and I hope and
believe that there will never be another.

The honourable Senator (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) further stated that there were 1,368
divorce decrees granted by American courts

to persons who were married in Canada.
You sec how tremendously the number
is increasing; and it is reasonable to suppose that if we have legislation facilitating
the passing of divorce, the number will increase still faster.

I listened attentively to the statements
that were made last year when this matter
was under consideration, and I was particularly impressed with the speech made by the

right honourable Senator from Brockville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham). He stated that
80 or 90 per cent of the divorces in Canada
were obtained by people who wanted to remarry. I do not know whether he made
this further statement or not, but I make
it now, that if that phase of divorce could
be eliminated we could do away with 80 or
90 per cent of the applications for divorce

in Canada, and consequently with about the
same proportion of the divorces. That is a
startling statement, but I believe it to be
true. After all, honourable gentlemen, it is
a small minority of the people who wish to
sever the marriage tie and break up the
family relations. Is this legislation designed

FEBRUARY 8, 1928k5
or intended to give facilities to people who
are inclined to indulge their passions? Are
we legislating for them? This is a very serious
question. I desire, so far as I amn concerned,
to do my duty as a Senator and as a citizen
of Canada. I have no wish to be dogmatic
or unreasonable in a matter of this kind.
May I say here and now, I would like to see
introduced into this House a Bill for which
ail of us, or the great majority, could vote.
0f course, I know that the present Bill cannot pass this Chamber unless a mai ority
vote for it, but I would like to see a measure
that would have the support of nearly ahl
the members.
I think there is perhaps a misapprehension,
even ini this House, with regard to the attitude
taken on this question by the Church to
whidh I belong, and., while I do not claim for
a moment to be an authority on Church
matters, yet I believe I know something on
the subjeet. The Church .to which I belong,
the Catholie Church, holds that marriage was
raised by Christ to the dignity of a sacrament,
and that when it is validly contracted and
consummated it cannot be dissolved by any

holds that the parties to, the contract themselves, the man and the woman agreeing to
be married, are the ministers of the sacrament.
The essential part is the mutual agreement by

the marital obligations. Every man or woman

matters for fier own children, declares that
the clergyman Who perfoms the ceremony is
only a necessary witness of the marriage, and

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: 1 think not-with
ail due respect to my honourable friend. Now,
the State makes this regulation-and. it is a
reasonable regulation-that the wiill is invalid
unless it be witnessed by two persons. That
is for the good of the State and for the sake
of public order and the welfare of the majority. T-hat is 8omething like the regulation
made by the Church t-hat there must be competent witnesses present and that the marriage
cerernony must be performed in a way that
prevents clandestînity.
It is stated, and perhaps this is correct,
that the Protestant churches do flot take so
strong a stand upon this question as the
Catholic Church does. I think the English
Church in Canada takes about the same attitude upon it as the Catholic Church. At
ail events, according to the regulations of the
Church of England, clergymen are prevented,
from re-marrying divorced persons.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: No, flot at ail.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is not correct?
Well, I have read something along that line.
However, I will accept the statement of
honourable gentlemen who naturally know
more about it than I do, though 1 would like
to have an explanation on that point. There
are certainly, I believe, some regulations in
the Church of England in Canada t-hat go
about as far as I have stated.
I have here four resolutions passed by a
committee of the Social Service Council of
Canada in Winnipeg in January, 1922. That
1 think the evangélical
is pretty late.

SENATE
Protestant churches in Canada are affiliated
with the Social Service Council; or perhaps
the Social Service Council are affiliated with
the evangelical churches. I will read these
resolutions, which were framed and submitted
to the Council by a committee on the Family:
1. That this Social Service Council of Canada
expresses as its belief the acceptance of the
divine ideal of the life-long and indissoluble
union of one man with one wonan, for better
or for worse, terminable by death alone, as
binding marriage in Canada to-day.
2. That in preservation of this ideal unqualifled opposition alone can be shown towards any
suggestion or action that w-ould tend to substitute for general assomption of this ideal, in
the law or custom of Canada or any province
thereof, the opposed general asslnlption that
divorce was recognized and possible of attainment by mere request
the law; and

for the application

of

3. That while recognizing the existence of
cases of hardship and cruelty froum unfortunate
iarriage, this Council declares that in keeping
with this ideal relief should be sought in
judicial separation or a divorce that does not
carry the right of remnarriage; and further
declares as its belief that not only is this
solution in keeping with this ideal, but that
it will better serve the interests of society and
the preservation of the fanily as an institution.
4. Wherefore ttis Council will oppose any
cmovemient to extend the grounds of divorce in
Canada; and any novenent to increase the
facilities of divorce where the general law does
not

assume

divorce,

and

will

endeavour

by

educational effort to seek the furtherance of
the Christian ideal of narriage thruoughout
Canada.

Now, those resolutions were presented by
the Committee to the Council, which adopted
three of them. rejecting the third. I have
this to say, that I would support a Bill that
embodied the principal provisions of those
resolutions, or even one embodying the
principles contained in the three which were
accepted by the Council. I think that would
be a decided improvement on what is proposed, and an improvement on what we now
have.
I would therefore suggest that a reasonable
timne be taken to consult the Churches in
Canada upon this question. I understand
that the Methodist Church, before the Union
took place, had a regulation preventing their
clergymen from remarrying the guilty party
in a divorce, and I believe that the law of
England up to 1855 prevented the guilty
party from remarrying. I would hope for a
measure in Canada going as far as that, and
I think that would not be going too far. I
would prefer to sec remarriage prevented
altogether, because I believe that would be
a solution of this question.
If divorce goes on increasing in Canada
during the next fifty years as it has donc
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

in the last twenty-five years the situation
will be serious. We do not want to be
in the same position as our neighbours
to the south with regard to this matter.
It is a serious one.
I think it would be
better to proceed slowly on this question.
One year more could not do much harm,
even to those who wish to see this legislation
passed quickly. If we had the churches of
Canada behind us we would have seveneighths of the people with us. My impression is that the Canadian churches will not
be behind the proposed legislation, but I
think that as Christians, as men vitally
interested in the welfare of our country, we
could pass legislation that would meet with
the approval of the vast majority of the
people of Canada, and it is our duty to try
it.
I could not vote for the present Bill, if it
came to a vote. I had intended to move
an amendment to prevent remarriage, or at
the very least to prevent remarriage of the
guilty parties. I think probably the other
House wouid be the better placeHon. Mr. HARDY:
Is the honourable
gentleman aware that this Bill applies only
to the Province of Ontario?
I ask the
question because te speaks entirely of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I am well aware of
ttat fact, but I am also aware that Parliament can legislate on that question for
Canada, and it is our duty to do so. I
believe that if we had the churches with us,
that would necessarily imply that we would
have public opinion with us, and that we
could legislate for Canada, or at least for
nine-tenths of the people of Canada. I am
well aware that this Bill applies to Ontario,
but I presume that Ontario does not want
to do anything that is injurious to the State,
or to Ontario as a Province. We are net
sectional in this matter, at least I am net;
I would like to sec a Bill that applied to
the whole of Canada. That is my answer to
my honourable friend.
I think I need net go any further in this
matter. I tave statcd my views. I [ake mv
responsibility on this qucstion seriously, and
I wish to do so. I do not desire to be sectional or narrow-minded. I think I am .ooking at the question from the standpoint of a
Christian and a Canadian citizen; and the
suggestion I have made, that it be brought
specifically before the chureh courts and
assemblies and synods, and an expression of
their opinion asked, wouiid be a respectful
attitude on the part of Parliament, and could
not do any harm. Honourable gentlemen, I
thank you for your patience.

FEBRUARY 8, 1928
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
as thiýs Bill is one that affects Ontario only,
1.would like to say a few words as one cerning
frorn that province. I have listened with a
great deal of pleasure te the honourable
gentleman who bas just taken his seat; but,
if I heard -hirn correctly, bis speech was entirely on a Bill that would apply to the
wbole of Canada. lis answer te the bonourable gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy)
was to the effeet that this Parliament bas
power to legisiate se fair as thc whole of
Canada is concerned. I do net understand
thie situation that way.
As I understand the situation, at tbc tirne
of Confederation the Provinces of Ontario,
Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Prine F4ward Island were those that formed
the Confederation, and at that time Nova
Scotia New Brunswick reserved the rigbt
to deal entirely witb divorces. Therefore we
cannt legisiate in ýthis Heuse in any way
that wou.ld prevent Nova Setia and New
Brunswick fromn deciding whether or net
parties who are granted divorces sball have
tbc rigbt te remarry. That is tbe Iaw as I
understand it, and if I arn net rigbt other
gentlemen wil1 correct me. My contention is
that we have ne power te pass a law here
te interfere with the decisions of the courts
of those twe provinces, because of the arrangement by which they came into the Union.
The Province of British Columbia, which
came into the Union later, reserved exactly
the samne right. Then the other Provinices
were formed-Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan and the Parliarnent of Canada, by
tbe A'ct that created those provinces, put
tbem in exactly the saine position as Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick. Therefore I say
that evcry Province in, this Dominion to-day,
except Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edrward
Island, bas tbe right te pass laws relating
te divorce, and we cannot ipass a law that
will affect that decision.
Se far as Quebec is concerned, of course tbe
people of tbat Province have tbe rigbt te
corne ýte this Parliament and have diý.orccs
granted bere, just as have those frorn Ontarie, but the courts in Quebec annul marniages, and that procedure applies exactly the
sarne as divorce, being based on reasens with
wbich I arn net finding the siýigbtest fault.
They are perbaps good reasons, but Ontario
bas ne sucb procedure. Ontario is practically
the only Province fromn wbich applications for
divorce ýcorne te this Huse. The honourable
gentleman solernnly said that if we passed
this Bill we would be increasing thc advantages of getting divorce.

85

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Giving greate-r facilities.
Hon. Mr. REID: Giving greater facilities
te try cases. From bis speech I would infer
that he meant that it would be rnuch easier
te get a divorce.
Hon. Mr. 'HUGHES: No, that is a misunderstanding.
Hon. Mr. REID: That is what I inferred;
but, as I understand it, if this Bill is passed
and the court of tbc Province of Ontario
instead of this House deals with divorces, ne
person can get a divorce in Ontario witheut preducing the saine evidence as would
be required at this Senate.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I quite understand
that.
Hon. Mr. REID: Then the bonourable
gentleman bas net bbe sarne confidence in the
judges of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Oh yes, I have.
Hon. Mr. REID: But those Ontario judges,
in whorn we have the greatesb confidence,
ean only grant a divorce for tbe samne reasonq
that apply in the Senate. Then how is this,
Bill going te faciitate divorces? Perhaps it
miglit resuit ini raking thein lesa expensive,
for tbc applicants in Toronto would net pay se
much as tbey would in coming down here,
and the courts would sit in Toronto, Hamilton, Kingston, and Ottawa. Why sheuld net
those wbo apply for divorces bave such facilities? Why sbould we force thern te corne

of money, simply te give bbc saine reasons
and evidence, and get. the saine results? I
tbink that is unfair and unjust, and I bold

Ontario be put in tbc saine position as every
other province excepb Quebec.

SENATE
So far as I arn concerned, 1 would give
both Ontarie and Quebec those riglits. The
honourable gentleman asks us to go to the
different churches and synods and ask themn
to endorse the giving of those rights to Ontario alone. I think that is absurd. Coming
froma Ontaxio as I do, I say it is flot rigbt
that the present position should -continue
wben divorce cases are increasing se ranch.
If we were deing an injustice te the Province
of Quebec or any other province by enacting
this proposed legisiation I would hesitate,
but I hold that it would net de an injustice
cither te those who arc epposcd te divorce
or those in faveur of if. We are simply
saying, "On acceunt of ether ýlegisiative
duties, we in this Senate, or we in this Parliament, have net time te deal with them."
It bas becn proved cntirely te the satisfaction
ef the rest of Canada that the preper place
te deal with divorces is in the courts, and
we ask that the courts of Ontario be put in
fthc same position as ethers.
The honeurable gentleman says that only
one divorce case bias cerne frem Prince Edward Island. That may bc, but I want, te
fell himn that a great many residents of Prince
Edward Island bave meved te ether places,
and they bave bcd divorces thore. But I
weuld ask the question, how about Prince
Edward Island te-day? Has net the same
riglit heen gnrnted to tbem? That province
bas the right te grant diverce, bas if net?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It was offered it,
but the Legislature refuscd tbe offer.
Hon. Mr. REID:
Then why weuld the
henourable gentleman net give us the same
riglit bore? As a citizen of Prince Edward
Island or a member ef the other House, be
did net ebjeet at ail, yet new he advises us
te refuse te give that right te Ontarie. Parliamient effered te give tbe right te Prince
Edward Island; then why sheuld Ontario net
get fthc same rigbt? As a citizen of Ontario
I say that we are net asking anything that
affects any political or religieus party in Canada. We are asking that we let the Judges
of our Higb Court examine the witnesses in
diverce cases, and if ve bave enly tbe same
greunds that tbe Senate of Canada now has
on whicb te grant divorces, I tbink those
*iudges sbeuld decide the cases instead of the
Committee of tlic Senate, our time being
occupied witb other business.
Hen. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
gentlemen, coming as I do frem the Province
of Ontaio, I wish te explain my position before tbis matter is disposed of. In tbe first
place, 1 wisb te say tbat -I fully agree with
Hon. Mr. REID.

the vory clear and able presentatien that was
made yesterday by tbe honourable member
for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belceurt). Aside from
any religious convictions that I may have,
I feel that as far as possible we should nvoid
taking nny action wbicb xviii encourage the
dissolution of the marriage tie. If this Bill
becomes law, and we bave divorce courts
set up in the different cities and ceunties of
Ontario, I feel tbat it will add some respectability te divorces. It will encourage parties
wbo may bave domestie troubles te seek a
lawyer and apply for a divorce, rather than
endeavour te settle fbeir dornestie difficulties
at berne.
There is ne evidence that tbere is nny
very marked demand from the Prevince of
Ontario for this legisiation. This is the third
time that this Bill, or a similar one, bas been
befere the Senate, and te my recollection the
boneurable member for Grenville (Hon. Mr.
Reid) is the flrst member of the Senate from
Ontario who bas spoken in support of such
legislation.
I cao readily understand why the members
of tbe Sonate, and more particularly the
members of the Divorce Committee, would
desire te lie free ef the disgusting details
whicb are brougbf eut in cennectien witb the
bearing- of applications for divorce. But te
my mind tbe remedy is in their own bands.
Tbere is a general opinion tbreugbout tbis
ceuntry-I doe net suppose it is sbared in tbe
Sonate te any extent-that we bave a divorce
law in Ottawa, and thaf the Senate is a sort
of divorce court. Now, 1 have always understeed that every Bill granting a divorce
tbrougb Parliament was a special Act of
Parliament. I believe the applications are
made te the Parliament of Canada, net te
the Senate of Canada. If tbe Bill granting
tbe diverce were te eriginate in the llouse
of Gommons, and receive the sanction cf
both Houses and tbe Governor-General, if
would be quite as effective as a Bill which
originated in flic Senate.
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Just the same.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: If the members of
the Divorce Cemmittee feel that tbey are everworked, and desire te get rid of it, ail tbey
have got te de is te request those who apply
for divorces te make their applications te tbe
Private Buis Committee ef tbe House of
Gommons, and let fbem try il. eut.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would my honourable friend amend the Bull sa that the guilty
party would not be allowcd ta remarry?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Will my fhonourable

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would the honourable

Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I think there are

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I think that is a
reflection on the Divorce Committee.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Not at ail. I have
my own conviction in this matter. That is
one Committ-ee -on whhih I would not aot under

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend think that in passing this Bill
the Senate will be relicved of the necessity

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is ail wrong.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: My impression is
that that is the purpose of the Bill-to have
divorce cases tricd elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It would not have
that effect at aîl. It will have the effect
of creating concurrent jurisdiction; but the
Senate will have jurisdiction in the future
just as it lias had in the past. That is a
serious misapprchension on the part of My
honourable friend and some other honourable
gentlemen. We do not get rid of the
obligation of hcaring divorce cases even if
this Bill passes bath Houses. The Divorce
Cornmittec would continue ta exist, and
would hear cases in whatcver number they
were prescnted.
Hon. Mr. SOHAFENER: It would get rid
of a great many cases.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I grant that.

because they have their own courts. The
same will be truc with respect ta Ontario.
If people fromn Ontario came here wc can
say: Go ta your own court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My observation
is, that notwithstanding the passing of this
Bill the Senatc will still be vestcd with
jurisdiction ta entertain applications for

bs

SENATE

divorce, and that there still will be applications to the Senate, so that we will have to
continue the Divorce Committee to hear
whatever applications come to Parliament.
Hon. Mr. REID: Of course, we will have
the Committee just as we have it to-day.
But to-day people from the Provinces of
Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick,
Alberta,
Saskatchewan and British Columbia do not
come here.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
The honourable
gentleman is quite right. This no doubt will
diminish the number of applications that will
come here. But I want to correct the impression, that seems to exist in the minds of
many, that we are getting rid of the necessity
of dealing with divorce. Citizens of all the
nine Provinces now have, and will continue
to have, the right to come here with applications for divorce, and when they come it will
be the duty of the Senate to deal with them.
If we do not want to hear any divorces at
all, the remedy is to simply abolish the
Committee on Divorce, or rather, appoint no
Committee-destroy the machinery by which
evidence can be taken and applications for
divorce considered. If we fail to appoint a
Divorce Committee we shall have no divorces,
and if honourable gentlemen want to be
logical they will simply move towards the
abolition of the Divorce Committee of this
House.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
If .this Bill encouraged divorce, or loosened the marriage
tic, I for one would not support it. I want
to point out one effect that it will have.
A case tried in the provincial court is tried
in camera, and none of the evidence is published. But what do we have in the Sepate
Divorce Committee?
All the evidence in
every case is printed 425 times, and copies are
sent around to all niembers of the House of
Conmmons and the Senate. We have at the
present time over 250 applications, and I
fancy J am not very far out wen I say that
the number will run up to probably 300.
Multiplying that by 425 gives you 127,500 as
the number of copies of evidence in connection with divorces, many of which will be
circulated throughout the country. What will
encourage divorce more than that sort of
thing? If divorce hearings are held in camera,
and no evidence is printed and no report
allowed to appear in the press, I think it will
tend to reduce the number of divorces.
I would not care to indulge in any controversy in regard te this question. I think
tîat what we have to decide is whether the
Province of Ontario shall have jurisdiction
qon. Mr. BELCOURT.

to try cases arising within its own borders in
the same way that such cases are tried in
other provinces. If the passing of this Bill
were to have no other effect than to prevent
the publication of the evidence it would bu
of very great benefit. It would deprive people
who have the k'ind of mind that takes pleasure
in reading that sort of thing of the opportunity of doing so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
My honourable
friend has no doubt read the British Press on
that point. The opinion seems to be generai
there that the vant of publicity has increased
the demand for divorces. I have seen the
opinion expressed on several occasions recently that the large increase within the
last few years is due almost entirely to the
lack of publicity.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTISON: Is it my honourable friend's view that all the evidence should
be published?
Hon. M'r. BELCOURT:
Not af all.
I
think ve have the remedy in our own hands.
Why are so many copies of the evidence
published and distributed? It is not at all
necessary.
If this House is of the opinion
that we should be relieved forever of divorce
matters, let us make no mistake about it, the
remedy is in our own hands. I submit that
my honourable friend has gone only half way.
If le wants to get rid of divorce for good,
let him propose that there be no Committee
on Divorce in this House, and that will be
the end of it.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Hoonourable gentlemen, I think the honourable member for
Ottawa has made the position of the minority,
especially those from my own Province, very
clear on this subject. I want simply to add
a word or two. We believe divorce is vicious.
But even if we wanted to do so, we could
not impose our views upon this House. If
the matter were in our own hands, we mighit
be constrained to act differently. A matter of
faith is not a matter that you can discuss;
but, so far as we are concerned, we have no
power in our hands, and we do net want to be
a useless obstacle in the way of legislation
that is brought before this flouse. We cannot prevent the Bill passing if we try.
As to the means of carrying out the duty
imposed upon this House, I fully agree with
what has been said. Parliament has had inflicted upon it a duty that does not belong
to it, a duty that it does not discharge well, a
duty, in fact, that it cannot discharge fully.
A case that comes before this tribunal is only
partly settled; and if divorce, which is an
cvil thing, has to exist in this country, at

FEBRUARY 8, 1928
least let it exist under sucli conditions that
it can be administered in the best possible
way from a judicial point of view. That is
the view that 1 entertain. 1 believe that
divorce is bad from the point of view of
marais, and I cannot approve of it geiierally.
But I cannat prevent the Bill passing this
flouse; and, when it bas passed, I think every
member of this flouse will heave a sigh af
satisaction that Parliament has been relieved
of a duty which neyer should have devolved
upon it.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, I arn constrained to adopt the argument
of the honourable snember for Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly), who vaiced my opinion on
this matter very wel. Divorce, I believe, is
a social evîl, and I do not thinýk I couid
support it in any possible way. The appointment af courts in Ontario to deal with divorce
cases will facilitate the granting -of divorces.
If we lessen the expenffe, as anc honaurable
gentleman bas said this measure willd, divorces
wilI be mûre easy ta, obtain, and people,
instead af endeavauring ta sett-ie their differences at home, will go ta the divorce courts.
I do not Vhink that I need. say any more
about the matter. I do not think we will improve the situation by getting rid af this
responsibility-I think aur second condition
will 'be worse than the firgt. If divorce is a
bad thing, we wilI simjyly be encouraging it
by imakinýg it easier.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I will not take more than a moment or two ta 'close the debate. We knaw
that under the British Nor~th America Aet
marriage and divorce are Ici t ta the jurisdictien af this House. Was it intended in so
leaving the -matter, and net delegating those
powers ta the Provinces, 'that no legislation
should ever follow? I do not, think so. I
think the primary abject was ta see that as
far as possible there should be uniformity in
this matter-and if this Bill should pas, we
wilil have practical uniformity. We will have
complet e uniformity as ýta the grounids an
which divorce may be granted, but not in
the machinery madie use 'af.
This Bill came up last year and went
through this flouse, ani a few years previously whe'n presented by .my leader, it
passed the flouse. It is onlly in reference to
the arguments of 'the honourable gentleman
from Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) and same others, thýat I rise ta, spaak.
Many af the arguments advanced by the
honourable gentleman frorn Prince Edward
Island have ta do with the eere-mony relating
ta marriage, which is a provincial matter,

and not one for the juriadiction ai this Parliament. My own opinion, aiter a somewhat
vaTied experience af divorce in this llousc.
is that the courts are, 'by rea-san af their very
constitution, their machinery, and judicial atmasphere, a better -place than Parliamenit for
the granting of divorce. We have not aill the
rnahinecry thât. a court possesses. It wouid
be costly and cumbersame ta instaîl such
machinery, and the whale series af pawers
possessed by a 'court-whieh aur Committee
does not seek ta exercise-would on'ly burden
the Senate if we had 'them. My abject in
introducing this Bill is nat ta escape this
work. If I did ndt happen ta be doing tihis
work, with the very able assistance af the
other members af the Committee, some other
honourable gentleman would take up the
running. But I think the time bas arrived
for such a Bill as this, and I therefore move
the third readinig of the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, on division, and
the Bill was read- the third time and passed.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Gavero
General's Speech at the opening of the Session
and the motion af Hon. Mr. Little for an
Address in reply thereto.
Han. JOHN G. TURRIIFF: Honourable
gentlemen, I wish ta say just a few words
on the Address in reply to the Speech fram
the Throne. First af ail I desire ta extend
my congratulations ta the honourable members who moved and secanded the Address,
the honourable gentlemen fram London (Hon.
Mr. Little) and from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse). I arn sure we ail agree that they
discharged their duty very weli, and, as they
are bath young and, vigorous men, I bespeak
for them a long and useful career in this
flouse.
The Speech from the Throne is in anc respect very much like other Speeches from the
Throne that 1 have heard, in this flouse and
in anather, for twenty odd years. It is a
gaod ordinary speech, but like ail former
speeches comning fromn the Treasury Benches,
it doca not satisfy the Opposition. I have
neyer yet heard a Speech from the T-hrone
that did. Whether the Speech came fram
the party now on this aide of the House or
the party now an the other aide, the Opposition always found a good deal ai fault with it
for what it did not cantain. I must confess that
the Speech on this occasion does not contain
very much. Perhaps thase who prepared it

90

SENATE

had in mind the saying of an old sage, that
speech was given to human beings for the
purpose of enabling them to conceal their
thoughts. In that case we may expect discussion of many matters that have not been
referred to at all in the Speech from the
Throne.
I intend to deal for a short time with only
two subjects. One of them was mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne, and that is
immigration.
Honourable gentlemen
will
realize, I am sure, by the amount of discussion on this question that has taken place
so far during the present Session that the
subject is attracting a good, deal of attention
throughout the country. Canada is, and always has been, interested in getting people
to immigrate here. Many years ago I was
particularly interested in the question of
immigration, but in those days, honourable
gentlemen, it was much easier than it is at
the present time. You had to bring in immigrants of a good class, if you could get them,
'and them up on the prairies, turn them loose
and let them root for themselves. If you
did the same now you would not have much
success. You have now not only to bring
people into the country, but also to look
after them. Tiere is not the same area of
vacant land te give to immigrants as homesteads, and newcomers must be helped in
every way to get a start in life in this country and to become successful settlers.
I noticed, honourable gentlemen, a great
deal of criticism, from the other side of the
House especially, with regard to our immigration policy.
The general argument from
the opposite side bas been that the Government bas spent millions and millions of
dollars in bringing immigrants te this country,
but that when we have welcomed them in at
one door we escort to another, bid them an
affectionate farewell and let them drift away
to other countries.
The statement bas been
made that, notwithstanding what has been
spent, we ýfail to retain the immigrants brought
into Canada, or, if we do retain them, we
are not retaining the native population.
I
regret to say, honourable gentlemen, that there
is a good deal of truth in that statement, as
there has been in the same sort of statement
practically every year for many years past.
An addition of the number of immigrants
brought in by the Government and the number
of births should show our gain in population in
this country, but when the census comes to be
taken it is found that we have not that increase. I do not know that any more criticism
can be applied to the Government than to the
Opposition.
When they were in power the
Hon.

Mr. TURRIFF.

situation was always practically the same:
when we came to count up heads in the census
we did not have the additional number of
people that the Government claimed had been
brought in.
People come in, but many of
then drift out again.
We do retain some,
and we are getting some back, and Canada is
doing fairlly well, but we bave not a sufficient
increase in population.
My honourable friend
from Nova Seotia who was speaking yesterday
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) contended that if we
kept the population that we did get we should
now have fifteen or twenty million people here
instead of nine or ten millions.
I think that
is probably correct.
The fact that we have not a population of
fifteen or twenty millions proves something:
either that our country is not good enough to
retain them, or that we are not applying a
policy which will retain them.
Which is it?
Is it the fault of the country?
I do net
believe it is.
My own observation is that,
taking it ail round, we have as good a country
as there is on the face of this earth.
What,
then, is the reason why we are losing immigrants or native Canadians? My honourable
friends opposite say that it is the fault of the
policy that has been adopted, that if the
Government were carrying out a proper policy
those people would be retained in this country,
and thbat we ought to protect our industries in
order to retain our people.
My honourable
friends on the other side of the House who
argue along that line forget that they occupied
the Treasury Benches for more than half the
time that has elapsed since high protection was
introduced into Canada, in 1878, some fifty
years ago.
Why blame this Government
particularly?
I have heard it said hundreds
of times, in this House and in the country,
that the party on this side of the House
adopted the tariff policy of my honourable
friends opposite, and, I am sorry to say, honourable gentemen, that there is a good deal
of truth in that sta.tement.
I think that the
Liberal Party, while it has been in power, has
largely maintained the policy of high protection-and, in my judgment, to the detriment
of Canada.
It is not for my honourable
friends opposite to complain of the failure to
retain population, if in the next breath they
assert that the present Government and the
Liberal Party have adopted and continued the
Conservative policy and by that means have
maintained the success of the country.
For
the solution of the problem of retaining and
increasing our population they offer the policy
of high or adequate protection.
Honourable
gentlemen, I do not believe for one moment
that high protection has kept people in the

FEBRUARY 8, 1928
country, or that if a high tariff were continued
or increased, as my honou.rable f riends suggest,
the condition of the country would be bettered.
My own view is that the effeot would lie just
My honourablo friends are
the opposite.
aware that high protection has been carried
on for the past fifty years, and if the results
are as they assert, it cannot lie a good policy
Tbey cannot blame the
for the country.
character of the country for the failure to
maintain population, because the country is
a good one.
Speakiàg as a member from the West,
where a great many of the immigrants have
settled in the past years, I want to say that
in my judgment the way to retain the immigrants who settle on the land or in the towns
is to make the cost of living such that people
will find if e in Canada attractive. If yu
could do that you would not have to spend
millions of dollars every year to bring people
to this country; you would have an immigration agent in every settler who was comfortable and doing well.
What does the settler need? Good, warm,
woollen clothing in the winter, and good cotton clothing i the summer, and boots and
shoes ail the year round. Now, would you
not think that those would be items on which
the duty would be made low? But the contrary lias been the case ahl these years. The
duty on these goods has been kept high.
Agricultural implements are also of great
importance to the setthers. The duty on agricultural implements bas been reduced considerabhy; and let me be f air and say that
in the last twenty-five years, as nearly as I
can remember, the tariff on agricultural implements bas been reduced probably as much
by the Conservative Party as by the Liberals
But instead of belping out the setthers by
admitting free of duty such articles as clothing, boots and shoes, so that a setther of
moderate means might clothe himsehf and
bis family at a moderate cost and prosper
in the country, what has been the situation?
Hligh protection ail through-high protection
on woollens, high protection on cottons, high
protection on boots and shoes.
I remember wben the whole cry of our
manufacturers was: "Give us the protection
that the American manufacturer gets. Put
us on an even footing with bîm and we
shahl be satisfied." Tbey do not say that
at all now. Take the case of boots and sboes.
Every manufacturer in Canada bas not only
the whole of this country for bis market,
but lie bas ahl the territory from the Canadian border down to the Mexican border,
and from the Atantic to the Pacific ocean.
Every manufacturer in Canada can sbip al

91

bis goods in the boot and shoe line into
the United States witbout one cent of duty,
except in the case of a class of boots that
was put on the dutiable list by a smart
practice that was unworthy of the great
American peophe. Some three or four years
ago 1,000 or 1,200 pairs of skiing boots went
into the United States, and the tariff was
monkeyed with, and those boots were entered
as sporting goods. I say that tbat was beneath the dignity of a great nation; but we
ahways have to hook out for that eort of thîng.
There ig another subjeet that I tliink I
might reasonasbly discues, and I am sure the
bonourable membor for Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) wilh understand it, because I ref or
teo bis part of the country. I happened to see
in Hansard a speech by a metaber of the
other House wbo is initerested in the steel
business, aind who lamented that we did noV
have a Governmcnt that would give proper
protection to the industries, -because bundreds
of millions of dollars wortli of goodo that
wcre ooming into Canada sbould be kept out
by proper protection. Wehh, for many years
that has been said for tlie British Empire
Steel Company, one of thea biggest steel
manufacturing organizations in Caunada, and
the speaker was comphaining about it not
having proper protection.
Just let us see for a moment whaît protection that industry bas 'had. If I remember
rightly, some years ago the bounty on steel
was .brought in 'by my right, honourable friend,
Mr. Fielding, and though there was a high
protection on steel which enabled thaît corapany Vo make a very big profit, yet the Governinenit gave it a bounty on the steel
produced amounting to $11,000,000 or $12,000i000. That w.as in addition Vo high protection
against any other steel that was brought into
the country. One wou'ld think the Govemnment bad done pretty well by that company,
but that is flot all. That assistance kept the
company in business for some years, and it
remendously large establishment
built a
there. It soid any amount of preference
stock, and gave common stock with it; but,
in spite of ail that protection, thie company
began gradaially to go down bill.
After a wliile the Great War came on, and
Vihat coinpany camne to, the Government and
said that tbey oould make steel suitable for
cartridges. 1 am not blaming them at ail for
that, but the, Government of the day gave
them a oontract by wliicb Vhey made millions
on millions of dollars. At ail evenis, for years
before they got the ccntraot Vbey bad not

and I think some $6,000,000 was due on it.
That contract foi steel ingots enabled the

92

SENATE

company-I

think it nias the Dominion Iron
and Steel Conipany-tto pay off all their
cumulaitive dividends that had been unpaid
for years, and also increased the value of the
common stock from eight or ten cents on
the dollar to sixty or sixty-five

oents.

If my

memory serves me rigthly, the common stock
anounted to about 20,000,000, so there was
pmctically 810,000,000 given to it.
It might be thought that that was enough
to put the company on its feet, and enable
it to serve -the people of Canada with cheap
goods. But that was not all. I remember
equally weil, when that question was up, that
they claimed they could make boiler plates,
and I heard a statement made by the then
Minister in charge of that work in the House
of Gommons, that they could make boiler
plates cheaply, and could sell them in the
old country. He gave a contract to that
company, and they made a great many plates
for the Canadian Merohant Marine.
But
the minute the war was over they found that
instead of their being able, as they had
boasted, to sell in foreign countries, they
could not sell a single plate at a profit. The
Government then went to the Company and
asked them to cancel the contract, and the
result was that a price was fixed for the
cancellation of the Government's liability to
buy further plates. The amotnt was fixed
at $3,000,000 some odd, and later on there
was a change of Government and a trifling
reduction was made, but over $3,000,000 was
paid to the Company.
Roughly speaking, there was $10,000.000 or
$12,000,000 given in bounties; there was ii
contract
on which they
niade another
$10.000.000 or $12,000,000; and tien there was
the cancellation of the contract for $3,000,000
more. And now what do we find? The company is on the rocks, and calling for more pap.
Are the people of the country going to pay
more pap to keep the concern alive, after it
lias taken about $25,000.000, besides the protection it got?
My honourable friends opposite, when discussing this question, say, "We must have
protection for our industries."
Ilonourable
gentlemen, do you think we want more protection for ithat style of industry in Canada?
Are we going to be asked to bonus it any
further? Are we going to allow our settlers
on the prairies and the people in Ontario,
Queboe and the lower provinces to continue
paying higli prices on everything the fariner
and the settler lias to use? That is the question that we have to decide. If we cannot

are not going to keep them at all, and we
night as well save the millions of dollars
that we are spending to bring people into
the eountry. I think these facts and figures
show plainly that the suggestion made by my
honourable friends opposite, that the way to
improve matters is to give more protection
to our industries, is not founded on solid
facts, and what I said goes a long way to
prove that.
There is another question I wish to touch
on for a few minutes, that is not in any way
linted at in the Speech from the'Throne;
but I think my honourable friend the leader
of the Covernment (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
and the 'honourable leader on the other side
will know by what has taken place in this
House that it is a very live question with the
people throughout the country. I refer to
the question of deepening or not deepening
the St. Lawrence channel between Montreal
and the Great Lakes.
I was very glad to hear the honourable
member for Wellington (Hon. Mr. McDougald) speak on this subject, because of his
experience for some years as Chairman of the
Harbour Commissioners in Montreal, and
being in the very best position to deal intelligently with this problem.
I was olso
pleased to bear fron my Right Honourable
friend from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr.
Graham), and from my honourable friend
from

Grenville

(Hon.

Mr.

Reid),

both

of

those gentlemen having been Ministers of
Railways and Canals.
I was particularly
pleased to find my right honourable friend
advising the Government to go slowly. I
do not believe in rushing into an expenditure
that mi
run from '650,000,000 upwards. Let
me add that anyone is more or less at a disadvantage in speaking on this subject in this
House in the ab-ence of the reports presented to the Government on this subject,
and a heyman like nyself does not know
very much about these things; but there
are two or three points I irant to make
that I think should be mentioned before we
comle to grips with the United States Government.
W hile the American people individually
are very fine people, and I know a great
nany who are just as good people as we
have in Canada, yet in dealing with them
as a nation we might remember an old saying that was used down where I come from
-that when von go to sup soup with the
devil you want to have a long spoon. Now.
iy impression is that when you go to make
a tracoty with the United States Government
you want to know all the facts of the case,
and you need to have your wits about you.

FEBRUARY 8, 1928
1 remember that ivhen 1 was very much
younger there was some treaty or dealing
made by which fresh fish were to go into
United States free of duty, and our fisheries
put up fresh fish and shipped tliem into the
United States, expecting them to go in free;
but in the meantime the United States Congress had put the cans containing fish on
the dutiable list, and practically shut them
out of that country. I ar n ot very clear on
this, but I think in the main I arn right.
There was another matter that came out,
that even the younger men in this House
will remember ail about. When the Panama
Canal was buit a f ew years ago arrangementâ were made that Canada's shipping
would have the same rights in the Canal as
American shipping. That is, if parties in
Toronto or Montreal wanted to send a cargo
of goods to Vancouver, they could be shipped
through the Panama Canal at the same rate
as goods from New York to Seattle or San
Francisco. That was ail very well for a
very short time; but what did Congress do?
It passed an Act taxing Canadian vessels, and
taxing them heavily; and it is to the eternal
credit of the late President Wilson that he
came forward and said, "We made an agreement that Canadian traffic was to pass
through the Panama Canal on the same conditions as ours, and I arn going to disallow
the Act that you have passed" and he did
disallow it. But what would have happened
if a different man had been in the President's
chair? He might have taken the view of
the majority of Congress, and broken the
agreement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend speaks of an agreernent which
interested Canada. It was not limited to
Canada. The agreement made between Great
Britain's representative and the United States
was an agreement which covcred the whole
world.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I arn very glad that
my honourable friend has set me right on
that, but I think I arn right in thc main
effeet of the case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Absolutely; and
ail homage is due to the virile temper and
character of Woodrow Wilson in that matter.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, that is what
I thought. But he is not there any more,
and the only reason I brought this up was
to show that we rnust have our eyes open,
and we ought to have the best men available
to carry out this arrangement of digging a
deep wvaterway up to the Great Lakes. And
here let me say, honourable gentlemen, that

93

I arn tickled to death that our own men will
have the negotiating of this treaty. I arn not
very mucli exercised about whether the men
on the treasury benches sit on this side of
the House, or corne from the other side. I
believe that Canada is every day realizing,
more an~d more, that we have the greatest
asset in the world in the water of the St.
Lawrence.
I was pleased to hear rny honourable friend
from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) say that he
was favourably irnpressed witli the scere as
it was a few years ago, but lie did ziot
know ail the facts now, and lie wanted
the report put on the table.
I quite
agree with that. I was very mucli pleased
with my right honourable friend wlio
advised the Government to go slowly, and I
give credît to the honourable leader of this
House for the fact that the Goveroment lias
submitýed the whole question of the riglits in
water of the St. Lawrence to the Suprerne
Court of Canada for decision. A few years
ago most of us thouglit that the Dominion
Goveroment owned the navigable rivers, the
water and the land under the water, and could
build anything they liked on the banks of the
streams. Now I arn not quite so sure that
we have that right, and I think the Government lias adopted the proper policy in subrnitting that question to the Suprerne Court.
And let me say here that if the Suprerne
Court of ýCanada were to say: You have been
all wrong in the past. The Federal Government has certain rights, but the Province in
which the river is situated also has rights and
privileges, I arn not at aIl certain that sucli
a decision would be bad for Canada. I
rather think it miglit be well for Canada to
have three strong Governrents watching
lynx-eyed te see that the American Government does flot secure one pinhead more than
they are entitled te. I think it would lie well
to have Ontario and Quebec at one with the
Federal Government in seeing to that.
I was very mucli ples sed tihe other day to
hear the honourable gentleman frorn Montreal (Hon. Mr. McDougald) say that in his
opinion the city of Montreal had no reason
to fear the construction of a deep water
channel frorn Montreal to the sea.
I know
it lias been stated in all the papers lately, or
at aIl events in many of tihe Montreal papers,
that it would be a bad thing for Canada te
have a deep water channel built fromn Montreal up to the Great Lakes. That is sornething I could not understand.
Tliey oay it
is the very best policy to deepen tlie channel
fromn Montreal down to the Gulf; but it is a
heinous offence to deepen tihe channeil west
of Montreal. That seerns very strange. Can

if you improve a waterway for a thousand
miles up into the interior of the continent,
so that big vessels cani ply up and down it
and carry freight, it will be a detriment to
any part of Canada?
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: In what newspapers bas my honourable friend read the
report that there is opposition to the improvement of the channel between Montreal and
the Lakes?
Hon. Mr. TURRIEF: I would say the
Montreal Star and the Montreal Gazette.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: 1 do not think
SO.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honoura:ble friend
ought to be very much better posted in
that matter than I arn.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: When the honourable gentleman makes a statement like
that, I think he should naine the papers. I
do not think there bas been any opposition
at ail.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Has the Montreal
Gazette not opposed the deepening of the
channel up to the Lakee?
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: No.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I mnay be wrong in
that, but I have seen other papers quutiug
articles opposing that fromn the Montreal
Gazette and the Montreal Star. However, I

how it could take such a position.
events, as I say, some papers have taken that
position, and I have not been able to understand why they sbould.
As I was saying, I was very glad to hear
the honouraýble gentleman from Montreal
(Hon. Mr. McDougald) say that it was lis
considered opinion that Montreal would flot
be hurt by the deepening of the dhannel, but
that, on the other hand, ber trade and harbour
wýould be improved by it very much.
Now, there are une or two things that I
want to say particularly to my honourable
friend the leader of tire House. In my judgment no treaty of any kind should be made
with the United States until two or three
matters bave heen settled. First of aIl, no
ti'caty should be made with the United States
until the Chicago water steal is settled. That
should be settled beforehand, net afterwards.
WVhat would be the use of our spending hundreds of millions of dollars in deepening the
channel if the United States could tap Lake
Hon.

Mr. TURRIFF.

Michigan, as they are doing now, to the extent, 1 understand, of 10,000 cubie feet per
second? That is a lot of water to be taken
out of the Lakes-water that should come
down the St. Lawrence river. Apparently
the United States Congress is not able te stop
that diversion and I tbink the Government
here would be justified in saying tbat until
that matter is settled we will not move hand
or foot. The United States need the waterpower and the channel far more than we do
at the present time, and if our Government
stands firm I think it will get what it wants.
As I was going te say a moment ago, I amn
glad that it ris our own people who are dealing with that question, so that we will flot
bave another fiasco like tbe Alaskan boundary aif air.
There is one other point that should be
settled. No ownership or right or title that
we now have, in wbatever shape or form it
may be, should be alienated te tbe slightest
degree. Tbe St. Lawrence river is our property. I understand that traffie bas always
gone down the river on the Canadian side, but
I bear that the report of the engineers would
change ail that, and states that between
Prcscott and Montreal the canal should be
built on the American side. I do not know
whether that is truc or not, but I think the
Goveroment should se to it that nothing
that we bave at the presenit time is given
away in any manner whatsoever.
There is only one other subject upon whichi
I want to touch in this connection. If, as
reports say, there will be 4,000,000 hydraulie
horse-power on the Canadian side, and a
couple of million horse-power on the Amenicani side, I tbink we should be very careful indeed to provido against any part of the power
that is generated in Canada being alienated
or exported to the United States. If somne
American firm. were to come along and say:
"'Here, wc want to get one million horsepower; you do not want it and cannot use
it for the next twenty or twenty-five years;
scîl it to us, and when you want it we will
give it up on five years notice "; does any
honourable gentleman think that ever in God's
world wc would get that power back? Why,
it would be said: "You were a party to, buýilding up this town of 50,000 or 100,000 people;
it was built on the strength of tbe power
that we bought from you and paid for. We
cannot be expected to give tbat Up now, and
won't do it." What would we do under those
circumstances? The population of the United
States is twelve times that of Canada. and
they would do pretty nearly whatever they
wanted in spite of us. Se, I say the only

FEBRUARY 8, 1928
thing we can do is make provision in the
Bill providing for the treaty that the Canadian Governrent cannot grant a license for
the export of current to anybody outside of
Canada without the approval. and consent of
Parliament. I believe if that were done
perhaps we would be able to retain what is
our own.
We have many resources. We have farm
lands that eventually rnay not be as good as
they are to-day; we have great fisheries which
eventually may be sornewhat depleted; we
have great timber and pulp resources, which
eventually may bcecut down or burned over.
But in the St. Lawrence river we have a
heritage that is ours, and ours alone, a heritage that should he handed down to our
children for rnany generations to corne, so
that a thousand years frorn now it stili will
be flowing on and bringing prosperity to the
people of Canada. We should keep fast
hold upon that river and every horse-power
that can be generated upon it should be
utilized in Canada. We should stand by our
guns and not allow it te he chiselled away
frorn us.
Those are the things I would like to see
done before any deal whatever is made with
the United States Government, and upon that
basis I hope to see the canal built. If it
cannot be huilt upon that basis, I hope it
neyer wiil be buit. Let us keep that power
fur ourselves. It won't be more than twentyfive years when we can use it ail. If Amenicans want to buy that power, let us say: "Ail
right, but you will have to use it in Canada.
Build your factories here and give ernployment to Canadian workrnen."
Now, I have spoken longer than I intended,
and I shah neot trespass any further. I simply
want to say that 'I have every confidence
that the Government, of which rny honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is such
an ornarnent, will see that Canada is fully
and thoroughly protected. Let us alremember,
honourable gentlemen, that it will be a cold
day for the person or party that gives away
this henitage.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to address myself ver
briefly to one at least of the questions which
have been discussed during the past few days
in this House. First of ail, with ail the other
members of this House, I should like to cxtend a very hearty wehcorne te the new
members who have taken their seats with us.
I congratulate the Government upon the
choice which has been made, partieularly, if
I may say so-because I know them betterupon the members from. mv own Province.

They are men who are in every way fit and
capable of representing the great intcrests o!
that Province. I go further: I congratuhate
the Governrnent upon having called to this
House a representative of the French race
frorn the Province of Ontario. They have
followed a very wise example. The previous
Governrnent thought it just and proper that
the 500,000 Canadians o! French extraction
who inhabit the Province of Ontario should
have a representative in the Governrnent, and
I arn glad that the present Goverament has
tho'ught it fair and wise that they should
have a representative in the Senate. I congratulate thern upon their determination in
this respect.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I should like
to say a word or two upon what has been,
and evidently will continue to be, the crucial
problem o! Canada. Tirne and again it bas
been stated, and admitted, that the future
o! Canada depcnds upon the movement of
her population. I say "movement" because
I intend to treat separately the incorning and
the outgoing population. I shahl address rnyself to the honourable member frorn Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) because in doing se
I shall be speaking to a representative o! the
Vhree Western Provinces.
For years, hionourable gentlemen, we have
been rnakinS strenuous efforts to bring people
to those three provinces.
Great sacrifices
have been made Iby the East; and witýhin the
last five years the Government bas spenit over
$11,000,000 to induce people in the Uniited
States and in Europe to settle there. I
venture the assertion that the Canadian railways in the same period have spent nit least
as large an amount. We have therefore
expended approximately 320,000,000 within five
years in trying to increase our population in
the West.
What sucoess have we achieved?
Few
people realize, honourable gentlemen, the
appalling rapidity with which the rate of increuse in the western provinces is dwindhing.
After the war we encouintered a period of
bard tirnes, Over-production had brought
about the closing down o! many of our industries, and, as everybody will admit, the
farmers were suiffering cruelly. They did not
receive adequate return for their produce,
and yet they had to pay higb pnrices for
everything required in their cahling. During
the five years from 1916 to 1921 what was
the ratio of increase ini the three western
provinces? It was as fohlows. In Manitoba
there was an increase of 10 per cent; in
Saskatchewan of 17 per cent; in Alberta o!
18.5 per cent. Notwithstanding the period of

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

papers have repeated time and again the
opinions of men at the head of banks, insurance companies, trust comipanies, and railways, to that effect. For the purpose of this
argument I amo ready to admit that we are

population much faster than it did in the
five years ending in 1921? So serious does
the situation look that an investigation, I
am glad ta say, is about to take place in
anotlir place; se I trust, at all events. But
let us compare the ratio of increase in the
last five years with the increase in the five
years ending in 1921. In Manitoba the ratio
of increase lias fallen ta 4.7 per cent-less
than 5 per cent: it lias been cut in two within

down ta 8 per cent-less than half of what
it was in the preceding five-year period. In
Alberta it lias fallen from 18.5 per cent ta
3.3 per cent.
What lias become of all our past efforts?
What have we donc with the millions that
we have poured into the West? Can we say
that the system we have adopted and carried
out is one that we can afford ta continue?
I contend, lonourable gentlemen, that this
mnatter is more serious than all the other
problems of the country put together. It is
said, and it is true, that this country lias
been blessed with an over-abundance of riches
of all sorts. Everybody admits that. We are
blessed in our geographical situation, protected by two moats 3,000 miles and more
in width, against aggression from Asia and
from Europe. We have plenty of timber, we
have enormous resources in water-power, w-e
have an abundance of lands and fisheries, and
we possess more coal than the whole of
Europe. To this Paradise of riches of all
sorts we invite the stranger-nay, we gather
in immigrants by the hundreds, paying their
passage to this country and settling them on
the land, and yet when after five years we
take stock we find that they have all, or
Hon.

Mr.

BEAURIEN.

practically all, left us. What is the matter?
How can we afford ta keep on losing population?
I would suggest ta the honourable member
who has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Turriff) that
lie might with profit read a portion of the
speech delivered in another place by the
Minister of Immigration. The Minister said:
"In my own province, unhappily, the crop of
cereals bas been very disappointing, but
fortunately we have mixed farming and that
lias saved the country ta a large extent."
The proposition I would put to the honourable gentleman fromi
Assiniboia (Hon. Mr.
Turriff) and te all the western members of
this House is this: You may, it is true,
expert your wheat quite easily, for nothing
can be exported more cheaply, but the time
when the land, instead of being cultivated,
may be mined, as it has been for years past,
will come te an end some day. Indeed it
bas ended in certain parts of Manitoba, and
the people there are now obliged te find
another means for Mother Earth to feed lier
children: that is, mixed farming. But, tell
rue, can you expert the products of mixed
farming as you can expert your wliat? No.
What is required for mixed ftarming?
A
home market. You cannot escape the fact
tliat the farmer requires a home market.
And liow can lie get a home market unless
you have industries? In this country, situated, as it is, alongside one of the most
powerful nations in tlie worldI ino finance
and in industry. can you reasonably expect
to have industries without a reasonable
measure of protection?
I will not dwell
longer on this proposition. I may be wrong,
but it seems self-evident and docs not
require te be laboured at all.
If anybody thinks that industry can exist
in this country without a reasonable measure
of protection, let him have the courage to
dig down in his pocket and buy some
industrial stock. My honourable friend lias
said, "No protection for the steel industry."
It is very easy for a man te say that who
lias not taken a personal interest in the study
of an industry of that kind; but here is Plie
problei as I would put it to my honourable
friend. If in Belgium or in Germany men
engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel
are paid at the rate of $1 or $1.25 a day, and
if for similar services it is necessary to pay
them in this country $7 a day-as it is-what
is going to happen to your Canadian industry

when. manufactured in Canada, does nlot that
furnish us with convincing evidence that a
icasonable amount of protection must be
granted to such an industry or it must die?
When 1 hear honourable gentlemen from the
WVest complaining, I cannot help recalling the
plea once made by a young man w1ho had
killed his father and was on trial for hie life.
His plea ivas that the jury should have pity
on a poor orphan. If there are any difficulties

Are they nlot the people who have caused the

Everybody knows that the Goverament 'bas
ha.d to respond to their commands, and that
on account of the actual reductions in the
tariff and the fear of further reductione in the
future, which. is equally damaging, our induetries are eeriously suffering?
I venture the prediction that before long
our West will follow in the footetepe of the
American Weet: it will recognize the necessity
of a home market; it will admit that to provide
a home market we muet 'have industries; and
it will fina'lly recognize that we cannot have
industries without a reasona;bie measure of

Let me now deal, honourable gentlemen,
wit.h another point, the question of the out1 requested the Dominion
going population.

figures showing the number o-f Canadiane who
left the country for the United States within
the pa2t year. I have heen able to obtain
the figures for eleven months. He informe
me that the number of persone who have so
emigrated in the past eleven months is 62,00
and some hundreds. That means that approxirnately 70,000 Canadians have left us during
the year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: How many have
returned?

arn going to put the argument tb him. There
can bce no better man te judge it, because,
although he leads this House, hie party considerations do not count when he sees clearly
that his patriotic duty lies in a parbicular
direction; and I arn going to show it to hlm.

incrcascd in population la the last five years
by 363,000. The total hy immigration wvas
183,000; by natural increase, 180,000. But
Did he ever
what is the net increase?
inquire? Lt was 111,000. What le the loss?
It was 252,000 in the bhree western provinces
atlone. We have made an investigation al
througb the Province of Quebec, and we
know that wibhin those five years the losses
have been appalling. 1 put this proposition
up to my honourable friend: if lb be brue
that by bbc actual census of 1921, compared
with the statisties of Washington, we have
lest exaetly three times as many men as
were regietered by the American Government as having gone into the United States,
is it not moet likely that the eame
discrepancy in records persiste tb this day?
Is that nlot apparent, fromn the lues made in
tlie three Western provinces alone?

FEBRUARY 8, 1928
so moving as ta hear those people speak of
their îId bomesteads. I remember an oid
man sayîng that hie had spent most of his
life in the We.st, int.ending to settie perma-nentiy there and bring up his family, but
hie neyer bad forgotten the silver voice of
the angelus bell that called everybody to
prayer at 7 o'clock at night, and that hie had
saved and put aside enough money ta corne
baek and hear it again.
Let us flot farget that here we have a very
immense country, and as wealthy as it is
immense, but we have ta carry the weight of
iAon aur shoulders, and we know how difficuit
it is ta keep aur own population united,
because differî-nces af interest growv from the
immcnsity af space. Therefore if part ai aur.
Eastern population must maya, by ail means
]et it go West. In that case it will have a
new home in the West and the aid bomestead
in the East; and the ties between the two,
more than anything else, will make this
country united and strong.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, in closing this debate I should
like to informn my honourabla friand from
Mantarvilla (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that the
situation in the threa western provinces is
flot as bad as hie statad it. Thera was possibly
a Ioss ai population there during a certain
part ai the last five years, but I draw his
attention ta the fact that around 1920 and
1921 prices af western praducts were so law
ihat the mmnd ai the population was considerably depressed. During the last flirce years it
bas moved towards optimism. We have had
thrae good craps, and I amn convinced that
the next five years, or the next cansus, will
show quita an increased ratio in population.
Thare is no hetter immigration agent than
a prosperous farmer, and when during three
or four years a cry goes out fromn thase three
provinces that farmîng is nat a paying
proposition, it is not surprising that population should not be attracted ta those
lands'
or that people who have been a certain number ai years without being able ta meet their
liabilities at the bank have felt like looking
eisawhere, as a venture, ta better thair conditions. But from what I hear, during the
iast two or tbree years, another sentiment is
permeating the west, and I arn in hopes that
prosperity sucb as we had in pre-war times
will reappear, and that we will retain not only
the native population and its natural increase,
but the immigrants that camne here.
Naturally we lose constantly towards the
south, but there is a mavement bath ta and
fro, and with the advantages that we have
been getting in the west, I beliave that con56109-7 j

ditions wiil go on appearing in a very favourable liglit. My bonourable friend asks what
the Govarnment has done. It has done its
best ta improve the condition of the western
fariner. I heard a praminent membar ai the
Progressive Party f rom the West state that
ai- course the western farmer wanted ta buy
bis manufactured goods as chaaply as passible, but that the primary thing the western
farmer wanted was cheaper transportation.
We hava lately improved those conditions,
and have given cheapar transportation ta the
West, and I amn reaily convinced that, generalIy speaking, the western farmer in those
three provinces is to-day quite satisfied with
bis lot. We know thiat iromn many sources;
frem the banks that have branches in tauch
with the farîners; and through the press; and
ail this will make for an increased immigration in the wcst.
No, I tbink presperaus times are now at
band; I believe that impravement wilI camne
mostiy from. the presperity of the farmer.
Of course, we ivant prespereus industries, and
ta a large extent wc have them. One has
only ta look at the annual statemants made
lately by the variaus industries oi the land
ta see, by the balance sheets and the dlvidends paid, that the industries are on a good
footing.
My boneurable friend has expre.ssed the
fear that we were net taking care of and
siipervising the immigrants whe are with
us, and the tuition wbieli is given them. But
I amn inforrmed that thare is a hrancb ai this
Gavernmcnt. which existed prier te the
present Geverninent, but which is quite
active new, that keeps close watchi over wlîat
is gaing on among the foreign population,
and that is quite informied ai the propaganda
wbich is being cenducted, and is doing- its
hest te check it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
That iýs quite,
truc; I arn very well aware that the Government is informed; but that is net my point.

Why dees net the Governinient deport the
people who are opcnly teacbing
aur midst? That is known ta
nient; it bas been known for

Soulanges-Vaudreuil, which he represented in
the House of Commons for many years.
Sicleness prevented himi fromn participating in
our labours.
The sad news reached us this morning of
the demise of Senator Cloran. Our Iamented
colleague had a varied experience in many
fields. He was a barrister and a journalist;
he was active in literary, athietic and
national asïsociations in the city of Montreal.
He was a candidate in his native city, as
well as in Prescott, for the House of Coinmons. He was Reeve and Mayor of Hawkesbury. He toole a very close interest in the
work of the Senate, and was heard on many
questions. He was a fluent and eloquent
speaker.
XVe regret the departure of our friends and
colleagues. To their families we extcnd our
warmest sympathy.

along with the honourable Leader of the

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Now that we are adjourning for such a long time, I would like to
ask my honourable friend if he could arrange
with the Departiment of External Affairs to
give uis a précis of the documents relating te
the Chicagýo Drainage Canal and the diversion
of water there. I do flot ask for docuîments.
There seemns to bc a very great difference of
opinion abroad as to what flhc actual facts
are in connection with this matter. Some
people dlaim that wc agreed to the diversionthat there was an arbitration or commission
sent thiere; some say that one quantity was to
bc taken, others say another, and others that
thiere was a contract in regard to the water at
Niagara. If my hionourable friend would ask
the Department to let us have a précis of
the facts, it could be laid on the Table for
our instruction after the vacation. It would
be a sort of brief, and would tell us where
the documenté are to be found.

VENEREAL DISEASES BILL

RETUI1NS FIIOM IIRANCII LINES

SECOND READING

Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable genf lenen, 1 have flic hionour f0 lav on the
fable tlhe Report of the Boaîrd of Railway
Commi ,-tîoner.s.

Hon. E L. GIRROIR moved the second
reading of Bill D, an Act to make venereal
disease an impediment to marriage.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I could
say a good deal with regard to this Bill; ini
fact, I have prepared considerable material
in support of it; but I do flot intend to
present it at this time.
Generally speaking, the Bill is founded on
a desire to give our coming Canadians a clean
bill of health. In animal husbandry we endeavour te provide a dlean bill of health for
the stock which wc raise; but in the human
field nothîng of that kind has been done; and
it scems to me that we shouild follow the lead
of certain of the States in the Republie to
the south of us, and should endeavour te
prevent people who have venereal disease
scaftcring it over the country and doing
great damage to our race.
Just to show you the seriousness of the
situation, I wilIl read a short article from the
Canada Lanoet and Practibioner. This article
is written by Dr. Gordon Bates, an expert
in the field of social hygiene, who in the
course of a very good letter says:

UNITED STATES FLAG IN CANADA
MOTION FOR RETURN

lion. Mr. TANNER moved:
That an Order of the House do issue for a
retumo of copies of ail correspondence in 1927
bctween F. W. Gilday, M.D., of Montreal, and
the Departmnent of Marine and Fisheries, and
the Departmcnt of the Secretary of State in
respect to the flying of the flag of the United
States in Canada.
The motion was agrced to.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

A man in the city of Brantford applied to
the City Relief Officer for coal and groceries

for bis fami]y. lie snid that lie liad rheumnatiam
and was unable to work. He was sent to, the
hospital for exaininabion and after careful in-

vestigation the following f sets were elicited. It
was found that several cbildren had died. The

MARCH 13, 1928
man was found to be syphilitic, also hîs wif e.
The following describes the condition of the
living children:
The eldest child is partially blind and deaf.
The next two children are deaf and dumb.
The fourth is a cripple.
The fifth is an idiot.
The sixth is mentally defective.
Syphilis is the cause of this situation.
IMproper care of children in the home, resulting in f aise ideals, ignorance as to the f acto
which should be considered when marriage is
entered into, the broken home whether caused
by separation of parents or death of parents,
bad housing conditions, the lack of such a procedure' as periodic health examination-these and
a thousand and one other factors have to do
-with the existence of such disease. So that as
one goes an studying the problems of disease
prevention one finds that the whole question
hecomes more and more complicated.
As I have said, in many of the states of the
United States they have a law similar to
the one which 1 arn advocating, and no
marriage can take place without a physical
examination. I do not mean for one moment
to say that this is the 'last word upon the
subject; it may be that this Bill will have
to be added to or amended bef ore it is passed;
but at ail events, it ie an earnest effort to
safeguard the heaith of the race. I do flot
know that this is the proper tribunal to deal
with this Bill, and I would suggest that it
be referred ta the Comxnittee on Health, to
which I would like to see added the name of
the Hon. Dr. Rankin.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should like to
sp'e the Bill discussed. It seems ta me tat
the second reading should not be allowed ta
go without some discussion. Personailly I am
not prepared ta say anything about it at the
moment.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill is one that of course should be
t.haroughly discussed; at the saine time, it is
of such a nature that one does not care very
much about discussing it in public. For that
reason I think the Bill should he sent ta a
committee, the proper anc probably being the
Standing Committee on Public Health.
Under the Bill the question of whether any
marriage shall take place or not is entirely dependent upon the certificate of the physician.
Il that certificate is ta be of any service whatever, there bas got ta be a very thorough examination of bath the expectant bridegroom
and the expectant bride--an examination that
is very far from, being a mere formality. If
your expectant groom and bride simply have
ta go to a physician and pay a f ee in order
ta get a certificate, without undergoing a
tboeough examination, you had better have no
Bill at ail. It would be introducing into the
ceremony of marriage the saine farce that has

been in vogue in certain provinces where they
have had a prohibitory law with respect to
alcoholie beverages--that people simply had
ta pay $2 for their prescription, when they
could get the liquor. I imagine the situation
in regard ta marriage would be somewhat the
same if the Bill were left in its present form.
If the law is ta be of any use at ail the examination must be a thorough one, and the
certificate of the physician must, mean exactly
wvhat it says, namely, that the two parties are
free from any taint of venereal disease.
I think this matter could be more thoroughly
and satisfactorily discussed by a suitable
Committee, where the members would be in
a position ta secure the technical advice which
may be required.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: We could take the
second reading of the Bill with the understanding that we are leaving the principle open.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is what I
was going ta suggest.
Hon. J. D. REID: I would like ta ask
whether the Parliament of Canada bas a right
ta say who shahl or wbo shahl not marry. I
have always understood that the provinces
If -that
governed in the matter of marriage.
ie the ceue, I think it would be welh ta let the
Bihl stand until the Leader of the House can
make oome inquiries of the Justice Department as ta whether or not the Bill, if passed,
would be ultra vires. If we were ta go on
discussing the Bill for some days and then find
that ta be the case, we would appear ridiculous
in the eyes of the provinces.
I think this Bill
Another point is this.
would. have a better chance of getting through
Parliament if it originated in the House of
Gommons.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Under the British North
Amnerica Act, marriage and divorce are given to
the Parliament of Canada; what is reserved
ta the provinces is the celebration of marriage
-the mere f orm.
Hon. Mr. REID: I have always understood
that the Dominion Parliament had no jurisdiction whatever as ta marriage, but that it
belonged ta the provinces.
H.on. W. B. ROSS: That is the celebration.
of the marriage.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The form of the
ceremony.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Who is ta celebrate it,
and the number of witnessee required.
Hon. Mr. REID: Even s0, I think the Bill
might better originate i the House of Commons, as possibhy it will meet with more
opposition there than here.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If the suggestion
of the Leader of the Opposition is accepted,
1 cari see no, reason wby the Bill should flot
go to the Committee on Healtb, as suggested
by the mover.
Hon. Mr. REID: If the honourable gentleman and the other legal gentlemen take the
position that it is within our jurisdiction, ail
right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Persona]ly I think
it is, but I would rather the Bill went to the
Committee witbout the buse committing
iteif to, the principle of it.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: The Parliament of
Canada bas passed a Bill permitting the
marriage of a mani with bis deceased wife's
sister, showing that tbey have authority to
say wbo shahl or who shall not mar-y.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

ment ta lay on the Table of the Senate the

Re said: Honourable gentlemen, .iust a day
or two before we adjourned I asked the Leader
of the Governiment if 'he would lay on the
Table the reporte of the Commission and th<Ad.visory Committee in connectian with the
St. Lawrence Waterway.
The honourable

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

The Joint Comn-

Hon. Mr. REID:
A Joint International
Commission. The report of the Advisory Committee, he stated, ha conld not lay on, the
Table at the time for the reason that the
Government were carrying on negotiations
with the Government 0f the United States,
and that the making public of the repart
might interfere witih the negotiations. That
was a f air answ'er, and a gaod reason why 1
should delay going on with tÀhe discussion of
this matter at that time.
I, af caurse, should have liked ta have read
that report, which is a very important docunment as well as other infarmation, before
making the few remarks that I intend ta
mnake to-day, and I Vhink I had better explain at the autset, in anticipation of a ques.-

tion from the Leader of the Government,
why I am waiting 0nolonger. Shortly after
we adjourned I began to sec 'items in the
newspapers indicating that others than ourselves had been given this report, and that
already propaganda had been started in favour
of the findings of the Advisory Committee.
That being so, surely it is not unfair to request that it should be given te the members
of the House of Commons and of the Senate.
In the Toronto Star of February 21st appears
evidence that this report was in the hands of
outsiders. Here is the item to which I refer,
headed, "Stamp of approval put on waterways," and stating:
City Couneil expresses approval of St. Lawrence developnent plans. The City Council
yesterday-That is, the city council of Toronto-expressed its approval of the St. Lawrence
developinent schemnes in adopting a motion
froin Alderman Boland recommended wi
aimrendment by the board of control.
Alderman Boland's original motion read as
follows: "That this coucil do record its
unaninsS approval of the report of the National Advisory committee appointed in consection with the St. Lawrence waterway
development as essential in the proper development of Canada and look forward to the
adoption of plans which will provide for the
commencement of the work at the earliest
date, and that a copy of this resolution be
sent to the prime minister of Canada and to
the representative of the city in the Senate
and in the House of Commons."
Board of control, in dealing with this motion
before submitting it to council, deleted with the
consent of Alderman Boland, the words
"unanimous" and "report of the National Advisory Committee appointed in connection with
the," and made it read "and recommend the
adoption of the motion." Council passed the
motion as amended.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend what paper be is reading
from?
Hon. Mr. REID: The Toronto Star of
February 21st this year.
Then again I have before me another paper,
tise Mail and Empire, in which an item
appears, headed, "No joint control of St.
Lawrence." It says:
Chairman of Advisory Board on Developnient speaks at St. John. Tallk is deplored. Hon.
W. E. Foster warns against heeding immature
statements.
In my judgment that refers to the report
of the Advisory Committee.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
of that?

What is the date

Hon. Mr. REID: The dispatch is dated St.
John, New Brunswick, February 14th. In
ihis item this gentleman makes two statements
Hon. Mr. REID.

which, I must say, I do nat consider ta be in
accordance with the facts contained in the
report of the Joint Waterways Commission.
A little later I will explain what those points
are. The item continues:
Hfe described the power and navigation possibilities, the favorable features which the
river possessed, traced the work of the various
bodies that have been investigating it for some
years and dealt with the treaty rights of the
United States, as applicable to the present
situation.
Another part of the item states:
"I have never yet heard any serions suggestion," he said, "that if the work is proceeded
-with there would be involved any joint control
by Canada and the United States of any works
undertaken in purely Canadian territory.
United States rights in the St. Lawrence River
are already defined and covered by special
treaties. United States ships freely pass up
and down the St. Lawrence River through
purely Canadian territory, and at the command
of the skippers of Uncle San's ships their
whistles are obeyed at all Canadian locks withaist hesitation.

"Statements have also appeared fron time
to time tending to arouse the public mind in
opposition to the project by intimation that it
will involve Canada, and therefore the taxpayers in a very large expenditude of money
Any proposail that would cast doubt upon the
steady reduction in taxation, susch as we have
hsad in recent years, would certainly meet with
strong opposition froin the country as a whole.

Hon. Mr. REID: I think that was the

Ap"Says Al-Canadian plan Unfeasible."
arentx-l these gentlemen to whom I refer
iave before tbem,¶n discussing -this question,
the report of the Advisory Committee, whicl
is being passed on by someone. I do not
think for one minute that the Government
are doing that, but if someone is passing on
ihis Advisory Committee's report so that city
couicils and boards of control may pass resolutions of that kind, I feel justified in taking
up this question and discussing it here at
the present time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Is General Mitchell
s member of the Advisory Committee?
Hon. Mr. REID: No; he was a member
of the International Joint Waterways Commission.
This question is, in my judgment, one of
the most important that has ever come before

MARCH 14, 192
this Parliament. I do flot believe that members of the House of Commons or the Senate
realize the importance of it. It would take
a long time perhaps to lay before you all'the
different questions that might be raised. I
will make my remarks a brief as 1 can, and
will promise not to take up much time.
During the recess I have studied very carefully the report made by the International
Joint Waterways Commission. 1 'live on the
St. Lawrence and was born and brought up
there. AIl the improvements that have been
made on the St. Lawrence waterway during
the last forty years I have seen and followed,
and I know ail the conditions on that river.
I am deeply interested. The province of
Ont ario is deeply interested, and I maintain
that if the improvements that are recommended in this report are to be carried out,
the situation is very serious for Canada as
a whole.
The Commission have divided their report
into several sections. One deals with navigation alone, a second deals with power, and
then the two subWets are combined. For my
part I want to divide the question into the
following subi ects, in order to discuss each
separately: <1) navigation; (2) power, (3)
how the project will atffect Montreal Harbour;
(4) how it will affect Ontario and Quebec;
and (5) how it will affect Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
First, navigation. Let me explain to honourable members the present condition. Vessels
with a load of 500,000 bushels and of 18 feet
draught can proceed with safety, from Port
Arthur to Port Coîborne or Buffalo. At
present no vessel drawing more than 14 feet
can pass into Lake Ontario through the
Welland Canal. but next year it wiIl take
vessels of 25 fret drauglit. After Ieaving the
Weland Canal vessels of 18 fret drauglit can
proceed with safety, as they can between
Port,.Arthur and Port Colborne, riglit through
Lake Ontario and for 67 miles down the St.
Lawrence River, untîl they reach a point
t.hree miles below the town of Prescott and
the city of Ogdensburg. From there on to
Montreal the course, through the canaIs and
the River St. Lawrence, permite of vessels
of 14 fecet draught. That is the present condition.
The first. thing that amazed me was the
statement that the present depth of navigation between Port Arthur and Port Coîborne
or Buffalo was only 18J feet. I must confess
that 1 had always believed we had 25 feet.
Some years ago it was decided to elarge the
Welland Canal to permit of 25 feet draught.
I made inquiries; I desired to ascertain why,
if we had enlarged the Welland Canal to a

107

drauglit of 25 feet, no vessels drawing more
than l8ý feet could proceed to Port Coîborne
or Buffalo.
If you look back a few years you will find
that we did have 25 feet of navigation. You
cannot pass through the locks on the Amenican side to-day with more than 19j f eet,
thougli they were built for 25 feet. Our
locks at Sault Ste. Marie to-day permit of a
draught of only 18j feet. You could get
through thcmn with 25 feet if cnough water
were there. It was there at one time. Why
is it not there now?
Looking through the Commission's report,
I saw several reasons given to explain. why
the levels on the lakes and the rivers between Port Arthur and Port Coîborne have
been reduced. The Commission say, first,
that the outlets have been cnlarged. That is,
between Lake Superior and the next lake the
opening lias been deepened and w1idened,
and the saine is true aIl the way down. The
next reason given to explain why the lakes
and rivera have been reduced from their
former levels is the diversions, and they
enumerate the following:
(a) The operation of the regulating works
constructed to correct for power diversion in
the St. Mary's river at the outiet of Lake
Superior.
*(b) The diversion of the Chicago Sanitary
District from Lake Michigan.
(c) The diversion from Lae Erie f or power
and navigation through the Welland Canal and
the Niagara river.
(d) Changes in the discharge capacity of the
St. Clair river et the outlet of Lake Huron and
of the St. Lawrence river affecting Lake Ontario.
(e) The diversion on the Niagara river for
navigation purposes through the Black Rock
Canal for power purposes also affects the level
of Lake Erie.
(f) The diversions via the Welland Canal
and Black Rock Canal affect not only the
levels of Lake Erie, but also to a small. degree
the levels of Lakes Michigan and Huron.
Therefore the outlets and diversions have neduced the safety of navigation between Port
Arthur and Port Coîborne from 25 feet to
18% feet.
Now, let me tell you what the diversions
mean, as I interpret the report. On the St.
Mary's river, at Lake Superior, there are of
course the loeks, but water powers have been
developed there and this has affected the
levels. At Niagara, as mapiy of our Ontario
people know, the Chippewa Power Company
and other power companies have made developments, 8o that the volume of water
coming through is much greater than formerly,
and the lake levels are consequently lowened.
That is the present state of our navigation.

Commission ia this. Thev say, spend $41,700i..

muaIt about that part of our country; but
what I arn afraid of is that if you deepen the,

mwater la not kept uniform, Montreal barbour
ran ho improved by dredging it out; and they
>a3 that a dam might be constructed below
Montreal so that we, could control Montreal
harbour; but frcom these statements by the
Commission I conclude that Montreal barbour
is in danger if this proposition is put through.
It might be asked why thosc weîrs could
riot be kept right. One element tha.t makes
Ibis doubtful is that the Commission recornrnend that if the power bouse is to be conz-tnîcted the dam wbich ia to develop 2,000,000
hoi'sepowei' is to be put entiroly on the United
States side of the boundary line, and that
.ome weirs are to be constructed on the
United States side and I suppose also, on the
Canadian side. So fir as the power houac is
concernerd thcy recommcnd that the United
Statea. Gox-ernrnent agree that the Internaulonal boundary line in the river, or at the
island whero tîjis power house is to ho conistructed, shall go through the centre of the
power house building, leaving one-balf of the
building in Canada and the other hoîf in the
United States. Now, wben this dam is huilt,
an~d the power bouses on it are on the United
States aide of tbe boundary, oje would tbink
that the control and oporation would ho in
t he bande of the United States Glovernment;
but from this report I corne to the conclusion
that as the, United States Government bas
given a private compony at Messina, N.Y.,
the power in perpetuity, and if any trouble
arises hctween the Dominion of Canada anld
the United States in connection with the
operation of tbe power or weirs at that point
Canada 'will bave to deal wih this privitte
crorporation, or tbe matter will bave to ho
decided by tbe United States Courts.
At certain periods of the year, when the
water is low, at least lower thon it is in tbe
spring, it comnes to, a question whether Montmeal harbour or the power usera in the United
States must suffer, I amn afraid that Montreal
borbour wiIl bave to play second. It would
ho diflicult to control the weirs, or to get tbat
power company to, allow them to he opened
as tbey ahould ho, becouse it is urged that
tbis dam should ho so constructed that the
whole 2,000,000 horse-power can ho developed
aù once. It might ho thought Vhat the
Amerian Gpvernrnent would control that
matter, but I arn afraid that as the Un.ited
State9 Government have sold their intereat s
to a privote company and therefore the
property is owned hy tbat power cornpany,
which hold.a a deed ia perpetuity; and I
would ho afraid that what bas happened with
the Chicago Drainage canal might happen
bore, and we would have to go Vo a United

109

States Court as we did a good many years
ago, to geV tbe Chicago Drainage question
settledL-altbougb it is noV acttled, and I fear
wiIl not ho for a long time yet. But while
ai] those ne-gotiations would ho proceeding,
the Montreal harbour would suifer, and unleas
inatters wero properly adjusted the Montroal
harbour woîild flot ho the terminal for ocean
traffio.
Up te the prescrnt ime, therefore, I note
threo objections. One is tbe removal of the
ishind at Galops Rapids wbicb holds back the
water in the St. Lawrence up Vo Lake Ontario,
and placing obz'trtctions in our prescrnt
Canadian channel so tbat we could flot use
it as the river channel for vessels in future.
Tlhat wviil affect river navigation aIl the way
thriugh to Montreal in this way. Everyone
living in tbat Iocality knows that the river
and Lake Ontario waters are vory much
bighier in the spring, at toast in May, June,
andi perbaps baîf of July, than in the following montha. The water bas heen held back,
in Lake Ontario during the winter hy those
islands at Galops Rapids and the ice, so that
in spring we bave Vwo or tbree rnontbs of
good deep water navigation; but when the
water is <lrawn off, ail winter by the power
company for power purposes, the flow la noV
as good as bofore.
The second objection is that wo put 24
miles of this ehannel entircly in American
teriitorv, and tluat places absolute control or
bonds4 te the United States the key for control
of navigation in the St. Lawrence. The
rcaýson I %vould like to sec the present conditions romain is that I foot that something
.should ho donc to protoot the Province of
Ontario in regard to the important coal ques,ion by bringing cool, as wo are now doing,
from England, France, or any foreign country,
wbere we con huy it cheaper, and transporting
iV through the St. Lawrence os fair west as
Toronto or Windsor. I Vhink that we ehould
bave that protection for the Provinces of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, aloo, for I helieve
tbat we will ho bringing coal right Vhrough
to Toronto from those Iower provinces. I arn
one of those who helievo very strongly that
tbis transportation should ho, os it la now, in
our own territory, hecause the quantity of
groin that will corne from the West is increasing, and we sbould have matters so
arranged tbot there would be no interruption
in trafflo between. Port Arthur and Montreal.
Now, if we have those 24 miles on the
American side, of course thae treaty could be
cancelled in case any little troubles arose. It
might be said that that would be very forreacbing, os we have had those canaIs and

That shows, honourabte gentlemen, se far
a!; the United States are concernied, that wheri
we once commence exporting power te (hem
we can neyer hope to discontinue it. At ail

MARCH 14, 1928
events, we neyer succeeded in getting any of
this power back. Now, what is the position
of Ontario with respect to that situation? The
Hydro Eiectric Commission, or the Province
of Ontario, bought three companies sone years
ago when they wanted the power, believing
that, according te the license that had been
granted, they couid get the power that was
being exported by thern.
But they were
unable to do so. The United States said:
"If you cut off this power, we will cut off
your coal," and so on; and nothing could
bc' done but renew the license. The resuit is
that to-day, the Hydro Electric Commission,
or the Ontario Governrnent, yeu mnight say,
have to, apply for a license every year to
export 125,000 hor.sepower to a private corporation in the United States whe are distributing in that part of the country. As
I rernember it, the contract price is $10 per
horsepower.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
horsepower.

$9 per

Hon. 'Mr. REID: Well, $,9 per horsepower.
So here is a private corporation in the United
States buying our power at $9 per horsepower,
and making a fortune out of it, whiie we in
Ontario have to turn around and buy 125,000
horsepower in our own country at a price of
$15 per horsepower. We are losing $6 per
horsepowcr per year on thi? 125,000 horsepewer which we have te produce in perpetuity
to send to the United States. Now, I dlaim
that is net -fair. I do not think the United
States Governrnent treated us exactly as we
should have been treated, in flot insisting
that we should get our share.
Then w'e have been trying te settie the
Chicago drainage canal question. Our Govcrnmenit have taken the position that that
deveioprnent should net have been allowed.
Now, let me give an instance of how the
Treaty of 1909 was made between the two
Governments, and how it was interpreted. I
have before me a clipping with regard to
what took place a short tirne ago, when the
present Prime Minister was in Wa.shington.
This article begins by saying:
Premier Mackenzie King, who is visiting in
Washington, declines to diseuse the matter with
newspaper man.
I find no fault with that.
The Prime
Mînister did what wvas perfectly right . Then
it gees on to say:
Now that Judge Hughes bas put the case up
to Congress, and incidentally to the federal
Governiment, the way je cleared for renewal of
Canada's pretest. One effect of the ruling
ii
te clear up doubt as to whether Canada Would
have to deal directly with the federal Government or with lake States who were complainante

i

in this case and whio claimed jurisdiction over
their respective portions of the Great Lakes.
Lake states baving lest for the time being,
responsibility ie (lefiuiitely fixed with the
federal Governrnent.
Now I ceme to the main part of it:
One interesting point in Ju(lge Hughes' flndings in bis reference to the Canadian boundary
waters treaty of 1909-That is the Treaty we are working under
ab the present time, under which we gave
them equal rights in the use of our canaisOne interesting point in Judge Hughes' findings is bis reference te the Canadian boundarY %%
aters treaty of 1909, frem which hie quotes
at iengtl.
hen lie quotes frein a statement
of Elihu Itot, then SecretarY of State, before
a Senate committee, when Root said: "I bave
,-ely carefully guar(led tbe terms of this treaty
ini order to not include Lake -Michigan, and in
order flot te involve the drainage canal (of
Chicago) in any way." Furtber on Root referred to Canadia's diversion of water from tbe
Ni agara. River, which hie upbeld, and then Root
added: 'We are now taking 10,000 cubit feet a
second eut of Lake Micbiga"n at Chicago, but.I
refused te permit thern te say anything in the
treaty about it. The definition of boundary
w aters was carefuliy drawn to exclode Lake
Michigan. They consented te leave eut of this
treaty any reference te the drainage canal, and
we are now taking ten tbousand feet for the
drainage canai, which reaiiy cernes eut of the
lake îiystein."
To me tliat is evidence that wben this
Treaty was being made Mr. Root was net
quite fair. There are severai ether cases
I ceuld refer te, but I wiii net take the tirni.
Hon. Mr. LYNCILSTAUNTON.
the other cases.

Give lis

lon. Mr. POPE: Go on.
Hon. Mr. REID: It weuld take tee long.
I n)lght refer te our canaIs. I tbink the
honeurable gentlemian frem. Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. BelIceurt) will remember that we had
the right te use the American canais, and
they had the right te use ours. The honeurable gentlnman wiii aise rernember when Mr.
Murphy ran a fleet of barges and tugs with
cargees of lumber from bere te New York.
Under the Treaty we biad the rigbt te de
that, and Unitcd States barges Lad the right
te cerne up here. We aise had the right
te take freight from Lake Erie dewn through
the Erie Canal te New York.
But that was
stopped. I have heard different stories as te
how that was accemplished. One report, I
do net kn.ow whether it is true or net, was
that the Government at Washington transferred the canal te the State of New York,
and that the State refused te aliow aur vesseis
te go down there. We couid have done the
same thing; we could have transferred the

Welland Canal te the Province of Ontario.
But we clid not do it; sve let Arnerican vescls

oalled, I think. the St. Lawrence Power Transmlission Conpany. Wtcll, 1 kncxv aIl about
that, company bthey had about 3,000 horsepower-and when I carne to look at the Bill
I found at tbe foot of it a very innocent
looking clause whiehi gave thcm the right te
dani t ho St. Lawrence rlighit across at B-arnard's
Island, and to construet power plants, and
so on. 1 opposed the Bill i0 the Committee
antd in the House, and whon Sir Wilfrid
Laiurier saw what the Bill really meant, lie
made the premoters withdraw it. 0f course,
after that, we get the poer tbrough the
Ilydro-Eleetrie Coirmission building a transmission lino frorn Codar Rapids, where thore
is 100,000 horsepower. Sir Adam Beck tried
te purchase seme of that poer, but nothing
could be donc until pressure svas exerted,

the United States as it was sold to a United
States private cornpany and they refused to
let us have it.
Now, if this great project is going to be
developed in the Province of Quebec, I hope
and trust that it wiil be developed, and the
power used, in Canada. The reports in the
newspapers say that this company la going
ten 1ie allowed to develop only 500,000 horsepower, and that the power must ha used in
Canada. Who are behind that project? I
have been wondering if it is flot the samne
power cornpany that is trying to get control
of ail the power it can from Canada. The
Cedar Rapids Power Comnpany is practically
owned by that power company, whose headquarters are in the United States. I arn not
a iawyer, but I have been wondering about
tijis que~stion, which sorne lawyers can think
out. Suppose the Bill cornes before us and
w'e insert in it a clause to provide that none
of this power âiall be sold outside of Canada;
and suppose that company selle the 500,000
horsepower to the Cedar Rapide Comnpany,
which bas a license to export power. I
wonder if in that way they could get around
the question, and Quebeýc would be deprived
It would be
of the 500,000 horsepower?
exported.
Then, again, this power plant is to be const.ructed ail on the Arnerîcan side. The Comnmission recornmend that a change be made so
as to have the line go through the centre of
the building. I do not know whether the
United States Government would consent to
that or not, but I think it would be pretty
difficult to prevent people on the ot-her aide
from taking as much of that power as they
wanted when only an irnaginary line divides
the two countries, and I do not see how we
could ever get control of it again.
Again, there would be 1,000,000 horsepower
devcloped for Canada. We cannot use that
quantity of horsepower here in Ontario for
years; therefore we muet allow it to, be
exported, and the result would be that probably one-third of that power would be sold to
the United States and we should neyer get it
back again.
Now, as to the construction of this great
canal twenty-four miles long entirely on the
Arnerican sida, I have been wondering whether
power rather than navigation ia net the
paramount issue, and whether the propaganda
in the United States is kept on for navigation
purposes only, whila power is the predominant
to
issue. In the West the propagand a

wondering what will happen, say, ten years
from 110W, if the whole scherne is carried
through. There will be another government
in power at Washington.
Hon. Mr. W.ILLOUGHBY: And here.
Hon. Mr. REID- Governments corne and
governments go. Will the governments that
succeed those that are at present in power in
the two countries stand by ail the intentions
that are now declared in connection with this
great work?
Now let us consider Montreal Harbour.
That is our great ocean port. 1 say that any
man who reads the report made 'by that Comnmission-it is here, and I can give you the
sections-must corne to the samne conclusion as
1 do: if the St. Lawrence is darnmed at
Barn-hart's Island, in Arnerican territory, and
Canada loses control of the free flow of the
St. Lawrence and gives to the United States a
joint control, we may make up our minds that
Monitreal Harbour will be in danger, and the
ultirnate resuit will be that the water level
will be so lowered t'hat the Harbour of Montreal will be seriously injured. Someone may
say: "The water must ail go through. You
will get just as much water when the dam is
there as you would without it, because the
weirs will be opened," and so on. Let me tell
you that a reading of the report shows that
this dam will be built high enough to retain
ail the water there except what goes through
the wheels of the power plant, and you will
have deep water above, but the quantity of
water passing through and on down to Montreal will be reduced hy haif in low season,
and Montreal Harbour destroyed as f ar as
deep ocean going vessels are ooncerned.
Then the question may arise, are you going to shut off 100,000 or 200,000 horsepower,
distributed in the United States, in order to
benefit Montreal Harbour, or bas Montreal
to suifer in order that the people in the
United States may ha benefited? That is,
of course, a question for everyone to, decide
for himself, but for my part I cannot bring
myseif to the conelusion that Montreal Harbour will receive justice if we ever come to
that position. Therefore the people of Montreal will surely take up this question and
consider it seriously, as 1 have done. Surely
they will get the best man availsable to, investigate the matter and see whether or not
my conclusions are right, and, if they are,
they wiIl take whatever measures may be
necessary to protect their own city, and to
protect one of the finest harbours in the
world, one on whidh this country has spent
an enormous amount of money.
I think I have explained how the project
affects the several provinces. 1 have pointed

56109-8

SENATE

out that we want Nova Scotia coal. As the
provincies grow, we shall require to develop
our traffic by water. At ail events we want
the right to do so and to have our freight
rates adjusted by the water competition.
Someone maiy say: "You are crit.icising,
the report, but what have you to suggest?
We helieve that a majority of the people of
this country want a 25 foot watarway." My
answer is this. If the Governmant of this
country corne to the conclusion that w'e
should have 25 foot waterway betwean Montreal and Lake Ontario, I suggest that we are
in axactly the sama position as we wera
when we enlarged the St. Lawrence Canais
before, and I ask, why flot construct the
canais on our own sida, as we did before,
or sirnply enlarge our presant canais? Any
man who knows that tarritory wilI say that
the Canadian -ide of the river is the proper
place for the deepening of the watarway, and
in my judgment it would flot cost any more.
I make that staternent on the authority of
engineers who are closely in touch xvith the
whole situation. I arn aware that the Commission give economy as practically the only
reason for net putting it on the Canadian
sida. They think it would cost twe or thr'e
million dollars more to provide in Canadian
tarritory a similar channel and similar facilities for navigation fromt Montreal up to
Lake Ontario. What I sug-gest is that if this
work is to go on it shoudd hc done on the
Canadian sida aven if it does cost us another
million or two. I maintain that the additional expanditura would ha justified in that
it would pravent any possible friction hatween Canada and thïe United States now or
in the future. I would spend three, four or
five millions for that purposa. I do not expect that thare would aver be any trouble
hctwecn Canada and the Unitad States if
we built the watarway on our own sida. We
are legislating now net for the presant day,
but for conditions that will axist tan, twenty,
thirty, forty or fifty years froin now, and wa
want to leave the people of Canada such a
legacy that they will approva our actio and
say, " Those men knew what they were doing when they passed that legislation." Therefora I say to the Government, build those
tweuty miles of canal on Arnarican territory.
Thatt is ill that is requirad. It is the who]e
key te tbis situation. Take the position that
voii Nill build it on Canadian territory, and
the question is solvcd.
N1ow, as to the seheme te get 2,000,000 hoepowcr deývcloped at Barnhart's Island, I arn
sure that, as I hava said, we cannot use
1,000,000 horsepower for sortie years. I say

friands on the other sida suggest?
H1on. Mr. REýID: Ne. I will explain that.
Prohahly 1 have not explained it fully. Tha
report recoîenendýs that t.hey commeece the
work on the Unitcd States sida of the river
threa miles beiow Preýscott and censtruet a
canal antirely in United States territory, say
10 or 15 rniles long; than go down the centra
of the river te, Ogden's Island, and iestaead
of coetieuing down the centre of the river in
Canadian territory. tbey miaka a curvatura
around the Sout.h sida of Ogden's Island entiiely through Uniterl States territory, and

MARCH 14, 1928
again transfer our Canadian channel to United
States. The whole flow of the river passes
down betwcen Ogden's Island and Morrisburg
in Canada. If a dam placed as suggested
between Ogden's Island and Morrisburg without a lock it forces vessels to go on the south
side of Ogden~s Island all in American territory and a lock in United States territory.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How rnany miles?
Hon. Mr. REID: Probably three or four
miles. Then the channel would go on down to
Barnhart's Island. MI the locks on that whole
stretch of 24 miles would be on the American
side. The canal would be made up of three
sections.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But is that development on the American side flot suggested by
the Commission only as an alternative
scherne?
Hon. Mr. MjID: So far as the 24 miles are
concerned the suggestion is unanimous. 1 do
not know that it was unanimous when they
first decided upon it, but of course they had
to make it unanimous. T-here is no alternative
scheme; it is the only scheme that is proposed, in so far as the Joint International
Waterways Commission are concerned. None
of the 24 miles will be in Canada, and we are
tied up thera for ahl time to come.
Hon. MT. BEIJCOIRT: Ia it because of engineering difficulties?
Hlon. Mr. REID: No.
Hlon. Mr. BELOOURT: Merely for economical rossons?
Hlon. Mr. M.ID: I do not like to state my
authority, because I arn not going to imglicate
any of those who were connected with this
matter, but I will say this. When 1 asked
that question the answer I received was:
"There is no difficulty at ail. It is just as easy
to put it on the Canadian aide." Why was
it not done? For reasons of economy. It
1woul cost $3,000,000 more to build it on the
Canadien aide. Because of the desire to
save the $3,000,000 we are giving aws.y Canlada's control of the St. Lawrence.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is not claimed,
that it is because of engineering difficulties?
Hon. Mr. RSID: No; thera are no engineering difficulties at ali-none whatever. I
will tell you in a minute or two how 1 prove
that.
1 had in mind another suggestion or two.
This question is not one of party; it ia one
for every member of the House of Coenmons
56109-84

l

or the Senate to consider in the interest Of
Canada. 1 say without any hesitation, I do
flot believe there is a member of either House
but wants to look at this question in a nonpartisan way and to do what ié right for the
counltry. I have one or two suggestions to
make as to what should be done. First, if
we are to have any legisiation in this Parliament in connection with this matter, it
should flot be brought down four or five days
before the Session closes. We ehould have it
several weeks ahead. The Government shýould
urge th-at this question be considered carefully and should give every opportunity for
examining witnesses ini order that we may
ascertain which is the right way. What will
happen? Not a single vessel captain wil
tomne here and admit, unless he is pressed to
do it, that a veasel, of the largest type frorn
the upper lakes can go down the channel. they
propose for that 24 miles. I know tlËat place
well, and the reason for my statement is that
there is a great curvature, and those vessais,
which are 687 feet long, cannot go through;
but if they went the other way, straight down
the Canadian side, they would flot have to
contend with any curvature; they would go
down into the canal at the Galops Rapids
where the lock now is, and on down the river.
I cannot see why such a scheme was proposed,
and worse than ail is the intention to place
obstruction in the river on the Canadian uide
which will destroy navigation and flow on
Canadian territory. Then wt- right protest
as we like, but the United States will have
a channel 800 feet wide and 25 feet deep,
where the water flows down to dam at
Barnhart's Island.
There is another point. Suppose we make
a treaty and proceýed with the work. If we
wait until the works are completed they wili
allocate about 90 per cent of the power to
the United Statest and about 10 par cent to
Canada at that point. But to-day alI the
water goes down the Canadian aide, that is,
throuýgh the Galops, and if you sat down to
figure out how mucli we are entitled to, it
could not be flgured at less than haIf. The
main flow all the way down is on the Canadian side, at this particular point where the
island holds hack the water of the St.
Lawrence, ail the water except this small
stream en the south side goes down through
Canadian territory. But what will happen
when they corne toi figure it out? The
Ainericans will say, "'Why, two-thirds of this
water cornes from the American side, coaning
from th5't channel 800 feet wide and 25 f eet
deep"--though it doca flot corne down that
way at all-"now therefore you are entitled

116

SENATE

to about 25 per cent and we are entitled to 75
per cent." Unless the quantity of power we
are to get is settled before the work has
started, thon I say, Cod help us when they
come to decide it in the future, after the
channel has been completely constructed.
I have suggested building that canal on our
Canadian side, and I appeal to every man in
both Chambers, and in Canada, and also to
the Montreal people, to see that we have a
Canadian channel; but if it is agreed that we
are going to build a dam across the channel
let us sec that the weirs are all on the Canadian side so that we can control them, because
we have got all the territory between Cornwall
and Montreal, and we should be able ta
control that, and never allow it to be controlled on the other side of the river.
I have another suggestion to make, because
I have such confidence in the conditions which
I have stated, and se firmly believe that they
will turn out as I say. I also feel that this
is a question on which every member of the
Senate and of the House of Commons should
get all possible information, and there is no
better way of doing this than by actually
seeing the conditions. This House will be in
session in May. Why should not the Government take every member of the House of
Commons and Senate who would go to sec it?
We might take the train here at 8 o'clock in
the morning. and be in Prescott in an hour
and a half, or in Brockville in two hours;
then take the Canada Steamship Company's
steamer which runs from Prescott every day
from June until September, down to Montreal.
Let the members look the whole situation
over and see what the proposition is, then
get off at Cornwall about 4 o'clock, and
arrive back here at 6 o'clock. The members
would then see what the curves are, and all
that is going to be done, and I believe very
few of them would come back here and agree
to the recommendations that appear in this
report.
I think that we should have a Committee
of investigation, and if a Bill comes down we
should have time to consider it without havýing
the propaganda raised that the Senate are
opposing it. Give us time, and give the House
of Commons time to have witnesses here to
give us their ideas as to the conditions I have
mentioned.
The City of Montreal should get the very
best engineers they could, free from any impressions or conclusions on either scheme, and
let them go into the matter and see if they
will come to a Committee of either House
and say that if this work goes on as proposed it is not going to affect Montreal HarHon. Mr. RED.

bour. Let Montreal harbour protect itself.
Why should we not have the opinions of the
captains that are going to use this channel?
Of course the question will be asked, "How
can you dispute engineers' reports?"
Well,
I will tell you how I can dispute them. I
remember the situation when the St. Lawrence
Canal was being enlarged from 9 feet to 14
feet. The engineer who made the plans for
the upper entrance, when he came to Morrisburg, found objection from the vessel captains who used the river, and who were
unanimous that the proposed construction
would not operate safely for vessels. They
said the opening should be larger; the head
of the pier should be a little distance away
from what it was; but of course the engineer
knew it all, and he would net for one minute
change bis plans, lest it should oe a reflection
on his work. Of course, he was there for a
few vears, with the result that the Morrisburg
scction was completed. Then he proceeded
to construet what is called the North ehannel,
a long pier of several hundred feet was run
out into the river; but instead of running it
on a line with the flow of the river, he ran
it a little the other way, and a similar appeal
was made by the captains. What happened?
Anyonc who goes down there now can see;
the engineer had to do exactly what the
captains mentioned, because the vessels could
net go in at Morrisburg unless those changes
were made, as the captains suggested, and
they had to put a pier a little bit south, and
at the North channel build another one out
seveoral hundred feet long, in order to have
the flow come along the right way, but it was
a patched-up job, for all that.
I mention these things to show that when
wxe have the Government deciding the question we have only engineers engaged.
I
suggest that the men who have to use the
channel, who have no interest in the matter
except to give their opinion, should be brought
before the Committee.
Another feature of this development is the
propaganda that is being used to frighten the
people by saying, "This is going to cost such
an awful amount; Canada cannot go into it."
I heard a rumour recently, and some day we
may see an announcement, when the Bill
comes here, that the Beauharnois Power Company are willing to do everything in connection with this improvement so far as concerns
the portion from Cornwall to Montreal; they
will provide all the navigation if we give
themn all the power. That would probably
mean costing them $175,000,000 or even
3200,000,000, but if they are going to get
3,000,000 horsepower which will only cost them

117

MARCH 14, 1928
820,000,000 it would be less than $100 per
horsepower; as it is now, it coets them 8150
per horsepower, sa it is a cheap developinent,
and is worth that to the parties who are
behind it,-and I do not believe they are al
Canadians. If they get it, we wili not get it.
0f course it would be a nice thing for the
Government ta be able to say "It is flot
going to cost a cent." So long as we are
prepared ta construet that 24 miles and put
in the power to the United States, or the
private corporations that are going ta get it,
then I say ta, you, they will develop it, and
they will get the whole thing, and it will not
cost any more than power developmnent costs
at the present turne. That is where the fine
idea, is going ta, be, and then the cry will
come up, "Here, we are going to hold this,
and it is flot gaing ta cost Canada anything."
If the plan that I am suggesting is carried
out I will tell you what will happen: you
will have that development built froin Cornwall ta Montreal, and I think we can saf eguard that so as ta, prevent power from. being
exported; at least, it would take a vote of
Parliament ta allow any a! it ta be exported,
and then only provided that it could be sold
except ta a company that was going ta use
it entîrely in Canada. But when you corne ta
the other section between Cornwall and the
Galops Rapids, if the Government will say
ta the Hydro-Electric Commission, or, if they
will not do it, ta saine private company,
"You develop this power, or improve this
canal by simp'ly enlarging the locks, dredging
the canais deeper-" that would he the cbeapest and best way, I care not what any engineer
eays. I can get engineers whose reputatians
are just as good in Canada as any others,
who will bear out the statements I have
made. That is the situation.
In regard to this howl about finances"Give up the key ta the St. Lawrence; put
that 24 miles on the other side, and then
you will get the whole thing done without
any debt being placed on Canada"ý-I amn
not one of those in favour of that. I would
not seil any part of Canada, or o! aur territory, on any account. Why, the United States
Government are to-day willing ta, pay bal!
the cost of the Welland Canal for ail turne ta
came if they had a joint control with us.
I would not agree ta that an any terms, and
I cannot believe that the Governinent or any
member o! the Bouse o! Commons or the
Senate would ever agree ta any such conditions. Tbey were not willing ta do it when
we were enlarging ta 14 feet. Judging froin
press reports, they wanted ta huild a canal
instead of spending that money aeross from
Fort Erie on the Arnerican side of the uine.
That is what they wanted to do at that turne.

Now they are wiiling to do it, and they are
willing to put their line rigbt through the
centre of the river clear down to Montreai.
Tf you re-place the international line, or give
them a strip of land in perpetuity between
Cornwall and Montreai, you will neyer get
thein out of it again. We own it now, and
we shouid keep it.

much longer time than I should, and I
apologize for that; but the subject is one
on which I feel very strongly.

PROJECT

DISCUSSION

On tise Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I wvant to say to
my honourabie friend from Grenville (Hon.
Mr. Reid) that in accordance with tho request
that lie mnade yce.tcrday, I nade cfforts to sec
if the recport of the Advisory Committee in
regard f0 tise subjeet upon which hie spoke
an interc'sfingiy xvas availabie.
I w-as inlion.

Mr. HAYDON.

formcd that thle Advisory Committee itacîf
had at the end of its report specialiy requeste1 tisat the report shouid nlot be depositcd upon the Table of either Huse, because it was of sncb a nature that it might
leopardize or make difficult negotiations whieh
were bcing carrie(l on.
Hon. 'Mr. REID: I may say f0 the honourable gentleman that ýthat is the reason which
was given by the Leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) when 1 asked for the report
before. 1 stated in my remarks yesterday
that that was a good reason, and that of
course I could flot press for the report so long
as negotiations were going on; but that wben
it was being handed around to others, when
the Chairman of the Advisory Committee was
discnssing it, and when it was being used as
propaganda in favour of carrying out the work

as ýthe Commission recommended, I thought
this House and the House of Commons should
have the report before them.
I have flot changed my mind in that regard.

I do flot think 'my statement was unfair.

I

gave to the House, as honourabie gentlemen
wilil remember, instances showing that this report had been given to the public. The main
instance wvas one in which the City Counicil
and the Board of Control of the city of
Toronto had the report before t.hem, and
passed a resolution, and forwarded it to the
Governiment at Ottawa, recommending that
the report of the Advisory Committee be carried ont in full.

Hon. Mr.,MURPHY: How did they get it?
Hon. Mr. REID: I would not like to answer
that question. I have my own opinion. I do
flot accuse the Goveroment. I said ini my remarks that I did not think it was handed out
by the Government. I do flot know to whom
the biame should be attributed. 0f course
there are many ways in wbich the report might
get out-it might be through some officiai; if
might be fhrough some clerk in the office of
some member of the Advisory Committee. I
dIo flot accuse anybody. At ail events, on
February 2lst the City Counicil and Board of

Control had a copy of that report before them,
and passed the resolution to which I have referred, and forwarded it to, Ottawa. I do flot
want anybody to misundersf.and me, or to
think that I accuse the Government of giving
it ont for the purpose of propaganda.
Hon. Mr. LYNCiH-STAUNTON:
vois a copy yourseiýf?

Have flot

Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I thoroughly agree
with my hononrable fricnd thet if the report

MARCH 15, 1928
is to be made public this House and the House
of Commons are entitled ta, see it first. I arn
here to answer only for the Government-I
cannot answer for others--and so far as the
Gaverniment, is concerned, I want ta say most
emphatiealiy tthat it lias flot handed out the
report ta anyone. No one has seen it except
the members of the Cabinet. 1 think iny honourable friend is somewhat xnistaken in t.hinking that anybody else has seen tliat report. I
do not think the municipal council of Toronto
or any member of it lias seen the report, and
I arn quite sure a copy was nat before tliem
at tlie time ta which tlie honourable gentleman refera.
Hon. Mr. REID: I should 'le very sorry indeed if any remarks made by -me yesterday
could be inter.preted as meaning that 1
blamed -the Government. In no way, shape or
form, do I blame them.
The honourable gentleman says that I muet
lie mistaken in the case ta, which I referred.
Well, I arn very sorry indeed if the Mayor of
the city of Toronto, and the Chairman of the
Board of Contrai, and tlie members of tlie
City Council and the Board of Contrai,
deliberately passed a resolution recomrnending wliat is cont.ained in a repart they had
neyer seen. If they did thlat, they are not as
intelligent as I thought they were.
Hon. Mr. (MURPHY: Was the occasion
upan which that resolution was passed the
occasion upon which the honourable gentleman says the Chairman of the Advisory Cammittee gave same information ta the public,
or made a speech?
Hon. Mr. REID: Na. I referred yesterday
ta tliree instances in whicli there was, as I
would caîl it, action taken or information
gîven in connection with the matter. The
resolution which was passed by tlie City
Council and Tlie Board of Control of Toronto
appears in Hansard. Therefore, it was evident,
at lest to me, tliat tliey must have liad the
report or they would flot have passcd the
resolution.
.Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Naturally.
Hon. MVr. REID: I aiso said that the
Chairman of the Cornmittee, the Hon. Mr.
Foster, spoke on the question in Saint John,
and said there was nothing in the report
suggesting that part of the work would lie
under joint control-that it was absolutely
untrue. iMy -interpretatian of tlie recommendation of the Joint Waterways Commission was that there muet lie joint contraI of
the international section. In any event, my
interpretation of wliat appeared in the pres

119

was that the Chairman of the Advisory Committee was discussing the matter from the
point of view of the Advisory Committee
report.
Then there was also another reference by
Brigadier General Mitchell of Toronto, one
of the Commissioners.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: One of the
joint engineers.
Hon. Mr. REID: One of the joint engineers.
Fie was flot on the Advisory Committee, therefore I couid flot say he had the report. However, I came te, the conclusion, perhaps
wrongly, that he knew ail about the report
of the Advisory Committee; and I think you
must corne to the conclusion from the remarks
that I ma~de that there was a leak somewliere.
(Hon. Mr.
gentleman
honourable
The
Murphy), as a Minister, knows that you can
hardly keep these matters secret in a Departmont. flowever, I want to assure the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), for
I fear he lias misinterpreted rny remarks, that
I was not trying to blame the Government in
any way.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I said nothing of
the sort. I agreed ta, ask the Government if
there was any possibility of this report being
laid on the Table of the House, not because
I found fault wîth what my honourable friend
said, but because I thought it was my duty
to make another effort in that direction. I
asked the Prime -Minister about it, and lie
gave me the ainswer that lie gave some time
ago in the other House-that it was flot
advisable at the present tirne to make tlie
report public. He then told me that the
last paragrapli of the report requested that
it should flot lie made public, at any rate for
the present.
Hon. Mr. REID: May I also lie allowed
to say to the Leader of the Governrnent that
there is another reason why I do not think
tliere should lie all this secrecy. Tlie Advisory
Cornrittee of the United States sont their
report to the Governrnent on January 27th;
that report was published; and anyone wlio
wishes it can get a copy. Tha.t being so, it
does not seern unreasonable tliat our Advisory
Cornmittee shouid submit their report to the
public.
Lt rnay be that I arn taking too strong a
position in regard to this matter, but I regard
it as one of the most important subjects that
ever came before Parliament. I arn deeply
interested in this question, and I arn of the
opinion that ail availabie information should
be made public insteal of being kept secret.
The Govemment should let the people of

12(1

SENi-ATE

Canada know what is proposed by this Cornrnittee, and learn w-bat effect it is going to
have in the different parts of the country.
They should let everyone criticize it who
wishes. In that way they will learn more
about it before coming 10 a decision. If they
are going to keep the information and the
recommendations secret, and follow no one to
criticize them, it will flot strengthen the Bill
when il is framed. That is the criticisrn I
made yesterday. I did flot try to make any
political capital out of the malter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. REID: I did flot get up to try le
kili the sohemo, but I endeavoured to critici7e
it in a fair waY so as to belp the Government
corne to a preper and bonest conclusion in
f-be intorests net, only of the pr.njrct ilseîf
but of the country as a w-hole. Gix-e us the
report and lot us see w-bat it contains. These
mon on tîhe Advisoi-y Committce are able men
and 'had rnuch information before them;
nevertheless, should flot w-e be a little waýry?
The ex-Chairman of that Cemmiittce made -a
speech some days ago-ho kncw w-bat wvas in
the report, becaiise he wa. there-and ho said
"Go slow." Well, if hie is a little afraid, wlîy
sqhetull net the public as a ivhole have a chance
to ciilicize? I will net insist on this if il is
going te be dotrimental te the interests 01
Canada, thal thiat report should ho madle
public; but if tbe Covýeranient bias corne to
that conclusion. I ask that the mialter ho .lot
left unlil a weck or 1w-o hefore Parliam'ýnl
closes. I would suggcst that the Gox-ernmeuît
make or propose ne agreemenîýs or treaties
until the beginning of next Session, and that
in the meantime we may have the epportunity of going into the matter fully se as le
help [hom te corne le the right conclusion.
This question is of such importance te eveî-v
province in Canada that if the project bas te
ho pushoed through se th)at work on il rnay
ho conmonced, I believe the Government
shouild eal a special Se.,sion of Parliament ini
ord'-r te deal with tihe malter, instead of concluding any arrangement wiîth the United
States Government tînt tbey might. bave te

ne great injustice will bo done to the peeple
of the West, or any otiher
part of
if the ýGovernment will only give the ceuntry,'
the Parliamont of Canada tirne to discuss thbe Bill. Let
tbe Governrnent court investigation, and secure ail the ovidence lhey can gel. The Governmont would thus ho in a great deal better
position te cerne le a preper decision, and
would prebahly avoid criticism for rushing
the Bill through, for the people of Canada
would say that aI least in Ibis case lhey did
w-bat was right.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Honourable gentlemon, I think the House is uinder obligation

plenty.

I thought I gave you

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I would like to ask
the acting leader of the House if the Governnient is taking any steps to find out how the
Ieak came to be made in Toronto by the
Advisory Committee, or probably by somne
officiai. If anything has been done along
that lin e, it seems to me that there ought to
bc some dismissals. It seems rather a peculiar
thing that the Parliament of Canada is sitting
here without any information, while information of ail ,orts is being given out, that may
be used to the disadvantage of Canada, and
to the advantage of the United States. Even
if that is not being done, surely the Parliament of Canada has a right to know what
the report contains, more especially when tihe
American report is being pu*lished. I like
the position taken by my honourable friend
from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid), t'hat this
information should be given to the House, and
given at once, so what we wiil ha~ve at lest
a couple of months in whioh to consider it
before we are calacd upon to take any action
upon the report.
1 quite agree with my honourable friend
from Grenville that this is probably the most
important legislation that will corne before
Parliament either at thi term or the next,
and in order to give the matter fair discussion
and consideration we shouki have ai possible
information. I arn in hopes that we may get
such data as wil enable us to go on with the
project, but at the same time 1 take the position that I have no intention of helping any
one of the projects if by any means we are
going to get the emall end of -the deal. We
are now in such a position that we do not
very urgently need this development, and we
can afford to take our time and go into, the
question thoroughly; so I trust that the House
or the Government wili not be led into any
snap verdict by our frienids across the line. We
know them of old, and therefore we want to
be very careful.
Hon. Mr. BELICOURT: Honourable gentlemen,ý sfter ail, I think that wha~t was done or
said in Toronto, and perhaps elsewhere,' doe
nlot necesgarily establish the fact that there
bas been or bas nlot been any leak. What wais
s-aid might be accounted for by the conjectures
of gentlemen who are deeply interested in7 this
matter. I tbink my honourable friend from.

Girenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) yoeterday conjectured a good deal about what is, or may
be, ini this report; s0 I do not think that we
have any evidence that there bas been any
leak. At ail events, we have the assurance
of the Government that they do not know Of
any leak of any kind, and the Government is
very much opposed to there being any leak.
Hon. Mr. REID: Well, there are a nwnber
of gentlemen present to-day who were not
here yesterday when I made my remarks on
this subject, and as there seeme to be some
doubt as to whether there was any leak, I
will just read the resolution as pa.ssed by the
City Council in Toronto, and then the House
rnay judge. I gave this ycsterday as one
reason why I thought there was a leak. I
said that the Star of Toronto had. the following ini its news items on February 2lst, and
with big headlines on the top of the article it
stated :-"ýStamp of approval put on waterways; City Council expresses approval of the
St. Lawrence Development Plan"ý-that is, the
City Council of Toronto. The article proceeded:
The City Council yesterday expressed its ap-

proval of the St. Lawrence development echemes
in adopting a motion from Alderman Boland
recommended with amendment by the board of
control.
Alderman Boland's oririnal motion rend as
follows:
"That this counicil do record its
unanimous approval of the report of the National Advisory cominittee appointed in connection with the St. Lawrence waterway
development as essential in the proper development of Canada and look f orward to the
adoption of plans which will provide for the
commencement of the work at the earliest
date, and that a copy of this resollution be
sent to the prime minister of Canada and to
the representative of the city in the Senate
and in the House of Commons!"
Board of control, in dealing with this motion
before submitting it to council, deleted with the
consent of Alderman Boland, the words
"unanimous" and "report of the National Advisory Committee appoînted in connection wîth
the," and miade it read "and reconimend the
adoption of the motion." Council passed the
motion as amended.
Now, that was one of the resoens why I
concluded that there must have been a leak.
I am not finding fault, but if information
does leak out, or if the publie prs are forming their conclusions, and having a propaganda
regarding what is contained in the Advisory
Committee's report then I think we should
have the information in this House. TÏhat in
the only reason why I spoke of it.
Right Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen, I agree thoroughly with the hionourable gentleman; but is not this prohably
the situation? Tuie appointment of the Joint

122

SENATE

Engineering Board and the Advisory Comrnlttee, and ail the machinerv eonnected with
it, cntailed a good deal of intricacy that the
publie, and even the new.spaper men writing
editorials, do not altogether understand. Is
it flot po.ssible and probable tbat wbat the
Toronto Cotincil had before them ivas the
report of the Joint Engineering Board? Colour
is lent to that suggestion by the action of
Aldermnan Boland in eonscnting that the word
"'unanhmous' bc strieken out, because the
report of the Joint Engineering Board was
nt unanimous. Tire United States engineers
reeommended a one-step development, while
the Canadian engineers reeommended a twostep developmeet. On tlie whole, after listening te, the argument, and knowieg a good
de-il as to how newspapers are made, and how
beadline8 are written, I have corne f0 the
conclusion that what the Toronto Council
bad before tlieni w.ù, the report of the Joint
Engineering Board, which is publie.

I migbit say, in this connection, that if any

SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 31, an Act to amond the
Supreme Court Act.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
very simple Bili, whicb got its first, second and
third readings in the othor Brandi of Parliament on the saine day.
The purpose of the Bill is twofold. The
first obj oct is to fix the sitting of the Court
in April instead of May; that is, f0 advance
the sitting one month. The Court found that
sometimes the spring session lasted until late
in the sumrmer, and they have expressed the
desire that lic Act may be amended so as te
perimit tbem f0 sit earlier, that is, in April
instead of in May.
The othor purpose of the Bill is to enable
t1lu Court tn near evi(lence wbenever they
deem it proper.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
voce?
lhon.

MIr. GRAHAM.

That is, viva

Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Viva voce. What
oecasioned the Court to ask Parliainient to do
this was a case in which thero werc very important plans whieb had flot been made part
of the proceedings, and the case could flot be
properly decided witiout the production of
tho-e plans. But as there was no provision
by which that could be donc, the appeal iad
to stand over to another term, and the Court
was very much embarra-ssed. The rigbt to
hear evidence exists in the Privy Council, and
also in our own Courts of Appeal in the different provinces, so, there is no reason why
tho Suprome Court shouid not have that
jurisdictjon. This amendmcnt wil1 save both
time and costs, because the present lack of
jurisdiction, or inachinery by which to take
evidence may involve sending a case back to
the Courts below.
Thore is nothing in the Bill except those

two provisions, and as I say, the Bili secured
its throc readings in the other branch of the
Legislature at one sitting.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourabie gentlemen,
1 read tbis Bill when it was introduced in the
et ber House, and bave rea.d it again. There is

nothing at ail objectionabie in it. On the
rigbt-han:d side ef the page on wbich the Bili
is printpèd there is a memorandum whîeh says
that this change in the terni meets with the
approvai of the Bar. I suppose the Bar
secietios were consultcd.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot give my
honeurable friend any evidence that the Bar
bas approved.
Hon. Mr. RO)SS: It is statcd bore:
This is f0 facilitate the despateli of business.
for the convenience of the Bench, and with the
appros ai of the Bar.
1 do not sec how the change from the first

Tuesday in May to the fourth Tuosday in
April is going te hurt, the Bar very much.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUIIT: No. I t.hink its
interest is identical. The Bar is as cager te
get off for its holidays as is the Bench.
Hon. Mr. ROýSS: But I weuld net have the
change ma.de merely at the instance ef the
Court, without the Bar baving been heard
from. I suppose it bas been. 1 do not know.
Hon. :Mr. MeMEANS: Another note states
that tie Privy Counicil can receive evidcnce
in addition to that wbich is embodied in the
stated case, and tiat the amcndment confers
a similar 'power upon the Court. Can tbey
takce evidence by affidavit?
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 think tha-t is in
their discretion. For instance, if it were

MARCH 15, 1928
nierely the production of plans, or a formai
affidavit, and if there were no occasion for
cross-examining -the party giving the affidavit,
I think the Court would accept the additional
evidence without insisting on the presence of
the witness. Ris presence would be required
only for the pucipoees of crose-examination, as
my honouràble friend knows.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bull was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BELCfOURT: With the leave of
the Bouse, if my honourable friend (Hon.
W. B. Ross) sees no objection, I would move
that the Bouse go into Committee on the BiR.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: We do flot need to consider it in Committee. Move the third reading.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Very well. I move
the third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time and passed..
PUBLIC PRINTING AND STATIONERY
BILL
SECOND READING

Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second
reading of Bill 33, an Act to amend the Publie
Printing and Stationery Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose
of this Bill, I t-hink, can be stated in two
words: it is to make the law conform with
the practice. The Printing Bureau and the
offices connected with it have to be provided
with stock for the various kinds of printing
to be done. There is general]y on hand, I
am informed, about M50,000 worth of stock.
Like other stocks, the supplies at the Printing
Bureau have to be replenishied from time to
time. Under the law as it stands the Printing
Bureau is entitled to an advance of $200,000
in order that it may carry on its busineas. It
has been found for many years past that that
sum is wholly inadequate to the requirements
of the Bureau and that at least &500,000 more
is needed. The whole purpose of thie Bill is
to create a sufficient working capital for the
establishment. The Auditor General has on
occasion found fault with the payment of
certain accounts which exceeded the 8200,000,
and the Printing Bureau has been embarrassed in carrying on its work. The intention
is to make the amount available 8700,000
instead of 820,000. As honourable gentlemen will sec, the cost of the Department is
not in any sense increased, nor will this
measure lead to any mncrease. Its purpose is

merely to provide in proper time for the
amount of expenditure which has been incurred and which it is anticipated must be
incurred yearly. I think I have stated the
fuît purport of the Bill.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Bonourable
gentlemen, just a word of observation touching this Bill. I -have listened wiih. interest, to
my honourable friend the leader in his expianation of its intent, and I know from experience that wvhat he has stated as to the sum
available for the purchase of stock being
inadequate is correct; but I would point out
to him and to the Government that I do not
think it is necessary or desirable to increase
the amount to the extent that is proposed in
the Bill. To increase it to that extent would,
I fear,' lead to further expenditure, which I
deem wholly unnecessary; and I make t-hat
statement in view of the fact that I had something to do wîth the administration of the
Printing Bureau for a few years. A Dumber
of years a-go, through the activity of certain
honourable members of this Bouse, if I am
flot mistaken, an inquiry into the operation
of that institution was held, and it resulted
in greait economnies being effected. When the
investigation and the re-organization were
finished, about 30 per cent of the expense connected with the running of that institution was
eliminated, and the value of the product of
the Bureau, or the amount of work that Lt
turned out, was «increased notwithstanding
that 30 per cent reduction in operating costs.
One of the economies that were made effective
at that time was the curtailing of the quantity
of stock kept on hand, much of which deteriorated with âge, if it did not become
valueless. You do not want a new book made
out of old paper. Nowadays, with the up-todate and efficient methods of distribution
which prevail in every commercial activity, Lt
is possible for our Printing Bureau to obtain
its s~upplies on very short notice from the
various milîs producing paper within not too
distan't range of this city. Because of tihe
improvements in modern business met-hods we
fi.nd that merchants everywhere do not purchase their goods several months in advance,
as they used to do, but order from week to
week or from month to month, and do not
carry the big stocks that they used to carry.
The ver>' same principle has been applied,
with satisfactory resuits from the standpoint
of economy, to the Printing Bureau, and I
have some apprehension as to what will occur
if 'Parliament increases by 200 per cent the
amount available for the purchase and carrying of stock. I am afraid that one of the
results will be that you will be called upon

124

SENATE

to provýde a new building in whieh te place
this increased stock. I believe that some increase in the amouint provided should be
granted, but I certainly do flot agree that the
amouint ouglit to bc inecased to the extent
that is suggested in the Bill. Without wishing
to be unduly critical, I arn attempting te give
the Huse the benefit of the experience I have
had in the operation of the Printing Bureau
and jts administration.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I may say this to
my honouirable friend, that 1 arn informed
that the stock which is carried at present is
worth $500.000 and there wou.Id be ne nece4sity
of providing a new building or obherwise
increasing -the accormodation.
Therefore
that danger does not exist. My honourable
friend muest remember also that the Printing
Bureau is, after ahl, self-sustaining. The printing whicli is done in that inGtitution is .paid
for by the different DepartmentsHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If they pay their
bills.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -and it is for the
Departments to ýpractise what niy honourable
friend preaches, more economy. The Prmnting
Bureau ilself cannot do so; the Bureau must
print what is requisitioned by the different
Departments. Therefore this Bihl will flot
intcrfere with any econmy that might be
practised by them. That explanation oughit
t o
ufficient to nicet my honourable friend's
two objections.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would point eut
to ýmy honourable friend, in reply, that the
whole Governiment of Canada does flot use
$500l,000 wvorth of paper in a year, and if the
Printing Bureau bias to-day $500,000 worth of
blank paper lying in stock. awaiting orders ýto
bc tu'rned iii by the various Departments
for printingHon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is flot aill paper.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -then it is more
than is necesary. Like drygoods, paper tbat
is piled up on a .shelf and kept in a store for
a year bas nlot the saine value as it had wben
àt xas put there. AIl I would say is, what
the honourable inember for Grenville (Hon.
Mr. Reid) said wvith reference to a much more
important project, be careful and go a little
slowly with your expenditures on extensions
whieh are not necessary. I woul have no
objec.tion wlîatex er to a 50 per cent increase
of the amount, and, speaking from exýpcrience,
I do think that wuuld bu ,officient.
Hou. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps my honlourable friend's warning will be sufficient.
Hen. Nlr. ROBERT~SON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 hope it may be.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl was
read the second time.

ROYAL

MILITARY COLLEGE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moveil the second
reading of Bihl 13, an Act respecting the Royal
Military College of Canada.
Ho said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
another instance in whiclî the practice lias net
beeýn consistent with tbe law. Originally the
Royal Mdlitary College was supposed te accoiiîmodate, if I remember rightly, 100 students.
That number is now more than
doubled. ýSome provisions with regard te control have become necessary because of changed
conditions. The Bill is onhy in a very smahl
way different fromn the present Iaw.

Hon. Mr. BEiLCOTRT: Yes, it is a new
one, but nearly ail the provisions of the old
law are embodied here.
Hon. Mr. STANFIEJjD: What changes are
made now?
Hon. Mr. BEICOURT: The only change
is to make the amount o.f expenditure corréspond with the real requtirements. The experbdituTe has been met from time to time 'by
a portion of the amount. being placed in the
estimates, whereas it should have been provided for. by the statute. The Auditor General has taken exception to t.hat method and
lias inslisted upon the law being changed so
that the actual expenditure may be in corformity with it and not be subi ect to a special
vote every year.

It is truc that the spirit of the Civil Service
Act was being applied, but there was nothing
to authorize it or to make it legal.
Those are the only provisions, I think, that
need to be discussed. I move the second
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think if the Leader
of the Huse would just state in what particulai-s this Bill differs from. the old one, we
would be in a position to) know ail about it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Really the only
difference I can see is to make the law conform with the practice. For years past the
College lias been extending very considerably,
especially in the number of students, and in
the old days the Minister of Militia, now the
Minister of National Defence, really had
control of the College although the Act 'was

National Railway and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway concerning a branch line known as
the Rosedale-Bull Pond Creek branch line.
In 1924 both these railways were very anxious
to get into this territory. After a good deal
of discussion, it was decided, according to the
spirit of the age, that both raiilways should
not be competing for the same business in
this territory, but that they should come to
a joint agreement before building. Exactly
what is in the agreement I do not know; it
is the ordinary railway agreement; and this
territory will be well served by the two big
lines. The purpose of the Bill is to confirm
the agreement.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I think this Bill is all right, but as all these
railway Bills are important, I think this one,
even if it is pro forma, should go to the Railway Committee before getting the third readmrg.

objection that I can see.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second

Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
Bill which is really very necessary. At the
International Conference at the Ha,gue, in
1925, we agreed to certain provisions regarding patents. This Bill is merely to incorporate
in our own Patent Act the provisions then
unanimously agreed upon by the nations
adhering to the League. That is all it provides for.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

reading of Bill 8, an Act to amend the Trade
Mark and Design Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this ls

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Why not put them both
together and send them to the Committee?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It all arises out
of the same Convention.

standing the transfer, the Government at
Ottawa sought always 10 have the co-operation of the province in the administration
of the water beit. Tbey finally reached an
agreement whereby the Dominion Government coný-entcd to let the Province administer
under the Provincial Act, which stili stood
and whichi is standing to-day, but the Govornimenl at Ottawa insisted upon a certain
provision being accepted by the Province to
allow the Minister of the Interior, acting for
the Dominion Governlment, bo exorcise a certain control. That control wvas provided for
by section Il of the Act, which honourable
zcentlemen ivili sec printed. word for word, on
th right-hand sidc of the Bill. Since the
Aet of 1913 xvas passed the authorities at
Ottawa have feit that there is really no necessity for the Ministor exercising that conîrol.
Perfect harmony has been established botween
the Province and the Dominion with regard
to thc administration of the watcr and the
riparian rights. So Parliament is now asked
to suspend the operation of section 11. That
is onc part of the present Bull.
Section 3 of the Bill enacts the repeal of
section 12 of the Act of which 1 have spoken.
It is considered no longcr neccssary, because
the rights of the parties and of the Province
are fully safcgnarded by section 4 of the Act.

The Minister has adviscd Parliament accordingly, and the House of Commons have
adopted this Bill, by which section 12 is to
he repealed.
That is substantially the purpose of the

Bill. It met with no difficulty in the other
branch of the Legisiature.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would ask the honourable gentleman, are the Government flot
taking steps now to transfer to British Columbia the whole of this land, known as the railway bell.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot say what
is the intention of the Governmeint in that
particular respect, but the intention is to

he would apply the provision that is now suspended. In the meantime it is to remain in

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: You are also, taking
away the right of any riparian te the domestie

use of the water that is flowing past him.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no; the reverse.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Section 12 is repealed,
you wiIi notice. That is the one that prevents
any ril)arian resident from being deprived of
ihie use of water for domestie purposes.
lion. Mr. BELGDOURT: The effeet of the
Act is to recognize the rights of ail riparian
owncrs to their share of the water for domestie
purposes-ail purposes, in fact.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But, as 1 understand,
the section that does that is being repealed.
The bottom note says:
Section 3. The section to be repealed reads
as follows:"12. Notwithstanding any.provision of any
of the Water Acts, no privilege, license or
r-.ght to the use of water shall be grantedl
nihere the proposed use of the water would
deprive any riparian proprietor adjoining the
river, strcam lake or other source of supply of
wvhatever water hie requires for domestie purposes."
That is being repealed.
Hon. Mr-. BELCOURT: I know, but the
reason why thiat is repealed is that under section 4 -of the Act it is already provided for.
There is no intention at ail of depriving the
riparian owner of any of the rîghta whic h he
has acquircd, or to which he is entitled under
his grant.

Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, the seric-s
of questions that stand in my namie on the
Order Paper are put forxvard not for the
purpose of captions criticismi, but in ot-der to

MARCH 21, 1928
draw the attention of the Government to a
situation which is worthy cf their attention.
In discussing these matters 1 must te some
extent anticipate the answers which my
honourable friend may give. Dr. W. A.
Riddell is a young man Who has beau sent
by. the Government of Canada te Geneva te
represent us on the League of Nationis, I
understand, in connection with the labour
clauses of the League and the Treaty cf
Versailles. However, he has apparently been
employed by the Government in a larger
field, and is te soe extent, 1 am informed,
under the direction of the Department of Extermal Aiffairs. I am a.sking the nature of
bis employment, and the Department by
which he is empioyed, and than 1 draw attentien te the fact -that during the past eighteen
months, perhaps longer, Dr. Riddell bas been
making a series of statements, whieh have
appeared iii the Canadian press, pux'porting
te speak on behaîf of the Goverument of
Canada andi the people of Canada. Those
stataments are of vary great importance, as
tou-ching upon international relatiions, and
they are statements which in my jtidgment.
should only be made by a responsible Minister, or preferably by the Prime Minister
himqel-f, in the Parliament of Canada.
Just as public opinion here is formed and
based upon statements of responsible public
men, se in international affaire public opinion
in the world is based upon statements cf responsible men, made in proper places. I have
net made a collection of those statements;
but newspaper readers will remember that for
the past eighteen months or twe years we
have sean statements cf some sort almest
every week or se, from Dr. Riddell, touching
upon ahl sorts cf questions. Those statements, if accepted, are expositions cf Canadian
policy, and are thus of far-reaching effeet.
New, it is net fair to the nations cf the
world that they should be led te accept such
statements as prenouncements of Government
policy. Personally, I disapprove cf some of
those statements, and I am sure they must
have been dîsapproved of by others, and 1
am merely raising the question now in order
te draw the attention cf the Government te
observations made by persens purporting to
speak for the people cf Canada, when, in
point cf fact, it is most unlikely that this
young man has any such authority.
My honourable friend may take some exception te the method cf framing my last
two questions, in which I ask if the Government assumes responsibility for those statemente; and, secondly, whether the Government has reprimanded Dr. Riddell for statemente of which it doas net approve. The

purpose of those two questions is flot sinister,
by any means, but they are designed to
bring home to the Government the possibility
that those statements may rise up and smite
the Government somne day when, in a difficult
situation, they muet accept them. We are
making our appearance for the fixst tixne in
international affairs, and it is desirable that
ail the officiais of the Govemnment, as well
as the Government itself, should be made
aware of the very great importance that is
attached ini international affairs to, statements
made by public men. Beyond that I do flot
care to go. I believe that Dr. Riddell is a
very capable, energetic, and worthy officiai,
and I have no desire to reflect upon him in
any way; but I wish merely to draw the attention of the Goverment to the fact that
he appears tu occupy an important position,
and the Government would be well-advised
te proteet îtself, in his publie utterances, by
suitable instruction and by ail necessary precautions.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, my honourable fricnd from Edmnonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) assumes that
Canadars representative at Geneva has net
received regular instructions from the Government on the matters upon which he has
been called te speak at the varieus Committees where Canada's interests were at stake.
[n consequence of that assumptien, my honourable friend's argument is weak, because
Dr. Riddell hàs received instructions generally
on matters of some importance-directions
rather than instructions-and he has faithfully
performed his duty, following the lines indicated to him by his own Minister.
It was decided te appoint Dr. Riddell as
permanent representative, because we have
assumed the obligation te attend meetings
of the International Labour Bureau at varions
fixed periods in the year, and we have been
obliged te attend other meetings of committees appointed by the Assembly or the Council. It was thought that it would be f ar more
convenient for Canada te, have a permanent
representative there, and that it would save
a considerable sume of money te the treasury
te have ene representative - who would net
have te cross the Atlantic haîf a dezen times
in order te attend those varieus commissions.
Dr. Riddell is perfectly conversant with al
labour matters, having occupied an important
poet in the International Labour Bureau, and
he was selected because of his special knowledge in that department. He had had considerable experience in Canada; if I am net
mistaken, he had been Deputy Minister cf
Labour in the Ontario Government. lie was

134

SENATE

quite quaiified to deal with ail social questions, and hie has rendered a very good account
of himseif as representative of Canada in
those varions activities of the International
Labour Bureau. He lias heen seiected as representative on some important committees,
and recentiy bie sat on the preparatory subcommittce on Arbitration and Security, where
hoe met important authoritative representatives
from other countries, and hoe was called upon
to state the views of his Government, and
the policy wbich had been propounded eithor
on the floor of Parliament or in the Assembly.
I read bis deliverance at that meeting, which
had taken place a few days before my arrivai
in Geneva, and I heard numerous commendat ions of the manner in which hie bad presented
the oxperience of Canada in the field of
Arlutration and Security.
«\Iy honourable friend, if lie bas met Dr.
iRiddell, bias probably bcen mîsied by hie
luvenile Iooks; but lio is moving towards,
if lie lias flot paised, tho moridian of life, which
1 woul(I put at forty. Ho is rnost conscientious
mn the performanco of bis duties, and most
lesiromîs of doing tho right thing for bis own
country. Naturally hoe lias only general instructions on many matters, and if my honourable friend askod nme if every word hie
*peaks bad the authority of bis Minister 1
wýould wit bout besitation answer in the negativo, as regards very many questions on
which hoe may express an opinioiq in discussion.
But wben it cornes to a concrete resolution on
îvbich lie bas to vote, if lie lias any doubt as
to the opinion of bis Minister, it is lis
concern and duty to cable bis Minister for
instructions; so that if my lionourable friend
îiased only a few moaths on the shore of
(leneva Lake, I believe hoe would find that.

w-e bave a very prudent representative in the
person of Dr. Riddell.

To thie questions which

1)e puts, I would answer:
1. Yes.
2. Canadian Advisory Officer, tO aid in
fmrthering Canadian interests in the League
of Nations and the International Labour
Organization.
3. Departmonts of Externai Affairs and
Labour.
4. Not possible to answer without more
specific indication of the statements in question.
I might add that I know personaliy of instructions

5. Yes.
As to No. 6, I had occasion to tell xny honourable friend. before thie opening of this

%wbich lie used,, because it iniplied thait there
could perhaps lie cause for a reprixnand.
1
suppose my honoura-ble friend desires to know
if tmhe Government lias expressed its disapproval of some statements made hy Dr. Riddeli. To that question I wouid say no, but
I would add that there nover lias been cause
for any disagreement between our representai vc and lis Minister, the Minister for Extomnai Affaire.
ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAYS PROJECT
UISE OF ADVISORY COMMIITTEE'S REPORT
On the Orders of the Day:
.Hon. J. D. REID: I risc to make an explanation in confection witi 'the remarks
I made on the -St. Lawrence Waterways on
Wedno.sday dast.
I have received a telegram
froîn Brigadier-General C. H. Mitchell, and
I think I should place it on record, as I do
not want to do any injueiico to General
Mitchell. It is as folLows:
Toronto, Ont.,

1\y attention lias been drawn to reports in

you thmat I. bave nover seen this report and (Io
not know its contents. The only public referonces 1 have made to this Comnittee and its

Twenty-Tliird, copy of whicb I arn sending
you by mail to-night.

These refereaces do not

presunie a knowledge of contents of report.
Brig. Geni. C. H. Mitchiell.
In my remarks I gave, as a reason wliy
I thought, I was justified in speaking as I did
on tbis matter, tbhat the Hon. Mr. Foster, who,

was Chairman of the National Advisory Coinmittee, bad discussed this question a few days
before in St. John, and I read lis speecli in
n newspaper report; aiso, tbat the Gouncil of
the city of Toronto lad passed a resolution
recommending tlie carrying out of the report
of the National Advisory Cornmittee.
I also
mon'tioned that Brigadier-General C. H.
Mitchelil had addressed a meeting in connection witli the waterways at Toronto, and
I st.ated Vliat evidentiy those persons lied be-

fore tliem the report of the National Advisory
Committee.
0f course, Hon. Mr. Foster
wou'ld have it, because lie was Cliairman of
the Committee, and the report froin tlie Toronto City Counicil stated tiat tliey had, it.
I wrote to, Brigadier-Generel Mit-chell, iii
reply to bis telegram, that I was pieased to

MARCH 21, 1928
hear that hie remarks were not taken front the
report of the National Advisory Committee,
but still he had the report~ of the Joint
Engineering Board, 'which had been madc
public here, having been laid on the table of
this House; so of course he 'had the right
to diseuse it if he wished. But I do not desire to cast any reflection on Brigadier-General
Mitchell in connection with the matter, and
therefore I felt that I should place before the
Senate the exact position, so that there could
be na f ault found.
DEBATE

RESUMED

The Senate resurned frorn March 14, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of tbe Hon.
Mr. Reid:
That he will cail the attention of the Senate
te the St. Lawrence Waterways project. and
i aquire if it is the intention of the Governrnent
to lay on the Table of the Senate the report
of the. Advisory Committee on the proposed
seherne.

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, et the outset I desire to say that I,
like the honourable member from Grenville
(Hon. Mr. Reid) would bave much preferred
to have had the prîvilege: of seeing the
opinions which have been given to the Gov*cwnrent by the Advisory Commîttee. I have
no doubt that the opinions given by the
members of that Committee might have corrected opinions of my own and of other
honouoable members of this House wbo have
been deprived of the benefit of their perusal.
.Nevertheless, I fully appreciate the reason
wby the Governiment has not deemed it its
duty to make those opinions pubilic. Suppose
that a property in which two parties bad a
common interest, as is the case bere, was
priva tely owned instead of etate-owned, and
that one of the parties had asked for advice
of a tecbnioal character in order to, be able
to dea1 with bis adversary, it might be very
foolish for that party to discl.ose the advice
which be lied received. I have read, and
no doubt other bonourable mmbere of this
House also have read the reasons aasigned
by the Prime Minister ini the other House
the other day, and accepted by the Leader
of- the Opposition, for withholding this information, and I think we bave to take it for
granted that the Government was well advised.
I desire te say also that after hearing the
honourable member -from Grenville discuse
this very important question I hesitate to
follow him, because I have flot hie personal
knowledge of the river, nor hie general experience as an ex-MinisteT of Railways and
CanaIs. However, I have taken the trouble

to inforrn myeif bY examining into the
report of the Joint Boord of Engineers. This
report to my mmnd is very complete, and
deals flot only with the work of the membes
of the Board, but also, with the work of the
first Commission in 1921, a Commission which
cost Canada and the United States each a
surn of sorne $7,50,000, and covered moat important matters of research and engineering
works of ail kinds. In making its report the
first board or Commission deemed it to he
its duty to suggest that before any deoision
was taken the Board ehould be enlarged and
further investigations made--thaýt was in 1924
-and the Comimission was enlarged by the
apointment of three members by the United
States and three by Canada. The members
appointed by Canada were D. W. McLachlan,
of the Railway Department; Oliver O. Lefebvre, of the Quebec Streame Commission,
a inan of very large experience and an engineer of first rank; and Brigadier General
Mitchell.
In 1926 a report was made by those gentlemen, but their labours did not cesse there.
They went on and examined further into the
matter, and in the severai appendixes to the
report will be found the result of the further
exarnînation wbich they made. For my part
I arn satisfied thst extraordinary precautions
had been taken to, inform the Govermment
and the public at large as far as possible.
It was suggested, 1 think, that there ehould
be furtber investigation, and I would not be
surprised if it were advisable or even necessary, from either the economic or some other
point of view, to have further information
before a final decision is arrived at. However, we have to deal with this matter witb
the assistance of the documents that are now
at our disposal, most of whicha are contained
in this book.
I besitate also for fear that opinions expressed in this House may be taken on the
other aide of the line as expressions of public opinion when in reality tbey are expressions of individual opinion. However, I think
I will be guarded enougha in my remarks net
to compromise anybody.
Let me say at once that I agree entirely
with the honourable, member for Grenville as
to the importance of the question. I regard
the power susceptible of development as a
national asset of immense value which. should
remain the property of the Crown for all
times and farmed out from time to time with
necessary provisions by way of successive revision of the amount of the rent to be paid,
or otherwise, to proteet the interests of the
State or of the public. I amn also of opinion

136

SENATE

that the power to be deveiapcd ahauld flot,
for any cansideratian, 15 sold for consuxaptian
autside of Canada.
The hanaurable member seems ta ho apprehensive that our friends an tho other aide of
the lino wilI get the best of any bargain or
Treaty which mny ho made with thcm in
confnection withi thic prajeet in question and
that xve shauld avaid as far as possible dealing
with them. lis main reason of compiaint is
the diversion of water at Chicago. As to this,
I canfess I amn not suffleientlv informed ta
express an opinion. I believe if aur duty ta
examine tharaughly juta the quest-ion of diversion of water anti if we have any serious
ground for eami)laint, Canada shauid iL.sist
on getting justice before entering into a new

Article 3. It is agreed that, in addition to
the uses, obstructions, and diversions heretofore permitted or hereafter provided for by
special agreement between the Parties hereto,
ne further or other uses or obstructions or
diversions, wvhetheiý tempnrary or permanent,
of boundary waters on either aide of the line,
affecting the natural level or flow of boundary
waters on the other side of the line, shall be
made except by authorîty of the United States
or the Dominion of Canada within their
respective jurisdictions and with the approval,
as hereinafter provided, of a joint commission,
to be known as the International Joint Commission.
The foregoing provisions are not intended to
lirait or interfere wîth the existing rights of
the Government of the United States on the
one aide and the Government of the Dominion
of Canada on the other, to undertake and carry
on governmental works in boundary waters for
the deepening of chaunels, the construction of
breakwaters, the improvement of harbours, and
other governmental works for the benefit of
commerce and navigation, provided that such
works are wholly on its own aide of the line
and do mlot materially affect the level or flow
of the boundary waters on the other, nor are
such provisions intended to interfere with the
ordinary use of such waters for domestic and
sanitary purposes.

In virtue of those treaties the United
States have equal rights with us to free navigation in the boundary waters and in the St.
Lawrence river from the lakes to the sea.
I do nlot think that large ocean vessels wil
ever .navigate above Montreal but I cannot
help believing that a 25 to 30 foot waterway
from Montreal to the lakes, and on the lakes,
is bound te be made, and I have no doubt
that such a waterway coupled with the four
to five million horsepower susceptible of development will be some day or other a very
great asset for Canada.
I amn also of opinion that, committed as
we are in perpetuity ta see both the St.
Lawrence river and the boundary waters
open to free navigation by both countries
on equnl ternis, we can hardly refuse to deal
with our neighbours in connection with the
opening of such navigation and the development of waterpowers on ternis fair to both
parties. I further believe that a properly
worded treaty defining the rights and obligations of both parties and providing for a
proper arbitration board would be rather
a protection for us.
The joint oontrol

seems to be a necessary consequence of the
common interest of both nations in navigation and boundary waters. I should be afraid
that our refusing to have practically anything to do with the United States in connection with the projeet in question would
be taken as an unfriendly act.
Under the treaties to which I have refcrred
I doubt that we should have the right to
have the channel in the international section
aIl on the Canadian side, implying a diver-

137

sien of boundary waters, to which the United
States would no doubt objeet. Even if we
could manage to have the channel aIl on

the Canadian aide and to have entire control of it, I should be afraid that it might
induce the United States to spend any
amount of money towards increasing the
capacity of the Erie-canal and thereby diverting to United States ports freight which
would otherwise corne down the St. Lawrence.
I understand that the power susceptible
of development amounts to about five million
horsepower, two million being in the international section of the river and divisible
equally between Canada and the United
States, and three million in the province
of Quebcc, at the door of Montreal. I should
have hoped that the right of both provinces, Quebec and Ontario, whether in law,
or in equity only, to the power within their
respective territory would have been acknowledged by the Federal Parliament, on
condition that the Dominion should be practically relieved of its share dif expense for
both navigation and power, and on condition also -that the power should remain the
property of the crown.
As my opinion does nlot carry very much
weight, and as my intention was to help as
f ar as possible towards a, proper conclusion
on this important question, I thought it
my duty to seek for information from. a
first-class authority on the subject, namely,
Mr. D. W. McLachlan, of the Deps.rtment
of Railways and CanaIs. He has been, as
I have stated, engaged on this question from
the beginning and is exceedingly well informed and competent to judge. Therefore,
after adjourning the debate I wrote bim, on
the l7th of March, this letter:
Montreal, Marcli 17, 192S.
D. W. MeLachn, Esq.,
Engineer, Department of Railways and Canais,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. McLachlan,
You mnay bave seen the address made by
Honourable Dr. Reid at the Senate sitting of

March 14 on the St. Lawrence waterway projects.
I have adjourned the debate to Wednesday
next, wben I pro p ose to try to give the Senate
a summnary of t he whole projeet, as recoin-

mended by the Canadian section. I am afraid
there is a great deal of confusion in the mind
of the public and it is important that the
recommendation of the Canadian section be
better understood. I have a copy of the report

of the Joint Board of Engineers
with appendix, where I find the recommendations made
DYthe United States section and by the Canadian section.
On page 19 of the report I see a mention
made of the regulating works in operation at
the outlet of Lake Superior, and 1 understand

138

SENATE

that these regulating works are under the
joint control of Canada and the United States
under agreement between both countries. Wouild
you kindly tell me where I can find that agreeWould you also tell me whether the
ment?
water in the port of Montreal can be affected
by these regulating works, and to what extent?
Also what other regulating works, which can
affect the port of Montreal, are projected by
either the United Stateg section or by the
Canadian section?
On referring to page 119, Senate Hansard,
March 14, you will find that Dr. Reid criticizes
very strongly the proposed diversion of the
water from the Canadian side to the Anierican
side between Prescott and Montreal, and more
especially the construction of a canal twentyfour miles in length entirely in United States
territory. Would you kindly tell me whether
in your opinion this diversion eau be avoided
and what would be the consequences as far as
expenses are concerned and as far as control;
also the reason why a channel 800 feet wide
is proposed to be eut through Galop Island
entirely on the American side, and what is
the object of opening this channel. In your
opinion is the port of Montreal liable to be
affected by the proposed works as recommended
by the Canadian section. in what way and to
what extent?
In1 this connection please see
page 124 of Hansard.
As Dr. Reid takes exception to danmming of
River St. Lawrence from shore to shore, I
would like to know if it can he avoided and
if the dammiing is liable to affect the port of
Montreal.
T would also like to be enlightened by vou
on the following:
(1) Would it be practicable to have two
separate channels. one on the Canadian side
and one on the American side, controlled by
each country, both for power and navigation,
and if not, why?
(2) Does the fact that free navigation is
open to both countries imply the necessity of
joint control of the channel?
(3) If one channel alone was constructed
on the Canadian side, say between Kingston
and St. Regis. would it not imply a diversion
of water which would necessitate our obtaiiing the consent of the United States Government?

I want to call special attention to that,
because it is very important.
If it implies
the diversion of water, we cannot help dealing with the United States Government.
(4) Could Galop Island he left alone, or is a
channel througli it a necessity in the case of
the one-stage developmnent as navigation channel
and in the case of the two-stage development
for purpose of regulation only?
I ani writing you very hurriedly. I shall
appreciate any further information which you
can give nie on the whole question. I expect
to leave for Ottawa Tuesday afternoon.
Could you also tell me where I can find the
report of Judge Hughes on the question of
diversion of water at Chicago?
Yours truly,
(Signed) F. L. Beique.
His answer is dated the 20th of March, and
I have reccived it to-day:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

March 20, 1928.
Honourable F. L. Beique,
The Senate,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Senator Beique:
Your letter of March 17th is before me.
A little confusion has arisen in our report
due to the fact that the main body of the
report w-as written while we were still investigating foundation conditions at Crysler
In May, 1927, these foundation conIsland.
ditions turned out to be much better than was
expected, and, as a consequence, we were foreed,
in appendix C, to say that it is an improvement on the two-stage project formely reconimîended by the Canadian Section.
If you read appendix C, you will, I feel, get
everything straightened out.
A partial single-stage project is also described
in appendix C. It was put there at the instance
of the Canadian Section. The United States'
Section counted it ont because it did not
develop al the pow er. It represented the ideas
of the former Board, Messrs. Wooten and
Bowden, when chanîged to imeet new ideas with
regard to ice.
The regulation of Lake Superior is beiug
handled by a Control Board. the Canadiai
memuber of which ls Mr. J. T. Joinston.
Director of the Water PoNels Brani, Dept.
of the Interior. Mr. Johnston succeeded the
late Mr. W. J. Stewart of the Marine Department. The effect of the present regulation of
Lake Superior is discussed in the Report of
Ne
the Joint Board of Engineers, page 78.
doubt this regulation has affected water leveis
in Montreal to a slight extent, but it is se
small it is hardly worth mentioning. See plate
No. 1, page 217.
The regulation of Lakes Huron, Michigan
and Erie was considered by our Board, but
such regulation was reported against, partv
because it could not be made to benefit the
lakes without hurting Montreal, or benefit
power without lowering lake levels, or doing

contenplated as part of the Deep Waterway
Improvement, but the rules are drawn so as
not to affect Montreal adversely, at least
during the latter part of the navigation peried:

of Engineers. Actually, the effect of the regulation proposed would improve the depth lu

of low years.
In the Joint Engineering Board's Report.
the canal is placed on the United States aide
of the line in the vicinity of Long Sault
Rapids, and also at Crysler Island. This is
done simply becanse it worked out cheaper
on that side and left our 14 foot canal systei
Thintact on our side at the Long Sault.
Canadian side is left in a condition where we
can build a canal if we ever wish te do so.
The damming of the St. Lawrence River fron
shore to shore cannot be avoided, if the river
is to be improved for power. The navigation
improvements at Galop Rapids were put
through Galop Island in one case and south
of Galop in another, due to the fact that the
depth required could be secured more easily
in that way than in any other. The location
of the village of Cardinal on the Canadian
side more or less blocks a route on our aide.
and above Cardinal the river is so crooked
that good alignment could not bc secured. It

first question-

I wiIl first repeat each question, so that the
answer to it may be better understood. My
first question was:*
Would it bie practicable to have two separate
channels. one on the Canadian side and one
on the Amiérican aide, controlled by each country, both for power and navigation, and if nlot,
why?
Rerm is his answer:
In answer to your first question I would say
it would bie practical to have separate chan.
nels on either side of the boundary between
Kingston and the head of L'ake St. Francis,
for navigation, but if any quantity of water
were drawn through either of these chanvels
it would involve lowering the level of Lake
Ontario, and this would be a violation of tue
International Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909.
Therefore it necessarily implies the consent
of both parties. He goes on:
Consequently, for separate channels, sone
joint approval of work in the river to compensate for diversions would bie required. To
go further and develop separate power canais
on eaeh side of the river between the outiet
of Lake Ontario and St. Regis would lie absurd,
because the cost of excavating such channels
would be enormous and an international control would be required at Galop Rapids just
the saine as it is required beside the ower
bouses at Crysier Island, and Barnhart ?£sland
in the proposai recommended by the Canadian
section.
Question number 2:
Does the f act that free navigation is oe
to both countries imply the necessity of joint
control of the channel?
Mr. McLaehlan's answer is:
It seems to me that your second question can
be answered in the affirmative, because every
channel enlargement means flattening of slopes
and lowering of levels at its head.
My third question was:
If one channel alone was constructed on the
Canadian side, say between Kingston and St.
Regis, would it not imply a diversion of water
which would necessitate our obtaining the consent of the United States Government?
Mr. McLachlan answers:
The answer to question number three seems
to me to bie "Yes." If a canal on the Canadian
side is constructed for navigation alone, the
diversion of water would bie small and the
works requiring international approval would
also bie small, while a canal for power would
involve a large diversion of water and international approval for extensive control works
at its head.
Questi on number 4:
Could Galop Island bie lef t alone, or is a
channel through it a necessity in the case of

139

the one-tage development as navigation channel and in the case of the two-stage development for purpose of regulation only?
His answer is:
It seems to me question number four can Le
answered -in the affirmative.
Galop Island
and the rapids on either aide of it can bie lef t
alone even with a river improvement for both
navigation and power.
This would however
involve a very large increase in cost. This
increased cost for improvement would lie
brought about by the necessity for the introduction of a side canal with a lock to go round
the rapide at that point and as a water level
below the Island could not bie raised without
affecting Lake Ontario, this in turn would require an enormous amount of channel enlargement between the foot of Galop Island and
Morrisburgh, because this stretch of river muet
Lie put in such a shape as will permit ice to
formn in winter without gorging.
In any practical improvement of the International Section of the river for power, the
channels at Galop Rapids must Le enlarged or
other channels provided at this point in order
to flatten the slope and enable the water levei
below to Le. raised within a few feet of tbat
of Lake Ontario.
1l have no copy of the report of Judge Hughes
in my office. I understand Mr. Burpee, Secrptary of the International Joint Commission lias
one copy, and probably Dr. Skelton of the Dept.
of External affaire has another. It is being
printed by the Pearson Printing Co. of Washington, and i.s being sold at $1.00 per copy. It
was summarized in Engineering News Record,
Dec. let, 1927, page 890. This, my office could
lend you, or it could Le obtained from the
library, I am sure.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) D. W. MeLaclilan.
Iamn sure honourable gentlemen wila appreciate the value of this opinion on the
very important questions which have been
raised, and rightly raised, by the honourable
memýber from. Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid). To
my mmnd the ex!pense of the whole project
could Le divided into two classes: let, the
cost of works solely for navigation, including
the ceet of the Welland canal and of the
decpening of the St. Lawrence, and possibly
the neeessary .preparatory works for the developinent of water power, which the joint
board of engineers cals works comm-on to
navigation and power, anti 2nd, coet of works
primarily 'for power.
As to the let class, the cost~ shoulti be
borne by both countries in the proportion
of their respective interest in navigation,
namely four-fifths for the United States and
one-flfth for Canada.
On tihis basis, the onefilth of the Dominion would be about covereti
by the four-fiftthe payable by the Unitedi %ttes
for the Welland canal and the deepening of the
St. Lawrence.
The icoet of the Welland
Canal alone arnounta to about $116,000,000,
without intereet, and the deepening of the

SENATE

140

river between Montreal and Quobec would
ho some $40,000,000 or 350,000,000, ali told,
if I arn not mistaken.
Hon. Mr. REID: May I ask the honourable gentleman if he is suggesting that Canada aliow the United States to, pay ane-baif
the cest oi the Welland Canal?
Hon. Mr. BEIQIJE:

No, four-fil ths.

Hon. Mr. REID: And the sanie with the
other works betwecn Cornwall and Montreal for navigation?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes. We have made
a bargain which we cannot cancel. Under the
treaties te wbich I have referred the United
States bas equal rights with Canada te free
navigation on the lakes and on the River St.
Lawrence, from the head of Lake Superior
We cannot hielp that, for under
te tihe sea.
flie treaties we have made the United States
hiave acquired tho6e rigbits, so tllat ne canal
can be eut on the Canadian side only, witheut the permission of the United Statos. That
heing se, 1 ask wbat is the use of aur sayîng.
"Let us eut the canal on our side, and centrel
itî"?
We cannoyt do it witheut vioiating the
troaty.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: How d'id
we do with the new Welland Canal? Did wve
get their consent?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do net kniow; 1
would say it could net be donc withbout their
consent. But the enly question I have taken
up with Mr. MeLachian is as te whether it
implies a diversion oi water. No diversion
of water can take place unless it is passed
upon by the Internationl Commission, which
was appeinted for that purpese.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: Dees that
apply te the Geergian Bay canai?
I-on. Mr. BEIQUE: That is another questien.
Hon. Mr. GREISBACH: But an erdinary
diversion of watcr woîîld be distinct from a
diversion where the water flows back afterward.s. Surely the diversion contemplated by
the treaty means a diversion where the water
has gene for good, sucb as the diversion in
Chicago.

canal can be constructed eiýther on the
American or on the Canadian side withoîît
the consent of both parties, because this would
involve a diversion of water, which cannot
be made without the consent or authority of
the Joint International Commission.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the Arnericans
wanted to dig a canal wvould they have to get
our permission?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes. Thcy have equal
rights for free navigation in the laeand in
that part of the St. Lawrence above St. Regis
Those are boundary waters, and it was -agreed
that they are to be boundary waters for al
time to corne; therefore, whether the quantity
of watcr is large or small, it cannot be diverted
without their consent. Mr. MeLachlan. in
bis opinion, makes a distinotion between,
navig-ation only and power. As far as navigation ýisconcerned, it would be a srnall diversion,
but it would ho a diversion, ail the samne. As
Fai as power is concerncd, it wouid ho a verv
large diversion, and therefore it couli noz
be done.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is it, a legal
opinion, or an engineering opinion, wliich Mr.
McLaclblan gives?
lion. Mir. BEIQUE: It is an cngineering
opinion, and it is on a question of fact. As -an
engincer he is giving an opinion, on a question
of fact, that it wvould be a diversion of water.
lon. Mir. ROBERTSON: May I ask rny
hionourable friend a question? Is that conclusion which ho, has voiced based on his
undcrstanding of Mc. McLachlan's opinion
with roference to the diversion of water?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is based on my own
opinion, becauso 1 believe that common sense
dictatcs that it is so; bot I wanted to be sure
that I rmade no mnistake, and I w-rote and put
the question to an engineer who is conversant
xvith conditions, iind his answer 'vas in the
affirmative.

lIon. Mir. ROBERTSON: Which engineer,
I understa-nd, is an eanployee of the Departmoent of Railways and CanaIs?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then I assume
that the House must naturally accept the
opinion of that engineer as being the opinion
of the Departrnent of Railways and Canais,
and indirectly of the Government itaelf?

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course I arn expressing simply my own opinion, which may net
be worth -anything at ail; but I a-m a
Canadian, and I attacb a great deal of interest
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Oh, ne, you cannot
te the rights of this country. If Canada were
assume that. My letter was written, I think,
independent of the United States I naight
take another position, but fromn my reading in a very fair way, for information. I thought
of the treaty I have ne doubt at ail that no0 that as a Memnber of the Senate I was entitled
Hon. Mr. MEIQUE.

MAROR 21, 192
to that information from an emp1oyee of -the
Government who is conversant with the conditions. I wrote himn, and he bas angwered
my questions as ain engineer. 1 arn satisfied
that hoe neyer referred to the Minister or to
anybody in order to answer my questions; in
fact, I 'received the lette just before Ihree
o'clock to-day.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Honourable
gentleman says that there can ho no diversion of boundary waters ivithout the permission of the Joint Board. Is that specifically
stated in the treaty, or doos my honourable
friend infer that only from the common rights
of navigation, whieh hoe thinks wvouId be injured by diversion?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is from the týreaty.
There are ex~ceptions made in the treaty, but
they are small, suoli as sewage and two or
three other small matters; but a diversion
for navigation or for power cannot ho made;
no diversion can be made without the consent of both parties.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That applies to the
St. Lawrence only; it does not apply to the
Ottawa River.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Som? honourable
gentleman asked my honourable friend if the
Georgian Bay canal could ho built, without
the consent of the Amoricans, and I understood my honourable friend to say that it
could nlot.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would say that it
could not, if it implies any diversion of water
from the lakes.
Hon. M -r. DANDURAND:
The French
river flows into the Georgian Bay.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Might I ask the hionourable gentleman on what basis the calculation was made as to the cost heing borne
in the proposition of four-fifths by the United
States to one-fifth by Canada?
Hon. Mr. BEIQIJE: That calculation is
made on the recognizod fact that both countries are interested in navigation in those
proportions. The tonnage of the vessels on
the lakes is fou-r.fifths dor Ameri-can vessels
and one-fifth for Canadian vessels.
I euggested that the coat ho divided into
two classes. and I have deait with the first
class. As to the second class, it should ho
as9unied by Ontario and Quebec.
The province of Ontario would no doubt

horsepower in the province of Quebec, I am

sure companies would ho found to make the
development at their own oxpense, for the
sake of having the benefit thereof for a reasonable terni of years.
If the matter was dealt with in this way,
the western provinces would receive, through
free navigation, al the henefit they may expect from the enterprise; and the legitimate
interest of Ontario and Quebec resulting from
the fact that the power is within their territory would also ho satisfied.
I would have hoped that the Federal Government would have seen its way to lot the
power romain the property of the C.rown in
both provinces, on the latter indemnifying
them as to ail expenses, for the Provinces are
entitled to the power in equity, if not in law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Might I ask rny
honourable friend bis opinion in regard to the
legal rights of the Crown?
Right Hlon. Mr. GRAHAM: Sub judice.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Give hira a fée for
that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not think that
arises on the question. As regards my su.ggestion that the cost of the works common
to navigation and power bo thus borne by
the United States and Canada in proportion
to their interest in navigation, the suggestion
is supported by the unanimous opinion of the
Joint Board of Engineers in paragraph 109 of
thoir report wvhich reads as follows:
100. Fundaniental principles.
This is the joint report.
he plans liave been prepared in accordance
with the reeognized prineiple that the interests

of navigation on the St. Lawrence are
paranionnt. A full observance of this principle (tocs not interfero wvith the beneficial use
of the flow of the river for power generation.
On the eontrary, the improvemnent of the rapid
sections of the river for the joint benefit of
navigation and power affords, as a rule, much
botter navigation than could bo secured by the
improvements aow economically justifiable in
the interest of navigation alone.
So wo have there the opinion that navigation is intorrested in the dovelopment of power,
for reasons which are givon. And when they
pass upon the cost of improvements, we find
what would 'ho the cost of whait they icali tho
improvernonts common to both navigation
and power. Now I have prepared a short
summary of the report.
As is weIl known, the outlet from. Lake
Suiperior to Lake Huron la through the St.
Mary River, where regulation works have
been înstalLed. The control gates are operated
under a hoard of control in aceordance with
conditions laid down by the International
Joint Commission. From 1923 to 1926 the

142

SENATE

release of the water through the gates has
been above normal, with the consequence
that in January, 1926, the water in Lake
Huron was 3 inches, in Lake Erie, 1H inches,
and in Lake Ontario, 1 inch, above what it
would have been without the regulation of
Lake Superior.
In paragraph 13 of the report of the Joint
Board of Engineers, I find it stated that:
Navigation from Lake Superior to Lake
Huron passes through the locks at St. Mary's
Falls. Channels have been excavated through
the St. Mary's River above and below the
locks. and through the St. Clair River, Lake
St. Clair, and Detroit River (all between Lake
Huron and Lake Erie), to afford a minimum
depth of 20 feet at the lake levels that have
been adopted as the standards for improvements.
As honourable gentlemen know, the new
Welland Canal, between Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario, under construction, is 25 miles in
length, and is being excavated to a depth of
27 feet. Navigation from Lake Ontario to
Montreal if provided by isolated channel improvements and a series of side canals around
the rapids, which affords 14 feet depth.
Again reading from paragraph 23 of the
same report:
That part of the St. Lawrence between Lake
Ontario and Montreal runs in deep, slow-flowing
reaches and lake-like expanses, readily improved
for navigation, with intervening reaches of
rapids and swift currents. For the first 67
miles from Lake Ontario the river is a deep,
It then passes through
slow-flowing stream.
the remsaining 49 miles of the international
border in a succession of rapids and swift
water. Leaving the border at St. Regis, the
river expands into the quiet waters of Lake
St. Francis. From the lake it drops in a
and
sucecession of rapids toit Lake St. Lomis. more
drops through
from Lake St. Louis
rapids to Montreal harbour.
Such is in part the description of the conditions of the lakes and river St. Lawrence.
which I find in the report of the Joint Board
of Engineers.
The other day the honourable member from
Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) dealt with the
section extending from Chimney Point to
Colquhoun Island, opposite St. Regis, at the
head of Lake St. Francis, a distance of 48
miles. The whole project was dealt with by
tIse International Joint Commission in its report dated December, 1921, which report in
1924 was referred to an enlarged Joint Board
of Engineers. three of them appointed by the
United States Government, and a like number
appointed by the Dominion Government. The
three Canadian members of the Board, Mr.
Duncan W. MeLachlan, of the Department of
Railways and Canals, Mr. Oliver O. Lefebvre,
Chief Engineer, Quebec Streams Commission,
of Montreal, and Brigadier General Charles
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Hamilton, C.B., C.M.G., of Toronto. General
Mitchell was not a member of the International Joint Waterways Commission.
It may be of some interest to refer here to
paragraphs 126 to 131, inclusive, of the report
of the Joint Board of Engineers dealing with
tIhe international rapids section. It is the
section where the proposed channel is to b
made through United States territory, and to
which the honourable member from Grenville
has taken strong exception. It will be seen
what amount of attention was given to that
section by the Joint Board of Engineers.
126. At Crysler island, a dam 2.800 feet long
is shown on a long curve, with United States
and Canadian power houses each 1,500 feet
long at either end. This curve is introduced
to develop length and followv the most
advantageons rock surface. A loek for 14-foot
navigation is shown at the Crysler island end
of the curved dam. This lock is designed for
lise until the pond above the dam is raised ta
above elevation 229 when 14-foot draft will
become available in the new canal. Estimates
provide for unwatering the control 1,500 feet
of the dam at Crysler Island by the pneumaticcaisson process and for the unwatering of 700
feet in shallow water by the cellular steel
sheetpile trench method. The remainder of the
dam and both power-house sites are to be
unwatered by the open cofferdam method.
for carrying deep
127. The side canal
navigation past the dam is shown on th,
United States side of the river. It is 1.6
miles long and is provided with swing top
log apparatus at the head of the lock. as well
as duplicate gates and fender chains. The cost
of a similar canal on the Canadian side would
be substantially the same.
128. Two-stage plan No. 5-217 shows a dam
at tle head of Barnhart island with power
houses at the foot of that island, as in project
No. 4-224. The works at the foot of the section
are in general similar to the latter project ani
are located at the same sites. The unwaterino
problemîs are the saime and it is intended that
they should bc met in the same way.
129. The water level to be held above the
dam at the foot of the section in project No.
5-217 is 7 feet lower than in project No. 4-224.
This lower level reduces the lift of the lock
in the side canal west of Robinson bay and
lowers the bottom elevation of the side canal
above that point. This lowering of the reach
level also increases the excavation required at
the head and foot of Sheek island for the heail
race.

restricted channel between Butternut island
and the foot of Ogden island. just above
Morrisburg. when levels on Lake Ontarin

sometimes has occurred opposite Prescott.
would cause a large increase in flow in
restricted ehannels while the pond between
Ogden island and Crysler island. 6.700 acres in
extent, is filling up.
131. The travel of surges would not interfere
with the use of channels for navigation, as the
increased velocities would still be within the
limits of safe practice. If. however, a surge
should occur in the brief period when an ice

MARCHI 21, 1928
park is making upstream past Ogden island,
it might increase velocitie8 beyond 2.35 feet
per second.
Sbould the river surface be
heavily burdened witb ice at this time, a gorge
might occur.
1 understand that it is hardly feasible ta
avoid going te the other side. The channel
must of neoessity sonietime be on 'the Canadian aide, and sometime on
the other side.
To have it an the Canadian sie, 1 understand, would involve an expenditure of at
least $12,000,000.
Hon. Mr. REID: Where does the hionourable gentleman get those figures?
Hon. Mr. BFJQUE:
1 got those figures
from Mr. MeLachlan.
I think they are in
the report. It would also mean closing our
eanals on aur side for the time of conetructien,
Hon. Mr. REID: Where?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: At Cornwall. It would
mean a Jârge expense because of the power
development which would have ta be expropriated.
Then folow details with which. 1 need flot
trauble this honourable House, and then the
following recominendations:
142. The estimnated cost of this projeet is
stated by the
Canadian
section ta bie
$228,610,000.
143. In this scheme nearly, if not all, the
gates in the Galop contrai dam would bie open
during flood conditions and during the latter
part of the ice-covered periad.
During the
iow-flow periods of late summer and autunn
saine contrai gates would bie closed.
144. The contre] of flow out of Lake 0ntarie
would be gaverned in part by the level of the
Long Sault reach and in part by the apening
and closing af gates at the Galop Rapids dam.
With this scheme an ice caver wnu]d naelz
upstreami fraîn below Ogden island without
gorging of the section so long as the flow out
of Lake Ontario is held down ta about
203,000 cfs.: and the water level at the Long
Sauit is held up ta about elevation 239.
145. A dam is sbown across a diversion
channel et Galop island and also across a
channel on either side of a lock at Lotus
island. 'The latter would cantrol the flow south
of Galop island. A gated bouse is shown in
bath dams, with butterfiy valves for the bulk
of the apeninge instead of roller gates.
Early in the winter there wauld bie a head of
twa or three feet at the south Galop control
dam and a head of three ta four feet would
be used up in the siopes and dam of the north
Galop channels. The head in the north Galop
channe] together with ability ta quickly close
gates in the other channels can bie used ta
prevent excess flows passing the section during
surges.
146. The
above-described
acheme
would
develop, ahl the head available in the section
during the winter period. and also ail that
available in summer when Lake Ontaria is near
extreme high and extreme low stages. The
amount of power nlot developed by this project

is greatest in apen-water period when Lake
Ontaria stands about elevation 246.0. At that
time the head lest would bie about 3.5 feet.
147. The control of velocity of flow in
restricted channels afforded by this project is
better than in other schemes because fewer
gates need bie opened or closed ta increase or
decrease the flow in the river, and the distribuition of flow in channels can be better controlled. It imposes a guard lack in the path
of navigation instead of the navigable pass
shown in the full single-stage praject.
148. The river is now actually navigated by
aIl trafflc through the four-mile reach between
Iroquais and the head of the Morrisburg canal,
through the ten-mile reach between Morrisburg
and the bead of Farran Paint canal. and
through the four-mile reach between Farran
Paint and the head of the Cornwall Canal.
The vessels used in this navigation
however, heavily powered in proportion are, their
ta
size. The only parts of this section of the
river, above Cornwall island, regarded as safely
and conveniently navigable in its present condition by large lake freigbters and ocean vessels
are the four-mile reach froni Weavers Paint
ta the Farran Point rapide, and the four-mile
reach froin the foot of the latter rapide to the
entrance ta the Cornwall canal.
149. The entire reach of river froin Morrisburg ta the head of the Cornwall canal eau
be rendered safely navigable for deep-craft
vessels with a moderate amaunt of dredging if
the watcr level be raised to elevation 220. At
this elevation the flowage damage is neot extensive. The plans for improving the river for
navigation alone provide, therefore,
this reacb by a series of dams across for raisng
the hed
of the Long Sault rapide.
150. The plans provide a large diseharge
c'apacity througb the gates of these dams, su
that the pool created can be drawn down mn
,tinter. with a view ta avaiding, ordinarîly, the
formation of ice janis in the reaches between
Morrisburg and t6e dams, and of holding the
rise consequent to sucb jams ta minimum levels.
Under no circunistances could the back-watp-r
frvn such rises affect the diseharge capacity
of the coutrol section at the Galop.
Ac'cordînz ta the prajeet recommcnded by the
United States section (single-state development). the channel passes on the American
sqide of the river almost aIl the way from
Chimney Paint ta Iroquois and cutting tbrough
Galop Island, it then follows pretty closely the
boundary line down ta the head af Barnhart
Island where it turns soutb across United
States territory down ta a little below
Massina wbere it again fiaws near the boundary
hune until it reaches the Province of Quebec.
According ta the project recommended by the
Canadian section (two-stage develapment), the
cbannel passes entirely south of Galop Island
and follows the United States side of the river
down ta Morrisburg, and follows then the
boundary line alternating the south and north
sides thereof down ta Long Sault Island, where
it turns south tbrough United States territory
down to the Grass River and Cornwall Island.
froni where it follows near the international
boundary down ta St. Regis. Tbe project eontemplates however a rectification of the
boundary line at Barnhart Island in order that
one of the two power bouse may be on
Canadian territory. A channel is again opened
tbrough Galop Island nlot for navigation but for
contraI gates on]y.

If I rernember

the report of the Joint Waterways Commission, Lt -'rated that the interest of Canada in
the deep) waterways from the lakes te the

se& was one-fifth as campared with foaurfifths which the Americans had. That inciuded, I helieve, their ideas af navigation
from the ocean ta porte on the lakes, the
density of population that would he affected
by it, nnd I understood that they were quite
ngreeabie ta paying 80 per cent of the cost
of the complete works, Canada ta pay 20 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the 80 per
cent give them a title ta the Welland Canal?
Hon. Mr. MaLENNAN: No.
Hon. Mr. REID: And in Queibec too?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What would they
get for their money?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: That was the point
which I wished ta ask the honourabie gentleman opposite who has juet spoken (Hon. Mr.
Beique). Has hie considered that question of
sovereignty? We have joint arrangements for
unimpeded and free navigation. Would the
acceptance of money from the United States
in any way give them a title ta sovereignty
over the Canadian waters?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, no. I wouid
not be in favour of giving them any
right of sovereignty at al. Their rights
should be limited ta those under the treaty
respeoting navigation. If they desired ta act
nneehievously they could do s0 much more
easiiy under the exîsting treatias than under
a neir t.reaty regarding the improvement of
navigation and the development of pomer.
Any speciai treaty should af course provide
for reference of any disagreement ta an arbitration tribunal such as that of the Hague,
or some tribunal which would ha a proper
guarantee. We are neighbours of the United
States and they have a sort of common interest in those waters, so f ar as navigation is
concerned, and it seeme ta me that we are

other public works in King's County in Prince
Edward Island, and inquire if it is the intention of the Government to make provision for
the necessary repairs to the said works during
the present Session of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would ask
the honourable gentleman if he would not
postpone his remarks until next week, as I
have no information at this time. Meantime
I will endeavour to secure the information for
my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I would prefer to
go on to-day, and perhaps the remarks I will
make may be of some help to my honourable
Leader in getting the information. It is just
possible that I may not be here next week.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

All right.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable gentle-.
men, in order that my remarks may be well
understood, I will have to mention .the
Federal political divisions of the province of
Prince Edward Island. The Island is divided
into three political units called counties,
namely, King's. Queen's and Prince, represented
in the House of Commons by four membersone member for King's, two for Queen's and
one for Prince. The counties are nearly equal
in area, but Queen's, which contains the
Capital City, Charlottetown-is the most
populous.
From Confederation down till a few years
ago, so far as I know, there was no discrimination against any of the Counties with respect
to public works, public service or public
appointments.
During the last few years
there has been marked discrimination against
King's County in these respects, and I shall
give some instances.
During the sessions of 1924 and 1925 I
pressed upon the Minister of Public Works
the advisability of strengthening and repairing
the Souris Breakwater in King's County, and
I believe the district Engineers recommended
that this bo done.
The main Estimates of 1925-26 contained
an item of $36,500 for this purpose which
Parliament voted, and a contract was let the
same year for the work, but owing to the
serious illness of the Contractor's partner the
work was not proceeded with and the contract
lapsed.
The Souris Breakwater was not
mentioned in either main or supplerientary
Estimates of the following years 1926-27,
1927-Q8, and is not mentioned in the main
Estimates this year-the only estimates so far
submitted to Parliament. I believe ·his is the
t
only instance on record in Canada where Parliament voted money to repair a structure of
this character, and when the work was not
done owing to some accident, did not re--vote
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

the money the following session, as a matter
of course. The reason is obvious. If repairs
to this structure were needed in 1926 they
were still more needed the following year, and
every yeor since. Then why has this work
been entirely neglected?
This breakwater is now and has been for
the past few years in a very dangerous condition, and is liable to be carried away at any
time by a heavy storm. The breakwater
makes the harbour of Souris, and on it the
town largely depends.
If the breakwater
should be carried away the large railway
wharf and the private wharf of Matthew
and McLean would certainily be destroyed,
and the eastern end of Prince Edward Island
would be without shipping facilities. This
must not be allowed to happen; but the
Gove.rnment is taking big risks.
Another thing should be mentioned, and
it is this deterioration is going on so rapidly
because of the absence of suitable repairs
that $60,000 will now be required to do the
work that $30,000 or $40,000 would have donc
two or three years ago. Now, the breakwater ot Souris is a sample of the way in
whicli the other public works in King's County
have been neglected during the last few years.
Let me illustrate. In 1926-27 the Main and
Supplementary Estimates for Prince Edward
Island under the heading "Harbours and
Rivers" contained items for King's county
totalling $8,000, while for the other two
counties they totalled $172,300. For 1926-27,
under the same heading King's county got
$1,000 while the other two counties got
$126,800. The above figures do not include
the items for a potato warehouse in each
county last year which cost practically the
same amounts.
This year the Main Estimates, under
"Harbours and Rivers" provide for an expenditure of $13,700 in King's county and an
expenditure of $206,100 in the other two
counties, and the Souris breakwater is not
mentioned. The other works in King's county
that need immediate attention are the breakiçater and harbour at Bay Fortune, the breakwater at Little Sands and the breakwater and
harbour at Nuefrage.
When I came into public life some twentyeight years ago there was in existence a
steam packet service between Southern King's
and the mainland which was very useful to
the farniers, fishermen and business men of
that part of Prince Edward Island. In 1924
an effort was made to abolish this service,
but the Prime Minister, at my request,
prevented this. Last year the service was
abolished.

MARCH 22, 1928
There is a movernent an faot, now ta
establish a stearnship refrigeration service
between Prince Edward Island and several
points in Nova Scatia. I think this will be
a useful service and will develop trade, but
only two places in Prince Edward Island are
ta be ports af caIl, namely, Summerside in
Prince and Charlottetown in Queen's. King's
county is ignored. This would be a splendid
oppartunity ta restore ta King's the service
that was abalished last'year. I amn doing
what I can ta have onc or two places in
King's made ports of caîl and I have written
the Minister of Trade and Commerce on the
subjeet, but 1 do nat know what the resuit
will be.
As with the public works and the public
services of King's, s0 has it been with regard
to publie appointrnents in that county during
the past few ycars, but I will not pursue that
phase of the subj ect any farther at present.
Suffice At ta say that King's county has been
trcated, as if it werc a piece af foreign territory that had been conqucred by the sword
and its people had ta be held in subjection
by being served meagre rations.
I do not blame the Public Works Department or the Govermcent for what has hitherta taken place. Naturally they took the
advice of the rnen here and the men on
Prince Edwrard Island who) had the right and
the privilege ta advise thern, but they must
now sec that the advice so given bas been
xnostly sectianal and othcrwise unfair; and the
Govcrnmcnt will be ta blame if the discrimination againat King's county continues. But
surely the Governent of Canada will not
allow such conditions ta continue.
I wanted ta place this matter before Parliament before the preparation of the Supplementary Estimates, in order that at lest a
measure of justice might be donc ta that
county.
UNION 0F CANADA AND
NEWFOUNIYLAND
MOTION

Hon. C. E. TANNER rnaved:
That in the opinion of this House Canada
should favourably consider any proposal that
may be rnade by Newfoundland for union with
the Dominion of Canada.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it is unnecessary for me ta tell the House that the
subjeet which I arn introducing this afternoon
is anc that has engaged the attention of public
men in Newfoundland and public men in
Canada over a long periad of tirne. Indeed,
1 think it is correct ta say that the history of
its cansideration gaes back ta the early days
of Confederation, and that it was hoped by
56109--lO1

147

the publie men of those times that the Do-rinion of Canada would same time be rounided
out by the union with Canada of the colony
of Newfoundland. However, as honourable
members know, no agreemnent was ever
reached, or could be reached. Sornetimes it
appeared as if the representatives of Newfoundland and Canada were getting dloser
together; on one occasion, I believe, they were
very nearly together. Sometirnes Newfoundland was the reluctant bargainer, and at other
times the Dominion of Canada. But notwithstanding that the leaders of those days failed
in agreeing on a basis which would be fair to
Newfoundland. and fair to this country, I be'lieve-and I have sorne reason for believing
-that there is existent to-day to sorne extent,
-perhàps nlot arnongst the political leaders of
~Newfoundland, but arnongst the people-a
desire that not very rnany years hence a fair
basis of union between Newfoundland and the
~Dorninion of Canada rnay be arrived at. 1
believe also that I arn correct in saying that
in Canada there exists an opinion favourable
te the union of this country with Newfoundland.
Looking back over the history of events,
and having in mind the state of aiffairs to
Iwhich I have just alluded-and I intend to
be very brief in rny rernarks on the subject¶ carne ta the conclusion that it wauld be
'desirable if this Chamber, where honaurable
mexnbers are representatives of public opinion
in their various provinces, and are privileged
te speak particularly for the provinces which
they represent, were to give expression to the
opinion which, 1 think honourable members
will agree, exista in sorne measure in Canada
and in Newfoundland ini regard to the union
of the two countries.
I need neot say ta 'honourable members that
I realize at once that we cannot in this House
maire anythiýng in the formi of a definite proposai. That must necessarily corne frorn the
autharity of Vhe twa cauntries, the Government of Canada, for the tirne being, and the
Govcrnrnent of the Island of Newfoundland
for the tirne being. But wc in this House
can have our own opinions; we can analyze
public opinion as far as we can gauge it; and
we are justified in putting upon record aur
views in regard ta public opinion in the
Dominion of Canada on thris subjeet.
Honourable rnernbers will observe that ahl
1 arn asking this House to do la favourably
ta consider any proposai that rnay be made by
Newfoundland for union with the Dominion
of Canada. The situation which I arn placing
bef are hanourable rnembers is this: that if
the people of Newfoundland, on a review of

148

SENATE

what lias happened, and iooking into the
future, should conclude thît it would bc in
the interests of ilheir counîtry, and in the interests of Canada, that further conferences
nîight be held betwcen the two in regard to
Union, any proposai froîn thcrn shouid ho
weicorned, in the opinion of the Senate of
Canada, and the people of Canada should bc
ready to, sit dlown and talk the matter over in
a friendly spirit. That is the extent to which
1 arn asking this HoLise to agree this afternoon, and I think it is a reasonable proposition, and one which I hope wvi1i be unanirnousiy
apnroved by the Huse.
Honourable members rnay be rerninded
that weý who corne from the Maritime Provinces are perhaps; a littie more farniliar with
Newfoundiand and its people than are'others
who are sitiîateu in more wesstern provinces.
For a great rnany years we in Nova Scotia
have been very weii acquainted with the island
and rnany of its people. I may ba perrnitted
to s-iy that personally I have aiways taken a
great interest in Newfoundiand, and have had
relatives in there; anci our people ini Nova
Scotia have had rnany personai acquaintances,
both sociaily and in business rnattcrs, and have
alwvs had the highcst opinion of the people
of that island, anti a great deai of respect for
their enterprise and progress. I rernember,
f00, that one of Newfoundland's prime mini.sters. one of the niost erninent men of the
Island, Sir Williami Whiteway, married bis
wvife froici Pictou, the town iii which I was
born.
1 remoiher also that one of the
crninent mon cf tiîat sarne town, a Roman
Catholic, wvho was for rnany years parish
priest, with) vhorn I was very weli acquainted
indeed, and whorn 1 very greatiy adrnirod,
Nvas calied over to the Lland of Newfoundland, and became the Bishop of Harbour
Giace.
I rnerely mention those littie incidents to indicate that down in aur province
there are great, iiumibers of people who know
the people of Newfoundiand v-cry wvell, and 1
hope they know us as fax ourably.
The whoie o-f Canada docs a good deal of
business wýith Newfound'Iand.
1 arn not, going
to dotay the House witlh any particuilars; but
I inight refer honourabie niembers; to tho report cf the trade of Canada in 1927, which
shows that, w.e biuy a good deal1 from Newfounidiani. and soul a good deai ta the inhabitants there.
Last year we soid $11,000,
000 wvcrth cf produce of varions kinds, such
as applos, potatocs, oats, wbeat, flour, sugar,
ruýbber, hay, cattie, meats, butter, cheose, oils,

Hon. _Mr. TANNER.

acids, medicines, and other articles; so that
there is quite a large and growing trade hatween Newfound'iand and the Dominion of
Canada.
Another aspect of the matter ta whioh I
wouid calu a'ttenltion is the fact that Newfoundland and the Dominion of Canada are
units of the one Empire.
We have that in
common.
We are unýdcr one King and ana
flag, we have traded togethar during peace
tiînes, and Newfoundland and Canada fought
together on the battiofieids of Flanders. Newfc()undland as nobiy perfornied its duty during
the Great Wnar as did ans' other Dominion of
the Empire. Tue fact that we are units of
the same Empire, and unider the sarne King
and the saine fiag, constitutes: a reason, f0 my
mmnd, wh' we shouid hope that the time is
nýot very far distant when the two may draw
together and we may bc made
one.
Then thora is another featura of the situation, which is, that Canada is iooking with
great hopefuineas and stretching out towards
the future,
We are tald that we are expanding our influence throughout the worqd, and
it is truc.
The leader of this House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) ha.9 just returned froma an
important mission at Geneva, where the
Nations of the Worid were reprcsented; wa
ire now taking- our place in the Councils of
the whole wvorld, and Canada is ]ooking forward to the time when this coun<try wiii ha
reckoned as one of the great nations of the
world.
Now,, bearing in mmnd the faet that
wa have Newfoundland so near to our shares,
and that there is daily communicatian hetween
Canada and thait Island, it is highiy desirabia
that the units of the Empire should be consoidiated further than they are, if the people
of Newfoundland shauid so desire.
Indead,
I would like f0 entertain ai vision that the tirna
tviil corne when not only Newfoundiand but
tbc Brit.sh West Jndies,-all cf the units of
the Empire on this side of the Atiantic-wiil
be consolidated into one great Dominion.
Ncw, honourabie members, I have said
practically ail thait I wish to say in introducing ibis subjeet.
1 have purposeiy made
rny rernarks very brief, because I hope that
a numbor of other honaurable rnembes wvill
join me in speaking on this subjeet.
In conclusion, I would sinply repeat that ail
I arn asking this House is, that if Newfoxindland desireb f0 corne to us to discuss this subjeet cf Confederation, we wili give thern a
friendiy ieeption, and sit down and talk it

mbt

over.

Hon. A. B. COPP: Ilonourahie gentlemen,
I second the motion my bonourable friend bas
introduced this afternoon with a great deai of

MARCH 22, 192
pleasure, for one or two reasons. First, I think
that the time bas arrived when if any sucb
opportunity cornes it should naît be frowned
upon, but that we should discuss with our
friends of Newfoundiland the proposition of
their joining with the Dominion of Canada
and making t!his Dominion that much larger
and better off.
1 do not know that 1 would have said
a word except that as I read the motion,
I would flot want to see it interpreted strictly
according to the language used. I would go
as far as to say that we should consider
any proposai made; but I question whether
the language used in the motion should not
be modified somewhat, where it says that
we «should favourably consider any proposai
that may he made." I amn sure that this
House would be favourable to giving consideration to any proposai made by representatives of the Island, and if possible, arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion in regard to
Union.
As the mover very well said, the question
of taking in Newfoundland as part of the
Canadian Confederation was discussed at the
time this Dominion was formed, but for
some reason or other the Isianders did not
see fit to join us at tbe time. However,
altbough the Fathers of Confederation failed
to reach conclusions with the repreaentatives
of Newfoundland at that time, there is no
reason to suppose that the door should for
ever be shut, or that the leaders of thought
at the present time sbould not give consideration to the matter if it should be brought
before this Chamber; and, as the mover has
very well said, such a union would be a
very great advantage to this country.
Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable
gentlemen, agreeing as I do very heartily
with what the honourable gentleman from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) bas lu bis mind
in bringing before the buse this resolution,
I would like to say a f ew words in support
of it, although I arn free to admit at once
that I have flot given it the consideration
whicb su important a question naturally deserves.
1 arn now one of the older members of this
House-older in years, 1 mean-and I tbink
that at the present time I arn probahly the
only member from tbe Province of Ontario
wbo would have personal recollections of the
discussions, and of the difficulties, wbich
surrounded the bringing about of Confederation sixty and sixty-five years ago. I can
remember wben, as a school-boy, I beard a
good deal of discussion in regard to union
between the Canadas and the Maritime
Provinces. 1 can well rernember that to us

149

in Ontario, Newfoundland was then littie,
if any, more unknown or more distant than
Nova Scotia. We knew of it simplY as a
sister colony, and we tbougbt that if it was
a desirable tbing tbat there sbould be union
between Canada and the Maritime Provinces,
it would equally be of advantage to all that
Newfoundland should he included. 0f course
we aIl know, as a matter of bistory, that
representatives of Newfoundland took part
in the Quebec Conference, and in the discussions whicb, so far as the island was concerned, unfortunately then carne to notbing.,
Now, perhaps by lapse of time, the question
lias become of even greater practical importance, and as much so to Canada as to New-'
foundland. The recent decision of the Judicial
Cornmittee upon the question of boundaries
between Newfoundland and Canada bias made
a very oonsiderable difference in the situation as we Canadianîs thougbt it wae before
that decision took place. In speaking of
it, one thing that ought to be always
kept in mind is the important fact that
tbe members of the Judicial Committee who
by their decision fixed wbere, upon the ground,
the boundary fell, were not in a.ny manner
engaged in awarding territory to either Canada or Newfoundland, but were simply and
solely engaged in the judicial work of determining where, on the ground, tbe boundary
-fixed hy competent autbority centuries ago
-was in f act to be found.
In sorne of the discussions in the newspapers
tbat I bave seen. in regard to that award.
the decision bas been referred to as tbough
it were a decision of commissioners or arbitrators fixing for the first time the boundary,
and deciding the question of where the boundary should be. 0f course it was notbing of
the kind. The place wbere the eastern boundary of Canada should be was fixed by Irnperial authority, by tbe Parliament and the
Government of Great Britain, long before
Canada was an autonomous country; long before there was any power or right in any of
the inhabitants of Canada to deal with any
sucb question. The eastern boundary of Canada was fixed by the decrees and the statutes
of Government and of Parliament in Great
Britain in exactly the samne manner as the
soutbern or the western boundary of Canada
was fixed by the like tribunals. The Judicial
Committee in its work two years, or eighteen
months ago, was doing notbing but judicially
interpreting and construing the various legai
documents by which the position of that eastern boundary was fixed, and their determination of that question, whicb was purely a
question of the legal and true interpretation
of the language before thern, is one in respect

150

SF&NATE

to which, whatever feelings of disappointmcnt
or of astonisliment the decision May have
created, no one anywhere lias any ground for
complaint.
The territory in question was
British. It was to be assigned either to the
colony of Newfoundland or to the colony of
Canada, and the fixing of the boundary was
simply a question of the Britishi Parliament
or the British Government deciding where it
would be hest, in thoir opinion, that tlic
boundary hctween those two colonies should
be placed.
The circum.stance, however, that wo now
know that boundary is much farther to the
wcstward than we Canadians bcd thouglit it
was, gives, of course, very much increased importance practically f0 fthc question of what
is to bie donc in the administration of thec ferritoryv wh.icb was in dispute. The extent of it
is somewhat astenishing to anynne who has
not thouglit practically of the arcas with wbich
we are dea]ing in Canada. The island of Newfoundland itself is larger by one-third than the
the wliole of Ircland. The mainiand territoryLabrador, as we may cail it-is ncarly thrco
times the area of thc island; ,o that, so far
as inere- acreage is concerned. there is an
empire in the northcrn part of NcÇwfouindl.iand.
Considering the isiand alone, wc have there
a population of, I tbink, about one-haîf that
of NoaScotia. The isianul of Nowfoundland
alone is twice tli' size of the priovince of
Nov a Scutia or cf Vancouver Island. It is
no mean tcrritor *v in size; it is a place worth
thinking about; and union wijth it would be
sOMething- desirable, 1 venture to think, fromn
the starudpoint cf Canada, without regard
to what may be the s-tandpoint of Newfoundland itself.
Of Ilhe view cf the people cf Newfoundland
we are not to spcak. That is their own affair.
And that perhaps makes the situation with respect to the proposal for union one of considerable delicacy. If is not unlike, it secms
to me, ftic situation xvhich miglit face any
youung mann if lie 'veru cuntemplating matrimony; and perliqps the fact that this is lcap
ycar may either coniplicate or sQmooth away
somnething of flic difficultios. if there are difliculties pcactically in the situation. It is the
ancient law, we under-stand, that during leap
year the lady bas the riglit te m-ake a proposa],
but I suppose fthc man lias not in any way
lest bis riglit. Eithcr party, I takc it, may
lalvflil'v propose, and in exactly that situation
1 sholld think that cit-her Canada or Newfoundiand mig-it, witliout any eeainfo
dignity, make proposais or suggestions one te

Sir ALLEN AYT.ESWORTIT.

But that does not remeve the difficult.y as ta
which is f0 begin. Somnebody must speak first,
or nothing wilt ever lie donc, and it seems ta
me tliat we are inxlebted. te the honourabie

us an opportunity of expressing opinions witli
regard te it. For my part I appreve, and 1
hope that flic resolution whieh mny honourchie

language as showing that there is nothin.- in
it to which anyone ceuld take tlic ëligit est

our part fliat Canada sliould favourabiy considcr any propos4ai that may be made by
Newfoundicnd for union witli the Dominion
of Canada.
I want to make a suggestion as ta the
wording wliich may commend itself to the
lIeuse.
It scems te me it miglit malte a
little difference, just because of tho situation
I have been trving te, describe. This xvording
is: "amy proposai tliat may lie made by
Ne-wfeunýdland." But Ncwfoundlcnd mcy Fay,
"Whyu uhould we make anv proposaI? We

colonies, that Newfoundlcwd bias been a
British possession for more than four bundrcd
years, w bereas Canada as a Dominion is but
of flue age of sixty; and we must net forget.
cubher, that flicre is sncb a thing-, n*ow uit any
rate, as cquality cf status, and flit wbctlier
flic status of Canada as a Deminion is a
new status or an aninnt one, if is a status
cf equality. If that is so-if Canada as a
Dominion is to-day of equal status with
Britain ifself, s0 is Newfoundlcnd. There can
bo no -,ains.aying of tbat position. Canada
is, we w'ill ail concede, tlic equa] in political

the equal of Canada. If Canada bas a status

lie said: Honourable gentlemen, when this
B3ill was on the Order Paper on a previous oc,casion I gave ail the information which 1 had
with regard to it, but there is one aspect of
the matter which I should perhaps have made
clear. It is this. The Bill in its passage from
the other branch of Parliament to this one
was placed iu my name as Leader of the
lieuse. IBy whom, or why it was doue, I
do uot kuew. The only reasen that I can
think of is th-at it wvas bee.ause the Bill
we'nt through the other lieuse, wvhere it
received unanimeus support, with the active
co-operation and approval of the Postmaster
General. Finding the Bill in my name, and
as it wvas one thajt met with my personal approval 1 did net give it a second thought,
and perhaps I left the lieuse under the impression that I was dealing with it because
it was a Goverement mieasure. Apparently
that is net se. The Bill was net introduced
b «v an'v menber of the Geo'erninent, but by
onc' of flic memhers foi. thc city of Toronto.
As I say, tLe Biîll was supperted by the

liaving said that. I de net know that I
shjould sa'v anyîhing more, exeept, perhaps,
te, repeat that the Bill1, meets with my persoucI approval. It is a mcasure demauded, I
think, a long time age. I cao remember
articles in newspapers, both in this province

this kind.

epen discussion. We are disposed and willing and sexieus te know just whose opinions
are being impressed upon our attentionopinions that have less or miore value dependiug upeu who expresses them. If an opinion
emianates; from a man of long experieuce sud
seuud judgment, that opinion is likely te go
much further thau the opin;ion of a mani who
has had little or ne experience and whose
judgment has net proved te be of the seundest. Bills ef this kiud have been iu existence
fer seme time in England, in Australia, and in
the' United States, snd f rom what I have been
able te ascertain they have worked satisfactorily and te the advantage of the public.
A question was put te me yesterdaynet iu the House-as te whether we had a
right te deal with a messure of this kind.
A very learned aud experienced member of
the bar of this province, for whomn I have
the highest respect, expressed a doubt as te
our jurisdiction, being rather of the opinion
that this was a 'natter affeeting propcrty and
civil rights. WeIl, gentlemen, if you look
at the Bill you will sc that it really dees
net affect preperty or civil rights, even indirectly; it is purely and simply a matter
of post office administration.
In 1882 the
publishers of newvspapers, magazines, and se
on, were al'lowed te transmit their publications through the mails ou specially advantageous termas, which have fromn time te time
been bettered, and while 1 cannot state precisely what advantage they enjoy over
iudividuals, it is certain that they de enjey
a privilege which others do net. This Bill
merely places an. obligation upon the publishers te, do certain things lu order te continue te enjoy that privilege. We are net
dealing withi their preperty or civil rights;
xve are net sffecting their legal status or
doing anythîng, which te my mind, can be
said te interfere wvith preperty or civil rights;
we simply say yeu will have te, make these
statements sud publish thema lu yeur ucwspaper in order te, continue te, eujoy the
privileg-es which have been grsnted te yeu.
I do net knew that 1 eau add auything,
further without repeating myself, se I will
again move the second reading of the Bill.
lion. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I am net particularly concemned lu this matter one way or the other. but I feel tînt the
Bill1 should go te a Cemmittee. As a rule
Buis that ceme before the lieuse, unless they

MARCH 22, 1928
.are Governient Bills, are sent to a Coinmittee in order that we may hear all who
wish to be heard, eîther ini favour of thein
or against them. I think that was the position taken in the other Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no. My honourable friend is mistaken. The Bill was
read the second time, the Bouse went into
Committee upon. it and reported it, and it
was read the third turne, ail in the one aftennoon.
J[on. Mr,. REID: Is not that ai the more
reason why it should go before a Committee
of this Bouse? I ami sure that if the Bill is
fair to the newspapers and to the public the
honounable gentleman should not be afraid of
it going before a Cornmittee. A Bill of this
kind may have serious consequences to the
newspapers eithen one way or the other. I can
quite understand that perhaps the newspapens
as a whole would not like to take the position
that the Bill should have gone to a Committee and that they should have been given an
opportunity of being heard; but we have Coinmittees of this Bouse for the purpose of taking up matters and inquiring into thein, and
bubmitting the evidence to the Bouse so that
lwe may coine to a proper conclusion. It is
-al right for the honourable gentleman to give
lus bis opinion. 1 do not know any more about
the Bull that what I have heard froin hum, but
I have alway8 understood that the newspapers
did file -certain information with the Department. If we had that information before us
we might come to the conclusion that it was
sufficient.
SI amn only pleading now for sufficient information to enable me to come to a proper
conclusion as to how I should vote. I would
'like to have the Bill go before a Committee.
Sunely that is not unreasonable. It is flot
going to Iengthen the Session at ail. I hope
'the honounable gentleman, thenefore, will
'change his motion and send the Bill to one of
'the committees, where we may get the information which. I have asked for.
R ight Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: I
agree with my honourable friend who has
just taken hie seat. We could pnobably obtain the information better before a Committee, and I think we should do so, because this
Bill contaîns perhaps more than appears to
those who are not interested. If honourable
gentlemen will pardon me, I will just go over
it briefly. It says:
The editor, publisher, business manager, or
owner, of every newspaper, magazine, periodica!,
or other publication, shall file with the Postmaster General and the postinaster of the post
office designated by the regulations, not later
than the first day of April and the first day

153

of October of each year, on blanks furnishied
by the Post Office Departinent, a sworn statenment setting forth the naines and poat office
addresses of the editorWhat editor? 'ne sporting editor, the financial editor? the social editor? the news editor,
'or the editorial writer? What does the Bill
inean on that point?
Hon. Mr. DANILEL: AUl of them.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does it mean
the editorial writer? I may be wrong, but as
'one of the older journalists in this country, I
believe the impersonal character of Canadian
'journalisin bas been its strength. It is what
the paper says, nc>t what somne individual says,
that the public look to; and the responsibility
is with the owner of the paper, be that owner
a corporate body or an individual. If a newspaper must file under oath the namne of every
editorial writer, what then? There are gentlemen wbo contribute greatly to the literature
of this country through the newspapers who
do nlot care to have their namnes published on
the front page.
H-on. Mr. BETJIWURT: I hope my honourable friend has a stronger argument than that?
Right Hon. Mr. GRKýHAM: Those who
have had soine experience know that, that is
one of the strongest arguments that can be
brought forth. I could naine some gentlemen
who write very high elass articles for the
newapapers, and who are nlot in the newspaper business at ail, but in other employment.
They write simply because they have a literary turn of mind, and the proprietor takes al
responsibility, and must, for what those perÉons say. Now I continue:
-mana«ing editor, publisher, business managers
and owners, and, in addition, the stockholders,
if the publication be owned by a corporation;Nearly every newspaper now carnies the
*naineof the managing editor. The publishers
ý-because thiey are joint stock companies-and the business managers are well known.
There is no question about that.
Now we come to the owners-and this seeins
to be what the Postinaster General has in
mind. In Ontario, and I suppose it is the
saine in other provinces, we make an annual
return giving the naines of the officers of the
company, the naines of the directors, the
naines of the shareholders, the number of
shares they own, the value of those shares,
and the amount paid on them.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is not done, is
it?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is in the
province of Ontario, and I think it is in the
other provinces.

Honourabie
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen., I confess that I have hardly had
time to examine the Bill which is be-fore us,
as to the fact that it is tacked on to the
Post Office Act, or -the extent of the Bill,
or its phraseology.
I simply want Vo address myself for a
moment to a broader question than that which
appeans on the face of the Bitl itself, but a
question which in its essentials I believe, is
deait with by the Bihl. It is that of impersonal journalism. My right honourable
friend to my riglit (Riglit Hon. Mr. Graham)
has expressed his preference for impersnal
j ournalism; but there is very mucli to be
said in favour of 6igned articles in newspapers. There -are countries where that practice prevails, the leading articles being signed
by journaliste whose names become welI
known, and who in fact make for themselves
a reputation, so that as their names appear at
the bottom of articles from. day to day for
years, their productions become quite authoritative, according to the sound judgment and
the brilliancy of the writers.
There are countries where journalism is
impersonal, and it works no hanm when for
a nuimber of years a newepaper has established
it.sell, and gained the confidence of the public
for i-ts sure and sane leadership. But there
are dangers locyming ahead, which are the
result of .present-day transformation. One
danger is the comffmercializing of newspapers,
the ownership beirjg obtained by large institutions, fiinancial and others, which create ohains
of newepapers from onje end of a country to
t.he other, thus dominating public opinion. A
body of mnen can purchaise a series of newepapers, and- daiiy carry on thefr campaign
towards their ends-not public ends-but, their
ends. How will the ordin-ary reader, who is
also an -elector, flnd out who are the -men
moving behind thie scene? They used to

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would lîke to, ask

tbis question cf personal and impersonal
journalism affect the Poet Office?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I have said,
I have net examined the formi of the Bill,
or its application te the Post Office Act, or
the ground it is supposed te cever. 1 desired
to addreos myself simply te wbat I thouglit
te be the essential principle of -the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: That miglit mnake, a very
good principle for s.nother BiHl-a Bill relating
te the criminal law or something of that kind.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Was it bought with
trust company money?

Hon. SMEATON W-RITE: Honourable
gentlemen, the riglit honourable member for
Eganville (Riglit Hon. Mr. Grahamn) lias
referred te the first clause of this Bill. The
second clause ie in my opinion quite coinfused.
It reads in tb.is way:
Ali editerials or other reading matter published in any sucli newspaper, magazine, er
periodical fer the publicatien of which money
or other va.luable censideratien is paid, accepted,
ç,r promised shahl be plainiy marked "advertisemient".
Every article written in a newepaper is
paid for; that is, the editorial writers are
paid. According te my reading of this Bill,
we couhd not publish anything.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If my honourable friend will read it carefully hie will see
that the payment is for the publication, net
for the writing.
Hmn. Mr. WHITE: It dees net say se,
here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I bad hard
work straigbtening it eut, but I finahy got
what wa.s meant.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: It dees net say se here.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made reference te a newspaper having
been recently bouglit by a trust oompany. 1
imagine there is only one preperty in the
public eye, and the gentleman who bouglit
it dlaims that lie is the preprieter; that lie
borrowed the money froim tbe bank and is
prepared te give proof of lis ewnership. I
do net think it is quite fair te make a charge
without naming the preperty. I think that
if my honourable friend knows of a preperty
that lias been bouglit by a trust company
recently lie sheuld, in fairness to the newspaper gentlemen who bave bouglit properties

Hon. Mr. WHITE: The purchaser says that
it was bouglit with money borrowed from the
bank. He is prepared to say what bank lie
borrowed it from, and how much lie borrowed. My honjours.ble friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) makes a serious charge in bis
reference to a property bought recently. 1
do flot know what property it could be except
one, and the property that I aUlude to is the
Mail.
Hon. Mr. REID: 0f Toronto?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: 0f Toronto-the Mail
and Empire. If it is the saine property, I
think my honourable friend should say se, and
give the people who are interested in that
transaction some opportunity to reply. Otherwise the statement is hardly fair.
So I move, honourable gentleman, that the
Bill be flot now read a second time, but be
read this day six months hence.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, I arn not specially interested ini the
newepapers or in thefr editorial writers, but
fromn what I have heard this afternoon I think
this Bill should go before a Committee. I
Iistened with a great deal of interest to the
speech of the right honourable senator fromn
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), who, I
t'hink, stated that lie is or for a number
of years was a journalist, and that the
great strength of t.he editorial writing in thi8
country was in its anonymity. I agree wàth
him, and in my opinion that is why it sliould
be signed. I think that anonymous editorials
in many cases carry znuch more weight than
tbey ought tio carry, and that if the signature
cf the writer were appended the editorial
would probably be taken at a truer value.
Therefore I am rather in favour of tbat part
cf this Bill. I think that the best way te
deal with it would bie to send it to a~Cenmittee.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
gentlemen like the right honourable senator
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), I
do flot see any real good in this Bill, or
any partieular harm. I lm speaing as a
publisher of a newspaper. I do flot see any
necessity for the requirements contained ini
this measure, and I do flot consider that there
is much public demand for sucli legislation.
Now, having said that, I do flot want.te put

myseif in the position of being opposed to
the Biii. If there is any taint directed
against the ownerships of newspapers in this
country I arn prepared, se far as I arn concerned, to have the information called for
in this legisiation published in the newspaper
with which I arn associated. But 1 think
that the people in cvery community where
a newspaper is an influence know who are
the owners of the newspaper. They know
the influence that dominates it. They know
that in Toronto, tbey know it in Montreal,
they know it in Winnipeg and everywhere
cise. Then, as for caliing upon the newspaper
to furnish this mass of information, I would
point out that, while it is truc there rnay
be a rnanaging editor or a directing editorial
influence, it is impossible to place before the
public the names of ail the editorial writers.
There may be four or five. Some of them
rnay be permanent members of the newspaper
staff, and some may be only contributing
editors.
In years gone by there used to be a feeling that some newspapers were controlled or
dominated by corporations. The impression
cxisted that certain newspapers in Western
Canada were controlicd by the great railroad corporations. I do not think that such
a charge is made against a single newspaper
at the present time. Howcver, if the public
rcaiiy want to find out who are the owncrs
of a newspaper, thcy may ascertain that
rcadily enough. They may do so in our
province, the province of Alberta, by going
to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies,
who has a record of the name of every shareholder, and the number of shares that he
holds.
I doub t very much whether any other
business in this country would encourage
legisiation that would require it to produce
the names of the concerns holding mortgages
against it, and to publish those names in the
columns of a newspaper. Having said that,
altbough I bave criticized the Bill more than
I have supported it, still, as the publisher of
a newspaper, I have ne personai objection
te legislation of this character; because what
is now availabie tbrough channels such as
the Re-istrar of Joint Stock Companies couid
bc mad& available ta the publie in the way
that is preposed bore. But I think that
a great deal of the information that is

names ef the owners of a new.spaper are
demanded, they might be published at certain periods of the year, but to ask for
the names of ahl the members of the staff
is unnocessary, because the pehicy of a newspaper is dictated by the man or the company

that ewns it, and is net in the hands of the
editor, or the managing editer, or the business
manager.
Hon. JOHN LEWIS: As one wbo bas had
some experience as a working newspaper man,
and none whatevcr in own-ersbip, I shouid be
very greatly intereslted in any movement for
mncreaising the independence of the editor or
writer, but 1 cannet sec how that object iis
geing te be attained by the publication of the
name of the owner, the name of the managing editer, and the names of the varieus
editoriai writers. Nor weuld that informatien
convey very mucli enlightment te the public. If yen pass this Bili you de net know
wheither the persan who wrote a certain article
wrote it on bis own initiative or on the erders
of the editor, and yeu do flot know how far
tbe paper is centrelled by the editor or by
the owner. Yeu are exactly in the same position as you wore before. It may be thought
tha.t the ewner is under some out.side control
-that a corperation may possibly bave get
pessession of tbe newýspaper. They might do
that just as weli tbrough sorno nominal
ewner. Tberefore, in order te carry eut the
abject ef this Bili yen weuld have te insist
upen the publication of ail the invcstments
ef the persans whe own the nocwspapcr.
"Are yen interosteci in the Canadian Pacifie
Raiiwav. or in seme bank, or saime ether big
cerporation?" You weuid nover ho at an end
ef tue infermatien that wouid have to be
suppiied.
The henourabie leader on my aide (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), wbose remarks I listened te
wuitb very great interest, and wîtb whem I
usualiy agreo, speke of the chains of newspapers in tbe Oid Country. It is a movement.
that I do net at -ail like, but wbat I de observe is that over thero, whether by iaw or
by practice. the names of all these people
are weiI kno'wn-Rothermore,
Northcliffe.
Beaveî'hroek and se on-and it dees net seem
te check that mevemieat in the siightest
degreo. Tbe reading public do net seem te
caro a continental wbo owns the newspapers.
Their circulation increases. It is a mevemenr
that, as I say, I de net like; I prefer tbe eid
persenai jeurnaiism; but I do net sLe that
this Biii is geing te de very much to restore
that cenditien.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Just one word.
My benourable friend wbo ieads on the other
side (Hon. W. B. Ross) said that there was no
legisiatien of this kind anywhcre, and he
thouglit that if any legisiation had deait oi

legisiation wvith regard te libel, defamation
etc. But that is net correct. May I, mast fei

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Before you, read it, understand that what I said kvas that I wasunable to find any leg'islation as wide as this,

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is in order to

I invite honourable gentlemen to follow closely

HOPPE COAL FIELDS AND
ISENBERG ESTATE
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. POPE rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That lie will call the attention of the House
to the position of the Hoppe Coal Fields and
enquire of the Government:1. Why has the Isenberg Estate been given
a fiat te prove their claims?
2. Who are the actual owners of the Isenberg
Estates in trusts?
3. Are there actual heirs who asking for a
fiat? If so, who, are they?
He said: Honourable gentlemen of the
Senate, it is nlot my desire to detain you at
any great length. Those honourable gentlemen who were members of the Senate when,
a few years ago, the Hoppe leases were under
consideration by a Special Committee are
well aware of the fact that that Committee's
decision deait with a hard coal area, perhaps the largest on the continent of America,
certainly far exceeding any other in the
Dominion of Canada, and well situated with
regard to both the East and the West. At
the time this matter was deait with by the
Special Cornmittee it was decided that this
coal area should remain permanently the
property of the Government of Canada and
should nlot be alienated except by legisiation
of the Parliament of Canada; also that $100,000 should be the limit of compensation te
the Isenberg Estate, representing the interest
of the late Dr. Hoppe, for any expenditures
that might have been incurred.in connection
with the development of this property. There
are other applicants who, if an opportunity
is presented, will corne in with their dlaims,
which some judicial opinions declare to ha
earlier and more fundamental than, and
superior to, those of the Hoppe lessees or
wbat is known as the Isenberg Estate. When
I saw that a fiat had been granted in this
case, it seemed to me that tbis was going
beyond the desire expressed by the Committee, which was as follows:
If, as your Committee hopes and strongly
urges upon the Government, the fiat granted
on October 9th, 1922, is withdrawn, and the
above meutioned Petition of *Right permanently
stayed, the question may arise whether under
the special eircumstances disclosed by the
records of the Department of the Interior,
an indernnity should be granted to the Isenberg
Estate. In the opinion of your Committee such
indemnity, if deemed advisable by the Government to be paid (as to which your Comjnittee
expresses no opinion), should be paid te nobody
else but the Isenberg Estate, and should nlot
exceed one hundred thousand dollars.
Mark those words, "permanently stayed.
The Committee recommended that the Petitien of Right be permanently stayed. I arnl

not a lawyer, and I may be placing a wrong
interpretation upon those words; but when
that decision was given by your Committee
I thought that I should neyer hear 'of the
granting of the Petition of Right or a fiat to
the Isenherg Estate, absolutely against the
opinion expressed by your Committee, who
brought witnesses before it who studied this
question, and proved the corruption or the
dishonesty of people who were attempting to
take away from the Dominion of Canada
this special heritage which we own. For that
reason I was alarmed when I heard again of
this Petition of Right.
We have observed recently that a great
effort is heing made to promote the shipment of Western or other Canadian coal to
the centre of Canada. Permit me to say,
honourahie gentlemen, there is no coal deposit
in the West or the East of Canada which can
compete successfully with this deposit.
Some of it is pure lignite. Under these circumstances we should cherish this asset with
a great deal of jealousy and see that it remains absolutely within the possession of
the Dominion of Canada. There should be
no hesitancy on the part of this or any other
Government in preserving for the people of
Canada this wonderful deposit of coal. If
the Isenberg people, whoever they may ho,
or, if they are dead and gone, any estate or
organization representing them, are allowed
a fiat, you cannot deny to others, at least te
Canadians, a privilege similar to that which
is granted to foreigners outside of this country. You are opening the door wîde, bonourable gentlemen, and the result may ho the
loss to the Dominion of Canada of this
wonderful coal deposit as a national asset.
Therefore I ask these questions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

why I will answer lis statement hefore reading the answers which I have fromn the Department of Justice.
My hon. friend is
surprised that after legisiation had been passed
by Parliament authorizing the Government
to withdraw the fiat that it had granted, it
has seen fit to issue another fiat. I may inferamny honourable frîend that the fiat was
withdrawn. because of certain allegations whieh
affected the petitioner at the tîme. Besides
pamsing the legisiation which e'upowered the
Government to withdraw that fiat, Parliament

discovery by the Government that tbose who
sought the fiat had entered into a champertous
agreement. I wanted to. know who were the

any knowledge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, there was
more than one inquiry -on this inatter. There
was one which brought in the report to which
my honourable friend from Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Pope) refers; but there was another inquiry in which it was clearly disclosed by
written evidence that the agent in O.ta'waI do not now remember bis naineHon, W. B. ROSS: Murdoch, is it net?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -had written to
the Estate, or to the wiow, and had undertaken to carry on a lawsuit and press for
judgment on receiving fifty per cent o! the
amount to be recovered, if my memory does
not fail me. It was upon the evidenee whîch
had been gathered by the Committee of the
Senate, if I remienber correctly, that -the
Departinent of Justice cancelled the fiat.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Doce my
hionourabie friend know that that decision wa.s
made, and that it was umier a wax' daim?
I think the lease wae cancelled because be was
an enemy and an alien.
It was not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cancelled because he was an alien. On the
face o! the document, it was cancelled because he was late in paying bis arrears. I
do not know whether it is every year or every
six months that the demand is made for payment; but it was shown in the Senate Coinmittee, which wvas presided over by the late
Senator Bradbury, I think, on the examination
of officiais of the Department, that the practice was flot to foreclose a lease after the
expiry of the terni, but that some extension
o! time was generally given. It was found
that the special reason for baste in this matter
was the allegation which had been made that
the leases were made by enemies during the
war, on the assumption that Isenberg was a
German. As a matter of fact, it is claimed
that he filed his lease himself as an American,
and that the only German in the case, was his
agent in Canada, Mr. Hoppe.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Were not the lessees

question of a few weeks.

Hon. MT. WILLOUGHBY: .It was nlot
very long; 1 think there was very great diligence on the part of a gentleman in the
Department who afterwards got lis congé for
exceeding his instructions.
Yes. I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not gone beyond these statements, but the
Committee thought that there had been a
practice which was somewhat sharp in the
Department. 0f course, it is not proper to
revive these facts, when n case in damages
is before the Courts, but I arn quite sure that
the Isenberg Estate is fully possessed of al
the documentary evidence that was produced
before the Committee of the Senate.
The Senate Committee found that there had
been practically a conspiracy between an inside official of the Interior Department and
outside interests which, after the lease was
cancelled, or as it was about to be cancelled,
sent a party to those coal fields beyond Edmonton and staked dlaims and obtained a
lease; and the report o! the Senate Commîttec
asked the Department to cancel that lease
as having been obtained under very exceptional if not fraudulent circumstances. The
case was clearly made out that there had been
some practice in the Departmnent which justified the Senate Committee in recommending
that some kind of compensation or solatium
should be given to Isenberg.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I think my honourable friend is getting a littie mixed up. My
question was in regard to the Hoppe leases,
as I understood that Hoppe was very far
behind in his payments. That is my understanding.
I was nlot a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
member of the Committee, and I arn simply
drawing upon my memory; but if there are
members o! the Committee here, I would
refer my honourable friend to the conclusions
reached by that Committee, wbich were quite
clear as to a certain share, of rcsponsibility
falling upon the Department.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I do flot think we should
mix the two affaire together.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. POPE: They are two separate
and distinct matters. One was investigated.
by the Senate in regard to what are known
as the Shillington leases. Dr. Shillington of
this city had the leases. I had no part or
parcel in the matter of obtaining the leases;
but I happened to be down with the gentleman who was hand]ing the minerai resources,
whatever his namne was, and I asked him what
he was going to do about the Hoppe leases;

because Happe had become an enemy at that
lime, and in fact I undersland that when the
Ulnited States went into the war, he was an
enemy of the United States, and was put away
on an island by himself or with senme others.
This man in charge said, "We are going ta
terminate those les ses, nlot because we are
going ta raise the question of lis being an
enemy, but because he had nlot paid lis
dites; we are going ta terminale them by a
certain date in May," I think il was. Then I
said ta him, "What bappens then?" Hie
rcplied, "Without the Minister orders atherwise, tbey will be open for staking." The
Minister, so far as I know, diýd not order

the Shillington intercsts ns I understand,
%%hidi I assume was a legitimate business,

If we openf this question by a suit for damages,

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I understand the
lionourable leader ai the flouse ta say that
lhe second fiat was granted because of
diplomatie representations. I would like the
honourable gentleman ta assure tle flouse
either thal it was granted because of diploniatic represenlations or because of the merits
of the case. I would like ta have that clear.

which caused Ibis resalutian ta be passed at

Bishop Helenowski said:

This gentleman immediately attached himself to the benevolent association charged
wîth the care of immigrants of Slavonic

these poor immigrants who came here knowing

I have in my hand one of their newspapers

and gives an account of speeches delivered on
that occasion. The speakers deplore the fact
that that regime of terror has not lasted more
than seventy-two days, and discuss the causes
of its downfall. The presence of women in
those demonstrations is of bad omen, and reealls to us the dismal part played by the women
firebugs during the Commune.
Another page of that sordid newspaper is
filled witlh praises to Lenine.
One may conceive the evil influence Red
literature such as the A B C of Communism

have replaced the churches and are used as
places of reunion for the Communists. That is
where the people and the new immigrants are
induced to come and listen to speeches by
instigating agents, or to dramatie representations written by Communistie authors, the effect
of which is still more harmful than speeches.
After dealing with the doctrine of the
Communists, with their extended, effective
and successful organization, and the need of
repressive measures against them, Father Casgrain concludes:
The situation is very serious and it is higlh
time we should act. The more that propaganda
is spread, the more difficult it will be to stop
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

it. One must foresee what may take place in
the future.
A party of Communists might be formed
and might hold the balance of power in Parliaient. It weoulid then be too late to combat
this danger which is threatening our country,
and more especially Western Canada. Our
Governnent would be well advised and would
manifest good patriotism were it to adopt imniediate neasures to avert this danger.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I ask how far
can these statements be substantiated by the
documents which I hold in my hand. I have

taken some pains to have translated extracts
from the Ukranian News,

a very

important

newspaper circulated regularly amongst no les
than twelve or thirteen thousand of the
Ukranian community. First, I wish to submit

something of the structure of the Communist
organization of the Ukranian. It is composed
of an association called the Ukranian Labour
Farmer Temple Association, in regard to which
I have the following article:
'i'lTe U.L.F.T.A.

m -anizationaliiIacliince, vhich has been created
da.vs and niglts during the last ten years. The
U.L.F.T.A. is not only its branches and societiT. The U.L.F.T.\. is its 81 general branches

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: W'hat is the date?
lion. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

The

date of the

newspaper is February 16, 1928.

Now may I quote an extract from the same
paper of February 2nd, 1928?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The same Labour
News, published in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Are those schools publicly supported?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am sorry that I

cannot give the

honourable

gentleman

an

answer. If they receive support, I suppose it
would be a provincial grant.

MARCH 27, 1928
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I can. assure the honourable gentleman they do not get any provincial grant from Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBJEN: Now, what is the
teaching of these sohools? Here it is:
Our joint activities are the assurance that
in the future we will unite dloser our strengtb
for the benefit of our organizations and for
the struggling of our demands, and at the end
we will destroy those who although have no
strength, but are making efforts to harmn us.
The enlightenmient activities also help greatly
our gains. The collective readings jointly with
the branches of the U.L.F.T. and W.S. of the
book, "The Science of Lenin" about the
Communist Party were visited by 50 per cent
oi the members of our branch.
Therefore, part of the teachîng of the achools
is the gospel of Lenin. However, let me
proceed.
In an extract fromn the same newspaper of
the 21et of January, 1928, I lind the following:
To-day ail the world of workers and oppressed
honour the fourtb anniversary of the deatb of
their leader. But not by cryiug and despair.
They commemorate thîs day in honour of their
great teacher andI in order to spread lis teachings amongst the non-class conseious miasses of
the working class, and to unite them to the
cause for which Lenin worked and struggled.
To-day at the fourtli anniversary of the deatb
of our teacher, let us strengthen our organizational ranks. let us deepen our knowledge -witb
the science of Lenin, let us become members of
that party which Lenin built, and of wbicbi he
was a niember--members of the Communist
Party. The best bionour of our teacher will be
if we, the workers, would join the ranks of
lienin's party, and within or outside of it
would carry out bis will.
On the l5th of December we find the same
newspaper giving a report of a meeting at
which they reproduced, what they caîl "living
papers". Thcy are nothing but plays.
"Living1 Papet-" ln the appearance of which
we w-cie aidcd by coîni-ade E. Larin, %vho
reccntlv arrived bore from the U.S.S.R. and
miade the initiative in that direction, that is
to organize biere sucb "living paper" as it is
praetised at present ail over the vçillages of the
Soviet Union. By itself sucb a show is very
interestîng. For instance, the persons represent the great capitalistie Goveraments witb
inscriptions on their ebests-England, France,
iPolaad, etc. They are joined by a woman,
America, frorn whom. Poland begs a loan for
the arny.. They are talking amongst tbemselves about the preparation of war against the
U.S.S.R., and this is aIl done before the door
of the U.S.S.R. This door is large and on the
top of it is a siekle and bammer. A body
of workers corne in. They are going to the
U.S.S.R, but the above-mientioned persons persuade the workers not to go to U.S.S.R bccause
it is an uncultured country. Tbe workers, all
of them reply, that they are f ed up with the
capitalistie culture, and that they are going to
a country -%bere Socialism. is being establisbed,

and wbere tbere is no exploitation, but alI
,work and lîve equally. But tbey (the workers)
are beld back.
The workers make their way to the door by
force and tbey are met with great enth,,siasm
by the workers of the U.S.S.R. with the song
of the International.
Another picture: a worker goes to the factory
to work, saying good-bye to his wife and
children. la a few minutes tbe wife is notified
tîtat bier liusband is killed in the factory. The
wif e runs to the factory. Some time after
there is a court trial. The defense of the wif e
dernands $12,000 for bier busband, but the manufacturer says tbat bier huaband was careleas
and put his armi into the machine, and because
oE this the machine did nlot work for one-haîf

the wif e
the above
,%orker. The woman is crying tbat iA is net
right, but the judge orders to remove bier fromn
the Court as if she is insane, and decides that
it is the w-orkers' fauît.
Ini another newspaper, the Labour News,
of Janunry 21, 1928, appears an article whioh
descrihes the progress of the Communist
Association among the Ukranians. It is the
report of the agent of the aesociation.
Great joyful cbanges on the f anus
"What I noticed in time of my organizational
tour in Manitoba-Report by T. Kobzky.
"On the instructions of the C.E.C., U.L.F.T:A.,
I went last wiiitei: oi an organizational tour
amongst the farms of Manitoba. This winter
the C.B.C. sent me again on tbe samne work. I
had travelled seven wveeks' this time. freim
Novemiber 28, 1927, to January 15, 1928. I
bave visited tbirty Ioealities iii some of which 1
have been previously. Within one year I bave
seen great cbanges amongst our farmers. Last
year, when I travelled, there were localities
w bicb were at enmity to our organization. The
reason of it was that the farmers were frightened by many black spirits (priests-142) wbio
forbade to tbem to read tbe "F.L." and wbo
toid themi that tbose who read tbe F.L. and
ia-ttend the mass-meetings of tbe Bolsbeviks will
lie deported. Some believed in sncb nonsense,
but the miajority did corne to the mass-meetings in spite of those black spirits, and became
convinced that our organization struggles for
the truthi; w-c opened their eyes and they recognized the reason why tbey were frigbtened.
'Hie black spirits were afraid that when the
tainiers wiII find out tbe trutb, all of thent
wvould be driven out. This bappened. Because
w-hen 1 visited the second time tbe samne localities, I have seen that the situation was cbanged.
Up to last year it was, that our opponents werc
afraid to rent to us tbe Narodny Dom for
mass meetings, but this year they did not only
gladly give us their buildings, but some of
tbem, althougb not affiliated with our organizatien, are carrying out tbe work according to
our constit *ution. Many of sueh "Narodny
Dom" are already in tbe process of affiliation
witb the U.L.F.T.A. All mass meetings were
more successful. than last year, wbicb is a aigu
that our f armers awoke fromn the patriotic
sleep and are striving to the ligbt. Everywhere
tbey are interested with tbe enlightenment of

vont make a inistake saying that within a short
time our organization will be spread ail over
Manitoba, wliere only Ukrainian farmers live.
The assurance of it is aise in the fact that the
F.L. drove out of the farms ail patriotie newspapers. There are such localities where you
cannot get the Ukrainian voice, even as a
iedicine, and there was a time when the latter
w*as cooiing here in large bundles.
May I now quote an extract from the
Farmers' Weekly? Thi's concerns the Government of Canada and particularly the
Department of National Defence.
May be not many of the Canadian farmers
know that Canada has a Department of National
Defense and a special minister. For that Department there are estimates for this year
over 18 millions of dollars expenses. No
thoughtful person can guess fron whom Canada
lias to be defended. No one is attacking Canada. The U.S.A., namely its capitalists, invested
so mich money in Canada; the latter is their's
withîout war. Therefore, why does Canada need
a minister of National Defense? There is only
one answer to it: the masters, capitalists, are
afraid of their own slaves, and therefore they
create a departiment of National Defense, whieh
keeps militia, police, detectives, etc. In time
of strikes the above organs of the masters
iule "are keeping order" namely defending the
masters property, wrhich the working class
created, but which the masters took for thems lves.
the propaganda
Honourable gentlemen,
amongst the Ukranians is undoubtedly very
serious, but that is not all. May I call your
attention also to the propaganda in Ontario?
I fmnd in the Star of the 23rd of December
last the following:
The spreading of Soviet propaganda among
the schmool children of northern Ontario, with
Montreal and Toronto distribution agencies
paying marked attention, it is understood, to
the pupils of the governnent's railway travelling schools, is at present engaging the attention
of the provincial governînent througlh the Department of Education.
Teacliers of the district, it is said, have uncovered evidences of organized attempts upon a
large scale to influence the minds of the scholars
under their charge, a large percentage of whon
ire of foreign parentage. The propaganda is
being carried on generally through the medium
of pamphlets whici are circulated among the
elhildren. Some of thmese have been sent here
for perusal by Hon. G. Howard Ferguson,
Ontario Premier and Minister of Education.
During the week of November 7-the tenth
anniversary of the Russian revolution-the propaganda activities were apparently in full swing.
At this tiine several northern districts were
tlooded with literature aimed directly at the
school pupil.
In the Confederation Jubilee Celebration
what share did the Communists take? Allow
nie to answer by reading an extract from the
Montreal Gazette of the 11th July last:
Left thus to their own mischievous devices,
the Communists have grown more bold, and did
not hesitate to pursue their dangerous activities
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

during the Jubilee celebration a week ago. At
the Jubilee parade in Toronto, according te the
Toronto Globe, "those enemies of the country,
the inissioners of disruption," distributed "te
peisons who appeared susceptible circulars designed to breed suspicion and discontent, and
to offset any feelings of patriotism which might
be aroused by the celebration."
Addressing
thenselves "To the Workers' Children," the
Bolsheviks, or Bolshevik imitators, asked in
tlcir circular: "Whose Jubilee is it?" The
document tlien proceeded.
Youî are told in the bosses' newspapers, in
school and other places, that Canadians are
celebrating a holiday. Whose holiday is it?
It is the holiday of the bosses, of those for
whon the workers toil.
It is their holiday,
not ours.
For they, indeed, are prosperous,
because they have made great profits from the
liard toil of the workers. They have given
is low wages se that they could be richer. They
have something to celebrate.
But we, the
workers, should have none of it. It isn't our
holiday.
Look at ail the cadets and soldiers on parade!
Why are these here, if not because the bosses
want another war se that they can get rich,
mauîîiiifi-tiiiing uniforns, ammunition, and other
war .supplies?
Besides. the bosses w'ant te
crush the only Workers' Government, Soviet
Russia, because it stands for the rights of the
workers. Do the bosses figlt in w-ars? No.
ilhey send us, the workers, te he muirdered. They
tlheiselves sit at home and get ricli.
Tie Clobe's comment upon this effusion is
The Toronto paper points out that
pertinent.
thie taxpayers of Canada, the owners of business
and homes and of the land, are footing the bill
for bringing out new settlers, in the hope that
the newcomers and their children will become
loyal citizens.
Many of these are foreigners,
and it is among foreigners that the propagandists are working.
It is more unfair to Canadian citizens, in the Globe's opinion, te allow
these disturbers te go about unhindered than it
would be te deal harshly -with the troublemnakers.
Either Canada will have te stop them
or cease bringing in material for them te work
uîpon.. The alternative here suggested is one
that no self-respecting Governinent can consider.
No group of agitators can be permitted
to alter the immigration policy of the Dominion,
or to iipede its operation.
The plain duty of
the Governmîîent is te rid the country of a pest
that should never have been allowed te grow.
Why is this not donc?
May I now give a last extract, which will
portray to you, honourable gentlemen, the
result of the propaganda carried out amongst
What a wealth of documents
the children?
I leave aside! If you honourable gentlemen
desire to be edified on this subject take up The
Worker, published in broad daylight in Toronto.
I defy yeu to look through any number of The Worker without finding an open
appeal to ahl the Communists of this country
to band together in order to overthrow by red
revolution-the words are theirs-or by bloody
revolution, the system which has been established in this country.
But I desire to restrict my remarks to what I consider the most
sinister, the most pernicious form of propa-

safaguarding of fundamental rights in this
country, and the greatest of ail, the right ta

that mast perniciaus form of propaganda, the
seditious teaching of children? Here ie an
extract which will no doubt open the eyes of
a great many people throughout the country.
The Worker of the l8th of February last says:
Tbrills are flot experienced very often in the
Revolutionary Movement in Vancouver, but
the Audience in the Royal Theatre on Sunday, January 29, were Stirred by a Meeting Unique in the History of the Labour
Movemnent in the Part of the Country.
If ve do flot see much in the way of returna
yet, from solie of our work, we have no reason
ta ha sorry for the tinie and energy spent on

Comments from outside of the Party ranks, prove
that, phlegmatic workers who could listen ta
the arguments of Communiet speakers and flot
turu a hair, are being affected by the work of
these young camradeq of ours and there is no
doubt that, juet as Camrade Lenin gave credit
ta the Pioneers for bringing adults into the
Party in Ruesia, we will have the same experience here in Canada.
Sunday's meeting proved the contention of
some of aur warkers among the children that
they are possessed of revalutionary spirit. inteilectual calibre, and have ail the potentialities
for leadership in the struggles of the workers in
the strenuous times that are crawding the present,

She referred briafly ta the attacks made an the

goiang ta take their power away from them.
TeY only make ane mistake there," sha continued, "we are nat going ta wait till we graw
up. We are doing aur bit right now."
What je the gospel taught in tha Ukrainian
achools? Father Cangrain calîs it the A B C
of Communjsm. Let me take a short extract
from, that catechismn of murder and revalutian. It je openly taught in forty schools.
It je proclaimed publicly in. sevaral newspapers, distrjbuted regula.rly ta the naumber
of twelve or thirteen thousand. I arn now
caming close ta the duty of the Government,
and I desira ta call the attention af the honoumable leader of this Hausa ta what I arn
about ta read. It will, I think, justify me
in asking the Governmnnt whether their conscience is completaly at rest, and whether

171

they think they have a right ta close thair
eyes ta the Criminal Code of thie country
and the law regulating immigration. Not
long -aga I read of a case which was fram
many points of v-iew a very sad one, and
wbich occurred in the city of Mkiotreal. It
was that of a poor etarving crippled bcggar
who kept a school wharcin ha taught childiran
petty thiaving. Ha fared vary badly when
he appeared before the judge. Tha man had
a very heavy sentence imposed upon him. 1
think I can show ta the Govarnment now
that publicly and openly, throughout this
country, Communism with aIl that it implies
in heing daily taught ta thousands af children.
Communism, as Lenin understands it, is the
very negation of every article contained in
the Criminal Code, whether for the protection of personal or of property rights. Can
that bc denied? Wbat have the Communisti
done in Russia? There a relatively small
minority have by blaody rasolution and by
mu.rder seized for themselves all the property
and ail the rights af the immense mai ority.
It ie their doctrine that ie taught in Canada.
In the full gamut ai crime cantained in the
Criminal Code can you tell mie ana that has
been omitted in the constitution of the Red
Russa of ta-day. Wauld it ha the crime
of sedition? Of course, sedition je the bas
of their taaching. In it murdar? Why, it in
maid that no man shall stop ta respect any
other man's lufe when ha is aecomplishing a
ravolution. Exacutions? Yes, by the score;
everybody knows it. And this in taught
openly ta the childrpn of Canada. 1 aak
in ail seriousnese if tha Dapartment ai Justice
is toasllaw this challenge ta all the provisions
of the law; and I challenge anyone speaking
for the Governmcnt ta show me anc provision
af the Criminal Code pratecting cither persan
or praperty that ie not violated, denied, controverted, in the doctrines af Bo'lshcvism
which ara openly praached and taught ta
thousands of echolars throughout the land.
if the Department af Justice je going ta allow
that ta ha donc, how can we expeet the law
of the land ta be rcspectad?
But I go further, and ask what justification
or excusa ie there for the Min.ister of Justice
ta aIlow that teaching ta go on? That is the
accusation biraught against -the Government.
1 think every member of this Housa understands ithe gravity ai that accusation.
Then the-e je the A. B. C. of Cammunismn,
the Boîshevie Oatechism for children, prepared for the poor littiae children of the immigrants wha cama ta this country. Here is an
extract from it:

Communism -

MARCH 27, 1928
Under these circumstances, I ask is it necessary for the Government to pass legisiation
for the purpose of expediting the eondernnation and punishment of those Communistic
tcachers? Thank goodness. we have kept in
our statutes. two laws that can now be brought
into play for our protection. Last year, when
the Government in a generous rnood of
disarmamnent wanted. to lay down ail the
weapons whieh enable themn to act severely
and swiftly with offenders of thîs kind, hionourable gentlemen ivili rememaber that this
flouse said no. By a very decisive vote this
Ilouse said to the Government: "These
provisions arc necessary, and you may be
called upon to apply themn at any time."
Arn I fot right now in asking the Government
why they do not npply them? No more
expPdient systemn could be devised in our
Icgislation te free the community from. the
danger of this propaganda. Why, a sliglit
indiscretion enables the Departmnent of Immigration to pass an immediate sentence of
deportation. There is under sucli proeess no
possible agitation, ne great advertisement for
those preachers and teachers. No; they are
summarily judged, and expelled from this
]and, which they speak of as hell, to their
own land, whicha they seemn ta regret se, much.
Why has the Government sat stili? Why is
the Government flot movjng? Is theG<overnniient net inforrned that propaganda of
.seditious toaching is going on too openly. No,
the Govcrninent is well informed.
Why, then, does not the Goverrnent aet?
May I cail the attention of this flouse to an

additional reason why we sbould dlaim protection from the Government in connectien
with this movement? Honourable gentlemen
will remember that, a few years ago,' Russia
made supreme effort to consummate a trade
agreement with the United States. Krassin
was sent there, but hie pleaded in vain., and
when he left hie made a promise of which the

head of the International Trade Union organization, Mr. Samuel Gompers, took a note,
which, I flnd in a very admirable book written

by him on Communism in the United States.
His book is entitled,

"Out of

their

Own

Mouths", and I read from. page 224 the
following extract:
The danger that the pro-Soviet agitation
may be revived is not past. Krassin lias boidly

stated that the British trade agreement was
rbtained not by any fundamental concessions

of communism to, capitalisin but by propaganda, and hie plans to station himscîf now in
Canada, whenee hie says he hopes to return
«via. New York". Provided only he wilI corne

Now for the last reaeon. I know there xnay
be political reasons, why a government at the
hcad of a democracy, should be impelled not
only by a sense of duty, but also by a
very natural, sense of self-preservation. 'Ihere
are certain strong ourrents of opinion that the
Governîment does not like to cross, and no
doubt in this case, the Government does

not want to place itself resolutely against
Comrnunism in this country. I amn afraid
that is the reason. What other reason can,
there be? Common sense ought to tell us.
Not one of the Ministers can he charged with
holding any sucli subversive ideas. They
are ail thoroughly respectable gentlemen, imbued with perfect sentiments-moral, though
perhaps not political. But they entertain
none of those sentiments, and they have no

interest to proteet sueh people except that
the Red wing of the eleetorate will mass their
forces and attack the ýGoveromenýt, for any
energetie measures to check their propaganda,
in this country. If -nccessary, to give courage
to the Government, I may tell them. that
very respectable paliers are urging ,action.
There is an excellent article in the Montreal
Gazette of June 9, 1927, as follows:

Waiting for the Governnient
If the propaganda directed from Soviet
House, in Lorndon, was ilaugerous-so dangerous
as to warrant an international rupture-wbat
is to bie said of the movement whieh the propagande lias set on foot in Canada. and what is
to be donc about it?
The public know of
nothing that bas yet heen done hy the Governmient to counteract the poison that lias already
heen set in circulation, but the publie expeet
that somiething will be donc if the good faith
of the Governent is to be demioustrated.
Public opinion is becoing axoused in this
matter, and the request made by the Catholie
Women's League is eue whiech every riglitthinking Canadian is ready te support. Ministerial inaction cannot, in the circumestances, be
explained or justified on the plea that evidence
is lacking. It would be absurd te suppose that
the conditions described by Abbe Casgrain are
unknown. te the Gover ornent and have net been
known te the Governmnent for many months.
The termination of the Soviet trade treaty is a
beginning but it cannot be regarded the end.
Lest the Gazette should be considered politically biassed in the present inetance, I will
put upon record an article from Le Canada,
the sacred organ of the Liberal party in the
Province of Québee. Listen te wliat it says
in its issue of June 9, 1927:
We must admit that we have, unhappily, our
srnall contingent of Communiets and Bolshevigts,
but have we net learnt, by documents seized ln
London, that the head-quarters of their activities are te bie found in the Queen City?
We have ne intention of blainge the City of
Toronto for this; we only wish to state an
existing fact. Besides, it is of seeondary impertance that sucli revelutienary sehools should

exist in this place or in another. The point
that matters is that they do exist and that
steps are not taken toeclose them; that professors
teach their sinister theories and that they are
not thrown out of the country.
Education is a sacred thing that governments may, and have reason to help to the utmost, but in which it is defficult for thein to

ments are faeed witli an organization that
teaches social destruction, abolishment of religion, defiance of authority, and, in short, with
a body capable of placing the destiny of the
country in jeopardy. it is their duty to intervene and suppress the evil, as it is their duty,
when faced with any calamity, to take rigorous
means to prevent it.
We are convinced that up to now, no government in this country, either federal, provincial,
or municipal sees witli favor the Bolshevist intrigue. It is passing strange that the doings of
so-called dreamers should have been ignored,
but how can they be tolerated any longer w-lien
their efforts are directed towards children, towards those who will be the Canadian cifizens
of to-morrow. However desirous we are of
naking this a prosperous country, we shall
never reach our goal by sowing the seeds of
destruction and revolution.
Should this unfortunate state of things be
attributed to immigration. We think not. it
seems to have had a very different cause. But
why bring in good immigrants if a concerted
effort for their perversion is to be pursued in
Canada. Tliese propagandists of suclu criminal
theories nust disappear at any cost. and withont
hesitation ire hold that the first to go mnust be
the Bolshevist teachers who endeavor to create
liere the chaos now existing in Russia. To expel them from this country is perhaps a radical
neans, but it woild be at ail ev-ents the quicktst and the surest.
Sailso wihi to quote La Presse of June 9,
1927:
"I have found that a great mniber of
chiildlrenî belonging to fami lies coming fromî
foreign countries, and who have abandoned the
Catholie faith, are openly taught the Bolshevik
doctrines by Russian teachers. There are about
fcrty suel schools attended by about 2,000
pupils, and their nmnber is ever increasing.
"It is higi tinie to denounce the infamous
teachings of these conhmunistic schools. Last
year, J translated, myself, the official schoolhook prepared for the use of the teachers and
the propagandiste. Its title is: 'A.B.C. of the
Communism' and is publislied in the Ukrainian
language; it is on sale in Montreal.
"It begius by stating that religion is ai
opiate, intended to chloroform the people, that
no true Conmunist can be a Christian, but
must necessarily be an atheist, for the simple
icason that the principles of Comnmunism are
diainetrically opposed to Christianity. It then
proceeds to advocate the overthrow of our present fori of governmnent, substituting in its
place the Soviet reginue with a proletariat
dictatorshil). The A.B.C. admits that sucl a
revolutionary change in our social system could
not be effected without violence."
We are of the opinion, with Abbé Casgrain,
that it is high time to put our bouse in order,
by sweeping out mnercilessly these communistie
agents iwho, like spiders are spreading their

accioplices to their revolutionary work.
Everything lias not been told on this subject,
and if we take the trouble of gathering information, iwe would discover that this Sovietic
propaganda bas made dupes elsewhere than
amuong the Ukrainian youth.
Happily, up to now, our working population
lias escaped, in general, froi this contagion,
but it is not our duty, and especially the duty
of the government to protect it against this
propaganda by expelling fromî the country these
detestable trouble-iakers, mischievous agents of
a régime wich,having ruined Russia, aspires
to pursue its diabolie work in our peace-loving
Canada, to sow the seeds of social, religions.

aware lias brouglît forth a lamentable harvest
in Russia.
'Tlie muatter is a simple oie, ie need but bar
the doors of the country against these Coimmîunistic trouble-imakers and to expel those
who, by hook or by crook, have found their
way here.

Our immigration laivs, strictly applied, provide all necessary weapons for the protection
of the coiniunity.
It cannot be denied that La Presse is a
paper with very marked Liberal leanings, and
its advice is just as clear, and its warning
just as certain as that of the Gazette.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I thank you for

simply

ask:

What will become of this dis-

cussion? We now have ev-idence undeniable,
I think, that the law of the land is being
violated, and that the consequences of that
violion are very fair-reaching. We also have
evidence, and it cannot be denied, that the
Government is inforimed of this situation and
does not act. We have e-idence that as far
back as January, 1927, the Governnient was
notified of what was going on by no less a
person than a Catholic bisiop; that six
iîmonths later another gentleman, whom I
know the Governnent consider worthy of the
greatest possible respect, gave the same warning and entered into a full revelation of the
conspiracy being carried on throughout the
land; tlien the Catholic Woman's League,
-ep-esenting a very large and respectable
body of opinion in the land, communicated
directly with the Government, advising them
again of what was going on. But they went

,îght months ago, and what bas been donc?
if something has been donc, are not we in
this House entitled to know what it is; and
if nothing has been donc, why not?
The first attempt of the Soviet Government outside of the boundaries of its own
country, was made in Canada. We all know
how anxious we were at the time, and what

had to re-establish and maintaîn order witbin
their city. We have a much larger number
of immigrants in this country to-day than
we had at that time; and since then we have
bad fouir years of Communistie education.
le~ the Government going to act?-for I fear
notbing bas been donc up to now-Is it goîng
to tell this House that it will enforce the law
and suppress this propaganda which is creating a solid army of enemies ready to be
thrown on the side of trouble whenever the
opportunity occurs?
Hon, W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
gentlemen 1 have just one or two observations to add to what the honourable gentleman has said. Nothing that be bas said ie
novel or new to me and with ail the facts
he has given I arn in agreement. I must,
however, draw bis attention again, as I did
last year, to the wrongful or interchangeable use of the words "Socialist" and "Communist". Tbe Socialists and the Communise
are two distinct tribes of people: The Socialist is a man wbo believes in the common
ownersbip of things used commonly, and that
sucb a condition can be brought about by
constitutional means. The Socialiste are, if
you 'like, a political party. The Communise,
on the other band believe the saine thing,
but tbey believe Vbat such a condition can
he attained only by force. Tbat is a fundamental difference.
My bonourable frîend also used intercbangeably I tbink the words "Labour" and
"Communism" and "Socialiism". He will correct me in tbat if I amn wrong. That je to
be objected to for many reasons, the principal one being that it is not so; it is flot
truc. We bave in Canada a Labour Party,
and outeide of that we bave a large body of
people who are known as Labour people. We
bave also tbe Socialist Party and the Communist party. Now, it is truc that the Coinmunist party works largely amongst Socialiste and Labour people, and I know many
Sociase wo bave complained bitterly about
the inroads the Communiste have made in
their party. A very ptominent Socialiet, in
Edmonton bas told me that hie party ie
badly wrecked as a result of the efforts of
the Communiet Party.
Consequently the
termes "Socialie9t" and Communiet" should not
be used intercbangeably: the Socialist je one
sort of man and the Communist another.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Wbich ie worse?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Communist
ie a man wbo advocates the triumph of hie
views by force, and any man wbo asks the
question as to which is worse je lacking in
intelligence. 1 do not know who it was.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It was I.
Hlon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Common fairnese requires tbat we sbould recognize that
the Labour people and the Labour Party
look upon the Communiste as their greateet
enemy. We know tbat is so in England,
because there the Labour Party bave expclled
the Communiste froin their membersbip.
Here in this country there are many splendid
men, leaders of the Labour movement, whose
energies are almost entirely abeorbed in
flgbting this menace.
Therefore, ini this
House, wbere wc have time to think, and to,
discuss, and to corne to more or lese sound
conclusions, do not let ue make any mistake
on this point, because the sound element of
the Labour Party are entitled to aIl the
sympathy and support we can give them in
thie strugglc. They stand in the very front
line of the battie, dealing witb these people
band to hand, while we stand by and look on.
My second point je very easy. As I saîd,
nothing the honouraible gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) bas said je ncw or novel to, me, for
I have made some study of tbis question. It
ie the duty of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police to know about thie movement, and
tbey do know about it. They know ail that
tbe bonourable gentleman has mentioned, and
much more; and all tbat they know bas been
put before the Governinent of this country
day in and day out, week in and wcek out,
month jin and montb out; and the Govcrnment knrws aIl that the bonourable gentleman knowvs, and a good deal more besides.
Nowv, the responsibility for action je upon
tlhein.
Tbcy bave the knowledge, and it je
a question of polîcy bow tbey shall act, and it
is tbc do-notbing policy which the Government bas to defend here in the face of this
information.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, this je a subject of more tban paseing
importance. I bave listened with very deep
intereet to my honourable friend who made
the inquiry (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), and also
to my honourable friend froin Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbacb), and as tbere are a few

JUDGES AS COMMISSIO'NERS
ARBITRATORS

OR

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS rose in accordance
wvith thle folloîving notice:
Thnt bie will cail the attention of the Government to a decision of the Court of Appeal in
the Province of Manitoba to the effect that section 37, chapter 105, of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, which reads in part as foilows:
" Uni ess nominated by the Governor in Council ne judge mentioned in this Act shall act.as
commissioner or arbitrator on any commission
or inquiry."
is directory oniy and net mandatory, and wil
inquire from the Gevernment if it is their intention te insist on the observance of the provisions of said section.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, in making

this inquiry I would like te state at the eutset that there is net on my part the slightest

intention te criticize the judges of Canada,
but I do desire te bring to the attention of
the Government the construction which lias
been put upon a certain clause in the Judges
Act, wbich xvas passed, I think, about the
year 1921. You will ail remeiniber that at
that tiîne the judges of Canada, bcd their

177

MARCH 27, 1928
salaries increased, and there was inserted in
the Act a clause to provide that they should
nlot aet in any way as arbitrators.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: On commissions or inquiries.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The purpose of the
Act as passed at that time was chiefly to sustain the independence of the judici-ary. There
was then, I believe, a certain amount of
criticism because judges had been appointed
to act on politicai or other commissions, and
Parliament considered that the passing of an
amendment prohibiting the judges from sitting as arbitrators or on any commissions
xvould go far towards establishing the independence of the Bench.
A decision ha4s recently been given by the
Court of Appeal ini Manitoba that the provision in question is nlot in any way binding
upon the judges. There were six judges who
gave this decision; one of them was the
trial judge, and the other five sat in appeal.
I desire to say now that I do not for a moment attempt to, criticize the late Chief
Justice of the province of Manitoba, Who sat
as an arbitrator, because under the circumstances under which he did sit he would be,
in my opinion, perfectiy justified. He was
requested hy the City of Winnipeg and hy the
defendant Cross to act as an arbitrator with
regard to a piece of property which the City
had appropriated. Altlhough the City *had
requested huim so to act, when they found that
the award had gone a.gainst them, they appea.led from it on the ground that the judge
was prohibited by tihis particular section from
acting. The judge to whom the appeal was
made held that this was not binding upon the
judges. That decision was appealed to the
Court of Appeal, and the five judges, I think,
ail gave judlgment. One 'held tihat it was
ultra vires; another held that it was only
directory, and another that it wus not bind-ing
upon the judges at ail. There was one Muge,
I believe, who gave a dissenting judgmnent,
holding that the section was binding.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What wus the
date of that judgment?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It was reported in
December last.
What I desired to point out to the Government wus this, that if some of the judges
hold that a clause of this kind is binding and
others hold that it is not binding, some will
consider tihemselves perfectly free to act as
arbitrators and to sit on commissions, while
ôt-hers will feel inclined to follow theAc
and will be hound by it. In order to put ai
the judges on an absolutely equal footing i

is part of the duty of the Governrent either
to repeal this clause in its entirety or to redraft it in such a way that it can be enforced.
In inentioning this matter I have no desire
to discuss the judgment. On legal grounds
it may be unassailable. But I would ask tihe
Government to consider the question whether
the clause should not be repealed or whether,
if it is not repealed, it should not be redTafted
so as to be made binding on ail the judges
in Canada, inatead of being binding on some
and not on others. If I may say so, I think
that the present would he a very good time to
settle this point, for I understand that there
is a movement on foot to increase the salaries
of the judges.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to answer my honourahie friendHon. W. B. ROSS: I wished to move the
adjournment of this debate. It is late, and
this is a rather important question. It might
be worth while reviewing the legisiation. If
it ýmeets with the views of the House, I will
move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Ross the debate was
adjourned.

ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAYS PROJEC'r
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Mardi 21 the
ad'journed debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr.
Reid:
Tlîat he wjil catI the attention of the Senate
ta the St. Lawrence waterways project, and inquire if it is the intention of the Government
ta lay on the Table of the Senate the report
of the Advisory Committee on the proposed
scheme.
Hon. GEORGE LYNCH4ÏSTAUNT0N:
Honourable gentlemen, we have the sovereigu
riglit to navigate the inland waters of Canada
from their source to their outlet, from Port
Arthur ta Belle Isle, and from, thence out into
the waters of the Atlantic ocean.
For sncb
a riglit through the Dardanelles the Russian
Empire fought and schemed during ail its
existence. Sa important, so great is the value
of this right to every nation. Men may corne
and men may go, but the St. Lawrence river
goes on forever; and I trust that so long as
water runs and wind blows our descendants
will continue to be the lords of the North and
will have a free and uninterrupted riglit,
stopped by no man and obstructed by no
nation, ta navigate that mighty river for the
advantage of aur country and the benefit af
aur people.
I listened the ather day with great interest
ta the speech delivered by the riglit honourable member for Brockville (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Graham) in which lie spoke of bis experience
as a minister of the Crown and as cliairman
of anc af the boards of inquiry in relation
ta this subjeet. He liad realized the enormous
importance of this question, wbich the Canadian Parhiament may at fia remote period he
called upon ta decide, and bis knowledge
influenced him s0 much that from bis seat
in this House. addressing the Government and
the people af Canada, he entreated that we
should flot rush in where angels fear ta tread
unlesa and until the people af this country
have had eveiy apportunity ta express their
.56109-124

179

opinion and to acquaint Parliament with what
should ha done.
In this case there is to be
cowiidered flot only the question of whether
or flot we shall endanger the freedom of travel
to this country, or whether or flot we shall
mnake Canada a peut-up Utica, but there
is the further subi ect with regard to power.
The power concessions of this country are
great principalities which. bear in their bosomn
a never-ending stream of wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice, and they are perhaps the
most important material property which this
country possesses.
Forests disappear before
the axe, mines give up their wealth and are
useless; but power goes on as long as the
river lasts, as long as the world continues.
I arn uttering these remarks for the purpose
of asking you to give your rnost serious attention to these two questions which to my mind,
transcend ail questions on which. the Canadian people have been asked to pass. la
order that 1 may make clear the suggestion
I arn about to sulimit, 1 consider it important to draw t.he attention of the Senat&
to the exact position in law, d'omestic and.
international, of the two Governments which,
will prabably be asked to make a convention,
sometimes improperly called a treaty, regarding these two subjects.
The governments of the United States and
Canada are very mucli alike on some points
in regard ta this question, but very dissimilar
from the British and French Governrnents.
The United States Government bas no
property rîglits whatever in the territory of
the United States except in the District of
Columbia, and in regard ta suceh property
as it bas acquired.
The Canadian Go'vernment bas no property rights in any of the
lands or waters of Canada excepting those it
purchases, or lias acquired under the British
North America Act. The variaus States of
the American Union own aIl the property of
the State which. bas not been alienated; it is
vested in the people of the State. So ail the
pi'operty in -Ontario or any other province is
veýsted in the Crown in riglit of the province.
A f ew years ago, in the interest of the Ontario Government, I gave this subjeet very
careful consideration; I spent a long time in
searching out the law; and I gave an opinion
to the late Hon. Mr. Co>chrane in which. I
stated that ail the flowing water ini the province belonged to the Province of Ontario: it
was a natural resource, and any property that
existed in that water must, under the exact
and precise statement in the Britisli Northi
America Act, belong ta the Province; that the
Dominion Government had no power or
authority over the water of Ontario; that it
had no right, without the consent of the Prov-

180

SENATE

ince, to take it for the purpose of constructing canais or developing powers, excepting
in so far as it was necessary to take it, for
keeping up those canais which existed before
Confederation. 1 gave it as my deliberate
opinion, in so far as the Welland Canal was
concerned, that the taking of water by the
Dominion from Lake Erie for that canal was,
in the eye of the ]aw, what we in our province cail conversion-improper conversionand, if the province insisted, it should be paid
for it.
By roy advice an Act was passed de.claring
that any Crown grant theretofore or thereafter
mnade, of lands running to the edge of a river,
lake or stream, stcpyped at its borders, unless
the grant speifically named the bcd or centre
of the stream. Thoc Kenora case bad decided
that it ivent to the centre of the stream. By
this Act the Ontario Goveroment stýopped any
Court from hcreafter deciding that that was
the law. That was a vcry important piece of
legisiation for the Province of Ontario.
As soon as we had ail this donc. the Ontario Government made a dlaim on the Dominion, te, pay to it the money which the,
Dominion Covernment had rcceived for the
sale of wvater to the varieus water power
companies in Ontario; and under instructions
1 prepareti and submitted to the Governmcntl
Tie
an argument supporting that dlaim.
Department of Justice considered mv argument, and after a month or se admitted tha!
our contention was right in its cntirety. W~e
then proposed te make an agreement as to
how much should be paid by the Dominion
for the water taken into the canais. Wc
agrecd that it w'ould be ridiculous to ask the
Dominion to pay for water for canais-aithough it avas conccded we were entitlcd to
it--becauise, that water was for the development of th(, country, and it was most uin.
reasonable, avhcn the Dominion was to doe'elop
our province, that wve should put it to such
unnccessarv ai-d improper expense as we
thought that would be. It xvas then furthcr
agrced that the Dominion should pay th,
province haif of the charges tabich it liad
rccivedi, or would hercafter reccia e, for wal er
seld to the watcr companies.

not have succeeded in their action, because
they have no property rights and no legislative jurisdiction over property and civil
rights in the Union, and no right or authority
to make a contract on behalf of the State,
or the inhabitants of the State, with regard
to property and civil rights, which would be
binding on those people.
Now, in England, we have a lawless constitution; the Government can du as it
chooses, and Parliament can do as it chooses,
but the United States Congress cannot do so.
Parliament can pass a law for anything which
is humanly possible to be done, but the
United States cannot.
Now, let me draw attention to this. The
scheme recommended is to canalize the St.
Lawrence River from Prescott down to Lake
St. Francis. That canalization as it at present
exists, and the navigation, are on the Canadian
side for all that distance, about fifty4our
miles. It is proposed to change forever that
course of navigation between Prescott and
Lake St. Francis from Canada into the
United States, and to run the Canal down
through the State of New York to Lake
St. Francis. But what man can tell what
complications may arise in the future?
Why is it that all nations want the freedom
of the seas? Why is it that Russia wanted to
corne out through the Dardanelles, unrestricted by any conditions set by the Turkish Empire? Because one never knows what may
arise. This country is not always going to be
an infant. This country is going to be an
enormous country, perhaps producing on the
north shore of the St. Lawrence a nation as
great and powerful as that to the south; and
the time may corne when we may need for
our own people and our own trade and commerce the whole passage-way that is made
by canalizing. The time may corne when we
may be such a rival to the United States in
the trade and commerce of the world that it
will be her vital interest to stop us wherever
she can. Heaven only knows what the future
holds for both of these countries; and is it
not a matter of prudence, common sense and
good judgment, to suggest that we hold
what we have,, and not allow ourselves to be
lorded over in any part of this Dominion by
any foreign nation?
I do not propose Cassandra like to .prophesy
what may happen, but I do say that no
man, when he looks over the history of the
world, needs any experience to know that
what we should do for Canada is to keep the
navigation of the St. Lawrence in our own
territory so far as in us lies.

181

I do not question for a moment the good
faith of the United States. It behooves
this Government to walk circumspectly.
I hope and trust that no Canadian Government will ever make a bargain with
the United States without first submitting to
the parliament of this country and to the
fierce light that beats upon a throne-public
opinion-all the terms and conditions, because
there is no statesman so wise that he can
see every trap and every pitfall, and there
are no people so stupid that they cannot make
wise and prudent suggestions. I trust that the
Government, when it brings the proposition
clown, will announce to the Parliament of Canada that it is not a Government measure, on
which the Government will stand or faN, but it
will leave Parliament free to vote aocording to
the dictates of their conscience and as in
their judgment they deem proper for the
welfare of this country, so that the question
may not embarrass the Government or Parliament, and it may be possible to centre
upon it the collective wisdom of the Canadian
people and they may take the responsibility
of deciding their future for themselves.
I was about to say that I have no reason
to doubt, and do not doubt, the good faith
of the American Government, and I have no
experience which shows that that Government has ever done anything which is not
honourable. It has stood for itself and its
own country, it has asked for the last penny,
but, so far as I know, it has never gone beyond what is right and honourable. But my
fear of any arrangement being made is this.
I have pointed out to you, honourable gentlemen, that the property in the river and in
the land is not vested in that Government.
It is proposed to develop power, for example,
at Barnhardt's Island. The whole of that
island is in the United States. I am told
that the American shore, the water between
the American shore and the island, the land
beneath that water, and Barnhardt Island itself, are owned by a private corporation, the
Aluminum Company, and the Canadian shore
is owned by the St. Lawrence Power Company, who hold all the riparian rights, the
water and the land under the water being the
only properties owned by Ontario, and that
neither the United States Government, nor
the Canadian Government, nor the state of
New York, have any property rights whatever.
That being so, this canal must be built and
this development made-of course, in proper
form-by private citizens. Now we will imagine that the dam is in existence, all the power
is developed on the American side, and the

SENATE
company has promised that it will take only

1,000.000 horse-power and will live up to the
treaty which the United States has made with
Canada. Well, suppose that it does not do
so. Chicago went beyond the limit. Suppose it develops a million and a half. Who
is to stop it? It owns the water, it owns
the land, it owns the dam. The United States
has no jurisdiction, for it has admitted that
the building of the dam will not injuriously
affect navigation. "Ah, but," it is pointed
out, "it may affect navigation at Montreal.'
Montreal is not within the United States, and,
please God, it will not be. Interference with
navigation in the foreign country does not
give the United States Government any authoritv in the premises; it is only interference
with navigation in United States waters that
croates its jurisdiction or justifies its intervcntion. If the company develops that exce-s
quantitv of power who can restrain it? If
the United States refers the matter to the
court, a New York judge will reserve judgment as long as ho chooses. Remember, restraint is a mighty serious thing to New York.
New York wants the power. New York's
industries are thirsting for it, and if they get
it the case will be like that of Chicago. Oh,
no; no patriotic American court will ever
give judgment. And what can we do? With
tears, somewhat like those of the crocodile,
the representative of the United States may
say: "I am sorry-I am really, truly sorry,
but what can I or Congress do about it? We
can urge them not to take the power, and
there we must stop." That is the fact under
the law.
The United States Government had a case
in which they should have interfered. Diversion of the water at Chicago is not in violation of any treay, because they were clever
enough to leave Lake Michigan out of the
picture. The diversion at Chicago, in so far
ns it affects navigation in Canada, is a violation of common law, or rather international
law. The domestic law of every civilized
country, I think, is that every man shall use
his property so as not to injure his neighbour.
If I have a lot it has the natural lateral support of your lot adjoining. You may not dig
down straight beside me and cause the soil
of my lot to fall into yours, without paying
me damages, because if you wish to develop
your property you must prop mine up, or
you must develop yours so as not to cause
mine to cave in. There is the effect of that
maxim of our law. The same obtains in
international law. The world over, it is the
law that in boundary waters or in boundary
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

territory each nation shall use its territory or
its waters so as not to injure its neighbour.
There was a direct violation of that international obligation when Chicago took the
water from the river to the prejudice and injury of Canadian navigation. But the United
States has done nothing. Can it do anything
more than go to law? It is not like the
British Parliament, omnipotent. Surely men
can learn from experience. Surely when we
realize the condition of the constitution of
the United States and the ability of that
country to perform its covenante-not its
willingness, but its ability to perform themwe should hesitate before entering into an
agreement of this moment with them. We
moight lose that power.
How is that danger to be corrected? The
only possible condition on which a prudent
government would make an agreement for the
division of the power in the international
section is to insist that the United States
purchase the bed of the stream and purchase
all the rights that the Aluminum Company
have, and that the United States itself develop and own the water power which is to
be created there. Then it can control the
water power, it can live up to its contract and
implement its promises. and then it will be
safe for us to enter into an agreement with
the United States for the division of the
power in the international section, and not
until then, I submit with great confidence.
Now I wish, before I sit down, to say this:
so far as the development of the St. Lawrence
waterway is concerned, we can come right
down out of the clouds and get down to business, for this is nothing more nor less than
a business proposition. People are carried
off by flights of fancy. I know that the
people who live along the lake shore of Ontario have been tickled with the idea that
some day, if this project is carried out, they
may see an Olympic or a Mauritania swinging in the harbour at Hamilton or Toronto.
They expect that some day the mountain
will come to Mohammed-that some day we
shall bave freight borne on great ocean vessels from the head of the lakes to Europe, or
from Europe to the head of the lakes; that,
in fact, we shall make of Lake Superior an
ocean, part and parcel of the Atlantic. That
is purely fanciful, as every person who bas
studied the subject now admits. There is
no hope or expectation by anybody who has
considered the subject that at any time we
shall have vessels plying between Liverpool
and Port Arthur. The only hope or expectation is that vessels may carry grain from Port
Arthur to Montreal.

MARCHI 28, 1928
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Hudson Bay.

You forget the

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I have
said Port Arthur. I thought Port Arthur was
flot on the Hudson Bay.
Perhaps it is; it
rnay have changed since iast night. But the
truth is that al we ean hope for is that our
grain rnay be brought frorn Port Arthur to
Montreal.
Now, is it worth while?
That
is the point we want to settie; that is the
point we have to discuss.
According to "The Grain Trade of Canada,
1926", the average rate from Port Arthur to
Montreal is 9.60 cents per bushel; from the
head of the Lakes to Port Coiborne, 3.4 cents;
frorn Port Coiborne to Montreal 6.8 cents.
You will notice that the combined rate frorn
the Lakes to Port Coiborne and from Port
Colborne to Montreal is about the same as
the througli rate from Port Arthur to Montreal.
These figures that 1 arn giving you
are the officiai staternent of the average over
the season.
Sometimes the rate is higher
and sometîrnes it is lower.
From Montreal
to Liverpool the rate is 8.50.
It lias been considered by the people who
have examnined the facts--and I arn told it
would take a volume to explain the reasons
-that the building of the Welland Canal will
in ail probability decrease the cost of shipping:
grain from the head of the Lakes to Montreal
by from one to two cents a bushel.
The question is, then, whether or not, if we
canalize the river for vessels which will carry
300,000 busheis--10,000 tons--we shall get the
grain to Montreal any cheaper, and, if so,
how much. Is the game worth the candie?
That is the point.
I arn told that to transslip at Prescott out of a vessel into an
elevator c.osts one-eight of a cent per bushel,
and out of an elevator into a srnaller vessel
one-eight of a cent.
So the cost of transshipment is of srn'si importance. I rernemnler
that the Montreal Transport Comnpany' which
lias passod out of existence, used in the old
days to have one slip and two consorts, which
were really barges, carrying the grain frorn
Kingston to Montreal.
At the present depth
of these canais, I arn toid, a vessel with two
or tliree consorts can take the biggest ioad
that can corne down frorn there to, Montreal,
and these boats can proceed in our present
canais to Montreal as f ast as or faster than,
those enorrnous freigliters which. carry the
grain now to Buffalo, and there is no saving

that ouglit to have been easiiy understood,
and it ouglit to lie made plain whether there

183

is any saving or not before we enter upon this
gigantic expenditure, at ieast before we
transfer to the United States of Arnerica part
of our right-of-way down the St. Lawrence.
The oniy point nuw to be oonsidered is wliat is
the saving frorn Prescott to, Montreal. That
ig the whoie question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is it.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
And it
ought flot to take a board of engineers or
hlf a dozen comrnissions to find that out.
It ouglit to be possible to ascertain what
ioads these barges can carry and wh'at it wiIl
cost to ship down by thern. Did it ever occur
to you, honourable gentlernen, to think
deepening of the canails may not and proliably wiil not divert the grain to Montreal.
You know freight is a rnost mysterious thing:
it is past understanding. Did it ever occur to
you that between Port Arthur and Liverpool
we have the finest inland waterway that
exists? We can convey a larger tonnage to
Mýontreai liy means of our present canal
systcrn than can be carried to New York by
their present canal system. We know that
the rail haul from Port Arthiur to Montreal
is ghoirter than the Ta-il haul from Port
Arthur to New York. The sarne is true of
the water haul. Yet New York gets a laxger
po&tion of the trade than we do. Why is it?
Can any man expiain why the trade should
go to New York? There is onliy one reason
for it going to, New York in spite of the fact
Lhat the distance is greater, the water shailower, and that everything else is against it,
includîng the additionai handicap that Liverpool is fartlier frorn New York than fromn
Montreai. Yet, in spite of adverse conditions, this condition continues, aind mnust cause
wonderment to a man unacquainted with the
business. The reason for it is because there
is more tramp shipping available in the port
of New York than there is in the port of
Montreai.
Why is it that Quolic is not the great
port of this country? Why is it that the
people -of Canada have gone to the trouble
and expense of dredging out the river to bring
traffic up to Montreai? We have the finest
railway from the West, on the rnost level
right of way. runining between Winnipeg and
Quebec, and yet Quebec has not got and neyer
wiil get the trade that Montroal does. Many
years ago when 1 was in Quebec I asked* a
firieud of mine, a man of great experience,
why this was so, and lie said: "There is no
use building this ra.ilway to Quebec; the

184

SENATE

steamers won't come to Quebec for the grain.
There is no money in drawing grain. They
will go to Montreal if they have an inooming
load, and without it they won't come at ail.
Therefore Montreal gets the trade." Do you
suppose those steamers would ever go empty
to Toronto? What trade would they pick
up there? It would take a thousand vessels,
costing over a billion dollars, to handle the
grain that might come down by Montreal.
These big ten thousand ton freighters this
year cost $1.250,000 apiece. Look at the 4
per cent insurance!
Look at the enormous
cost of navigating them over long stretches
of narrow canal waters!
It is such things
as these that have brought people to the conclusion that there is nothing in the fancy
that such vessels will trade to Port Arthur.
I heard the honourable gentleman from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) say the most
extraordinary thing the other day. He said
that in Quebec the United States ws
paramount over Canada's waterway;
he
stated that since we made these treaties we
had no right to divert any water from the
St. Lawrence river, or from the lakes, without
the consent of the United States.
Hon. Mr.
"any water".

BEIQUE:

"Materially",

not

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I will
shiow the honourable gentleman what lie said.
This statement of his has gone through the
press of this country and has alarmed and
greatly agitated our people. Here it is:
Hon. Mr. Beique: Yes. They have equal rights
for free navigation in the lakes, and in that
part of the St. Lawrence above St. Regis. Those
are boundary waters, and it was agreed that
they are to be boundary waters for all time to
come; therefore, whether the quantity of water
is large or snall, it cannot be diverted without
their consent.
That is the opinion of one of the most
eminent lawyers in Canada-that the water
cannot be diverted without the consent of the
United States. Did such an idea ever enter
the head of any man in Canada-that we
were so incompetent that we would make a
Treaty to give our country away like that?
The honourable gentleman continues:
Mr. MeLachlan, in his opinion, makes a distinction between navigation only and power.
As far as navigation is concerned, it would be
a small diversion, but it would be a diversion
all the sarne.
I do not agree with that. I do not think
that the framers of these Treaties were
so stupid as to put us in such a position, and
I will give my honourable friend my reason.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

On page 152 of Hansard, where he quoted
from the Boundary Waters Treaty, I find
this:
It is understood. however, that neither of
the High Contracting Parties intends by the
foregoing provision to surrender any right
which it may have to object to any interference with or diversions of waters on the
other side of the boundary the effect of which
would be productive of material injury to the
navigation interests on its own side of the
honndary.
Now, by that the framers of this Treaty
preserved their common law or international
law rights. Before the Treaty was drawn the
law provided that neither country should do
anything in its part of the waters that wof'ld
injuriously affect the rights in waters belonging to the other country. The framers of the
Treaty wanted the international law to
remain as it was before. So they inserted
that clause, and it is quite clear that each
country has the right now, as it had before
the Treaty was made, to protest against any
use of the water on the other side to the
prejudice of its people.
Then, as to the question to which the honourable gentleman bas referred, I find the following in a quotation in his own speech:
The foregoing provisions are not intended to
linit or interefere with the existing rights of
the Government of the United States on the

one side and the Government of the Dominion
of Canada on the other, to undertake and carry
on governmental works in boundary waters for
the deepening of channels, the construction of
breakwaters, the improvement of harbours. and
other governmental works for the benefit of
commerce and navigation.

That is written in the bond. It is written
in the bargain that we shall have a right, as
heretofore, to go on making public works for
the improvement of navigation. Is that a
nullity? Then the honourable gentleman saiid
"Unless you make this bargain I fear that the
United States may deepen the Erie Canal."
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman should read the whole clause, where he
will find the words "materially affect."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I will do
that. Here it is:
-provided that such works are wholly on its
own side of the line and do not materially affect
the level or flow of the boundary waters on the
other.
That is expressiy what I have been trying
to point out: that we never had any right
to do anything on our side which would
injuriously affect navigation on the opposite

MARCH 28, 1928
side. That is the reason why we have been
protesting and protesting against what has
taken place at Chicago. That, we say, is
a violation of the common law, a violation
of international law. We say: "You are
doing something which no civilized nation
which respects international law should do
to another." That provision simply preserves, as did the first clause 1 read, a right
which, if it were flot for that proviso, might
be construed as having been given up. 1
submit with the greatest confidence -that
there is not a word or line in any one of
these Treaties by which either country surrenders any rights which it previously had
under international law. I arn not speaking
now of the right that was given or limited
ta proteet the scenic beauty at Niagara Falls,
or anything of that kind; I say the drafters of
these Treaties particularly guarded themselves against surrendering an invaluable international right.
Then, my honourable frîend said that he
was afraid the United States would regard
this as an unfriendly act. "An unfriendly act."
That is a mighty serîous phrase. When a
Government tells another "We regard this as
an unfirieiidýly act," it usually mens, "We
will go to war." Although the UJnited States
is a giant, and compared to it we are a
pigxny, I do not think they would say to
us: "Unless you gîve us these rights we
will go to war. We will regard it as an
unfriendly act." I think my honourable
friend is being ecared bý ghosts. Then as
to the statement that we would pravoke the
United States te enlarge the Erie Canial, let
me say that if the honourable gentleman's
opinion is correct,' the United States has né
right to enlarge that canal. But, you see,
the Erie Canal is owned by a State, and
that State can do as it chooses, and cati
snap its fingers at international law, as Illinois
bas done. The law of the United States is as
flux as quicksilver; you neyer can hold it;
it will always get through your fingers.
Now, I say that we should not make this
agreement unless we are satisfled that it
will substantially lower rates, and that the
game will not cost more than it is worth.
The interest on a couple of hundred million
dollars will bonus the carniage of a lot
of grain between Prescott and Montreal.
It seems ta me that it would be b1er ta
carry it for nothing than that the G'overnment should involve Canada in this great
expenditure, unless it can ha proved ta a
demonstration that there is money in it for

185

the people of Canada. I submit that s0
f ar as the development of this power is concerned, we should not make any agreement
until the United States have power and
autho-rity within the laws of the Union ta
carry out their agreement, or in other words,
until they own the property and agree ta
cornstruct the works themselves.
Hion. Mr. CASGRA1N,\: If ne one wishes to
speak, I would move the adjourtimenit of the
debate until next Tuseday.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable gentlemen, I amn in the position of the man in the
jury box, who knows very little about the
su'bject 'but Who may have to give a vote.
Hon. Mr. MARTIN: Then why do you
talk?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Because I may have
to vote upon this question, and I wish, when
the time cornes, to vote aocording te the
evidence, and, so far as I can, in the interest
of Canada. I followed as well as I could
the statements made by the 'honourable
gentlem-an who has just taken (hie seat, and
I understood him to state that when the
Welland Canal was completed Canada would
have aIl the navigation facilities that it would
use in the St. Lawrence River, and that further canalization would be of no advantage te
Canada sa far as navigation were concerned.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-tSTAUNTON: The honourable gentleman misunderstood, me. I said
that as soon -as the Welland Canal is finished
the only problem with which we wi'll 'have to
deal is as te whether or not we should
canalize to the corresponding depth with, the
Welland Canel the part of the river St. Lawrence bebîween Prescott and Montreal. I said
I had heem told tùhat, for the reasons wihi'ch
I gave, canalization would flot dýecrease the
cost of carniage of grain from Prescott to
Montreal; that it is an engineering problem
which bas been solved; and therefore the
whole question now is as to whether the cost
would be decreased ta such an extent as to
make it 'commerciailly profitable to this
country. As to that, I cannot speak; I can
only f orm niy own opinion on what I have
been told, having had fia experience te justify
me in giving a convinced opinion. But I said
that it is a purely oommercial. proposition,
that should 'be solved *by 'business men,
whether the rate on wheat and western grains
will be so low afte'rwaýrds as ta make it a
praper investment for this country.

186

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Just another question.
would furtîher canalization of the St. Lawrence
River bring return cargoes past Montreal,
up to Toronto, and west of Toronto? Would
there be any probability of that?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That a
vessel could go to Toronto? It might go.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: An ocean vessel?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Or reduce the cost of
cargoes for Toronto, Hamilton, and western
cities as far as Port Arthur?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I did not
deny that, if the water was made deep enough,
a vessel could be navigated to Toronto or the
west.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not commercially.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
But I
said that it is now admitted even by the most
ardent advocate in Toronto-I read an article
to that effect in a paper the other daythat it is commercially out of the questionnot that it cannot be done, but nobody will
do it unless it produces a profit, and there
is no money in it. That is now admitted on
all hands.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me to put one or two questions to him? I understood him to say that
both Canada and the United States, in the
international part of the river, are entitled
each to the natural flow of the St. Lawrence.
Hon. Mir. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And that neither the
United States nor Canada is entitled to divert
materially that natural flow of water from
one side to the other.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Yes, to
divert it so that it will injuriously affect
navigation in the opposite state.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But it would be so
under common law, and it is so under the
treaty?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
treaties have' not changed it.

The

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think if the honourable gentleman takes the trouble to read
my speech of the other day, he will find that
that was the very contention that I presented
to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I can
only say as an excuse for my obtuseness, that
I read the honourable gentleman's speech
several times, and I did not find that precious
sentence, and that the press of this country

has drawn the same inference as I have; and
I am delighted te hear him say that he as
the same view as I have.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Casgrain, the debate was adjourned.

COMMUNISTIC

PROPAGANDA IN
CANADA

THE

DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the inquiry of Hon. C. P. Beaubien:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the communistie propaganda carried on
throughout the country and inquire what measures, if any, the Government contemplates
taking to repress the same,
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend from Montarville
(Hon.
Mr. Beaubien)
yesterday
brought to the attention of the Government,
and of this House, a subject that is of national
importance, and indeed of world-wide concern, as bas been demonstrated in recent
years in a numlber of countries. I find myself
in complete accord in all that he submitted
to the House, so far as the facts were concreorned; but I would like to make passing
reference to one or two features which, if
not mentioned, might indicate to some readers
or listeners that the foreign members of the
population of Canada were all of one mind
respecting these matters.
There is a large proportion of the population
in Canada who were net born in this country.
Many of them come from countries in which
they did not have the advantages or liberties
that we enjoy; and I sometimes wonder
.whether, if we had been born in an environment and had grown up under the conditions
surrounding the Ukranian, whether we would
not be just as susceptible to doctrines of this
sort as he apparently is.
Therefore the
thought that I hope to advance this afternoon,
for the information of and suggestion to the
Government is that there ought to be an
honest and earnest effort made by the people
of Canada, directed by Government, to instruct the people who come to this country
along proper, legitimate, honest lines.
Merely to state that these things exist and
yet do nothing to remedy them, will net lead
us to any logical conclusion or beneficial
result. I know that my honiourable friend,
who brought this matter to the attention of
the House and to the Government, seriously
believes that something ought to be done to
improve the situation.
It is easy for one
to say, "I told you so," but it is perhaps not
so easy to initiate a movement that is not
altogether popular with some classes of the

187

MARCH 28, 1928
clectorete; yet a time does comae occasionally
~when governments must taka cognizance of
facts, and deal vith situations as thay find
them, in tha întarest of the people.
Such a time came to Canada in 1919, when
,gentlemen of advanced views wîth refarence
to policies, which they dasîrad to sea made
affective here, stepped over the lina and had

at the semae tima sought te calm the people
as te some fects touching this vary subjeat
te which my henourabla friand has referred.
Our mamnories are short; we soon f orgetwhat happens to-day, but I desice te caîl te
the attention of Parliamant, nnd of aIl who
may be interested, tha fact that in August,
1920, a pamphlet of information was carefully
prepared by the Government, and many scores
of thousands of copies ware distributed te

show that during the next coupla of yaars,
whether due te that cause or net, there was
in
a distinct 11111 the eggressiveness of that
portion of the population who termed themnsalves Communists.
In erder - that we may have a picture,
chronologically presented, of just what this is
ail about, may 1 quota a paragraph or two te
indicate whet Coînmunism is, and what it
stands for, in order that any person mn or eut
of the House to-day whe may be interested
miy know just what thîs agitation is ail about,
on what it rests, and what the rasults have
been and will ha.
Honourable gentlemen know that Czarism.
and Communismn are exaortly opposites, or
perhaps it might ha more correct te say that
it is ýreally the semae spirit, but in the hands
of the opposite party, and that communism
wes hemn as a result of the abusas-of autocratie
power under 'the old Czarist system. I do net
believe that it would hae possible in a dainecratic country, such as the British Empira
or the United Statas, based on democratie
prînciples and constitution, for a movement
-such as communismn te hava eriginated and
flourished. It exists because of the inherent
:and long-estahlishad conviction in the minds
4if peasants, serfs hemn under autocratie con-

ditions, who do flot and cannot conceive, until
thcy have been out in the world fSr years
urnder other governmrents, that the ceuntiry in
which they liye is not governed as was the
co~untry in Which they were born. So there
cerne into existence a class of people known
as anarchists who were attempting forcibly to
overthrow the ýGovernment of Russia as f ar
back as the reign of Czar Nicholas II. That
devel!opment extends back thirty yea.rs.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

The Nihilists.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They were, in
the estimation of meny of their fellows, real
petriots and martyrs to the cause; and I
want te say now that anyone who bas read
the detailed history of the raign of Nichelas
II of Russia will probahly have corne te the
conclusion that 1 did, that there was a man
with a heart and soul as big as Lincoln's who
endeavoured te reliave distress, and who eucceede>d in large measure. Ha placed on the
Statute Book laws that would have led te
responsible constitutional government in that
great Empire had hae been parmîtted to carry
Dut his work; but, like Lincoln. in the midst
of his task hie was assassinated, and his successors unfortunataly did not carry on his
policies.
In 1917 the Russian people, coming to the
conclusion that they had been deceived by
Garmany, and heving lest the last vestige of
confidence in their rulars, sought to overthrow the Government. Mr. Kerensky, who
wes the leader of the movemant, attempted
to establish in Russia a formn of Govarnment
very similar to that i existence in the United
States. In the midst of that effort the opportunity presented itseif for the more radical
to set up a dictatorship, of the iproletariat, or,
in other words, to make those who had heretofore heen oppressed the opprassors, and,
although they were in a small minority so fac
as the population of that Empire was concarned, they, together with the army that had
rehalled, found themrselves in a position where
they could exercise that dictatorship, and
thay have ever since been doing it. So a
constitution was establishad, and the provisions of it are somewhat intecesting. I will
now quota a few paragcaphs froin a pamphlet
that was issuad in Canada in 1920:
From March to November, 1917, Kerensky
endeavoured to establish a stable government
similar to and patterned after the formn existing in the United States, but meanwhile the
doctrines of Lenine and Trotsky were welcomed,
accepted, and adopted by masses of workers and
soldiers, who, in the name of liberty, committed
every crime imaginable from thef t to murder.
In November, 1917, a new Government was declared te exist, the character and constitution
of whicb may be described in the words of

188

SENATE

the report of the United States Committee on
foreign relations, dated April 14, 1920, which
Committee had been delegated to investigate
the status and activities of Ludwig G. A. K.
Martens, the self-announced representative in
the United States of the Soviet regime in
Russia. His own sworn evidence shows his
credentials to have been issued by the "Peoples'
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of the Russian
Socialist Federated Soviet Republic" from
Moscow, under date of January 2, 1919, and
sealed with the official seal of the Commissariat. This Government, as was brought out
in the course of the testimony, was set up in
November, 1917. by counter revolution to the
movement of March in that year, which had
accomplisbed the dethronement of the Czar.
The Republic operates under a constitution by
the terms of which "all property rights in the
land. treasures of the earth, water, forest, and
fundamental natural resources within its boundaries are abolishnd; which confirms the transfer
of banks into the ownership of the Government, by which there pass over without indemnification to the disposition of the county,
provincial, regional, and Federal Soviets, ail
private live stock and inventoried property of
non-labouring homesteads. and under which
private merchants, trade and commercial
brokers. monks and clergy of all denominations,
and, la general, all persons who do not "perform useful social functions" have no right to
vote or to be voted for.
That is a brief statement outlining the general terms and provisions of the constitution
of the Soviet Republie as established in
November, 1919. Mr. Martens, the self-announced officiai diplomatic representative of
the Soviet Government in the United States,
although carrying credentials from his Government, never presented them to the Secretary of State at Washington and was not
recognized in the United States as the official
representative of Russia.
A very exhaustive investigation was made
by a Committee of the Senate of the United
States, the details of which are very interesting, but too lengthy for me to place them on
the record. Any honourable gentleman who
desires to look them up will find them published in the Labour 'Gazette of August, 1920.
The reason I refer to tihis matter is that
we ought first to know just what form of
government it is that those people referred
by my honourable friend from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) last night are copying,
and what it is they advocate, and in these
f ew sentences you will find what doctrines
they are spreading.
Mr. Martens, the representative of the
Soviet Government in the United States-and
I am leading up to what I think will be an
interesting point-sought to establish and did
establish in the city of New York a Bureau
of Information. This was at the same time
expected and represented to be a basis from
which to establish trade relations between
Russia and the United States. It transpired,
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

however, that it was shortly known to be
simply a propaganda bureau. A paper known
as The Call, published in New York under
his direction, was the official mouthpiece of
Mr. Martens. During the investigation before
the United States Senate Committee, Mr.
Martens admitted, and indeed with some
pride, that it was their mission to distribute
propaganda literature and to send emissaries
throughout North America to preach and
teach the doctrines of Communism, and he
specially mentioned Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Cape Breton too.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Like my honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staurnton), I would say Cape Breton
is in Canada. At any rate, they proceeded
without delay to carry out that mission, and
very shortly afterwards we found evidences
of it in Western Canada, which culminated
in the trouble of May and June, 1919. A
prominent banker in the city of Winnipeg.
during the disturbances there, came to me and
said: "I think yon ought to know that there
is a very substantial amount of $50 American
currency bills being presented by foreigners
in the northern part of the city of Winnipeg,
at the banks, to be changed into bills of small
denomination. We know that this currency
has never been distributed here in compensation of any services rendered by these people.'
If the time permitted me to deal at greater
length with the evidence adduced before the
Senate Comîmittee you would be able to
connect up this fact and the fact that a very
large amount of money was placed at the
disposal of Mr. Martens and his office in New
York for the very purpose of advancing their
interests and carrying on their propaganda.
Honourable gentlemen will recall that for
a considerable period, in those troublesome
days of 1919, it was difficult for the outside
world to obtain authentie information as te
what was going on in the city of Winnipeg.
Telegrams were censored. The telegraph staffs.
quit their employment, some under stress and
unwillingly, others willingly. I refer to the
commercial staffs, for the railroad telegraph
service was not afffcted. There was for several
days only one medium througth which the
outside world knew what was going on in
Winnipeg, and that medium, as you may
remember, was the New York Call. Mr.
Martens' paper.
If honourable gentlemen
were sufficiently interestcd to inquire of the
Minister of Labour, I am sure they would find
on record, over in the Labour Department,
photostatie copies of permits obtained from
th- Minister of Transportation of the Soviot
Government of Winnipeg for citizens of that

MARCH 28, 1928
city to forward telegra.ms. These permite had
te be obtajncd before telegrains could be
icont.
Such is the connection between the Conimunist movemient in Canada, of which nîy
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) spoke
last night, and the Communist Government
now existent in Russia, and I think it is well
to keep tbat connection in mind. A littie
Inter on one discovers that Rev. William
Ivens, of Winnipeg, was the officiai correspondent of the New York Cail. You are
then led right along to the connection between the so-called Labour Church and this
Communist movement. And other gentlemen
-some of them not so far away, and whom
you all know, but who need not be mentionecl
at the moment-were connected with the same
movement.
So I wish to add my voice te that of mny
honourable friend from Montarville in saying
that I believe that all he states is true, and
particularly pernicious and dangerous are thie
efforts that are being made to pervert the
minds of the little children who are growing
uip in our large centres, because unless the
people are living in conditions of poverty,
tbey do not readily take to these doctrines.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) last night
took occasion to remark that there was
nothing of this kind in his city, the metropolis of Montreal. May I remind him that on
the 3lat of January hast, on the very day
that this House first discussed the Address
of bis Excellency, it was brought te the at,tention of the Government by the honourable
member for Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) that
these things did exist in the city of Montreal
at that moment, and he quoted bis autborîty,
which can be found in Hansard of that date.
That statement specificahly says tbat Cernmunist schools were established in varions
cities, and Montreal is specifically rnentioned
as one.
I further eall the attention of my honourable friend tbe leader of the Government to
the fact that away back in 1919 a person iii
Mentreal wrote to the leader of the strike
in Winnipeg a letter. which is quoted in f his

document that I have before me, issued in
1920, and wbieh urged the Winnipeg strikers
to adopt a certain plan of legislation that had
been prepared by Daniel DeLeon, a Philadelphia Socialist, nine years before, and that
was the basis of Lenin's Government in Moscow. The letter urged this man in Winnipeg
to use the same plan as the basis of the
Soviet Government then f0 bie established in
Catnada,). Tlhe author of the letter was a well

known and supposedly pbhanthropie social
worker in the city or Montreal. So my honourable friend's city, I fear, is no more immnune frorn the dangers of this propaganda
than any other city.
But I do say this, and indeed it will bear
repetitio-n. thýat we should neyer for one moment condemn a whehe class or race of people
because a few -of tbern support some ism,
which is flot common, or popular or rigbt.
May I remark in passing that in my opinion
a considerable responsibihity rests upon certain
large intere.sts in tbis country who are encouraging immigration, and who, if I arn
ccrrctlhy informed, substantially bonus so4me
of those ljkrainian papers that are supporting
this very propaganda. I tbink tha.t the Gov-

ernment would be wehl advised to devote a
little attention to that particular point, because it i6 very material.
Following the climax in 1919, the agitation
did decline for -a couple of years. As Canada
and other nations settled down te peace aetivities rather than those of war, the unrest
that was in the puiblic mmnd the world over
seemed to pasa away. People ail wanted to
bc' relieved of abnormal conditions and to get
back te a sound 'basis. But the United States
found that tbey were not rid of tbe resul-s
of Mr. Martens' activifies and tboise of bis
aocomplices. Therefore wbat did they do?
For the protection of their own, people andL
country, and particularly te meet -this situation, the United States passed what is known
as the Quota Law, and it bas been the greatest ýboon to that countiry and t he North
American Continent that we can possibly
imagine; and indirectly if bas been a great
boon te, Canada, because it bas had a saiutary
effeet on immigration ooming here. But no
seoner was Ühat Aet passed than there were
estaffblished in the United States back and
front door lines of communication fromi
Mexico and from Canada, neeessitating extra
precautions on the part of the United States
authorities. Whille I kaow that very ittle
has been said about it publiely, and f bat fhe,
press bias searcehy ever mentioned if, ye.t I am
sure that if the G-overnment would inquire
of its representative at Washingt on if would
bie able fo ascertain that a ve'ry large number
of people who had beýen advoeafing the overf hrow of t he United States Government. by
meanus advocated by C-ommunists bave found
theinsehves paci.ng the deck of a steamer
leaving the shores of tihe United States, witbeut anybody sayinig anytbing about if or flic

So neuf e waýs the situation becoming that
nd

190

SENATE

the employers of labour, organized as they are
there, both took cognizance of it. Here I
want to come to another feature of the question which affects us. We are all human, and,
unfortunately, men are inclined to pursue the
course 'that seems best suited to their immediate purpose. M-ay I say that the well
known trade union movement existing for
forty odd years, has been the bulwark tat
has guaranteed stability in industrial as well
as national life to a very great extent for
the last twenty years, and that is now recognized in the United States as being true,
but it was only when governments came to
realize and recognize the gravity of tihis propaganda that they began to appreciate the
fact that I have just stated. There are still
some eimployers in both the United States
and Canada who say that if we can makoe
these tmde unionists on the one hand and
Ihese Communists on the other fight among
themselves, we shall have both under subjection and shall get along nicely. Such has
been the view of many. That view is rapidly
passing, but it must always be kept in mind
that if Communism ever succeeds in establishing itself to the point where it thinks it can
force its will upon the eoom:munity, whether it
be a small or a large community, it will do so.
What is of more interest to us is the
present-day situation. What has happened
during the last six or seven years? Is the
danger still on the wane, or are the facts
as the honourable member from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) submitted them last
night now constituting a growing menace?
J am inclined to think that for several years,
probably up to the year 1924, the situation
was growing less acute; but for about seven
years nothing has been said about it by
way of governmental announcement, and it
has not attracted much public interest. But
recently the work of these Communist
schools which have been in operation for at
least four years, bas begun to be felt and
their influence is widening, until they are
undermining the faith and confidence of the
people in spiritual things as well as in indus'trial matters and human relations. It is
therefore important, I think, that we see
just where the leading influences are today, and learn how we may identify them.
The Communist first says that industrial
unionism or industrial organization, instead
of craft organization, should be adopted by
all workmen, and following the difficulty in
Winnipeg in 1919, which was an industrial
movement, the One Big Union, so-called,
which was the organization that led the men
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

there in their trouble. has continued to function, feebly for a while, but with inereasing
activity in more recent times.
The One Big Union in Canada adopted
almost word for word the policies, the principles, and the constitution of the I W.W.
Its literature was published by the I.W.W.
headquarters, near Chicago.
It is nothing
more nor less than the I.W.W., and its chief
weapons are sedition, sabotage and crime.
It was well known that its appellation in
the United States would not be popular here,
therefore a new name was found which designated more correctly what was contemplated,
namely, the sweeping of all workmen into
one big union, for the purpose of becoming
dictators. The 1919 movement was an experiment which thousands who participated
in it have since admitted was a great mistake. Nevertheless, we learn by experience.
The One Big Union is still alive, and is led
by the same men who were in it at that
time. It has its head covered; it is wearing
a wig, like some gentlemen do when they
appear before the Privy Council in England;
but so that you may be able to identify it,
whether it has its head covered or not, I
will describe its activities.
The Commercial Telegraph Operators in
Canada, who have been organized for 25
years, and who have had contracts with the
telegraph companies since 1902, were having
a convention in the city of Chicago in 1925.
Three men, all from Canada, none of whom
were Canadian born-one having been born
in Germany and the others in the United
States-attempted te obtain control of that
organization for the purpose of turning it
into a Communist organization. The delegates at that convention laid charges against
those men in the constitutional way. They
were fairly tried, and at that trial they made
statements that I think would convince any
honourable gentleman that their purpose was
undoubted, and they were ecpelled from
membership in that trade union. It will take
only a minute to give you an indication of
what I refer to. A Mr. Schnur, born in
Prussia, was the head of the movement, and
had been for several years an officer of the
organization in Canada. On September 16,
1925, during the trial in Chicago, he said:
We know that the press, the school and the
church are among the agencies of the capitalist
class, and we know that in the past they have
functioned in the interest of the prevailing
ruling class. The stand that I took at that
meeting. that if the United Press interpreted
the agreement with the union to mean that
United Press men, members of this union, had
tied up their labour power to their bosses, even
to the extent of scabbing on their fellow
workers in the same organization, to hell with
that agreement.

MARCH 28, 1928
That meant the violation of solemn contracts entered into between employers and
workmen whenever opportunity seemed to
make it advioable from, their standpoint. Ini
other words, such contracts were simply scraps
of paper, and these men were indulging in a
littie Kaiserism.
The employees' representatives resented that and voted for the expulsion of this gentleman and two others.
Now, who were the others?
One was a
gentleman named Lynch, who formerly had
been in Winnipeg. He was flot a Canadian.
During bis defence he said:
The goal must be that we should organize
ourselves to a point where we can prepare ourselves to control and own the earth. I don't
respect any contracts. The working class bas
its own code of morals. Any strike, wbich is
a miniature revolution, carnies its own code of
morals. The trouble witb the working class
is tbeir mentality is tied up witb conventionalities, laws, restrictions and niceties wbicb are
inflicted upon tbemn by the capitalist class. I
arn talking to you as a radical Socialist.
Those two gentlemen and one other-I will
not trouble you with his evidence-were expelled from membership in the organization.
Within three months they called a meeting in
the city of Toronto, and declared that they
had organîzed a new body known as the
Electrical Communication Workers of Canada.
That organization was to take in aIl electrical
workers, which would mean railroad and commercial telegraphers, street railway employees,
men engaged on power transmission lines, and
so on.
Why did they do that? It is quite
obvious. It was because they were flot able
to obtain control of a labour organization that
was on the square, and into which they had
been boring internally for years. Tbey then
began to bore from without, and I want you
to know the results.
Early in 1926 t.bey appointed a little committee of about six men, and made a demand
upon the' Canadian National Telegraphs for
reognition and a contract for commercial
telegraphers.
Those commercial telegraphers
bad had agreements with the old Great North
Western Telegrapb, more recently merged into the Canadian National Telegraphs, agreements wbich had been entered into twenty
years ago by mnutual consent, and revised
from time to time. The employers said to
these gentlemen: "No, we do not recognize
your rigbt to represent these commercial
telegraphers.
We bave an agreement with
them and they have given no notice of a desire to alter it." And the company refused
to deal wit-h them. Then what did these
gentlemen do?
They proceeded to Ottawa
and enlisted the syinpathy and co-operation
of three inembers of Parliament, aIl of whom
sit in the House to-day, one occupying a

191

mainisterial seat at this moment, and attempted
to secure recognition through the establishment of a board of conciliation in order to
force an employer to recognize their right to
have a contract Ibecalise they had minority
of the mien within their ranks. They insisted
that they represented a large mai ority of the
nmen. The employers very properly said
"Show us." They did not do so. On tbe
other hand, the organization with whieh the
employer 'had the contract i.ssued a circular
to the men stating that this question had
arisen, and saying, "We want your proxy as
to which organization you desire to represent
you."
To be perfectly fair, instead of asking the men to send their proxies to any officer
of the organization, they were asked to send
them to the generani manager of the Canadian
National Telegrapbs so that he would be
convinctid that tiiere was nothing underband
on their part.
I have a copy of the official
ballot.
Hon. Mr. MIJRPIHY: Who se-nt that out?
H-on. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Commercial
Telegraphers sent it to the men. They had,
I think, 1134 members at that time, and 1
bave the complete returns here as finally filed
with the General Manager of the Canadian
National Telegraphs. These give the names
of places from. coast to coast where these
men were empioyed, and show tbat 1013 of
the men cast their proxies and sent tbem. to
the company, tbus demonstratinýg their desire
to have the Commercial Telegraphers represent them.
Notwithstanding that, these people applied
for, and temporarily obtained, an injunction
to restrain the employer from doing business
with the organisation witb which it had a
contract, and with whicb it had been dealing
for years; and finally, after the faîl of 1926,
wben a new Minister of Labour came on the
scene, they renewed their efforts to get a
board of conciliation. This it was ent.irely
ouiside the power of the Minister to grant.
So number one is the One Big Union; number two is the Electrical Communication
Workers; and now there is another. There
is an organization known as the Canadian
Brotherhood of Railway Employees, wbich
is founded upon the basis of a Canadian organization for Canadian workers. It was in
existence first on the old Intercolonial railway, and it lias gradually extended to other
portions of the Canadian National railway
systema. In 1919, notwithstanding contracts
in force and that there were no gnievances
existing under those contracts, practically
every men in the sleeping car, dining car. and
freight-handcling services in the West, went

on a sympathetie strike. They were encouraged to do so by the head of the organization
who to my knowledge, because I was there,
sat in the MacLaren Hotel in Winnipeg, and
did not raise a hand to maintain the contract
lie had entered into. When these Electrical
Communication Workers were fighting their
fight, tbey came to the President of the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees and
invoked his assistance, which he gave them,
and they made joint representations to the
Government. Needless to say, the Government could not, and did not comply with
their request. However, on January 4. 1927,
the heads of three bodies-the One Big Union,
the Electrical Communication Workers, and
the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees-addressed a communication to ail
national and independent unions in Canada
suggesting

that

in

defence

of

these

poor

telegraphers who were so abused there should
be a conference held with a view to establishing a representative legislative body to
really represent the labour of Canada. That
meeting was called for March 15, 1927, in the
city of Montreal. The day previous, March
14. the men of those three main organizaions, who had attached their signatures to the
notice callina that meeting, were in the city
of Ottawa making their last attempt to press
upon the Government their demands for the
establishment of a board of conciliation to

where the trouble lies, and what is going on.
Let the facts be known, especially in those
centres. There is nothing like the clear light
of truth to cure disease, and I hope the
Government will undertake to try that cure.
I do not suggest that it is an imitation of
what was done six years ago, but I do say
that in 1920 the broadcasting of the facts to
the people had a very salutary effect upon the
whole situation for several years. From time
to time similar information should be given
to the people.
My other suggestion is that when any body
of workmen, or any committee claiming to
represent workmen, comes before a minister
or the Cabinet, requesting or demanding
audiences-they ought never to demand, but
some of them do-that if the Government has
any doubt as to their bona fides or as to
who or what they represent, let it take the
precaution of ascertaining before it gives
them an audience, because once they receive
an audience it is regarded as recognition, and
immediately it is broadcast throughout the
country to their own representatives anl
others that they have been recognized and
that others have been repudiated. In this
way the Government will avoid becoming the
instrument of industrial unrest, and will, on
the contrary, promote industrial peace.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haydon, the debate
was adjourned.

sent at ail. On March 15 they went to Monti-eal, and there was born a new labour organization, now claimed by them to be the
legislative mouthpiece of Canadian workers,
which is known, designated, and advertised,
as the All-Canadian Congress of Labour; and
the President is Mr. A. R. Mosher, President
of the C. B. of R. E.
I had not intended to mention this, because I think it will take care of itself; but
when the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Bonubien) brought this subject to the attention of the House last night,
I determined that the country and the House
and the Government should know the manner
and character of the so-called Canadian Congress of Labour which will represent itself
Io the Government as the bona fide mouthpiece of organized workers in Canada. I hope
that the few suggestions that I have made

INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE inquired of the Government:
1. In connection with the St. Lawrence
Waterway developraent, to wbat extent would
thec use of the Canadian canais be interfered

with by the construction of a channel or canal

ail on the Canadian side in the international
section, both for navigation and power?
2.What would be the approximate cost of
such channel or canal over and above that of
the channel or canal as recommended by the

Canadian section in the report of the Joint
Board of Engineers: witb reference in both
cases to the above-mientioned reports to the
parts applying to the subject-matter of bofli
quLestions?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The following
are the answers fromn the Department of
Raihways and Canais:
1. The Canadian section of the enlarged
Joint Board of Engineers considered a scheme
in which the locks would be placed on the
Canadian side of the river at the Long Sault.
Such a seheme would involve an increase in
cost over the recommended plan of $3,500,000
and would put out of commission the present

14-foot systemn of canais on the Canadian sido.
It did not, however, envisage an ail-Canadian
channel between the Long Sault and Lake
Ontario, where the navigation channel crosses
and recrosses the boundary line at varions
points. No estimate of a purely Canadian
channel was prepared.
2. No engineering investigation has ever

UNION OF CANADA AND NEWFOUNDLAND
MOTION-DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from March 22 consideration of the motion of Hon. Mr. Tanner:
That

should

in the

opinion of this House Canada

favourably consider any proposal that

may be made by Newfoundland for union with

the Dominion of Canada.

MARCH 29, 1928
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, in view of the visit of the Deputy
Governor I ivili endeavour to take flot more
than a few minutes, so as ta clear the Order
Paper for to-day. I dtesire ta add a few
observations ta those already submitted ta
the House on the subI ect of this motion.
The Gulf of St. Lawrence, sevýral hundred
miles in width, probably 500 at its extremity,
is the open door ta probably the largest inland waterway in the world, certainly the
inland waterway carrying the largest volume
of traffic, and along the St. Lawrence River
and the Great Lakes, for the 2,000 miles of
their extent, their live many millions of people
with billions of dollars' worth of property.
Therefore, I regard the Island of Newfoundland as the Heligoland of the North Atlantic.
It stands as a silent sentinel across the mouth
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the passage at
the north end being only 14 miles in width,
through the Straits of Belle Isle, and the
apening between Cape North on the mainland and Port aux Basques being, I think.
flot more than 60 or 70 miles. Therefore this
great Island, which is about 42,000 square
miles in area, or approximately the size of
the State of New York, although it has flot
as rnany people, is a watch tower which, if
necessity arase, would be a fitting frontier
defence for all that great territory which
borders the St. Lawrence River and the Great
Lakes. If we were living in or looking forward ta a time when the defence of that
great inland waterway would be necessary, it
seems ta me that Newfoundland would be of
paramaunt importance i this respect.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Is he
very familliar with Newfoundland?
Has he
been there?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Except for the
Straits of Belle Isle, of which the honourable
gentleman speaks, warships could give Newfoundland a wide berth; and I do not think
any warships would venture into the Straits.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
From Cape
North on the mainland ta the Island of Newfoundland is no farther than the Germans
shot sheill inta Paris du-ring the war. I am
not suggesting that there is likely to be any
neoessity for defence, 'but I am pointing out
the strategic location of that great island.
Newfoundland was discovered in 1497 hy
John Cabot, or, as is more likely, by his son
Sebastian. History tells us that Henry VII
presented Seba.stian Cabot with the sum of
56109g-13à

£10 for having discovered Newfoundland, and
subsequently gave him a pension of £20. The
Cabots apparently settled later in Massachusetts, for there the name bas been
transmitted and their characteristics are well
known, as expressed in a little verse that I
remember seeing same time ago:
HePe's ta gaod aId Boston,
The land of the bean and the
Where the Cabots speak only ta cod,
Abbots
And the Abbots speak only ta God.
For 200 years following its discovery there
was not much devolapment in Newfoundland
except a iittle fishing dyne by fishermen from
various European caunties, but after the days
of Sir Humphrey Gilbert the island began
ta grow in importance. The papulation
continued ta increase until ta-day we find a
population of approxim-ately 259,000 on the
Island proper and about 4,000 in Labrador,
which belongs ta the Dominion of Newfoundland. I caîl it the Dominion because it
bas a status equal ta ours.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:- It is not in the
League of Nations.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Well, perhaps it
might be if it desired.
Bef are reaching any conclusion on the subject matter of the mation, it seemas to. me that
it is important that we should review and
know samething of the resources, business
and people of Newfoundland, in order that
we may at least form some estimate of what
the proposition would mean if canferences did
occur between the twa countries laaking to a
union. Therefore I have taken pains ta
ascertain same facts.
We find flrst that the population is, as I
have stated, 270,000, and that there have been
built an that island some 923 miles of railroad, 545 of which is considered as main line
an*d 378 as branch Unes. Their railway is of
narrow gauge type.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN. Three feet six.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The capacity of
the rolbing stock and motive power la not
very great, and the railroad does not pay its
way, although it is an absolute necessity ta
the commerce of the Island. The Government of Newfaundland operate also a number
of steamships, which are necessary in maintaining communication with the outlying portions of the i.sland and with the mainland.
Their stea-mship routes caver a distance of
about 3,413 miles and are profitable, as le a
rather extensive drydock at St. Johns, Newfoundland, which the 'Goverament own and
operate. The operation of those public utilities--of dry-dock, steamships and railroads-

SENATE
in the year 1925, the record of which is the
latest that I have been able te put my band
upon, showed a net deficit cf $358,509, tbe drydock and the steainsbips yielding a fairly
substantial surplus, wbile the railroad had
a considerable deficit.
The total revenues cf tbe Newfoundland
Governmnent for 1925 appear to hae beens
$9,783,000 and the total expenditure for the
saine year $9,436,000, the net resuit being a
surplus, wbich wvas the first surplus that thcy
enjoyed for a long time.
One-baif cf the public debt may be attributed te utilîties and the other haî f te war
expenditures. We remember with satisfaction,

SENATE

support the motion, especial:ly with that
amendment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, I have no intention of speaking at
length on this motion, but I happened in
1880 to answer an advertisement, and went
there as an engineer and spent six months
surveying for a railroad there in the peninsula
of Avalon, and I did not return there for
forty-five years, when I was interested in
those Iron mines.
There is no doubt that those mines are
exceedingly valuable, and they sell ore to
Germany to the extent. of some 700,000 tons,
and could sell more, but that is about the
limit of production, and there is not very
much profit in selling it on account of the
high freight. The ore contains 52% of iron,
and it is good ore, and part of it goes ta
Sydney. That is a good asset, and the industry em.ployes about 3,000 men at big wages
for short days. Those who pay the wages
know that they are big. and that the days
are short, and I have lost enough money
there to know something about it.
But J do net believe that the Government
of Newfoundland have any idea at all of
being annexed to the Dominion of Canada.
W hen I was there, ona of the surveying
parties. not the one I was in, was stormed by
the wives of the fishermen, who broke their
instruments, because they said that if we
built a railroad they would get into debt,
and in order to get out of debt they would
have to sell out or be annexed to Canada. I
do net think there is any desire to-day for
annexation to this Dominion.
I visited Newfoundland with tweive members
of the Imperial Parliament to see the opening of the big pulp mill there that had been
assisted by the Government of the island and
the Imperial Government, which has been
purchased 'lately by the International Paper
Company. The Northcliffe interests are
located at High Falls, but I would say that
pulpwood exploitation on the basis of four
cords to the acre is not a paying proposition,
so that I do not think it would be much of
an asset. As a defence sentinel, we know
that the fleets of the world could safely ride
there, but then our good friend, the League
of Nations, says that we are not to have any
more wars anyway, so we may leave aside
the defence business.
The next thing I wish to mention is that the
Government-not the present Governmentwas a party, through the Hon. C. J. Doherty,
their Minister of Justice, to presenting their
case to the Privy Council, which could not give
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

any other judgment than the one they pronounced, because it was an action en bornage,
that is, they asked the Privy Council to define
the line between what Newfoundland owned
and what Canada owned. Thus they recognized
that Newfoundland had proprietary rights. I
met the Attorney-General of the Island the
other day, Sir John Bennett, and I said to
him, "You put it over us like a tent, didn't
you?" 'and he laughed. I said, "The minute we
agreed to have the line defined, then we admitted that you were the adjoining proprietor."
But the real contention was not that at all;
we were proprietors, but they had the right ta
take their fish on the shore, to get fresh water,
and to get wood to do any little cooking, the
same as France had on the French shore on the
south side; but the Government of my honourable friend made a mess of it. Judge Doherty
is a good judge, and how he made that mistake
I do net know, except that Newfoundland
would net agree to anything else and they had
to go to it that way.
I have in my house an old Atlas which shows
exactly the limit that has been fixed. But
Canada and the province of Quebec lost
nothing by that judgment, honourable gentlemen, for I would not accept all that territary
even if offered it for nothing. The late honMr.
ourable member for Ottawa (lon.
Edwards) had that place looked over, and he
said that lumbering there would be impossible.
If he wanted a ton of hay he would have to
get it from Montreal; a barrel of pork would
have to be brought from Chicago; potatoes
from Prince Edward Island, and so on, for
nothing grows in that part of Labrador, and
there is not much farming on the island proper,
either. But the people are happy; they live
very well; as far as I know they have a good
Government which suits them; and I think we
shoulid leave them alone.

CANADIAN NORTHERN RAILWAY

FIRST READING

Bill 153, an Act respecting the Canadian
National Railways and respecting the Canadian Northern Railway Company 5 per cent
income charge convertible debenture stock.Hon. Mr. Dandurand.

199
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill is to approve and give effect
to the Scheme of Arrangement and Compromise between the Canadian Northern Railway Company and the holders of its 5 per
cent income charge convertible debenture
stock. This stock is secured by trust decd,
dated May 6, 1910, supplemented by trust
deed dated May 17, 1915.
The trustees are
the British Empire Trust Company, Limited,
London, England, and the National Trust
Company, Toronto.
The stock is repayable at par on May 6,
1930.
Interest is payable at 5 per cent
or at such less rate, if any, as the net earnings of the railways concerned shaîl be sufficient to pay.
They were income bonds, and were to
receive dividends only as the income justified
it. Interest was paid on the bonds.
It was
not cumulative up to the year 1914, when
interest ceased to he paid, and since then it
has not been paid, but the stock is redeemable, is maturing, and is payable in 1930.
The Scheme of Arrangement provides for
payment of the stock at 94 per cent of par
on May 6, 1928, on wbich date the necessary
moncy bas to be in the hands of the trustees.
The Seheme of Arrangement was approved
at a meeting of the stockholders held in London on the lSth November, 1927.
Section 2 of the Bill conflrms the Scheme of
Arrangement and declares it to be valid and
binding as if it had been enacted by the Act
which. will be based on the Bill.
The total principal outstanding on December 31, 1926, was $24,137,846.08, 94 per
cent of this is $22,689,575.32.
The Bull provides authority for guarantee
of the securities subject to the approval of
the Governor in Council as to terms and
conditions. The proceeds are to be deposited
to the credit of the Minister of Finance. For
the purposes of the Scheme of Arrangement,
the sale of securîties shail he by competitive
bid; but in view of the fact that time is of
the essence, and will be very limited, provision is made for temporary financing.
With these explanations, I beg to move,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Are those liabilities
which the Government was not responsible
for and which they are now assuming?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The whole system was responsible for the issue. It was only
responsible for the interest as it was earned
after ordinary administrative charges were
met. Interest was paid at 5 per cent up to
1914. The company has not earned the 5 per
cent since 1914, although a committee of the
bondholders in London have been claiming
that during those latter years sufficient income had been shown to justify the payment of a certain amount, at all events, of
the interest by the railway company. All
this has been settled. There is no more claim
as to an accounting. Under the Scheme of
Arrangement the parties accept the repayment of their capital purely and simply at 94.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: What price did the purchasers pay for the security?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a statement to that effect. It is surprising how easily
these bonds were observed by the British
public. Some Canaddians also held a certain
amount. Income charge stock was issued by
the Canadian Northern in the years 1910,
1911 and 1912. The first issue was made in
1910-$15,000,000 at 922. In 191,1 the railway
company offered $7,500.000 of the stock, the
price being 98. Some of the original purchasers paid over par for their stock, which
had gone up.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To 106.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As far as 106,
my right honourable friend says. In 1907
the gross surplus was $1,700,000.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I assume that the
bondholders have expressed their satisfaction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes. They
met in Novemiber last in London, and by a
large majority-I think over 80 per cent of
them-agreed that under the trust deed the
agreement is valid.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: The agreement of
the majority will carry the whole issue?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
It would be interesting to know what the bonds were quoted
at on the market before the arrangement
was mad.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That I could not
tell my honourable friend. As far back as
October 1926 an agreement was made practically on these lines by Sir Henry Thornton.
It was not sanctioned by the Government,
and a new arrangement took place in 1927.
Then the moot question was which was the
better of the two arrangements. From information I have, if money was procured by
the selling of Canadian bonds at over 41 the
1926 arrangement would show an advantage
over that of 1927; but if the Canadian bonds
can be sold at or below 4.20, then the 1927
arrangement will show some advantage by
fifty odd thousand dollars.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second tirme.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time. and passed.

There have been severai suggestions in regard
to the wording of the motion wbich I piacod

are in syrnpathy with the
proposition
submitted and are of the opinion that it Iwould
ho desirabie to receive in a friendly spirit,
and to consider in such a spirit, any proposition looking to a union of Canada with Newfoundland. Hlaving consuited with the honourable leader of the Huse, I arn going to
ask for leave to arnend my motion slightiv.

That in the opinion of the Senate Canada

my motion after the word "opinion" be loft

The motion was agreed to.

,îustified in saying that the opinion of Canadianis has not varied on this question of Newfoundland's entry into Confederation.
In
rea ding the historv of the negofiations hetween our two countries I find that the question between us bas been mainiy n question
of terms.
Newfoundland was represented at the Quebec Conference of 1864, which met te discuss
the possibility of Confederation, and it .ioined
in a unanimous recommendation of a scbeme

It deiayed action, howevor.

Our own British North America Act, clause
146, empowers the Dominion of Canada to
enfer into negotiatiens with the provinces of
Newfoundiand, Prince Edward Island and
British Columbia for their admission into the
union. Therefore, as far *as Canada is concerned, it would not be necessary for us te
obtain any further authority from the Imporiai Parliament, as the necessary powers
wrre granted to us under the article te which
I have just alluded.
In 1868, after Confederation had taken
place, negofiaf ions xvîth Newfoundland were
rosurned, and in 1869 a Newfoundland dolegaf ion came to Ottawa and arrangod terms
of union.
The Newfoundlnnd Government
I lien went to the country on the issue, anîl
wvas defcated by a large majority.
Sir John A. Macdonald comments on the
çituation in a private letter te the Governor
General:
The acquisition of the island itself is of neo
imiportance te Canada, and the terins ofiered
hy ils and acce<ied te by the governrnent cf
the island w-ere se liberai that in a pecuniary
p'oint cf view ive made a bad bargain. (Pope,
ui, .145.)

In 1888 Canada proposed the sending of a

Newfoundland delegation te Ottawa te confer
upon ternis of 'union.
The proposai felI
throiîgh, Iargely, if appears, because a date
for the conference cotîld flot ho agreed upon.
This xvould show that there was net a very
ardent desire on the part of Newfoundland
te, enter into new negotiations.
In 1895 therç' was a serious financial crisis in
Newfoundland,
and a delegation came te
Ottawa again te discuss union.

I would ask
that we revert to the Income Tax Bill which
ivas before us a short time ago.
1 desire to draw the attention of the mcmi
bers of the Senate to the fact that this Bill
arises maînly out of the Budget proposals
whielh were made by the Minister of Finance.

that the personal income tax must be paid by
May Ist; and in ordcr that the reductions inay
apply without any jarring, it is thought, better
ihat this legisiation should be passed, if poscible.
The first clause lias merely to do with an
increase in the reduction from tee per cent
to twdnty per cent. The second section deais
with the rate of tax applicable to corporations
and joint stock companies. The real meaning
of the section is this. First, the tax wvas nine
per cent, then it w-as reduced by ten per cent,
making it a littie over eight per cent, and
this chang-e is to make the tax a straigbt eiglit
per cent.

SENATE
Now, while they are going on recommending
the building of linos and prolhesying that they
will produce good results-and I an not im
pugning their good faith at all--hoey are unable to tell whether the lines which Parliament has authorized them to build, and
which they have built, are producing thet
traffic that they anticipated when they took
the responsibility of recommending their construction to Parliament. There must be figures
on a railroad system so well run as the
National is to show the amount of traffic over
these branches in carloads.
The traffic must
be shown, perhaps not in detail, but in a
big summary.
We authorized the building of a line some
place or other extending 15 miles into the
country, the aim being, as we understood it
in the Railway Committee, to bring a settled
and producing part of the country within 15
miles of the railwav, that being about the
maximum haul that the farmer could make
without serious disadvantage to his income.
Those linos have been built, and now they
cannot tell us what good they have done.
Surely there must be sone figures to show how
many loaded cars came o-er that particular
branch, and about how many carloads in a
year iwere profitable or reasonably so. Take
this thrce-year program, for instance, that was
connienced. I think, in 1927.
It is very
unsatisfactory to be told that we cannot learn
whether that construction was justified by
the anotnt o? traffic handled over the linos
constructed.
J would ask the Leader of
the House to suggest to his colleague that
the position taken by the manager of the railroad should hf msodified. and that more information should be given.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I believe that
the statement made by my honourable friend
is deserving of attention by tho administration
of the Canadian National Railways.
We
can well remember the little memorandum
whiclh T read from the administration, stating
what was expected in the development of a
certain area in which a branch line was to
be constructed.
It gave not only w'hat the
area produced, but a surmise of what it would
recoive and absorb.
The Department lias
those figures, and it would be easy for it, as
my honourable friend suggests, to apply a test
to the hopes upon which we authorized the
building of the branches.
Of course, everybody will realize that the three-year program
ias only produced a certain number of finishod
branches, and we are not so very far away
from the end of the three years, and possibly the railway administration would require some time to prove the accuracy of its
Hon. Mr. McLELLAN.

estimates made at the beginning of the term.
The trade must find its way; it must leave
certain channels and enter tlese new
branches,
and i would not be fair to ask the railway
to give us a statement of oerations during the
first year, for example.
As those branches
are utilized, the railwav authorities should
bh able to give us an account of the
development of trade going and coming on those
branches.
It would b difficult for them to
give the actual money returns, which are involved in the long haul. and those branches
serve as feeders, but we could learn what
actually leaves those branches and what comes
to the various stations on those branches.
I will, however, draw the attention of the
Department and of the railway authorities
to this feature.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not intend to amplify
what
bas been said; but individually I have
fel
for several years that this House should
avail
itself of tIe right tocaIl the
railwav excutives. as is done in the Railway Committee of the other House. I realize that
it
is more important for that to bo dono in
tIe other House, in connection with the
Canadian National system of railways,
because they are the people who vote the money
for the appropriation which must
be made,
hence there is necessity of inquiry, and searching inquiry, on their behalf. But in this
House we have an ex-Minister of Railwavs
on the other side, and one on this side, and
we have many men of light and leading in
their various commercial and other callings;
so I think we should have not only a survey
of the National Railways as to the brancs
lines under the scheme that las been referred
to, which is quite in order. and the work of
vhich is very well done; but also a generil
retrospect of the year's operations of both
railways-for they are both amenable to this
House under the Railway Act-and I think
we should have the same regard to the Merchant Marine.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When my honourable friend says both railways, what railways does he mean?

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Of course,
technically speaking, we could only take the
National Railways. We could not. in the
ordinary course of affairs, ask the C.P.R. for
such a report, unless when they were
asking
for a charter, for we cannot ask any accounting of those who do not ask for anything
from us.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

They pay their own

207

MARCH 30, 1928
Hon. Mr. WILLOUIGHBY: Yes, they pay
their own bills and go their own way, and
have their own charter. It is with the others
that I arn concerned, and the samne with the
merchant shipping. Some members of this
House will have enough leisure ta attend ta
these thinga, but many of us are taa busy
ta do so. I think that in future, perhaps
flot this Session, we should have members
of the Canadian Shipping Board appear before
the proper Cornmittee of this Hause sa that
we will be seized, at first hand, of the acta
and proceedings of that Board.
The Senate
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
can always act upon its own responsibility,
and decide as ta its own action. I drew the
attention of my honourable friend fram Bedfard (Hon. Mr. Pape) ta the difficulty there
would be in carrying on as exhaustive an
inquiry into the administration of the Canadian National Railways as is being conducted
before the Committee of the other Chamber.
Perhaps there could be a way of bringing
the information at first hand without imposing upon the experts. and heads of departments of the National Railways such a longstay in the capital. 1 know that more than
one of the representatives of the railway have
spoken of the handicap imposed on their
administration on accounit of the principal
officiais being detained in Ottawa, in thc
other Chamber, sometimes for a month. That
is one-twelfth of the year that those officiais
arc taken froma their work of administration,
and their contact with the other officiais an(
their staff. The railways are aur property,
and we must avoid throwing too many impediments in the way of their administration.
I a.m satisfied that the other Chamber, at
ail events, has found a solution for the very
great prablem which confronted us when we
became the owners of that vast system. Ia
this Chamber we were asking ourselves how
the representatives of the people, in the otýher
Chamber and in this one, could relieve aurselves of the administration of a property
that cost over two billions of dollars, and
how the shareholders, who are the people,
cauld through their representatives in the
Commons and the Senate, have a word to
say once a year. When we were looking for
a solution of that problem it was decided in
the other Chamber ta transfer the budget of
the Canadian National Railway, and probably also the Merchant Marine, ta a Comnmittee of the House bef are which the officiais
could be brought and examined and crossexamined on their past administration andl
on their estirnates for the year ta corne. In
that procedure there has been found a. solution for the problem which we had ta face-

how such a vast property, handed to a few
men, yet the property of the nation, could
be controlled to a certain extent by the
shareholders.
Now, my hanourable friend suggests that
we might perhaps set up another and similar
control by having the officiais before us; but
we wiil need ta give the matter somes consideration befare we decide on a regular inquiry being made into the aperatians of the
railway and the merchant marine. We would
have ta examine carefully the effect it would
have and ta what extent we could inquire,
sa as not ta handicap too much the whole
system. in which we are so vitally interested.
Han. Mr. HUGHES: Would there be any
objection ta the members af the Senate being represented an that cammittee in the
other House-ta making it a joint cammittee?

Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: That is a question which could be taken up between the
twa branches of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am sorry ta have
ta disagree with my honourable friend from
Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby). We
are ail proud of the National Railways. We
call ourselves proprietors and awners of them,
and for that reason I think one part af aur
duty is ta see that the afficials who are
responsible for their cperation are allowed.
all the time passible ta be at their work. If
we are going ta bring some of themn ta Cammittees in the otheér House and keep them.
there for a long time, as is now done, and
then afterwards have them brought aver here
ta go over practically the saine ground, it
seems ta me that it would be double work,
and at the saine time do an injury ta the
road.
If some systema could be devised, as suggested by the honourable member for King's
(Hon. Mr. Hughes), by which a joint comnmittee of the twa Houses could arrange the
different matters, it would be well; but by
the other plan we would nat get any information further than we naw get fram the reporte that are afterwards submitted by the
committee of the other House.

wvas considercd advisable, therefore, to secure

extended exl)erience in port development ia

to ask the honourable the Leader of this

to-niglit any Orders in Council upon this
subjeet, but I have heaird that an Order in

honourable friend if lie would bie good enough
te, look into the matter so, that perliaps toxnorrow he would lie able to give us the details as to botli aspects of this subject.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will lay on

that the word "'shall" is to be construed as
imperative, and the wvord "may" as permissive.
There are the words. What do they mean?
Here is a provision to remove any ambiguity
or doubt that this provision is imperative.
I do not want to make a long hegal argument in this House, but I just submait the
broad proposition that we have the power
specificalhy given1 to us in the British North
America Act to fix the salaries of the Judges,
and that a necessary deduction from. that is
that we are entitled to eay that we shiaîl have
the whole of their time or to specify how much
of it we shaîl have. Otherwise, it is beyond
the capacity of mortal man to fix the salaries
at ahl. 1 wouhd like very much to have my
honourable friend on the other aide of the
House bring t-his matter before the Goverument and to sue that the Department of
Justice or the Minister of Justice takes some
steps to deal with it. If this is not done, this
instance may be followed in other Provinces
by what I would regard as plain violations of
the Act. It wouhd be just as well to nip this
practice in the bud. If it is necessary-I am
not suggesting that it is--if the Department
has any doubt about it at ail, now that so
many cases are going to the Courts for
opinions, let us have a judicial finding on thîs
question.
I think I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
alrcady stated that the Department was examining into thc situation and studying the
report. I do not know if there can be any
appeal from the decision of the Court of
Appeal in Manitoba to the Supreme Court of
Canada, but separate and direct reference

2. The report of the International Board of
Enginecrs on the St. Liawrence Waterîvay project does naf prcsent a unanimous recomniendation as fa the manner in which the International Section should be improved. The
recommendations of the Canadian Section do
not propose f0 place any dykes in front of the

Mr. REID.

3. The plans presenfcd by bQth sections of
flie Joint Board of Engineers require the
biuildin.g of a dyke in fr-ont of the fown of
Morî'isburg. Ail plans proented require tihe
suibmerging of the Rapide Plat Canal. The
water eleî'afion proposed is froma two ta four
feet above the loweutt p)art of flhc main street
of Morrisburg. The top of the dyke proposed
is about 14 feet ahot'e the Iowest part of the
main street of the fown and about nine feet
aboî'e flhc mean level of Lake Ont aria.
4. Plans presented bY' bath sections require
a dyke af Iroquois. These plans do nat subcmerge the Galops Canal, but propose ta utilize
the Galops Canal, not for navigation, but far
the carrving af a smal-1 percenfage of the flow
of the river.

5. The plans of the Unit ed States Section
of flae Board cf Engiceers show very extensive
dykes: bctwcen. Crysler Island and Barnhart
Island. Tue plans of the Canadian Section

pracfically no dykes in this regian. The
plans presented by bath sections include locks,
for connecting up witlî the present 14 ft.

alffer the new and larger works are completed.
In the proposai of flic Amnerican section a
lock for 14 ft. hoats is placed near fhe head
of Sieek Island. In fthe proposai of the Oanadian Section one lock is placed in the Crysler
'Islandl dam, anti anc lork is placed north of
Barnhaî't Island, near lock 20 af the present
Cor'nwall Canal.
6. The capital cost af the Galops Canal,

7. The water level at the licad of the Cornwvall Canai will be raiied about 17 feet in the
ptioltosal of the Canadian Section, and 42

The language of diplomacy, so to speak, is,
aceording to the cynic, one of mendacity.
That, hoevecr, is highly inaccurate. Safety
andi courteous treatment of envoys are its
real foundation, but on it has been buit a
-structure of iirocedure of thc ntmost importance anti delicacy. The expressions of proper
consideration in our intercourse with those
envoys, even down to the mai-gin whichi is
loft on letters, and the size of the paper on
wbich varions communications arc inscribeti,
are carefully regulated, andi carry with them
varions degrees of significance.
That tbis

the fact that the typewriter is useti in diplomatie correspondence, even of the highest
importance. This may possibly be a matter
of regret to anybody who is an ex~pert penmtan. Ail tbese tbmngs are carcfnlly regulateti,

APRIL 18, 1928
in saying that only those who were in the
confidence of the Government were nlot surprised by the announicement in the Speech
from the Throne that arrangements had been
nmade for sending envoys ta Paris and ta
Tokia. But the extension of this service ta
other centres, if such be in contemplation,
seemed ta me ta be a matter too important
ta came in and be accepted through the back
door. It has never been the practice of the
British people ta repudiate, or fail ta implement, arrangements made with other nation
by aur accredited representatives, except
under the gravest circumstances. If thase
arrangements are not approved of, the
Ministry may be punished, but an arrangemient which has been made, and has received
the due approval cither of Great Britain, or
of any anc of the Dominions, is reasonably
certain ta be carried out, whatever may be
the general opinion af the Parliament as ta
its wisdomn or opportuneness.
I imagine that the representation of Canada
in foreign countries throughi legatians is a
matter af sucb importance that it would have
been not anly expedient, but an obligation
iniposed Iîpon the Prime Minister of the day,
ta have said ta the people of Canada: "We
believe that the time bas came when Canada,
instead of utilizîng aur Imperial connection
through embassies and missions, shauld, in
countries where we have sufficient interests,
ho represented by Canadians, and have the
representatives of those counitries at Ottawa."
When once the matter bas been broached
with a foreign country, particularly if that
country finds the proposition ta establish diplomatic relations with them an agrecable one.
if would bc very difficult ta withdraw without

deavourcd ta show, we had rcached a resting
place in carrying ouf the arrangement with
Washington, for which everyone ivas preparcd.
The nuraber af questians between the two
cauntries is great; but when we go beyand
the United States we get inta positions which
are by no means clear..
With France and Tokio we have close relations, but they are nat the anly countries
of influence with which we have very important relatians, and business of great moment
ta this cauntry, and also, we trust, ta them.
For example, taking the question of trade,
which is about the only one we can cansider,
with the Argentine we do samething like
316,000.000 warth of trade; with Belgium, aver
$21,000,000, with Germany, $31,000,000; with
Holland, 817,000,000; with Italy, 821,000.000;
with France, 828,000,000; and with Japan, 825,Nationals of those countries live in

the questions which may arise are as important
and troublesome as those which may develop
with the two countries to which our diplomatie
service is to be extended.
There is another side of that phase of

ta send representatives.
inay say: "You send to France; you send
across the Pacific; but we are also important.
At the present time Italy is very sensitive of
lier importance, and she may ask, "Why nlot
send a legation to us, and we will send an
envoy extraordinary to you."
Be that as at ina. if I ruay digress for a
moment, it seecms ta me that thils country
could well restore a custom which wvas in
vogue when 1 first began to takc' notice of
polities: it -was then known as giving an account of ones: steward.ship. Many memIbers
of parlianient. and ministers almost without
exception, chose some ooeasian (luring the
recess ta mieet their constituents and tell
them what was going on, and tell them how
the government had deait with particular
questions in one way rather than in another,
if they were supporters of tlic Government,
and generally ta educate the people by informing them at first hand, and in the most
effective way, bsy word of mouth. It is a pity
that that cu-stom bas fallen into disuse. It
mighit ibe well to revive it, and I think that
if there cornes an extension of our diplomatie
ý1er%1ice, there will have to be something
equivalent to the Lord Miayor's banquet in
London at thýý Guildhall, wvhere the Prime Minister of the' day informs the country specially
on its relations wvith other powers. We al
rvmember occasions when that festival was
awaited with the utmost anxiety, t.o know
what Lord Beacon-sfield would say about our
relations with Germany; and wc ahl rememnber the spirited reply that Lloyd George gave
in regard to tihe Agadir crisis when he had ta
deal 'witli that question. Whether that will
be donc or not I do nlot know; but I think
there should be scomething equivalen-t ta that,
beeause the question of dealing wit'h foreign
countries cannot be carried on in the casual
way we have adopted in dealing with aur
awn internaI matters, whieh do not affect tbc
dignity or the action of any one except aurselves.
This ;Vhole question of representaVbion in

APRIL 18, 1928
Behring Sea matter. It was of great importance to Canada and I think there was possihly
some justification for aur feeling that our
interests were not as carefully guarded by
Britaîn as they would have been had it not
bcen an outlying part of the Empire that
was chiefly interested, namely, Canada, and
had the matter concerned more closely the
That was
people of the United Kingdom.
t he momentary aspect of the affairs, but no
one to-day, in looking back at it, feels that it
would have been a proper move for Great
Britain ta press that matter ta such a point
as ta cause strained relations and possihly
hloodshed between lier and the United States.
The long experience of England had given hier
representatives patience, and the thing passed
away and is to-day forgotten.
Another hazaixd ini diplomatie relations is
that publie opinion in a yaung and self-reliant
country tony be unduly aroused. Canada is
young and impulsive; Canada thinks highly,
and rightly so, of what ehe, is. Our representatives and the authorities who lay down the
policy for them wili have ta be careful ta
avoid that zeal against which a great diplomatist, perhaps one of the greatest of the aId
sehool, warned bis younger colleagues as sa
often leading ta disagreements and sometimes te disaster: "Pas trop de zèle, messieurs."
Furthermore, in the appoint-ment of envoya
ta aci outside the hardera of the Empire we
are asserting a formi of national atatus which
1 think ail of us will agree is still 8omnewhat
nebulous: and on the other hand aur dependence on Great Britain may be blazoned ta the
whoie world, whenever this gesture of national
self-sufficieney proves inadequate ta meet ail
the exigencies, or breaks down through iack
of preparation. Suppose samne question arises
in a country where we have no ambassador
or no representative. We have ta fail baek
an Great Britain. Our position is not ta my
mind a dignified one. Great Britain has for
years, gratuitousiy ta us and ta ail the other
Dominians safeguarded aur rights as carefully as those of the people born on hier own
island, and it -seern.s ta me regrettable that the
expenditure which we are making-far these
enterprises wiil be costly-might better be
made dn same way that would relieve the
British taxpayers of burdens whioh they have
carried, partly for the benefit of Canada and
the other 'Dominions, without the leaat contribution on our part.
Such is my protest. Now let me continue
with some suggestions as ta ho~w this extension of embassies and legations shouid be carried on, if it is ta be done.

219

One may pass aver the importance of care
in the sellection of Canadian representatives.
111 it would be for Canada if any Government
which is kept in power by the Canàdian
people did not realize ta the full the importance of appoin.ting men of character, of ability
and tact ta represent this country abroad. An
important question is, what shail be the status
of those representatives of Canada? WÎil they
be trained diplomatists representi-ng the Canadian people, or will they be pexty representatives, changing with every change of Government? Practieaily ail the nations of the
'world believe in being represented abroad by
'a permanent diplomatie body, free of poltical
liias or political attachments aind carrying out
ïm.plicitly the instructions of whatever Government may be in power. The United States
fried for many years the other system, that of
changing diplomatie and consurlar repregentatives with everv change of admninistration.
'They found it did nlot work, and now, with
the exception of somne of the greater embassies, they have a permanent and regular service. 1 understand that the exception with
regard ta the grent embassies is not altogether
unconneeted with internai polities.
Can we find in Canada men who, in taking
positions as our representatives, will look forward to representing their country and nlot
n partv? Such representatives have been
found in other countries, where their personal
character and their training have been reinforced by a great tradition in the service.
Let me eall the attention of the flouse ta
the fact that at the outbreak of the war Great
Britain wvas represented at Berlin and at
Vienna by men whose immediate ancestors
%vere Germans. The Commander-in-Chief of
the British Fleet was Prince Louis of Battenberg, a mediatized German prince. Hie was
revered and loved by the entire personnel of
the Fleet, and had it nlot been that his remaining in eommand would have placed him,
in an ambiguous position which any man of
his standards could not tolerate, hie wouid
have been absoluteiy trusted by the service
which knew him best, and which hie loved.
There are three great instances of what may
corne about if our envoys realize that they
are the embodiment of ail that Canada stands
for in achievemnent, in self-respect, in dignity,
and if they represent the people of this country, whether or not the particular group of
men that Canada has chosen to carry on the
government at a particular moment are personally sympathetic to them or not.
Canada, we helieve, can find sueh men.
Some of them, now in other positions, are
not ill-prepared to hold the position of Can-

SENATE
ada's represontative, and to hold it in accordancc with the standards I have indicated.
Canada cari train such men. On the other
hand, if the diplomatie service is to ho iooked
upon as suqiplementary to the Bench and to
this Bouse, as affording outiets for the rewarding of party services-if the mnillstone of
political partisansbip is to ho fastened on this
now venture that we are making, or may possih]y make, botter it would be that it should

the Minister foi' Foreign Affairs at London,
Sir Austen Chamberlain, we reached the
Japanese Covernment. which was approached
by the Britisli ambaasador at Tokio, and the
decision vasý reaclied which was announced in
the Speech fromn the Throne.
1 believe that the reasons which prompted
the present Government in making those two
creation-s wil1 meet with the aipproval of nmen
who understand, who have some vision, and
who can realize the importance of Canada
playing a decisive role in the maintenance of
ainicable relations on the Pacifie, and in hav~ing proper representation in Europe.
My honoura-ble friend has expressed the
fear that othor countrios would perhaps formulate sonie complaint on account of not
being put on the samne footing as France and
lapan. But t.hose countrios will roadily un(lerstand that Canada is simply devoloping
its service abroad according to its needs.
Those countries may feel out thoir way to
Canada in order to flnd whether wo would be
disposed to have an oxehange of ministers
wit-h them. If may be for this country' its
Government and its Parliament, to decide
what is best to do, and how far we sbould go
in the development of our
own diplomatie
service; but, surely no one wvilýl
have roason
to complain if we maintain tlie British dliplonva-tie service, which is af our disposai
throughout the wvorld.
My honourable friend lias indicated that
diplomatie relations were sometimes hazardous,
and he cited some instances where miniisters
were indiscroot; but 1 amn sure he did not fear
that wo would not be able to breed men of
proper stature for the reprosentation of Canada, because later on, towards the end of his
speech, ho declared that we eould surely flnd
in Canada men of suficient learning and understanding to represent us with dignity abroad.
I know that the honourablo gentleman is flot one
of those who could be accused of a Colonial
inferiority complex.
If is true that Canada
is young and impulsive-I arn using the expression of my honourablo friend-but tomnorrow, if if has not alroady, if will have a
population of ton million, and if my honourable friend will look around lie will find,
basking in the sun of international diplomacy,
some forty nations that are quitte inferior to
Canada in population and in development.
So I arn sure he will realize that Canada
can hold its own in meeting, throughout the
world, peoples who have for a number of years
had representation abroad.
My honourable friend closed his interesting
remarks with questions as to the diplomats
we shaîl have, to represent us-wvhether they
wîil be reared to that career, or whether they

223

will ho party men.

Well, for n number of
yoars wvcshahl of course, have f0 draw upon
our public mon, until we have gradually built
up a diplomatie corps.
My honourable
friend knowvs that; counfries that have been
schooled in diplomacy stili at tirnes use publie
men of high standing, and send thcm abroad,
giving thein the preferenco ovor mon who have
grown up in the service.
As f0 the remuneration antI the training of representatives, 1
may say thaf this matter is the objecf of study
by oui External Affairs officiaIs, and that we
shahl in due time bring f0 PArliament the
resulf of that investigation.
0f course, the
plan will have to ho wvorked ouf mosfly in
conjunction wvith the Civil Service Commission, as some of those officiais will come
undor the jurisdiction of that Commission.
and will have f0 ho classified.
WVe now have
one staff iii Washington; wo will have another
one in Paris, and another in Tokio; so that in
considering the mon who aie f0 enter the
service oif our Extornal Affairs Deparfmenf
we will think of chosing a number of young
mon who will gradually grow in the service.
My idea is thaf wvoshould put the standard
quitte high, and not ho influonced by friendly
contact that one bas, or the pressing demands
thaf one may hear about.
Whon we are
establishing thaf service wve must think of
the youing men wvho will enter that career and
followv it, and who will be callcd lipon. in yoars
f0 comie, to ieprecnt Canada abroad.
I amn
very proîid of my couîntry. and 1 feel thaf we
should put iii contact with outsiders the best
men that we can roar.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
Miglit 1 ask the
hionourable gentleman a question?
His iemarks as f0 permanence wcre put in such
diplomatie language that 1 did not grasp
whothcr lie declared the intention of making
tlic service permanent, or making it one of
change with party changes.
Hon. Mi. DANDURAND:
I can only
speak for mysoîf, because the maffer has not
been discussed; but I xvould feel that mon
who will grow into the service, and who will
ho appointed for service abroad, should meot
with such general approval from the publie
at large thaf whon the wvheel of fortune brings
a different party into power those appointmonts should be respected.

WATERWAYS

REQUEST FOR REPORTS AND MAP

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. REID:
Before the Orders of
the Day are called, I would like to make
one or two requests of the Leader of the
Government. I have received through the
mail, as I think every member of the Senate
has, a copy of the St. Lawrence Waterways
Report. This is a very important and interesting document.
Upon inquiring of the
Assistant Clerk, I find that we are each
entitled to only one copy. I wonder whether
it would be too much to ask that fifty or
sixty additional copies should be given to the
Clerk to be distributed upon request. My
reason for asking this is that I have had one
or two requests for copies from prominent
persons who are interested in this matter.
Mv other request has to do with the map
showing the different parts of the waterways
system. Of course, there is a map in the
report. but it is very small. Would it be
possible to have the Department of Railways
aid Canals prepare a large map, not including
all the little details, so that it would be
possible to sec the whole situation at a
glance?
No deubt such a map will be
tequired before the legislation is finally
pased.

If we had it in one of the Committee

roonis it would be very useful to members of
tic Senaîe, and also to members of the
House of Commons, who are interested in this
inatter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will ask that
100 copies of the report be handed to our

officer in order that those who are deeply
interested in this matter may secure them.

They will not be for general distribution, because many honourable gentlemen no doubt
will be content with one.

APRIL 18, 1928
As to the map, I would remind my honourable friend that it will take some littie time
to prepare it. However, if it has flot already
been done, I will ask the Minister of Railways
and Canais 'to set his staff to work to, enlarge
the small map.
Hon. Mr. REID: I do flot suggest that
it should show ail the minor details. I arn
making this suggestion now because I realize
that the preparation wil take some littie
time.
CHICAGO DRAINAGE CANAL
INQUIRY

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Is the honourable gentleman able to tell us when the precis relating
to the Chicago Drainage Canal, which was
promised some days ago, will be forthcoming?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It should have
reached me in time to lay it on the Table
concurrently with its deposit on the Table of
the other House. I arn under the impression
that it was to be handed to me Wednesday.
I wiIl find out why I have not received it.
TRADE TREATIES
REQUEST FOR COPIES

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable gentleman arrange to have the Treaties
mentioned a few moments ago distributed to
the members? I suppose he is aware that
some members in another place have bitterly
complained because ail these Treaties, which
are very far reaching in their effect upon our
trade, were passed i a very short time without even being distributed. I do not suppose
I need add very much to justify my request,
but I tbink I should say that every one of
those Treaties affects 1,'200 items of our tariff.
We are about to enter into a very important
arrangement with Czechoslovakia which, as
everyhody knows, is very highly industrializpd,
and therefore capable of becoming a very
serions competitor with our national industry.
Further, I think we ought to have information
concerning the actual production and exportation of these various countries to Canada in order that we rnay deal intelligently
with these Treaties.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have already
asked the Department of Finance to furnish.
me with a statement of our commerce with
those various countries, both as to exports
and imports. I do not. know whether the
Treaties with the Baltie States and some of
the Balkan States, or the Treaty with Czechoslovakia, have been printed and distributed.
5c'10-15j

I was informed by a member of the House of
Commons that he had not received them.
Those Treaties, to which we adhere, and
which give us most favoured nation treatment,
were made with those various countries by
Great Britain. I do not know whether I can
secure copies of ail of thema or not. At ail
events I will have a copy which I can lay
on the Table.
My honourable friend has rightly stressed
the importance of the Czechoslovakian Treaty
Practically
in comparison with the others.
ail the other countries are exclusively agricultural, so that we are not in any very great
danger of an invasion of our markets by their
goods. Czechoslovakia, however, is in a different situation, and I will try to obtain a
sufficient number of copies of the Trestyentered into between that country and Great.
Britain to satisfy the demand, or I will asic
that it be printed. If needs be, it could be
printed by the Printing Bureau for next week.
In the case of the other Treaties the essential
clause or clauses will be fouind on the right
hand page.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: For the information of the House, I may say that Bill 201,
respecting the Treaty with Spain contains a
long schedule setting forth the whole Treaty.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But I understand
that is not the case with the other Treaties.
MaY I also ask my honourable friend to
furnish this House with information concerning the tariffs of the other countries i so far
as they relate to our intermediate tariff, whicb
I understand will automnatically be extended
to those countries by the most favoured nation
clause.
It is very easy to understand that
we may receive the bene6it of such tariffs as
wi]l be of absolutely no use to us at ail.
Most nations in Europe are now so protected
that it is almost impossible to penetrate their
markets. My honourable friend knows that
very well. because he has been the first member of the League of Nations to be able to
state proudly for bis Party, flot for thisHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hlon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -that no less than

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes, since the war.
I think the honourable gentleman will bear me

It seems to me that we ougbt to

"And that this House do approve of sanie."

people throughout the world had no idea of

adopted by the Second Opium Conference.
There are some situations which cannot be met
except through a general understanding of all
the nations of the world. Prior te the war
there were occasional congresses or unions of
nations to try to cope with certain plagues.
But the decisions arrived at were not followed
by action, and years would pass before the
nations hit had signed the Convention felt
thit thev should meet again in order to reconcile their differences. On the other hand.
the various Commissions of the League of

On Septenber 22nd, 1925, the present
Speakor, duly authorized, signedl on behalf of
Canada the Convention and Protocol relating
te Dangerous Drugs, adopted by the second
Opium Conference assembied at Geneva on
Nevember 17th, 1924.
The agreements reached by the second
Opium Conference can be summarized as folloxvs:-thie 39 Articles are intended to complete the provisions of the Hague Convention
of 1912, and to bring about a more effective
restriction of the production of narcotics, and
to estaýblish a closer control of international
trade. Provision is made for the establishment of a system of export authorisations and
import certificates, and for the appointment of
a Permanent Central Board for watching the
international trade. The Board will prepare,

APRIL 18, 1928
every year, a report which will be sent to the
contracting parties, and make recommendations. Ail the requirements and f ormalities
provided for by the Opium Convention are
already embodied in our Narcotics Legislation, and the carrying out of the provisions of
this Convention would net in the least increase the charges or expenses already in-~
curred by this Government in conneetion with
the suppression of opium trafflc. Our legisiatien is embodied in Chapter 144, Revised
Statutes of 1927.
The Signatory States recognize their obligathe Hague Convention,
tion under Chap. 1 of 1
to establish sueh contre over opium as would
prevent illicit traffie, and they agree to take
necessary measures, within five years, to prevent the smuggling of opium from constituting
an obstacle to the suppression of the use of
prepared opium in those territeries where such
use is temporarily authorized. The Convention
of 1912 was made applicable te Canada on
December l7th, 1912.
The English and French texts of the above
Convention and Protecol are being submitted
to the Canadian Parliament for ratification.
As I wiIl only suhmit this Convention, I
miight perhaps glance over the report of the
Advisory Committee on the traffic in opium
and other danzerous drugs, which 1 had the
honour to present in December last as iRapporteur to the Council of the League. I do
se mn order that honourable gentlemen may
have an idca of the work whieh is being
carried on by this Advisory Committee on
the traffle in opium. That Cemmittee meets
at regular dates for an examination of the
question cf the illicit trafflo in opium.
The tenth (Extraordinary) Session cf the
Advisory Committee on Traffie in Opium and
Other Dangerous Drugs wvas held at Gen-eva
from September 28th te October 8th, 1927.
Its specifie object was the examinatien of the
question cf the illicit traffie. The Committee
examined the report cf the Cnmmittec- cf
Enquiry on, the Production cf Opium in
Persin, and congratulated that Committee on
its detailed and exhaustive study, at the samne
time thanking the Persian goveriament for
the way in which it had responded te the
suggestions put f orward by the Committee cf
Enquiry. It pointed out, hcwever, that as a
rule any opium expcrted from Persia which
is ne, covered by lirnpert certificates becomes
ab3orbed in the illicit traflic.
I may say, in this connection, that Persia
declared itself ready te proceed te replace
the important crop cf poppies by some other
productive crcp which would be a fair substitute for a living to these whc were developing the poppy production. The Ccmmittee's

M2

efforts have been crcwned with success as regards the general adoption cf the maritime
insurance clause, which is designed te render
more difficult the despatch by sea cf consigniments, cf drugs intended for the illicit
traffic. A large number oif maritime insurance
companies in different countries have accepted
the Committee's recommendations. The Comnmittee at its session examined 83 reports
conýcerning seizures, and aise returns cf illicit
transactions covering tons cf morphine and
diacetylmnorphine in every part cf the world.
lt is largely owing te the work cf the Committee that the actual facts in regard te the
illicit traffic are gradually beco-ming known.
The Comniittee, at its last session, adopted
four rosolutions, whieh may ho examined
summarily.
The Committee desires te draw the special
attention cf the Council te Resclution 1,
passed at the Committee's ninth session. This
resolution is addressed more particularly te
members cf the Council. The Com.mittee
says, ". . . . The entry into force cf the Convention deipends solély on the action taken
by the States Memlbers of the Coun-cil". Accordingly, I recommend this recoliition to the
special attention cf the Goveroiments cf the
States Members cf the Council. A certain
number of Statesl that are members cf the
Counicil 'have te ratify a convention in order
te bring ut into existence, and when I made
that report urging my colleagues oif the cuncîl
te sign in order te give it life I found that
Canada was one cf the laggers-behind. There
need now te be but four signatures added te
those that are there, and I kncw that tho-se
four signatures will be forthcoming with that
cf Canada, if this Chamnber ratifies this Conven-tion.
The Committee requested the Council te
represent te the Govern-ment cf China that it
would prove cf the greatest assistance te the
Committee in its work if it were provided
with a report as te ail important seizures of
narcotie substances effected by the Chinese
maritime customs at the various ports and
stations which are controlled by that service.
Such reports would also help other governments te prevent the illicit expert cf narcotic8
into China.
The third resolution says that in view cf
the large seizures now being effected in several
countries--seizures which in some cases exceed
the volume oif the licit traffic-and the f act
thýat a11 governments do net give precise information as te the manner in which narcotic
substances se seized are deait with, thereby
rendering it difficult te forin an accurate idea
as te the position cf the trafflo, the Committee
requests the Council to be good en-ough te

is there any.thing in this Convention that will
require us to modify our Drugs Act? Honourable gentleman wiil remember that when that
Act was brouglit before this bouse it contained a provision allowing a iaw officer to
enter a private house and searcli without a
warrant, and this H-ouse refused to accept
that provision, and that power wais seriously
curtailed. But is there an.'thing in this
Convention that will interfere at a.1 with our
legislation here in administering the Aot?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: No. I am informed that our resolution goes even a iittle
further than we are obiiged to go under the
Convention.
Hon. Mr. W. B. RIOSS: Then that would
be satisfactory, I noticed in -the newspapers
that Japan has given notice that she is not
coming in unless ail the nations do so. Is
that going to have any effect upon the Convention?

Well,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Advisory Committee, whose Rapporteur I ami
at the Council, met again on the lOth April,
and is now sitting; so my honourable friend
hias to-dýay seen a statement, coming from
the representative of Japan; but this is a
statement made in the course of discussion.
Before they come to a decision and an
agreement there wili lie considerabie arguments pro and con, where everyone tries to
see whether, if hie makes some sacrifice, the
others9 will do likewise.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do 1 understand
froma my honourabie friend that this Conference bas any effcct at ail on our internai
administration of the law concerning drugs?
From his description I understood that it
only referred to the international control of
the sale and purchase of opium.
If my honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend will look at the Blue Book which
lias been distributed, which contains the
Convention, lie will find under article 12 what
are our obligations:
Each Contracting Party shahl require a
separate import authorization to be obtained
for each importation of any of the substances
to which the present Convention appiies.
Suchi authorization shahl state the quantity to
be imported, the namne and address of tlie
importer and the naine and address of the
exporter.
The import authorization shail specify the
period within which the importation must be
effected and may allow the importation in
more than one consignment.

Then, in article 13 hie will find this:
1. Each Contracting Party shall require a
separate export authorization to be obtained
for each exportation of any of the substances
to which the present Convention appiies.

of
Then,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
course there are a number of enactmnents that
cover those two important things-that, Canada will be obliged to watch closely the importation, and see about giving a special
authorization, and likewise for exportation.
These obligations we already have ini our
own law. What is of special interest is the
creation of the Permanent Central Board.
l'le Central Board shall consist of eight
persons who, by their teclinical competence,
impartiality and disinterestedness, wili coinmand general confidence.
The members of the Central Board shahl be
appointed by the Council of the League of
Nations.
The United States of .America and GermanY
shall be invited each to nomînate one person
to participate in these appointments.
The name of Germany is mentioned there
because it waa not in the League at that
tîme. ThenThe niembers of the Central Board shall
not hold any office which puts them in a
position of direct dependence on their Governinents.
The members shall be appointed for a terni
of five years, and they will be eligible for
re-appointment.
Then, as to the duties of -the Central
Board:
1. The Central Board shall continuously
watch the course of the international trade.
If the information at its disposai leads the
Board to conclude that excessive quantities of
any substance covered by the present Convention are accumulating in any country, or that
there is a danger of that country becoming a
centre of the illicit traffic, the Board shall
have the right to ask through the SecretaryGenerai of the League, for explanations fromn
the country in question.
The resolution was agreed to.

Hýon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honour to move:
That a message be sent to the House of

(b) Until a wider market is found for Canadian coal there is little possibility of decreasing cost of production at the mines. The
creation of a market in Ontario cannot be
consummated until freight charges against
Canadian coal are materially reduced.
(c) Under the present limited demand the
mines produce a tonnage very much less than
it is stated they are capable of producing and
it is contended that if a lower freight rate
were made effective the tendency would be to
stimulate distribution whereby full time operation of the mines would be made possible
thereby improving present conditions.
(d) That the reduced rate on coal be a
seasonal one effective in the west during the
late Spring and early summer when railway
equipment is available at its maximum for this
purpose and when during this period the mines
are at their slackest period of operation.
(e) in furtherance of its views respecting
the desirability of encouraging an all Caandian
coal movement the Dominion Fuel Board respectfully requested that the Board of Railway
Commissioners put into effect the lowest possible rate for special movements of Caandian
ceal consistent with economie railway operation, as might be determined by the Commission's own experts.
The majority report of the Board of Railway
Commissioners held that a $7.22 rate was the
out-of-pocket cost of hauling Alberta coal to
Ontario.
A minority report, however, contended that the out-of-pocket cost might be
said to be $6.50 per ton. The Commissioners,
in reporting on the question, point out that
it is impossible to get the exact cost of a
particular movement of railway traffic and that
all >that can be done is to approximate the
cost. The fact that one of the Commissioners
brouglit in a minority report in respect of the
findings bas led to a wide difference of opinion
among the parties interested.
In view of the importance of this question,
ând the fact that the difference of view
expressed in the minority report of the Railway Commissioners has led to a feeling of
dissatisfaction among the interested parties;
in view also of the fact that the Government
and all interested parties are opposed to the
granting of a subsidy for the movement, but
are agreed that the railways be given a reasonable rate which would not prejudicially affect
the rate on any other commodity, in order
effectually to determine the exact facts and
what may or may not be possible, the Minister
recommends that a test movement to determine
a special rate on coal from Alberta points
to Ontario be undertaken under the following
conditions, namely:
(a) That a temporary rate of $6.75 per ton
be established to be effective for not less than
three months in each year during the period
of the test movement.
(b) That the cost of the movement under
consideration be supervised by the Board of
Railway Commissioners of Canada.
(c) That the cost of the movement be carefully checked by representatives selected by
both the coal interests and the railways.
(d) That a detailed report of the representatives checking the cost of this movement
shall be furnished the Board of Railway Commissioners for their consideration and that the
full Board of Railway Commissioners, after
hearing the parties interested, will determine
from the evidence submitted to them what is
a reasonable rate per ton, having in mind all

233

the factors which, in the national interest, may
properly be taken into consideration.
(e) That as the movement is a seasonal one
and for a short period in each year, it is desirable that the test should extend for a period
of three years in order that the Board of
Railway Commissioners may have conclusive
evidence of costs before them to enable them
to give judgment.
(f) That at the end of each seasonal movement and pending a final decision, the Board
of Railway Commissioners be authorized to
name what amount if any over and above the
rate of $6.75 per ton the Board estimates to
be due the railways in the light of the information secured during the season, and to certify
to the Minister of Mines the total sums of
money due to each Railway Company in connection therewith.
The Minister further recommends that inasmuch as it is neressary to protect the railways
froin loss during the period of the test, a vote
be placed in the estimates of the Department
of Mines to cover disbursements which might
accrue to the railways in the interim.
The Comnittee concur in the foregoing recommendations and submit the same for approval.
(Signed) E. J. Lemaire,
Clerk of the Privy Council.
Certified copy of a Report of the Committee
of the Privy Council approved by His
Excellency the Governor General on the
30th March, 1928.
P.C. 539
The Committee of the Privy Council have
had before them a report, dated 29th March,
1928, from the Minister of Mines, submitting
certain recommendations in respect of freight
rates on certain movements of coal mined in
Eastern Canada, which recommendations are
bereinafter set out.
By Order in Council of the 3rd September,
1924 (P.C. 1537), provision was made for the
payment by the Government of Canada to railway companies carrying coal mined in Eastern
Canada of part of the freight charges for
carrying such coal in the effort te extend the
markets for such coal-the freight charges to
the shippers being reduced at least to the
extent of such payments. No reasonable trial
could be had of the effect of Order in Council
P.C. 1537, owing to the fact that it was not
issued until a considerable time after the coal
contracts for the year 1924 were concluded, and
that the vote for moneys to be paid under such
Order in Council expired March 31st, 1925.
Extension of such provision was recommended
by a special Parliamentary Committee in 1926,
and again by the Royal Commission presided
over by Sir Andrew Rae Duncan and appointed
to consider problems affecting the Maritime
Provinces.
By Order in Council of the 13th February,
1926 (P.C. 226), the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada was directed to ascertain
the costs of transportation of coal mined in
Eastern Canada to consuming points in Quebec
.and Ontario at the season of the year when the
water route for the same by way of the River
St. Lawrence is closed to navigation.
The Board of Railway Commissioners for
Canada bas still under consideration the matter
concerning which such Board was to inquire
under Order in Council P.C. 226, awaiting
certain representations and information relative
thereto.

SENATE

234

The Minister is of opinion that with a view
to assisting the enquiry under P.C. 226 above
mentioned into costs of and a reasonable rate
for transportation of Eastern coal, and because
it is desirable that every effort shall be made
to arrive at such costs and rates under al]
practical conditions, and in respect of any
movements which might reasonably offer coinmercial possibility of enlarged and extended
markets for such coal and to afford such
information and to make available data which
can be secured in such manner, test movements
of coal mined in Eastern Canada to points in
the Province of Quebec should be instituted.
As for the temporary rate to be established
for suci test movements it is submitted that
the principal reason for encouraging a movement of coal mined in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick to points in the Province of Quebec
wholly by rail is the desirability of making
possible the continied operation of coal mines
in the winter. It is further submitted that
froin this area there is little probability of
any coal noving wholly by rail to any points
except points in the Province of Quebec.
"tA"
The Minister, therefore, recommends that a
test movement be instituted of shipments of
coal produced in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and transported to consuming points in
the Province of Quebec under the following
conditions, namely:
(a) That a maximum temporary rate of $3.00
per ton be established during the period of the
test movement of coal mined in Nova Seotia
and that a maximum temporary rate of $2.10
ha established duîring the period of the test
inovement of coal nsined in New Brunswick and
transported wholly by rail to points in the
Province of Quebec at such seasons of the year
as in the opinion of the Minister of Mines it is
not practicable to ship coal frein Nova Scotia
to St. Lawrence ports by vessel.
(b) That the cost of flic movement under
consideration be supervised by the Board of
Railway Conmissioners for Canada.
(c) That the cost of the movement be carefully cheked by representatives selected by
both the coal interests and the railways.
(d) That a (letailed report of the representatives cheaking the cost of this novement
shall be furnisled the Board of Railway Conmissioners for their consideration and the full

eost of such inovement under the alternative
conditions specified in the last paragraph of
P.C. 226. and iaving in mind all the factors
which in the national interest mlay properly be
taken into consideration.
(e) The miovement being a seasonal one is
to extend over a period of three years.
(f) Tiat at the end of each financial year,
pending the final decision. tle Board of Railway Coimissioiers be authorized to naime whliat

previous -aar, and to certify to the Ministr
of Mines the total sums of money due to cath
railway Company in connection therewith.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

(g) That such temporary rate be applicable
to coal only -when used as follows:
(1) For industrial and domestie use, but not
for railway or locomotive use.
(2) On contracts made subsequent to above
date.
"B"
The Minister also recommends that test
movements be instituted of shipments of coal
mined in Eastern Canada and carried by vessel
to St. Lawrence ports and thence transhipped
by the railways to points in the Provinces of
Quebec and Ontario, and that a temporary rate
of one-fifth of a cent per ton per mile but not
more than seventy-five cents per ton less than
the rate which would otherwise be applicable
be established for the railway movements from
such St. Lawrence ports, the amount of the
said reduction being payable to the railways
with a view to protecting then from any loss
that may be incurred and that the following
conditions apply to such test movements,
nanely:
(a) That such temporary rate be applicable
to coal only when used as follows:
(1) For domestic and industrial purposes but
not for use on railway locomotives.
(2) On contracts made subsequent to above
date.
(b) That the temporary rate be not applieable to movements of coal to points where in
the opinion of the Minister of Mines, Canadian
eoal already has the advantage in competition
with Anerican coal.
(c) Tiat the cost of the movements under
consideration be supervised by the Board of
Railiway Commissioners for Canada.
(d) That the cost of the movement of this
coal bc carefully checked by representatives
selected by both the coal interests and the
railways.
(e) That a detailed report of the representatives checking the cost of this movement
shall be furnished the Board of Railway Comsmissioners for their consideration and the full
Board of Railway Commissioners, after hearing
tise parties interested, are requested to determine froin the evidence submitted what, in
their opinion, is a reasonable rate per ton,
having in mind all the factors which, in the
national interest, may properly be taken into
consideration.
(f) That it is desirable that the movement
be limited to a period of three years in order
that the Board of Railway Connissioners usay
have a reasonable test of costs before thei to
enable thens to give judgment.
(g) Pending a final decision by the Board of
iailway Comissîcssioners as to what, in their
opinion is a reasonable rate per ton, the Minister recommsends thsat lia e sîauthorized to pay
the railways the difference between the rate
received by the railways hereunder and the
rate otlerwise applicable. such payments to be

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
before the Orders of the Day are called, there
is a matter of some importance to which I
wish to direct the attention of the honourable members of the House, and particularly
the honourable leader on the other side.
Over a year ago I was criticized by some
of my friends in my own province for voting
for expenditures on branch railways in the
western provinces and against similar expenditures in my own. This led me ta ask
f or some information, which I got, with regard to these branch railways in the West,

Hon. Mr. ROSS: The honourable gentleman asked that question last year, and did
not get the information. We will look for
that now.
If the saine operating ratio for the whole
Canadian National Railways for the year 1926,
of 82.5 per cent is applied to thesa earnings,
a net frein operation of $528,995 would be
obtained.
The total costs of construction of these
branches to December 31, 1926, was $13,417,048,
of -%hich $5,030,996 was expended during 1926,
and it is safe to assume haif of this $5,030,996,
or $2,515,498, would not pay interest during the
year 1926. Therefore interest would he paid
in 1926 on $10,901,550, which, if taken at 5 per
cent would create a fixed charge of $545,077.
On the above basis the fixed charges on the
branches in question were $545,077, and the net

Speakinit for myseif, I want lu make a
futhor positive and absolute denial of the

APRIL 19, 1928
implications and suspicions of' the Mail and
Empire.
The report was prepared by the
Advisory Comnmittee, and by the Advisory
Committee alone. That the Government put
upon that committee men who presumably
knew something about power and power
schemes was probably for the same reason
that it puts upon the Railway Commission
men who presumably know something about
railways; but for two of the prominent newspapers of this country to put out an impression
to the public of this and other countries that
the members of the committee were actuated
by motives of private gain, or collusion with
power interests,'is, I think, an action which
is undue, unfair and unwarranted. So far as
I myself am concerned, I cannot add too much
emphasis to my denial of the suspicions and
aspersions which these despatches have cast
upon me as a member of the Advisory Comhnittee, as a member of this honourable body,
and as a private citizen.
Perhaps I may
take some slight comfort from the fact that
this sort of thing seems to be one of the
ordinary penalties of public life.

SANITARY CONVENTION
MOTION

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND rose in accordance
with the following notice:
Consideration of the Message from the House
of Commons requesting the Senate to unite
with that House in the approval of the following Resolution:
That it is expedieht that Parliament do
approve of the International Sanitary Convention and of the Protocol of Signature
signed at Paris on the twenty-first of June,
one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, and
which was signed on behalf of Canada by the
Canadian representative acting under Full
Powers issued by His Majesty;
And that this House do approve of same.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, on May

10th, 1926, the Committee of the Privy Couneil
appointed, as Canada's representative to the
International Sanitary Convention, Dr. .J. A
Amyot, C.M.G., Deputy Minister of Health,
and requested the issue of full powers from
Ris Majesty. The full powers were issued,

and Dr. Amyot signed, on behalf of Canada,
the International Sanitary Convention which
was accepted by the International Sanitary
Conference held at Paris, May 10th to June
21st, 1926.
This Convention contains general provisions
to be observed by the signatories on the appearance of Plague, Cholera, Yellow Fever or
certain other communicable diseases in their
territory, and provides for measures of defence against these diseases. Its chief object
is to govern, with the least possible interference with shipping and transportation,
effective procedure, based on the scientific
knowledge of the times for the prevention of
the entrance and transportation of the great
epidemic diseases, and such others as might
become widely epidemie.
Part I contains general provisions regarding
exchange of information between the signatories as to communicable diseases and prophylactic measures to be taken by their
sanitary services. Article 15 states:
It

rests

with

each

Government . . . . to

determine what procedure is applicable in its
own ports to arrivals from any foreign port,
and in particular, to decide whether, from the
point of view of the procedure to be applied,
a particular foreign port should be considered

as infected.
With regard to merchandise and baggage,
certain measures are referred to, such as disinsectization, deratization, disinfection.
At
ports and marine frontiers, ships infected with
plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus, smallpox, shall undergo medical inspection; the sick
shall be disembarked and isolated; other persons shall be kept under observation for a certain period of time; the parts of the ship
which have been occupied by infected persons
shall be disinfected, etc. At land frontiers of
the contracting states, persons showing symptoms of the above mentioned diseases shall be
retained, and all measures taken by a country
at its land frontiers shall be notified immediately to the interested neighbouring country.
The sanitary control of lakes and of riverways is a matter for special arrangement by the
Governments of countries concerned.
Part II deals with the Suez Canal, the Red
Sea, the Persian Gulf, and pilgrimages from
the north of Port Said to the Hedjez and other
places.
The Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Board of Egypt shall transmit all sanitary
information regarding the conditions of the
Hedjez and other countries through which
the pilgrims pass.
Chapter III of Part Il provides for sanctions against any captain of pilgrim-ships
convicted of having infringed the sanitary re-gulations as set forth in this Convention.

and examining them. They are subjected to
minute examination, and they are quarantined or isolated for that purpose at once;
they are not allowed to circulate with others,
and so on. I imagine that is one of the
modes of putting into execution the provisions of the Protocol. I do not know
whether that satisfies my honourable friend!
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, it does not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, I would
answer generally that all countries which subscribe to this Convention are obliged to attend to the prescriptions of the Convention:
The competent authority shall not permit
the departure of a pilgrim ship until satisfied:
(a) That the ship has been thoroughly

cleaned and, if necessary, disinfected;
(d) That the drinking water on board is of
good quality; that it is in sufficient quantity;
that the tanks for drinking water are safe
from all contamination and so closed that the
water can be supplied only by means of taps
or pumps; water-supply fittings known as
"sucoirs" shall be absolutely prohibited.
Then Article 113 says:
The captain may not start without having
in his possession:
(1) A list countersigned by the competent
authority showing the name and sex of the
pilgrims who have embarked, and the total
number of pilgrims lie is authorized to carry,
etc.
I would say that each country is obliged
to comply with the prescriptions of this act,
and if it appeared that there was any laxity it
would be for the countries surrounding the
delinquent to establish a quarantine around
that whole country in order to protect themselves. I have not gone through it, and I
do not remember that there is any outside
power to use compulsion on any country. I
see here a number of sanctions:
Article 152.-Any captain convicted of a
breach of contract made by him or on his
behalf for the supply of water, food, or fuel
shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 50 gold
francs for each offence.
Article 153.-Any infringement of Article 107
shall be punished by a fine not exceeding 750
gold francs.
Article 154.-Any captain who commits, or
allows to be committed, any fraud with respect
to the list of pilgrims, or of the bill of health,
provided for by Article 113 (1) shall be liable
to a fine not exceeding 1,250 gold francs.
Article 155.-Any ship captain arriving without a sanitary document from the port of
departure, or without its having been countersigned at the ports of call, or unprovided with
the prescribed list, duly kept in accordance
with Articles 113 (1), 125 and 126, shall be
liable in each instance to a fine not exceeding
300 gold francs.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Is it necessary
for us to alter our shipping regulations to
agree with tIhat, and to give to our courts
the necessary powers?

239

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. I have
read the statement from the Department that
this Convention does not contain any new
requirements not already provided for by our
Quarantine Act, Chapter 168 of the Revised
Statutes of 1927. No amendment to our Act
will be necessary, this Act being so flexible
and giving suoh large powers to the Government that any unforeseen case of emergency
could be met by an Order in Council. The
officials of the Health Department do not
think that the putting into force of this Convention would mean any additional charge
or expense.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I now move:
That a Message be sent to the House of
Commons by one of the Clerks at the Table,
to acquaint that House that the Senate doth
unite with the House of Commons in the
approval of the International Sanitary Convention and of the Protocol of Si gnature signed
at Paris on the twenty-first of June, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, and which
was signed, on behalf of Canada, by the Canadian representative acting under Full Powers
issued by His Majesty.

MOTION

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

rose in accord-

ance with the following notice:
Consideration of the Message from the House
of Commons requesting the Senate to unite with
that House in the approval of the following
Resolution:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Slavery Convention signed at
Geneva on the twenty-fifth of September, one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, and
which was signed, on behalf of Canada, by the
Canadian representative duly authorized to that
effect;
And that this House do approve of same.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, on September 25th, 1926, the Right Honourable Sir
George E. Foster, as authorized by an Orderin-Council of August 7th, signed, on behalf of
Canada, the International Convention on
Slavery which was approved by the Seventh
Assembly of the Leagues of Nations.
This Convention contains twelve Articles
which may be summarized as follows:
The Contracting Parties undertake to prevent and to suppress the slave trade and to
bring about the complete abolition of slavery
in all its formas. For this purpose they shall
give to one another all possible assistance
and undertake to prevent compulsory or
forced labour from developing into conditions
analogous to slavery. Disputes arising from

Siavery is defined as beîng the status or
con(dition of a pcrson over whom any or ehl
of the pow'ers attaehing f0 the right of ownership andl exercised. Tire slave trade includes
aIl arts involv-ed in the capture, acquisition
or dir.posal of e person wifh intent f0 reduce
hiim ta slaverv or with a a iew f0 selling or
exchanging him and aIl acts of trade or
transport in slaves.
In some parts of the worid, such as t.he
Central Provinces of thre Soudan, notabiy
Cordofan and Kassala, and in some parts of
India, etc., firere are surviîx mg forms of
slavery, This Convention bas special application to, tirese remote countries and does
neot in\-olve any very direct action on the
part of Canada.
Tire Convention will corne into operation
for eaeh State on the date of the deposit of itýq
ratification or of its accession.
I may say thaý-t slavery, as wveknow it, tends
te, disappear from the face of the earth; but
tirr is stili a form. of slaveryv that meqy ha

H1e said: Honoureble gentlemen, th-is Bill

Indien llead and Brandon, which wcre larger
than the law authorized when first acquired,
*and for the further purpose of permibting the
enlarging of the farms mentàoned as well as

The Experimental Farm. Stations Act, as it

possible, exen thougi additional land might

At prescrnt the only method of acquiring
landl in connection with these farms is by
purchase or transfer of Crown lands, no provision being made for acquisition by gif t or
bec 1uest. An offer bas been made to bequcath
to the Crown, as an addition to the Experi-

mental Farm et Indian Head, a section of
land owned by a Mr. Patterson. Under the
Act as at present constituted the acceptance
of this bequest would not be iegally possible.

The Bill removes any objection that might
interfere with the acceptance of such a beqilest.
1 move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: To which Committee
do you propose to send it?
We could send
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it to Committee of the Whole to-morrow.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: It might be better, I
think, to send it to one of the other Committees.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We will set it
down for Committee of the Whole, say, tomorrow, and I will accommodate my honourable friend if hie desires to make some other
suggestion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved t.he second
reading of Bill 12, an Act to amend the
Dairy Industry Act.
He eaid: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
extendts the regulations as to cheese boxes,
and the methods of making and reinforoing
cheese and butter boxes. The paragraph to
be repeaied reads as follows:
"(j) Prescribing the size and dimensions of
eheese hoops, cheese boxes and butter boxes;
the joinery methods and f astenings of butter
boxes, and the thickness of wood in cheese
boxes and butter boxes."
The proposed changes are shown by the
underlin-ed words in the Bill. The effect of
the Bill is to add joinery methods and fastenings of eheese boxes, and methods of reinforcement of cheese boxes and butter boxes, to
the regulation which may be made by the
Governor la Council under this paragraph.
I am surprised to find thsit thiq regulation
needs any etrengthening, because some years
ago when we had evidenice -that the cheese
boxes needed strengthening. we proceeded silong
that dline. 1 remeusber at that time photographs were brought to us, an, oireullated in
this Chamber, sh-owing an almoet complete
annihilation of cheese boxes landed in ports
in Great Britaun, so anytihing that will help
to strengthen the boxes containing our cheese
going abroad should be weloomed.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does this Bill provide for the appointment of further inspe'otors?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. That maY

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: I understand there
is a scarcity of inspectors throughout the
country.
These regulaHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tions wvou1d need to be controlled later at
our ports, but I suppose that we have already
a sufficient number of inspectors.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Could the honourable
gentleoman tell me how many pounds there
are in a box of cheese?
Perhaps my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend from. Brockville could
answver that question.
Hon. J. WEBSTER: Anywhere from. 85 to
110 or 115 pounds. This Bili arises from the
necessity to have a uniform. thickness of wood
in the containers. The manufacturers are today cutting the boxes so thin, that they will
flot stand any rough ïhandling, and owing to
the condition in which our cheeses arrive at
Liverpool and Glasgow, they are graded as
seconds.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I notice every now and
ag-ain a report stating that so many boxes
of cheese have been shipped, but I neyer
could teli1 how much oheese that meant.
Hon. J. WEBSTER: A 15-inch hoop will
contain about 80 pounds of cheese; a 16-iných
hoop, 14 inches high, will contain anywhere
from 100 ito 110 pouxad-. The rail.way companies average Vhem at about 90 pounds.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But there is no standard
of weight?
Hon. J. WEBSTER: No. Butter is ail
put up in 56-pound boxes.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: A box of cheese may
contain, anything between certain figures?
Hon. J. WEBSTER: Not in the trade. It
depends on, the size of the hoop.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But there is no standard
size?
Hon. J. WEBSTER: No.
The -motion was agreed to, and the Bill
,was read the second time.

SENATE

By section 2 a new provision is intro-duccd
ir. order to add pia.timnm to the articles to
which the Act applies. Another amendment,
section 4, permits the termi 'eplatinum" to be
applied only t.o articles made fromi platinum,
wbich, as is xvefl known, is now more valuabie
th'an gold or silver. Platinum jeweliery bas
becýome very popular. Piati.num is a metailic
element occurring in alluvial deposits or in
rock-forming minerais. It is found principaliy
in the Urai 'Mountains, in Columbia, and in
the United States, where the principal deposits are iocated in Alaska. Lt is aiso found
to a limited extent in other portions of the

r.DANI)IRAND: Wlien the Bill

amencmcnt to the titie as it appeairs in the
Bill, whi.ch Ns"The Preciotis Mctis Act, 1928".
1 xviii inox e that thiis titie be changed to rcad,
"The Prcicous Metaljs Marking Act, 1928."
Io amnnding the Gold and Siiver Marking
Act it lias becn thougbit desirable to give the
Governor Gener-al power to designate the
quanti t y and quaiity of the materials of which
plated or filicci articles shahl ho composed. This
amendment appiies specially to gold plated
and gold filled articles, which are becoming
.ncreasingly popular. 0f recent years articles
witli the tbinnest possible xeneer of gold have
been imported, while Canadian manufaýcturers
xvere endeavouring to huild up a reputation
for their wares by making gold plated articles
wxith a heavicr coating-. Under the present
Act, howcx'er, either the inferior or the better
article can be calied 'gold filied" or "gold
piated". and it is for the purpose of encouraging tbe manufacture in Canada of a better
grade of goods that power is sought to designtte the quantity and quality of godld or
s;Ilver, as the case may be, that must be contained in an -article before it can 'be termed
cither "filled" or "plated."
As to section 4, in addition to the remarks
already made, it may be observed that power
is also sought to prevent any colourable imitation of piatînum to be used in the sale of
platinum goods. This provision carnies out
the same provision as in the present Act in
so far as gold and silver articles are concerned.
It is also intended that the trade mark of a
manufacturer shaîl be appiied to ail articles
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

comning tînder the Act, in order to prohibit
the practice of unscruipulous dealers having
an inferior line made for tbema and applying
ta it a fictitinus trade mark.
A further amendmrent is desired in the Bill
as passed by the House of Commons, and I
will move this amendment in Committee. Il
will read as follows:
Thîis Act sbah corn(, into for-ce on a date
to lie fixed by proclamation of the Governor
in Coinicil publishiel in the Canada Gazette.
When tbe preserit amencîments take effeet
many jeiveilers wihl have in their hands
articles or merchandise whicb may be marked
ccntrary to the amended sections of the Act
deahing- with phatinum articles. The Retail
Merchants' Association of Canada are of
opinion that at heast one year shouhd be
gr-anted before making this Act effective.
Honce tlie amendment which I wilh submit
tr. tbis Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DAN_ýIEL:
I notice that there
are at the presont tinte a great many atce
ailvertised as 'whbite gohd", and thoe seems
to ho a good deal of confusion as to the
composition of this article, whatever il is.
The oxpliaaory note refers to it, mentioning
(lie objections wbich. are generaihy made to
the termi "white gold' having no definite
construction; but I do not sec that bbe
change made by new section 12A eliminates
the termi -white gohd" or defines in any way
its comuposition, to show wbether it is
phatinum, or contains only a portion of
platinum, or is composed of some ahloy of
phatinum and gohd. The amendment appears
to me very indefinite witb regard to that
particuhar article. The note says:
The devehopinent of whlite gold bas proceeded
to sncb an extent tat
only- an expert can
decide vhîether an article is made of an ailoy
or of phatimni; it offers great opportunities
for deception. France. Switzerhaiid and Austria
hiave ndopted legisiation reguiating a standard
for platinum on the sainîe basis as requcsted by
tlîe Canaclian Trahe.
Now, 1 do flot see that tbis nexv Bill affects
that malter in any respect.
It speaks of
platinum, but does not give any recognition
to the termi "white gold", or explain wbat it
n)eans or how il is 10 be constnucted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perbaps bbe
detinition of "phabinum" wouhd exclude the
use of the expression "white gold".
But
when we come to the committee stage 1 wihl
endeavoun to give my honourable friend
exact information.
The motion was agreed bo, and the Bill ias

Those would be the places
wvbere the Battie of the Plains of Abraham and
thc Battle of the Ste. Foy Road wcre iought,
the one in September, 1759, and the other in

That is, it refers, as far

Hon: J. S. MeLENNAN:
Honourable
gentlemen, I arn fully in sympathy with tbe
restoration and the preservation of our bistorical sites.
From the information we have
had it looks as if $75,000 a year werc a considerable amount of muney. I have previously
callcd the attention oi the bouse to the fact
tbat in Cape Breton we have the site of
Louisburg, in its time more important
than Quebec in the relations between the
France and the England of those days,
and in the relations with the New England
colonies.
It was not until Louisburg was capturcd that an attack on Quebec could have
heeti carried on with any hope of success. In
other words, lthe conmmand of the sea wbich
that port gave the Frencbi was of enormous
a(Itantage in blat; strugglc.
Pract icallv nuthing bas heen (lune to preserx e I be many
m-iks of thc Frech occupation, and thcy arc
gradîîallY hcing ohliterated.
Anyone concerned with historical questions. or ivitb kccpîng alive thle spirit of wvhat wc uwe to our forebears, should h!ive an interc4t in commemurating the remarkable success tbat those Frencli
colonists, only 2,000 in number, bad in compet ilion witlh a mucli more populous ani enterprising people, tbe New Enland culonists.
Deeds of bravery on sea and land, equal ta
those of Quebec and equal on both sides,
were performed there.
The land at Louisburg is partly owned by
the Gox crament and in an extraordinarily easy
state for purposes of cummemoration, uwing tu
the v'ast number of maps and su an wvbicb bave
been preserved, and certain works tbere whicb
would miake a vivid piclure af what the town
wvas in tbe old days.
I am not speaking of
flui acquiring of any land wbiclb oughit to bc
acquired, but I should say Ibat 'two or three
years of tbe Quebec allowance, somcthing between ,200,000 and $400,000, would make
Louisburg une of the must picturesque and intercsting places to visit that anyone could
cunceix'e of, and 1 would trust ta the agcncy
of the Government that may be dune.
Al
that has been dune yet is ta mark certain sites
with rernembrance tablets.
I tbink this is
absolutely inadequate tu the importance of aIl

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Hunourable gentlemen, my honourable fricnd has cuvered this
whole ground very well; but I wauld add that
I du nut think there is a mure epic spot in
Canada than LuNburg. It w'as the centre oi
the fighiting for a long time; it wvas captured
aiîd rccapturcd seven or eight times, I tbink,
The story connected wiib Louisburg: is une of
extreme romance, and I tbink tbe suggestion
of iny honourable friend is quite in hune with
our developmcnt oi archives during the last

commemurating the decds of pioneers. During tbe past ten or twelve years there has

each year either through serial bond issues
or otherwise.
(4) By arranging the maturity dates of
refunding issues so as 10 have aI least a
reasonable amount of the boans maturing each
year, and retire these in whole or in part
from surplus revenues.

(1) Sinking

Funds:

If this plan were applied to the Dominion
Public DebI, it would be a huge undertaking
involving considerable administration and
other expenses.
If a sinking fund of $25,000,000 per annum
were established on a 4* te 4j per cent basis,
the total outstanding indebterdness would be
retire-d in a period of thirty-eight ye-ars. I
connection with the establishment cf such a
sinking fund, there would be a large annual
charge due to the cost of management of
the fund. and in addition the brokerage and
commission charges.
At the present time boans outstanding in
England amount to sixty-four million pounds
odd, fifty-twe million pounds odd of this
amount carry sinking funds which amount to
£9,700,000. The cost of handling these sinking
funds amounted to, during the fiscal year
just ended, $8,700 for brokerage and commission charges.
If sinking funds were established for all our
outstanding issues on the above basis in order
to contribute $25,000,000 per annum, the
annuel charge would be $62,000 for the first
yeur, and increese each year 10 an approximete maximum cost of $275,000, or a total
cost of say $5,000,000 for the whole period,
10 cover brokerage and commission charges,
the charges of management expenses being
additional to this amount.,
(2) Instalment Annuity Plan:
This plan would accomplish the same
result as sinking funds without involving the

245

expenseýs attached thereto. Due to the large
amount i.nvolved in such a seheme, it would
be rather a complicated method to work out
and apply to our refunding issues.
Both Nos. 1 and 2 would involve maintaining Public Debt charges for interest and
retirement at a fixed amount during the whole
period. There would 'be little hope for any
relief through debt retirement until the
scheme was completed.
(3) Retirement of a fixed amount of debt
ecl year either through serial bond issues
or otberwise:
This would have the effect of reducing the
annual interest charges and relieving the taxpayer to that extent, and the retirement could
he effected through paying off at least a
portion of boans which mature each year.
With reg-ard to ail three of these plans. the
fixing of the amount to be retired each year
without regard to what revenues may yield
is not desirable. Dominion revenues show
pronounced expansions and contractions corresponding to the flucuations in business conditions within and without the Dominion, and
it is quite possible for revenues to contract as
much and even more than $50,000,000 in one
year. This leads to the conclusion that it
would be rather difficult to maintain revenues
at such a level as to ensure in each year
sufficient surplus to ineet stated fixed retirements.
(4) By arranging the maturity dates of
future refunding issues so as to have at least
a reasonable amount of boans maturing each
year.
Under Ibis scheme the amount of debt to
be retired each year would depend on the
surplus available for such purposes.
During the period since 1923, we have
redeeed outstanding bonds amounting to
$134,700,000, made up as follows:
1925-26 bonds redeemed.. .. ... S 20,000,000
43000,000
....
1926-27 bonds redeemed ....
55,505,650
1927-28 bonds redeemed.. .. ....
Sinking Funds and miscellaneous
16,201,312
..........
retirements ....
$134,700,000
(odd)
in excess of

or in round figures slightly
225,000,000 per annum.
From the year 1929 to 1932 inclusive, there
ire boans maîuring amounting to three
bundred and twventy-nine million dollars odd,
and in 1933 and 1934 there are boans maturIn future refunding
ing 10 $980,000,000.
i&,ues il would be a simple malter to arrange
to bave a stated amount maturing eacb year,
enabling the maturing amount each year to

246

SENATE

bc taken up ont of surplus revenues or whatever ameount wais flot taken up te be refunded.
As those amountýs are paid off each year it
would irmcdiatoly reduce the charges for
interest on Publie Deht, and leave the saving
of ineonst available for other Government
expenditures.
Ail flotations during the War period at high
rates of interc'st xviii mature within the next
niine years, and there will ho, an oppertunity
of flnancing at much lower rates of interest,
thus redueing the present annual charge to
interest on Public Dcbt.
If the prescrit outstanding issues were ail
refunded in the next nine years at 44L per
cents hasis without taking into account
retirements, it would mean an annual saving
of something over $18.000,000 per annum.
The latter scemi' is the same as has been
fellowed cluring the last fexv years.
The
length cf time taken to redeem the present
outstanding deht weuld dc'pend altogether on
the aiount it would ho posible teo retire
ccb vear, and would ne doubt take inucbi
longer than under a sinking fund hasis; but,
as prex-iotisly stated, the annual interest

a matter thai I would leave experts te, grapple
with. I may be able ta obtain information
as to the manner in which the most advanced countries in that regard are proceeding, but I believe there is no principle ta be
bound in their methodse, that they vary secording ta their capacity tao pay now or within a reasonable time.
If other honourable gentlemen desire ta ask
any question, I would request them ta do
s0 naw, and I will postpane the second reading of the Bill until Tuesday next in order
that any information which they desire may
be obtained from the Finance Department.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I notice that the Bill
authorizes the Finance Minister ta withdraw
from circulation from. time ta time unmatured
securities of Canada. Is it the intention of
the Government ta cali in their unmatured
bonds and things of that kind, and if so, in
whst manner and on what terms? Is it the
intention simply ta compel the halders of
those bonds ta turn them in?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. I can
very easily answer that. This would authorize
the Department of Finance ta purchase bonds
that offer, either directly or indirectly, but
there can be no compulsion whatever. People
who hold the bonds of Canada, payable at
a certain date, are entitled ta retain them till
that date. As my honourable friend knows,
however, there are always some of these bonds
that are floating, sa ta speak, and it is for the
Department of Finance ta use its best judgment from day ta day in the matter of Purchasing such bonds.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: I do not
want my honourable friend ta think from anything I have said that I want him ta hold
this Bill over. I would like ta point out,
however, that for many years I have advocated the setting aside af a smail sinking fund
in order ta retire the bulk af the debt, the
part attributable ta the war, for instance.
That would be sound finance, and I do not
know of any other country that does nat proceed in that way. One per cent of two
billion dollars would be 820,000,000 a yearthat might be too much-or half af one per
cent would be $10),000.000 a year. Mathematicians could easily tell what that would amount
ta at interest in the course ai a certain number af years. We would want flrst to decide
what we could afford ta set aside, and then
ta see what it would caver. I really think,
in view af the democratic form. af governmnent
that we have in this country, and in view af
the changes af government from time ta timle,

247

there cught to be a defi.nite plan for retiring
that portion of the debt attributable to the
war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have just now
given the opinion of the Department af Finance as at present constituted against that
rigid form of a flxed sinking fund. The arguments will be f ound on Hansard. That is
why I suggest ta my honourable friend, if he
holds very strong views on this question, that
he give us the benefit of his views after
examining the reasons that have been advanced.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Can my hanourable friend tell me in a few words whet is
the principle of the objections?
Hon. Mr. DANDU7RAND: It is the rapid
expansion of the revenues of this country, and,
unfortunately, tihe equnlly rapid contraction,
due to eoonomic conditions that sometimes
have their source outeide of this oountry. We
eli know that when depyression sweeps over
our neighbour ta, the south in any accentuated
f orm we are apt to be carried downward by
the wave. As I was following the arguments
of the Depax'tment of Finance, they seemed
ta, me mocst patent against the sinking fundl
ides, which would bind this country ta a fixed
amount. The amount of $W0,000,000 seems too
large ta my honourable friiend. It was being
diËcuased from the angle of $25,000,000 a year.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: 1 didn't know
that.
Hlon. Mr. HUJGUES: Would flo the establishment of a sinlcing fund ta take care of the
war debt be equivalent to the Government
lending money ta itself? What- advantage
could possible be gained by -it? To take care
of -an obligation of that sort is en'tirely different, I think, from taking care of obligatuions
that have been in'curred for ordinary works.
If, for instance, the Government undertakes
ta build a work -of importance that will lst
f or a considerable number of years, and issues
bonds against that work to establish a sinking
fund that would take care af tihe bonds at
maturdty, when the adva.nt-ages of the work
would be available, that would be an ordinary butsiness transaction; but as I see it the
debt that has been incurred by Canada for
war purposes is in an entirely different category. If the Government can save money ta
establish a sinking fund, why not wipe out
that much of the debt and be done with it at
once? 'What possible advantsge could be
gained by egtablishing a sinking fund?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: They can do as
corporations do, îo.nd buy uip their bond,-.

248

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It is for an entirely
different purpose, as I have tried to explain.
Hon. Mr. STANFýIIELD: I think the lionourable gentleman rniundcr..tands nie. ln the
papcrs you will quite frccjuently notice corporations sdvertising that they have so much
money to cxpend to buy up bonds. Instead of
putt.irg their sinking fund at interest they eaul
for tho..e bonds and boy thero and retire thorm.
That is what the Government should do.

Government, which has to take upon its
shoulders everything in connection with the
revenue of the country.
Now, we have another way of revising the
tariff which has come about in very modern
times indeed. We have these favoured nation
treaties that Great Britain bas made with
many other nations of the world, and every
now and then some new nation is brought in
and is given some preference in our markets
because of these favoured-nation treaties of
Great Britain. What our fiscal system in
Canada bas ta do with the favoured nation
arrangements that Great Britain may have
with other countries I have never been able ta understand, and I do not understand taday. We are an autonomous country and are
supposed to be, in respect ta these matters,
quite independent of the Mother Country,
and she does not attempt ta dictate to us;
but we have that way of coming under, and
the privileges that we extend under those
favoured nation treaties ta certain countries
are what is known as our intermediate tarif.
The intermediate tarif was adopted in our
Customs Tarif after 1896 and lay dormant for
practica'lly a quarter of a century, until very
recently. There were three columns in the
tarif: the preferential tarif towards Great
Britain, the intermediate tarif, and the
general tarif. Then these countries come in,
and, for some reason or other, the favour of
the intermediate tarif is extended ta them.
Thereby, so far as the particular country which
is favoured is concerned, we find when we
wake up some morning that our tarif bas
been reduced half-way, or two-thirds of the
way, between our general tarif and the
British preferential tariff.
Another way we have of regulating our
tarif is also a very -modern one, and that is
by what are termed trade agreemRents. We
usually extend ta the countries with which we
make such agreements either our intermediate
tarif or our treaty tarif. By the way, I should
have said that we have four tarifs: in addition
ta the preferentia-l arrangement with Great
Britain and the intermediate and the general
tariffs, we have the treaty tariff. This originated in our treaty with France. Some of the
countries te which I refer obtain advantages
under the treaty with France, and some of
the rates under the French tarif are lower
than those of the intermediate tariff, and
others are the same.
Another sort of tariff arrangement is that
of the direct treaty. We sit down in great
solemnity with representatives of other nations
and Canada makes a treaty with regard to
advantageous trade conditions, so-called. Such

249

treaties, like the trade agreements ta which
I have referred, carry sometimes the advantages of the French tariff, sometimes those
of the intermediate tariff.
Then we have another way: by Order in
Council the Government have taken power,
and have power, ta extend the intermediate
tariff at any time ta any nation whom they
may select.
Sa we have all these ways of regulating
our tariff, although we have now ta consider
solennly a Bill which is called and will be
looked upon as a real revision of the tariff.
Now, I would like ta ask the honourable
leader of the House a few questions. I have
been wondering what sort of tangle this dear
old Canada of ours has got herself into, with
all these various agreements in various forms.
I shall be told, I am sure, that we have the
power ta cancel any of these agreements at
any time we wish, on six months' or a year's
notice, or something of that kind. I need nat
point out-because it is obvious, and experience tells us-that when you change your
mind and present ta a country a request for
the cancellation of a treaty of that kind you
leave rather a nasty impression on the minds
of the people of that country. It is not so
easy afterwards ta negotiate with them in
any respect. Therefore I think aur hands
are pretty well tied up, and I am very sorry
for what bas been done with respect ta the
fiscal system of this country. I think it is
going ta be very serious for Canada, and I
do not think it ever should have been dono.
The question one might ask the honourable
leader of the House ta-day is this: ta how
many countries have we bound ourselves in
this way? But it would be an easier question
for him ta answer if it were put in this way:
What nations of the world are left,-after all
the Bills that have been passed and the sheaf
of Bills that are coming before us, how many
countries of the world are there as ta which
we are not bound hand and foot in our fiscal
policy and our tariff? Nearly all the countries of Europe are included now, and I am
told that the Government's fingers are just
itching ta draw up a treaty with Germany,
whereby we may give Germany some great
reduction in our tariff in favour of her goods
and other nations who may enter into agreements with us.
What does it all mean? We heard yesterday of a statement which had been made by
the honourable leader of the House-I do
net wish ta charge him with it, for it was
said ta have been made elsewhere-to the
effect that Canada had reduced her tariff
three times since the war. Did my honourable friend say that?

these figures on the authority of a most
eminent financial ma.n in this country. Before
the war the United States had invested in
Canada $500,000,000, and now the United
country
invested in this
States ha.s
83,500,000,000. That money has gone into
many different things, and it bas helped to
keep business going. If it had been twice
as much it would have helped so much more.
It has gone into industries and into skyscrapers and other buildings, and a.ll sorts of
things. Canadian citizens and corporations
before the war owned, in federal, provincial
and municipal securities, 8320,000,000, and
now Canadian citizens have 82,900,000,000.
AlI this is invested in what are termed
trustee securities, federal, provincial and municipal.

search in order ta obtain these figures, but I
give them on the 'best authority. I have no
doubft the figures are correct.
Now, we have t.oo mueh money invested in
that kind of seourity in Canada. We want
more money invested in industrial and other
enterprises. There is money available if thîs
Government, or any other Government, will
have the courage to do what the Canadian
people are bound to approve of, namely, study
the tariff and make a tariff suitable ta this
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the honurable gentleman stated in what that amount
of $3,500,000 of American money bas been
invested?
Hlon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: No, I could
not give that information. The moncy has
gone into various enterprises. Some of it lias
been invested in buildinýgs; a great deal of it
went into mining.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Industries?
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Perbaps some,
yes, but there is not very much development
in industries going on in this country, I regret
ta say. I was juat coming ta that matter
when my honourable friend spoke. 1 want
to say, seriously and firmly, that the action
of the Government and its many ways of

interf ering with the tariff by keePing a Tariff
Board eontinually operating, day in and day
out, adi the year round, has had a very discouraging effeet on capital. The Government
are flot doing, for instance, as Sir Wilfrid
Laurier's Government did: they do not go at'
the tariff, investigate it, settie it for a certain
period, and leave it alone. Hearings are conducted every day, and every hour. Then there
are these trade treaties. You have capital iso
badly fright-ened that it will no longer venture
into any big industrial enterprise in Vhis
country.
Just think of where we stand. Sixty-seven
per cent of the products that are oonsumed
in the United States are made in factories in
Will it astonish this House
that country.
when I say that only 27 per cent of the
faetory products that we use are made in
Canada? So you see the tremendous field
there is. You want to bring to your help in
this country the enterprise and the courage
of every man who is wîlling to take a little
risk in enga.ging in industry and investing his
own money in it. To-day he is frîghtened
out of lis life, and his money is frightened
away. You cannot get development in industry in this country unless you stop this
treaty business, and unless you stop revising
the tariff every day of Vhe year, and ail the
time, or threatening people with that sort of
thing. The people of this country are a common-sense lot of people. What they want is
to be told the truth.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 do not know if
1 might dare to ask the honourable gentleman a question.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Oh, yes: I
would be delighted.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, at the Winnipeg iConvention, one of the standard clauses
was to change the time and conditions required.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Indeed. 1
arn glad that my honourable friend took such
an interest in the Winnipeg Convention. It
is very refreshing to know that it created
such interest, but 1 arn not sure that it is
necessary for me to start on an argument on
that particular point. It is there.
Hon. Mr. CASiGRAIN: 0f course, the
word protection was neyer mentioned.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP. Oh, indeed;
is that so? I had not myself remembered
that, and I was there. What is happening is
that the United States have put on the free
list flot our products but Canadian citizens,
like my honourable friend. They are on the free

SENATE
list; but the United States have restrictcd the
entry into their country ef our products, and
bey, are laughing up their sleeves at us. I
have heard some of the best men over there
say, "Oh, you are a funny people." They put
ilheir tariff so high that we cannot send any
of our products over there. even wheat. They
had 30 cents on wheat, and they were net
satisfied with that; and their tariff system is
soe lastic that they wvent to Mr. Coolidge
and wanted him te increase the tariff, which
is new 4212 cents per bushel on wheat. They

have power to increase the duty. They neyer
lower it, thev have always raised it.

Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Now that my
honourable friend bais interrupted me I want
to go baek a littie. I want to ask him when
he spcaks of the United States, what advantage the United States get for their products
similar to, those that we ship in those countries to which we have given favours in our

us? We lower our tariff, and we make treaties,
and the United States gets into those markets
on just as favourable rates as we do, and we

good many members on both sides of this
Ilouse are not satisfied that any reduction
in the tariff is conducive to the welfare of
this country.
The honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Sr Edward Kemp) wisely said tînt the
terrible scourge of this country, that has been
increasing from year to year, and especially
within the iast five years, is intimately connected with the fact that industry in this country is insufficiently protected. Does the honourable leader of this House know that according to statistics published by his own Government, the population of Canada from 1921 to
1926 only increased by 600,000, whereas the
natural increase would give no less than 900,000. not to mention over half a million imniuints receiverd during that time.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They cost us money
though.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, after stock taking made by the Government in 1926, the statement was made that we
had lost every immigrant that had come to
this countrv within the last five years-to be
exact 540.000. They have come, they have
looked at the country and they have gone.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And we are well rid
of them too.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Not only that, but
50 per cent of our own ohildren have followed
them. Fifty per cent of the natural increase
of this country has gone along with those immigrants, and the Government of this country
has no misgivings as to the cause. Only last
year every speech that was pronounced at the
time of the Jubilee of Confederation rang
with marvellous phrases of the bea.uty, grandeur. and unlimited riches of this country;
but still it cannot hold our own ohildren who
are tied to the soil, not only by their share
of that patrimony, but by every fibre of
their heart. They are gone, and the Government has no idea of the cause of their
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP.

departure, which is simply because they have
no work at home. There is no use looking
for any other cause: we know that is the
truth. Yet a Bill comes down to eut still
more the work that our children could have
at home, and no explanation is given.
Perhaps we might come to the conclusion
that there is no explanation to be given to
tlis House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the honourable gentleman just one question: is thio

This Bill has

That

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wili my honourable friend permit me to put a question to
Iim? The trend of his argument is that he
apparently wants to raise the tariff rather than
redune it, and he says this Bill has for its
object the reducing of the tariff. Well, if
that is so, I challenge him or any other member of this Chamber to move an amendment
to increase the tariff or any item of it. My
honourable friend knows very well that the
'Constitution precludes the Senate from initiating any legislation which would create a
charge on the Treasury or the nation, so that
this Bill cannot be amended by the Senate.
It an be rejected.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: So we have come
to this now, honouraible gentlemen, that the
Government pleads absence of jurisdiction.

APRIL 19, 1928
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do neît know
whethar my colleagues hold my opinion or
net on the subject, but it seems te me that
we canuot afford te pass. this Bill without
a tittle of information. Suraly, if thare
is ne defence of this measura there muet ba
sorma explanatiion, andl fer my part I would
suggest that this Bill ha sent te eue of the
select Comnmittees of the Senate, whare wa
should have the experts of the Government
coma hefora us and show that this measura ie
justifiahle. Then wa wouid hava some sort
of r-videnca te go on, andl .might then ha prapared te accept it. But te ask this House
te aocapt it bliudly, without oe word of
explanation-Nýay! with the acknowladgment
that ne explanation can ha givan-is, it seame
te me, honourahie gentleman, something that
we cannot accept.
The Government has two, methods of cutting
the tariff. First of ail, there is the rnetlhod
of making a great displey bafore the Tariff
Commission of this 'country, and the newspapers taiiing us that a petition bas hen
presented hy such and su'ch an iniduetry, and
then entertaining us wiçth news items stating
that the Commission bas taken the matter
undar consideration; and fln'ally, I suppose,
hy em.hodying in a measure the conclusions
of the Commission. But the Govarnmant has
another method which is very much more
effective. It simply extends te oe country
after another the most favoured nation clause,
which is the tariff of France. Now we are
about te extend it te tihe rest of Europe,
therehy cutting the duty on ne less than
1,200 items of our tariff. At oe fell swoop
off goas the top layer of our tariff walî, and
the wh.ole of Europe is invited te coma aloug
and get over the waii and ehara with us
whatever rernains of our market.
Just banc may I digrass for a moment and
ask whathen these traaty Bills could net aise
ha sent to the samae Select Committee?
Could we net final eut, for instance, te what
extent the Traaty with Czechoslovakia is
geing te affect the industries of this country?
Could wva net have iha experts of the
Governinent coma d-own and try te convince
us of the merits of these measures? If
that is net donc, for my part I do net see
how I could conscientiously vote fer such
measuras biindfolded.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman advocated the Treaty wit-h France
a short time ago. Ail these things were in
that Treaty.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: When the Treaty
with France cama before the House I studied

255

it wîth a great deal of care, and I told the
Government then that I was flot at ail satisfied that the stop proposed was a wise ene for
Canada. If my honouraible friend will look
up my speech at that time ha will see that
such has been my attitude. But thère is one
thing the honourabie gentleman has forgotten.
Ha has forgotten that the Hon. Mr. Fielding
and the Hon. Mr. Lapointe went to France
and camped there for no less than four
months, and asked France to give a quid pro
quo for evary reduction that was made in
our tariff.
But what has the Goverument donc sinca
fighting for and ohtaining what they said
was a fair axchange for every advantaga given
to France? They have said to o-ther countries, lika Italy, "Will you giva us the hast
you have for the hast wa have?" and thay
have exchanged hlindfoidediy. Honourahia
gentlemen can readily undarstand that the
hast that soe otthar country eau give us may
ha of no use to us at ail. Thare ara countries
whosa tariffs are so high that we can neyer
expeet ta get oer tham. The Govarnmaut
has dona tha saine thing holus holus, with Balgium, and with Switzarland, practically a fraa
trada country, which can therefora giva uothmng in exehanga. And new wa are going te
do the sama t-hing with the rest of Europe.
The resuit will ha that wa will hava no
more general tariff at ail: our tariff wil
hagin net at the intarmediate tariff, but at
the Franch tariff, which is lower. How our industry will fara under this new treatinant I
cannot say, but I am extramely anxious te
know. Therafora, I would suggest that ail
thase Bis ha sent to a Ceminittea; than, if
thay hava any menit, I hava ne doubit that
the majority of this Housa will accapt them

making a speech on this subject; I wish te
make only a few short ramarks. I noticad
that the genial Leader of the Gevernment,
whe neyver is indignant except histrionically,
challenged the right of the last speaker te
eriticize or debate the question which is hafore the Houee.

SENATE
Will my honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend allow me to correct him? I
would be the last man to criticize anyone
for offering criticism. It is the full right of
every member to do so. In fact, when I
took the leadership of the Government in
the Senate, I invited criticism, and I still
invite it. My only point was that this Bill
could not be amended by this Chamber: it
could only be accepted or rejected.
I have
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not the slightest doubt that the honourable
gentleman speaks sincerely. As I say, his
indignation on these questions is always simulated. His remarks were made in the form
in which they were to daunt the honourable
gentleman and to make him cease firing.
But he admits, as we all know. that the
only penalty with which the Senate is threatened, but never visited, when it opposes
anything the Government suggests, is that
"we will abolish you;" and I would not for
a moment argue to this assembly our right
to throw this Bill into the discard, because
evervbody knows that we can do so.
I agree entirely with the, last speaker (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) that this Bill should be sent
to a Committee. Our duty is to pass on this
Bill, not blindly, and not in ignorance; and
we would be stultifying ourselves if we passed
on it without knowing not only its contents
but the effect which it will have upon the
country, whether for good or for bad. Therefore, we must surely inform ourselves on a
Bill of such great importance. That being
so, I would support with all my heart a
motion te refer it to a Committee.
The honourable member from Toronto
(lon. Sir Edward Kemp), in the course of
his excellent address, stated that the people
are afraid, are nervous, are unhappy at the
catch-ns-catch-can policy which the 'Government bas adopted on tariff questions ever
since it came into power. I would point out
to this House that you cannot take up a

Hamilton several of the most important industries have changed in the last two years.
Only last week I had an interview with a

and who informed me that his company was

earth possesses yeu to put that great industry
into that position? You are doing exactly
what our neighbours are doing." "Well," he
said, "we are afraid." We consider our great
responsibility, and the risk that we run in

carrying on this industry is too great. We
propose to let the publie have part of it. You
do not know the anxiety of any person who
has an important industry which is subject
to an attack by Parliament, and we feel that
we are carrying too much, and that by reincorporating-selling
preferred
stock
or
bonds-we can go on and manage the industry without having such an enormous
stake in it as we now have."
I know from conversations which I have
had with many people in industries in this
country that that is the reason actuating
them: they are afraid that this constant
tinkering with the tariff will endanger the
stability and the future .of these industries,
which have been built up under a protective
tariff, and they do not propose to carry the
whole burden any longer. I am saying this
not for any political effect, for I have no desire
to make any, and I have no expectation that
J will do any good, but I am saying it in
the absolute belief that it is true, and with
the knowledge that these people are speaking
with perfect sincerity and that the reason
which I have given to you is the true reason
why they are changing their ownership.
Now, we have a Tariff Board, and I am
not at all sure that their reoommendations
have been accepted by the Government. I
know nothing about that; but if I may b"
pernitted, I would suggest that that Board
bas been proceeding on a wrong practice. The
revision of the tariff is not a matter of sentiment; it is not a matter for rhetoric: it is a
pure business proposition; and to allow people
to a'ppear before that Board and make stump
speeches about capital and labour and the
abuse of grinding monopolies is all beside
the question.
The only things that that
Tariff Board should consider are facts, and
every person who appears before it should
have a brief, stating in plain, unvarnished
language the reason why, from an economie
and commercial point of view, he wants
changes to be made. That is the way it is
done in the United States by those who appear before the CQmmittee in Washington.
The cases are prepared with the greatest precision. The arguments made are based entirely upon reasoning on the subject under
consideration, and, as I say, the Board do
not spend their time listening to fine speeches
and rhetorie and abuse of "grinding monopolists" and all that sort of thing. Until the
same sort of procedure is adopted our Board
will continue to listen to facts bundled in
and mixed up with fiction and will never
come to any proper results or get a proper
outlook on what should be done for the benefit
of this country.

APRTh 19, 1M2
It is quite certain that the greatest anxiety
and nervousness prevail among ail the mercantile classes in this country, and it is a
crying shame that the Government of Canada
shauld be carried on in this way. People
should. know exactly whcre Vhcy stand. The
Government should put f orward crystallizcd
propositions and let the people knaw their
position. One day it is anc thing, another
day another thing, and matters are put off
or postponcd. And I may say that I do not
thin.k this Government has been alane guilty
of infractions af the proper rule: I think that
for years we have had an unsteady and iiidirected movement in the revisian of our
tarif!.
Han. JOHN LEWIS: Honaurable gentlemen, I would like to say a few words -on the
constitutional question, or what may be
called a question af pracedure, alluded ta by
the honourable member for Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) and the honourable member
fromn Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton).
I sympathize with thema in their desire ta
take this mat-ter seriously, and scriously ta
consider any measure that may be brought
before thcm; but w'hen they go sa far as ta
propose that tihis tarif! Bill shahI be sent te a
committce of this flouse and considercd item
by item, I would like ta, refer thcma ta a
precedent, flot a very old and mu'sty one, but
anecereated by this Hanse itself a ycar ago.
In 1926 this Hause rejectesi a mea-sure for
Old Age Pensions by a vcry large majarityI think, over twa ta anc. In the folawing
year this same body passed that same
measure by a majority, I think, of about three
to, one: I have not the exact figures. Not
anc member af this House, so, far as I knaw,
arase and said: "I arn canverted; tihis is a
gaad measure; I t'hought it was a ,bad ane,
but naw I think it is a good one." Every
anc of those wh.o had ,previously apposed the
measure, but afterwards supported it, said:
"N'a, I stili think it is a very bad measure,
but it has been passed twice by the ather
House and apparently accepted in a general
election."
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: But the country
epoken in the meiantàme.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Yes, the country
spoken.

had
liad

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Th6t was the reason.
Han. Mr. LEWIS: But tlhis case,' with regard ta the tariff, is exactly analogous. The
(1avernment went ta the country in 1926, aftcr
havhiig ýmade reductions in tihe tariff whieh
werc very severoly ccnsured by protectionigte,

257

and the result was that the Government had a
bigger majority than before; its position wus
con verted fromn a very precarious one into a
safe one. Furthermare, this change taok place
flot only in the free trade West, but in the
protectionist province af Ontario, where aur
representation-4f I miay caUl ît a-was al'
most doubled.
I was gaing on to speak about the Pensions Act. Honourable members of tMhs House
took that position strongly. They said: "We
do not approve of it. We wach aur 'hands of
the wh-ole busineze. We will neot change a
comma, we will not change a letter." And th-ey
refused ail kinds of amendments that. were
macle for the purpose of improving the Bill.
They said: "No, it is a bad measure. We
throw it back an the G-overnment's hands. It
is the Government's responihiitty, it is none
of ours."
Surely in this case, those honourahie gentlemen who feel str.ongly on the question of protection should take a simihiar position and say:
"We do not approve; we arc Protectionistis;
but we accept the popular verdict and throw
the responsibility on the country. Evidently
the country i8 not as Protectionist as we are,
becausethe Government, by infringing an that
principle, very largely increased ifs miajarity,
converting its position from a very prcarious
one ta one tihat is saf e." I sbould think that
ought to clear absoluitely the conscience of
t-hese honourable gentlemnen 'who want now to,
go sa very minut-ely into, ail the details of
this paTtaular measure.
About the question of protection itself I
do flot intend to eay anything except this. We
are told that whaît we ougst. to do is to imitate
and adopt the practice of the Un.ited States,
which lias very largely increased its tarif!,
a'lrcady high.
Hon. Mr. C'ASGRAIN: Free boots and
shoes.
Hon. Mr. LEWI]S: The position in the
United States is almost preciscly the same tha-t
we have here. Everybody admits here that
accarding ta the common tests of prosperity
this country is prosperous, but it is said that
there is a great -deal of unemployment. The
position is exactly the same on the other Bide.
By aIl the ordinary tests by which you determine the prosperity of a country, -the United
States is prosperous, but there is an enormous
amount of unemployment there, cstimated
at variaus figures ail the way fromn 1,800,000
ta 4,000,000. the rea8on for thie disparity
bcing that thcy have no accurate officiai
returns. But apparently ncbody thinoe that
the figure is much less than 2,000,000. 8o they
are in preci&sely the same position that we

56109--17
REVISED EDITION

258

SENATE

are in, and that position is a very curious one:
In both cases while there are many signs of
prosperity, there is apparently a good deal of
unemployment or, in our case, as honourable
gentlemen on the other side say, of migration
which is due to unemployment.
From many of the speeches that have been
made here in this or previous debates you
would imagine that this was a country of
bewers of wood andi drawers of water; that
we do nothing but dig minerals out of the
ground, and cut down the trees. and send them
over to the other side; that this country is
romposed of a rural population and of hewers
of wood and drawers of water. Well, surely
those who say that have not examined our
census figures, whicht show that the great
prevailing tendency of this country has been
an increase of the urban population at the
expense of the rural, so that whercas many
yoars ago the rural population was largely
predoninant, the proportion is now almost
fifty-fifty and the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec have a ntajority of urban over rural
population.
Referone las been made to the amount of
manufartuted goods that we import as conpared with the amount we manufacture. The
actual figures are these; we import something
like $662,000,00 of fully manufactured stuff

from all countries, and $101,000,000

partly

manufactured, and we manufacture in our own
factories nearly $3,000,000,000 worth of goods.
So, after all, I think, you can hardly speak
of this couutry as a country of hewers of wood
and drawers of water, which I take to mean
a country where the bulk of the people are
employed in unskilled labour. Testing this
by our experts, you will find that a good
deal of misapprehension is caused by the fact
that we class our farm products as raw
materials. These amount, out of a total of
$1,282,000,000 to about $578,000,000. There is
secarcely anything produced on the farm that
is raw naterial. Many agricultural products
are so classed in a sort of technical wayvheat for instance, but who will say that
wheat is the product of unskilled labour? Let
anybody go and try to produce it by unskilled
labour and he will very soon find his mistake.
The more fact that a thing is produced in
the open air .does net make it raw material.
Wheat, as a matter of fact, is a manufactured
product of very highly skilled labour. When
yen once produce your wheat the greater part
of your anxiety is over; the milling and the
baking and all those things are miner industries
as compared with the production of the wheat.
It is the same with almost the entire products
of our farms. At least nine-tenths of the
people of this country are employed in what
Hon. Mr. LEWIS.

are called white-collar occupations in the
towns--in commerce or in transportation, or in
very highly skilled industry, either on the
farms or in the factories. The next largest
item of our exports is that derived from the
forests. And of that the largest item is paper.
That surely is a very high form, one of the
highest forms, of manufactured goods-as high
as we can go unless you are going te say that
we should print the New York Times in
Canada, which I think would be rather impracticable.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable gentlemen,
I am sorry I have not prepared a speech on
this question, but I felt that I should not be
doing my duty if I allowed the opportunity
to pass without entering a strong protest, net
so much against this Bill, not particularly
criticizing it, but against the fact that the
Government have not seen fit in this revision
of the tariff to take notice of, or pay any
attention to, the remonstrances of the fruit
growers. The fruit growers were amongst the
first te make an appeal te the Advisory Board
to hear their case. They were heard, I think,
three times. The matter was discussed most
thoroughly. Yet there has been no action
taken. I do not sriow whether any action will
be taken or not. It has been stated in the
other HoIuse that the case had not yet been
finished.
The fruit growers had a much better case,
had a more serious grievance, than any other
industry in the country. They were in a
position where the grossest kind of injustice
was donc them, as will be apparent to anyone
who hears their case. No other industries in
the country, except those that were protected
in the saune way as the fruit growers, by
specific duties, have a case comparable with
that of the fruit growers, or are being treated
as unjustly. Nearly all the industries that
were investigated and had the tariff on their
goods revised were protected by ad valorem
duties. Now, an ad valorem duty that has not
been changed much is just as valuable to-day
as it was forty years ago as a means of protection; but a specific duty that was adopted
forty years ago and remains unchanged is
to-day worth only about one-third of what it
was worth forty years ago as a protective
measure, and it is not more than half as
valuable as it was before the war. Yet the
case of the fruit growers, where such great injustice has been done and their grievance has
been neglected from year to year, is still
further relegated to the future. If it is to
be considered next year, and if there are good
reasons for the delay, I shall not have so much
criticism to offer. But I just wish to point

APRIL 19, 1928
out the fact that they were the first to present
their case and that they have a case more
deserving of attention than, any others, because
ail the duties upon fruit produets, nursery
products and vegetable products were specific
duties imnposed' fcrty years ago, when labour
was at $1 a day, whereas to-day t.he same
labour is $3 a day, and therefore the protection
was nearly three times as great then as it la
110W.
A duty whichi was equivalent to 30 per
cent when those eiuties were put on is now
equivalent to only a bout 10 per cent. Such
is flot the case wth any other industries in
the country except those that have been protected by specific duties in the sanme way, and
yet, a.s I say, this case bas been relegated to,
the future.
We appeared before the Advisory Board.
That is sornetbing thiat I have always feit we
should have had in Canada long ago. If we
had had such a Board irnmediately after the
war we could have appea!led to, it and had. the
duties changed, and if justice had been done
to the fruit-rowi-.g industry thousands of
do1'lars-I think, millions of dollars-might
have been saved to the industry. In the interval the fruit growcrs have had, I arn certain,
a worse time than any other agriculturists in
the country.
There were great. complaints
frorn the farm-ers of the West; there were
great complaints from the wool growers, and,
for a time, fromn thet cotton growers. Ail those
compiaints were justified, but those who made
tbem. have recovered. The grain grower is
getting fair prices now for his grain; the wooi
grower also is getting fair prices, and the
cotton grower recovered in a couple of years;
but thbe fruit growers are stili in the same position that they were in seven or eight years ago.
They have suffered continuously every year
for the Iast seven years. This Dominion is
situated just north of a great country that
has a great diversity of climate and soul, and
can grow the same kind of fruits that we
can in Canada. The whoIe range of States
fiom the Atiantic to the Pacifie shoot their
fruit into this country when the prices are
higb, and get ail the cream of the market,
but our growers have to, wait and take lower
prices for ail their products. The market is
always Iow while our growers have their fruit
on the market. They have had no benefit
from any action of the Government until a
year ago, when the dumping duties were
brought into operation. These dumping duties
had been on the Statute Book ever since
Mr. Fielding was Finance Mînister, but they
were nlot put into operation as regards fruit
until about a year ago. Their enforcement
had a very beneficial effect upon many items
56109-17J

259

of fruit and vegetables, if not upon ahl of
tbem. In the last two weeks an Order in
Council bas been passed cancelling those
dumping duties, and the consequence la that
the fruit grower is absolutely in a slough. He
bas no0 protection arnounting to aiiything from
the tariff-it equals only about 10 per cent;
lie has no protection on account of the dumping duties, and he is going to be left for
another year in the same desperate position
that hie bas been in for the last five or six
years. Therefore I protest that the Government did not do something in this matter.
Now, I want to say sornething with regard
to the appearances before the Advisory Board.
As I hiave said, that is a Board that I have
always advocated as a proper thing, but I
do not think that it ougbt to be permissible
for a trained expert in debate to he there to
criticize, quiz, cross-examine and ridicule men
Who corne before that Board to state their
case . As the hast speaker bas said, that Board
ought to be a Board for the bearing of facts
presented by men who have grievances and
complaints. It studies those grievances and
complaints, and presents their case to the
Government, and the Government then b~as
the duty of taking whatever action it secs
fit. But bere we have the situation that day
after day, e'very time that Board sits, Mr.
Deaclinan and Mr. Darby are present, the
latter representing the Board of Agriculture.
Being at this work ail the time, they are
experts, and they are always deibating and
criticizing the policy of protection-not the
facts. Tbey are ail the turne arguing the
theoretical question and presenting the
theoretical argument. I contend that that is
not the business of the Board, and that it
ought not to, listen to theoretical arguments.
It is a fact-finding Board, but it considers it
its duty to hear those discussions. I have
seen a young mnan who was clever and smart
in presenting bis case in favour of some
duties that he wanted put on; but Mr. Darby
aud Mr. Dechinan would throw in some of
their littie bombs, and throw the young man
off bis feet. It is not fair. The natural result
of that method will be that in course of time
those who, are appealing to the Beard for
increased duties will have to engage similar
advocates, and th-en we shall bave two men
there, sparring on the theoretical question of
protection or free trade. That is nýot the question to be discussed. The people of this
country decided that every time it was put
before them. I cannot agree with zny bonourable friend wbo bas just sat down (Hon. Mr.
Lewis), that that was the question at the
luat election. The question at that time was
hargely a constitutional one, and many side

SENATE
issues were brought in, but not the question
of tariff. Every time the tariff question has
been put before this country since it was
taken up in 1877 the policy of protection has
been endorsed, and I am bound to affirm
that if that question were put before the
people to-day, it would .carry with just as
large a majority as it ever did before, if it
were stripped of all the side issues that go
along with it to 'counteract the influence of
those voters who believe in protection. It has
often been said that the farmers of this country
pay no income tax of any kind. I am sure it
would he far truer to say that for a great
many years they have not made anything on
which to pay income tax, and that applies
to vegetable growers also.
In regard to the Bill before the House. it
seems to me, after a very cursory examination
of it, that it is very difficult for a layman to
compare it with the duties that were in existence before, as probably more than half the
items have been changed, and some items are
put into different categories, but on the
finished article there lias been no reduction in
duty, or rather, no opportunity for the manufacturer of the finished article to make money.
The duties on some of the things he has to
buy, sonme semi-mranufactured articles, . have
becn reduced, and therefore he is handicapped.
As near as I can judge, the principle the Government has followed is the same as that which
ths New Zealand Government bas adoptedthat the manufacturer of the last finished
article that gocs to the consumer is to be protected, but all others are to take their chances.
Applying that principle to the fruit-growers,
theirs is the finished article; therefore why
should not the fruit-grower have the duity to
protect bis finished article, that goes directly
to the consumer, equivalent to the duty allowed to the manufacturer of finisbed goods?
That is all the fruit-grower bas ever askedto have a duty equal to the average duty on
manufactured goods, which is 25 per cent. If
the fruit-grower got 25 per cent he would be
tickled to death, for he now gets only 10 per
cent, or 15 per cent at, most.
The ýfruit-growers do not want ad valorem
duties; they want specifie duties, for two
reasons. They are more convenient for the
customs officials, and the foreign exporter cannut cheat the oustoms by undervaluing; they
are therefore simple and effective in those
respects. In the second place, specific duties
are of most value when the article is cheapest
in the foreign country. When fruit is a drug
in the foreign 'market, and is being dumped
into this market, the ad valorem duty is not
of very much use. These are the reesons why
Hon. E D. SMITH.

the fruit-growers want specific duties; but in
order to assist any industry that
protected
by specific duties, there must of necessity be
changes in the tariff to correspond with the
fluctuating valie of the dollar.
In war-time there was such a demand for
goods of all kinds that it did not matter
whether dtities were specific or not; but the
principle of specific duties should have been
adopted since the war, in order to do any kind
of justice to the fruit-growers. I think there is
where the Advisory Board in the end will be
of great value, if they perform their duties
honestly, and faithfully present the facts of
the case as given by those who intercede before them; and I shall hope that when another
year rolls round the fruit-growers will have
had that attention which they have so long
deserved.

We are

ail

deniocrats, in a certa:n way, aind in this
House, as in xvery otler House, wt
iust
accept the con-idered opinion of the people.

I ai
always ready to stand by that pritciple.
Whein I think Ilhe people of this
country have honesily given ltheir opinion for
a change, we must take notice of it; and I
am prepared on this side of the Hoitse to
abide by the considered opinion of the
people on the tariff policy as on other qui.tions. But I know that what many imaiiiutacturers and
ran tue men in this couintry
feel is the constant Changintg of thei tarifï,
due either to recomnmendations
from
the
Advisorv Conmmittee or otherwise, pending
an appeal to the people, and threfore leading to a constant tinkering with the tariff.
It is because of that constant tinkering an i
changing that men in commerce and industrycannot adjust themtselves. If, at the end of
five years, or whenever a Covernment wen;
to the people, they would map out, for their
appeal to the country, their various suggestions by way of alterations to the then exist:ng tarif, and if the country pronounced in
favour of that policy by returning the same
party to power, the industry and commerce
of this country would naturally accept the
verdict, and I would be ready to accept it
if the tariff was the main issue in the contest. But we are tinkering with the tariff
Session after Session, and no industry in this
country can adjust itself to the changes.

APRIL 19, 1928
In Washington, if my observation and information be correct, we do flot find with a
Tariff Commission a constant lowering of the
tariff, or practically any Iowering cf the tarie!
during a presidential term. A dumping law
is frequently irnposed during a presidential
terni of office; but even these enactmnents
are extrernely uncommon; while the manufacturers and traders of this country are liable
fromn Session to Session. to have radical
changes in the fariff policy which rnay put
themn ouf of business. To that I object.
Hon. GEO. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen, it appears to me that this is a cas-ý
in which we have fo make a virtue of necesbi.net being in a position to do anyfhing
with this Bill, but either to pass or reject
it, and I arn sure this House would nover
think of pursuing the latter course. However. every person knows that the tariffi
an instrument which can make or break
business; and in glancing over this Bill 1
noticed one itein on the free list, thus affording no protection to an industry whose
balance sheef for the hast three years shows
that the profits are gradualhy disappearing.
I do flot wish to announce thc naine of that
firrn, but I will give if to the honourable
leader of the Bouse, in the hope that sorte
relief can be given te thaf industry.
We hear people in this House and oufside
speaking of the great prosperi.ty which is
upon us. and telling how business is booming;
but the business to which I refer is gradually
geing down, on aecount cf competition from
countries whose currency is depreci.ated, and
where wages are iow in comparison with ours.
That busines ýcould enmploy a greaf, many men,
and could be put in a prosperous condition
by mnoving the finger, as it were, of the
Government. If appeaus to mie thaft that
would bc fiar more reasoiiable than to engage
in the business of bonusing immigrants te this
country to corne in at one door and go out
at the other.
In regard týo the great prosperity that if is
said we have at present, I believe that if it
were not for the great natural resoxuices we
have in -the fields, the mines, and the foresfs,
we would be nowhere. In our greaf West
there is ne rnanufacturing, because the people
out there seem to think that the meanufacturers, who are their best friends, are their
enemies; and th--y lzncp on erying for free
trade, notwifhgtaýnding the facf lihat the United
States are putting up the bars higher and
higher against thern. I arn glad te say, however, that Providence is gradually intervening
on behaif of the great West, and that -the
enormous mining development which I behieve bas just startted, is going to give them

261

in time what they should have had before
now through industry and manufacturing.
Then the West wiIl wake up, and readize that
the sooner tbey get, manufacturing plants of
different deecriptions out there, which they
cali only have by getting sorne protection, the
better off they will 'he.
I realize tihat as far as this Bill is concerned, there is flot .mucha use in saying
anything about it.
Hon, C. E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen. I feel fempted to, make a few rernarks
on this subject, for one reason. We appear
to be in a hurry. 1 judge that we are in a
hurry, 'because we are sit-ting at night, and
the Senate marely sits at night unless if is
in a hurry. Now, why are we in a hurry to
get Ührough with this Bill?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 will answer
mv honourable friend riglit away. I arn not
in a hurry at ail, but weHon. Mr. TANNER: I was going to answer
the question myself.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We ýhave quite
a number of Bis that are d-own for second
reading.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My honourable fiiend
can give hie answer later on. The answer I
make is this--and I feel a littie justiification
in it. This Bill pa&Qed the House of Comnmons on the 30t:h of Maodh, and tihat Hoiise
re8umed its sitting on tihe lOth of A.pril. This
Chamber did neot resume until the 17th of
April. We coul have been dealing with this
Bill more ihan a week ago if honourable
members fiad not decided to adjoiten for such
a long period of time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The argument is
flot well taken.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Some of us protesfed
againtst the long adjournmrent.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON: It is because you oould not go home.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Why could we not
go home? We have homes just as good am
those of my honourab1e firiend f0 go to, and,
just like my honoureble friend, we go on the
railway free, and we could go home if we
wanfed f0; but we came up here f0 disdharge
our duty, and we were williing to remain,
some of uls -at any rate. But I arn pointing
out thaf we could have been at this Bill on
tihe 10th of April as well as to-day, and therefore there would not be any uirgency about
having a night sitting. So xnuih for that.
Now, I have no hope whatever of getting to
the bottom of this intricate Bill, nor do I see
that any Comrnittee of this House would

262

SENATE

verv profitably spend time on if, because,
aîs far as 1 hav e followed the procecdinigs in
another place, very few there undersfand it
to-day.
Even the Minister of Finance is
ver.% cloudv about a large part of if, and I
think t bat the persons wh'o were sitfîng Lehînd him anci supporting hlm must have
t;aken it on what is called faith.
But ive have a Tariff Advisor ' Board, and
ibaf is the, item of interest to me. This
Tariff Advisor.v Board is constitufed and set
up, we are told-and if is set up at a good

clone in regard to tariff matters. Whaf happens thon? Dors the Tariff Board make the
subject clear, or does if not? I happen to
have under my hand the report of the Tariff
Board, signed by one W. H1. Moore, who is
Chairman, ani who receives the substantial
saa''of $10.000 a vear. Mr. Moore in this
repor"t points ouf the duty of the Board.
What the Board is to do is set forth by

1 suppose we will have to swallow it.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, 1 have heen in this flouse now for
thirty years, and I have listened to many debates on the Canadian tariff. We ail know
the history of the tariff in Canada from 1867
to this day. First of all, there was a 15 per
cent tariff, and in 1874 Alexander Mackenzie
raised it to 17ý per cent; then in 1878 Sir
John Macdonald carried the day and made
what could be called a 30 per cent tariff; and
since then the tariff has been reviewed and

263

deait with by nearly every Minister of Finance who has been in office for four years.
We ail know that in 1897 Mr. Fielding made
his first revision of the tariff and brought in
the preference to Great Britain. Ten years
later, in 1907, he again made a general revision of the- tariff. After 1897 the preference
had been gradually increased to 33ý per cent,
and we ail heard fears expressed for our inWe now know that those fears

were groundless, because from 1897 up to the
time of the war, the country enjoyed a conThe increase in
siderable cra of prosperity.
the preference to 33ý per cent did not hurt
industry, although some woollcn manufacturers
claimed that they had been affected; and
from 1907 to 1914 1 do flot believe there was
any clamour for higher duties even from the

or about that date, the anti-dumping Act was

tariff would flot be high enough to prevent 5
per cent of the overproduction across the line,
which would flot be a very great overproduetion at a time of depression, being thrown
across the Uine and disorganizing our whole
trade. Mr. Fielding then managed to satisfy
them by bringing in the Anti-dumping Act.
We had prosperity under a somewhat reduced
tariff during the Laurier regîme up to 1913 or

some of whomn were members of the Borden
Cabinet, the tariff ias materially increased,
and during the war a uniforma 71 per cent level
increase came into effect.
I heard my honourable friend frorn Toronto
(Hon. Sir Edward Kemp) state to-day that
someone had boasted that since that tirne
the tariff had been reduced in Canada three
or four times. I arn the person who made
the statement, but I may surprise rny honourable friend by saying te, him that the honours,
if honours they be, were equally divîded between the Government of which he is a
supporter and the Government which I support, because, between 1918 and 19J21 lis
Governrnent twice reduced the tariff, and it
removed that surtax of 7-ý per cent, which
represented quite an appreciable reduction.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: My honourable friend did flot count Vhat, did he?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Ycs. If ail the
other coîîntries of th(, world were î'aising their
fences during the regimel of the Govcrnment of my lionoural1e friend, what was
Canada doioig? It was reducing the tariff by
72per, cent, and that was donc at one fell
blow. I ar n ot quite sure whether it wvas
under the Borden or under the Mcighen
Governmnent, but there was also a reduction
on agî'icultural implements by eithor of those
Gioverniments.
I know that it xvas made
before the R'ing Goveroment came in, in 1922.
lTnder the Ring Governit, there have
becu decreascs in the tariff, particularly on
the imiplernents of production, covcring quite
a wvide range, teuebing the produets of the
forcsts, the fisheries, the mines and the farms.
Those are the important sources of production and wealth in 'chis country, and the
King Goveromient, knowing what it wvas doing, andi doing it for a elear purpose, systcmatically rcduced the titriff on the instrument,
of production in order to lielp in the development of tho-c industries which are naturai to

bas bren the result? A. tremendous increaso

APRIL 19, 192
institutions, dndustrial and other, were as
sh.aky as some honourable gentlemen have
sa.id? I doubt it very rnuch.
My honourable friends have spoken of the
mignati-on of our people. Welil, that migration
bas con'tinued for a hundred years. There were
times when our people crossled the uine 'in
greater nuanhers than at present. I reme«nber
that one of the most eloquent speeches made
by Sir Wilfrid La-urier was one delivered in
1871, in the Provincial Legisiature, in which
he pîoitured a procession -of people moving
towards the line and saluting the 'Premier,
then the Hon. Mr. Chauveau, as they took
Icave of their country. There will always be
a movement of tiat kind. Some honourable
gentleman-I have forgotten who-said that
the people were leaving Canada because of
the inabili.ty of this country to afford Vhem
employment. 1 venture to assert that a greater
number leave Canada because of that natural
trend from the farms to the cities. Montreai,
wbich now lias more thon a million people, bas
not increased its population only by births;
it has drawn Iargely from the rural districts.
In the rural parts there are large families, and
some of the *farmers' sons, in preference to
tilling the soul, go into the towns and cities.
I saw the other day an article wbiob mentioned the fact that dozens of smali towns in
New E.ngland had been peopled by Cenadians
from the province of Quebec. forty. fifty or
seventy-five years ago, and that if to-day there
is an easy movemnent of or population from
Quebec into those centres it is because of the
policy pursued by ail Governments. This is
particularly true of the Governnfients that preceded the Laurier administration, for 1 amn
speakîng of those Governments that were in
power ovýer forty ye:ars ago, when Canadians
lef t for towns and cities in the United States
and traneferred their fortunes and their hopes
across the border. The resuit fa that to-day in
ev-ery village in the province of Quebec there
are cousins. neices and nephews of every
fami'ly in the New England States. It is
natural for these relatives to correspond, and
they do. and they tm'vel back and forth from
one coun:try to the other. There is naturally
an attraction to those towns in the United
States that are inbabited mostly by people
coming from Quebee. We shail always have
such conditions, and they are no justification
for saying that 'the panacea is for tbis country
to raise our tariff wall hetween the United
States end Canada.
My bonourable friend from, Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) bas suggested that this
Bill be sent to a Committee. This is the first
time that such a suggestion has been made on
a tariff Bill since Confederation. Why bas

it not been made 'before? Because it bas
been realized by this Chamber that the tariffmaking for this country is donc i the popular
Chamber and not in this. The popular
Chamber bas a mandate direct from the
people and knows wbat they are tbinking.
Now, what does this imply? That, witb tbe
knowledge that 'we cannot amend tbis measure,
we sbould examine the tariff changes that are
made and satisfy ourselves wbetber these
amendments are good or bad. Is it necessary
for that purpoee to refer the Bill to a Committee? Let every one of us consider wbat is
the doctrine beld by bira on the tariff question and what are bis inclinations, and we
shall know where we stand. Now, I realize
that everv member of this Chamber is entitled
to the information that he needs and desires
on a Bill of this kind. This is an opportunity
for honourable members of this Chamber to
familiarize tbemselves with the working of
the tariff. I have here the Cominissi oner of
Tariff, who will answer any queries. So far
as I am concerned, I do not intend to agree
to this Bill being sent eitber to a Standing
Committee or to the Committee of the Wbole
Huse. The practice is to move the second
reading and froma tbe second reading to
proceed te the third. We are now at the
second reading. I invite any member wbo
desires to ask questions for the satisfaction
of bis conscience, or for bis own enlightenment,
te put tbose question now. This procedure
is in accordance with what bas been the
practice in this Chamber during the last sixty
years. We must aIl isubmit to the verdict of
the people, as represented by the complexion
of the House of Commons, on this question
of the tariff, for it eonstantly comes before
the people at every election. We know
wbat the West believes; we know wbat the
Eas,ýt helieves. Judging by the essential requirements of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island, I sbould say that
the Maritimes are free trade provinces, and
when I remeniber that Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, -in a moment of aberration, rejected
the Reciprocity Treaty of 1911 and failed
to grasp the opportunity to obtain the United
States market for tbeir natural products, I
wonder wbether those provinces were e'ntitled
to hetter terms from the Dominion. I wonder
whether tbe people of New Brunswick have
not a feeling of despair when they think that
tbey migbt have sold their potatoes free of
duty under that Reciprocity Treaty. Would
flot Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have
enjoyed considerable prosperity througb the
sale of their fisb on the Amnerican market?
Ahl their il have come from the fact that
that market was cloxsed to them. Yet great

that he had better touch on some other question than fruit. I think he would make hetter
progress for the moment.
My honourHnn. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend speaks of fruit. 0f course, there
are those who seli fruits, and there are those
who eat them. Perhaps they do not se
things from the same angle.
With these few remarks, and apologizing
for the number of questions that I have
touched upon, perhaps without due preparation, in answering the various objections that
came from the other side, I move the second
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
rcad the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Sena-te, I move that the Bill le now
read the third time.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill having been read the second
time, I suppose it, is only logical that I should
rise now, to suove that the Bill should be
sent to a Standing Conimittee, and I will
make the necessary motion that it ha sent
to the Commnittee on Banking and Commerce.
In making that motion, may I extend to the
Leader of the House our hearty congratulations on the very rcmarkable speech that he
bas just m~ad.e. I almost feel that the honourable leader bas brouglit back to us an echo
of the eloquence that resounds sometimes in
the League of Nations. It reminds mea of
what a delegate representing the Canadian
Government at Geneva told me upon his
return to Paris. Ha said that he had heard. the
nîost eloquent speech, the most marvallous
speech, that he could have dreaimed of. Mr.
Viviani lad risen at a moment when somnehody
had proposed, I think rit was in 1919, tihat
Germnany should be admitted to the League of
Nations; and with bis impetuosity, stimulated
at that time by indignation, Viviani made sueli
an appeai as carried away the whole Assem.bly;
and the next day they resolved unanimously

261

that henceforth they would neyer vote
:mmiediately after a discussion, because on the
day previous they felt, as did the old Romans,
that they had been enslaved hy the chains
of gold flowing from the orator's* mouth.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I do not like
to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but
"lie honourable leader of the House was moving for the third reading.
Hon. Mr. BEýAUBIEN: I am sorry. I will
wvait.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move,seconded
by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that this
Bih .be read the third time now.
The Hlon. the SPEAKER: With the leave
of the Huse.
Hou. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That would be
two readings in one night w'ith thc leave of
the bouse.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: You will have
to get the leave.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 as], the leave
of the House to move the third reading of
a moncy Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 think 1 am now
in order in moving, in amendmant, that the
Bill be net now read the third time, but lie
referred te the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. Now, having extenided to My
honourable friend my congratulations, may I
say to hum that the questionHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Out of order again.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, I have a right
to speak to my motion now. May I say to
him that the question is put on more prosaic
grounds. We are here as a body of business
men. Wa have had submitted to us a measure
coming from the other bouse, cvery item of
which. may storp or speed on the industry of
the country. That i,4 the whola question. We
say to the Governinent, represanted by my
honourable friend: "Will you lie good enougli
to explain to us the virtues of thiq measura?"
My honourable friend stated in bis opening
remarks that he would not attampt to give
the information, and lie also remarked that it
would lie very difficult for him, to go over this
Bill clause by clause and give -us ahl the information that iwould lie raquired to justify
anyone of tihosa items. Why not send the
Bill to a Committee whiere this will be done
by the Government for the purpose of justifying this measure, and nobody could conaplain
of that, but rather be satisfied. We would
have the expert of the Governînent to explain
thc items that my honourable friand could

268

not explain to this House; and even if he
oould, anybody interested in an industry
could not be heard, so that the information
would be altogether one-sided.
I am not-prejudiced against the Bill, but I
flic slightest degree of
cannot exercise
judgment in considering whether it is good,
bad, or indifferent. We have not a tittle of
evidence before us. My colleaguos on this
side of the House bave said that it has never
even been recommended by the Advisory
Tariff Board. In :-'other place the Minister
of Finance gave sone information on each
item. but here we are. without any explanations
whatever, and we are requested to pass thesc
200 items modifying the tariff, without knowing their significane, or what effect they
inay have on industry. For my part, I do not
think this House can be justified in accepting
,such a sumnary proceeding. In the past we
have lad similar measures of public interest
coming fromu the Government in regard to
which evidence w'as huard as to tiheir effect ou

treated differently I do not know. We may not
have power to amend, but we certainly have
power to inquire; and if it is shown clearly
that in the sole interest of the nation this Bill

Senate to reject it?
The only thing that we ask is that if be
sent to the Committee, where we could hear
the pros and cons, and make up our minds
intelligently as te its real merits. and if there

is proven to be jusiified it will be accepted.
but at al! events we will have information
about if.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.
Honourable
gentlemen, I cannot accept the motion of my
honourable friend, because whatever may be
the facts that are brought before him, there
is, behind the evidence, the question of policy,
and it is that question of policy that I will
not consent to bring before the Committee,
where parties who are more or less directly
affected. will ask to be called and heard.
After they have been heard, the question of
policy will remain complete, because a vast
proportion of the people of Canada are consumers, and are primarily represented by their
elected members in the House of Commons,
se that the tariff policy is one that escapes
the judgment of this Chamber.
The judgment of this Chamber may be that
of men who dominated this country ten or fifHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Sen voar ago, but do not do so to-day. The
men who represent the publie opinion of this
country on the question of the tariff are in
the other Chamber. They have been directly
elected by the people, and I wonder what the
people of this country would think if the
majority of this Chamber, representing a sentiment that has been condemned once, twice,
or three times during the last few years in
this country, would affirm their own preferences in opposition to those of this day. So
that, knowing that my honourable friends
facing me are perfectly aware of the policy
that is in this Bill, I accept thoir challenge in
this House right now.

Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlement, if is not my intention to take part in
this debate; but it occurs to me that we are
not exactly disagreed on all the points that
are under consideration. In the first place,
my honourable friend bas asked for the concurrence of the members on this side of the
House in tho third reading of this Bill now.
Is that riglit? Is that what is before the

will be well served by the adjournment of

COPPER BOUNTIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 171, an Act to amend the
Copper Bounties Act, 19M3.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, legislation respecting the payment of bouinties on
copper rods was enacted by Chapter 40 of
the Statutes of 192M. The Act came into force
in 1923 and expires on June 30, 1928. For the
first period, 1923-24, the bounty was at the
rate of 1ý cents a pound; for the second
period, 1924-25, at was at the rate of 11 cents
a pound; for the third period, 1925-26, it was
at the rate of 1 cent a pound; for the fourth
period, 1926-27, it was at the rate of î cf a
cent a pound; and for the flfth period, 192728. it was at the rate of ý a cent a pcund.
The Bill now before the Senate provides
for the extension of the bounty for five years
in ycarly periods at j~ a cent a pound. It is
provided that the sum to be paid in any one
period. shall not exceed $200,000. It is
estimated that the ameunt of the bounty, on
the basis of production in 1927-28, will be
$62,510.
Refincd copper is produced -in Canada only
hy thie Consolidated Mining and Smelting
Company at Trail, B.C. Converter copper
made by the Granby Conso]idated at Anyox,
and hb' the International Nickel Company,
Limited, at Port Coîborne is shipped to
Concentrates from the
for'eign refincries.
Britannia Mine and the Eustis Mine are exported. Copper-Niekel niatte made by the
Moud Nickel Company. Lirnitcd, at Coniston,
Ontario. is refined at Cblydach, Wales.
Outside of the United States there are, I
arn informed, only threc copper refineriesone in Australia, one in Canada, and one in
Japan, The United States output is 95 per
cent of the reflne-d metal. Our reflnery in
Trail. in West Kootenay, has an output of
10,000 tons, or 20,000,000 pou"nd a year, valued
at 83,000.000. We prodiece raw copper, copper
matte, and blister copper vailued at $12,000,000,
which is shipped te the United States and there
refined, and of which 87,00,000 worth is returned te Canada.
The Uni'ted States controtl the price cf
copper, their export price being 88 above the
home market price. They naturally refine
mure cheaply, because as again.st the 20,000,000 pounds preduced in a year at Trail, at
Anaconda in the United States, they produe
17,000,000 pounds per month.
With this bounty it ie hoped ta develop the
industry in Canada, and I have heard some
people express the hope-whether 1they are
optiimists or not I de net know-that more

269

than eue -or two addition-al refineries may be
set up before the expi-ry cf this bounty. With
these explanations, I desire to mneve the
second reading cf this Bill.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The explauatory note
te the Bill says:
Section 2 cf the Copper Bounties Act, 1923,
provides for the payment cf bouinties on cepper
bars or rods rnanufacttired iu Canada and sold
for consumption therein.
I would like te know the reason wihy this
bounty wiil net be paid on copper bars for
export.
Right Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: If the
honourable gentleman will1 allow me, I th-iuk
I can tell thim. As a matter cf faet, there
has been difficuity in supplying these rods ta
ur own m-ilîs that manufacture wire, and it
]S in order to encourage thie consumption cf
our own Canadian product by cur o.wn wire
mi-ls that this is doue. If -these things are
exported lihey wilI have te pay a very big
dutv. Týhe bounty -of course enables the
manufuaoturers cf rods te sell more cheaply.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I canuot just understand the qogie of it. It appears to ha the
poîicy cf the Government, and they have so
statedà, to create an export market. Do yoli
ot think it is desîrable ta create an export
mnarket for our copper?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before we thiuk
of creating an export market, we must ha sure
that we are satisfying the legitimata aspirations cf aur cwn people, and meeting our cwn
needs. There is in the United States practica'lly a .monopoly cf the refined produaet. They
seil to the outside world at $8 a tan higher
thian the price to their cwn people. They
would naturally ba interested in capturing al
that is being produced in Canada, at whatever price it miglit be offered, in ordier ta
dominate the market in this country and te
maintain the price whidh they impose upon
the rest cf the world.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then this is not for
the purpose cf encouraging the production of
copper in Canada.
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yea.
Hou. Mr. GORDON: I thouglit from what
my honourable friend from Brockville (Right

CANADIAN

NATIONAL RAILWAY BILL
SECOND RE.\DINe

Rigtîh Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moi-ed the
second reading of Bill 194, an Act te amend
the Canadian National Raiiway Art.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Would the right Lonourable gentleman explain this Bill, because it is
tce worst drawn Bill I have seen this year.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am nat an
expert, on (irafting, but I can explain what the
Bill means. The purposo of this Bill is te
extend the jurisdictien of the Board of R-ailway Comnissioners je dealing ivith Government-owned railways. Under the varjous statilles and amendments governing Government
raiiw lys, tLe Board of Railway Commissioners
have power te deal with matters of operation.
TiteY have also beon given power te deai with
equipment and witit any additions or changes
that arc neccssary in order te proteet the lives
of passengers and em.pioyees. Il is proposod to
'put tite Government rýaiiways under the Board
of Railway Commissioners, in exaetiy the
saýme position as cornpany linos, so far as the
expenditure of capital, or -improvements that
require the expendituro of capital are coneerned. For example, if a subway is thouglit

APRIL 19, 1928
to be essential, the only way now in wbich it
can be obtained by the publie is by gatting
the Government, to consent. It is then built
by the Governmnent money, without any reference wbatever to the Board of Railway Comnmissioners. Under an Act passed sqIne years
ago the Board o! Railway Commissioners were
given power, in the case of company lines, to
order such work as a subway.
Hon, W. B. ROMS: Thut is instead of a leve]
cross'ing.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes. That
work could be ordered, and the expense apportioned between the municipality insisting
upon it being done, the railway that was
ordered to do tbe work, and a fund that was
established by statute of the Federal Parliament.
Another example.
A fence is to be
built by the Government llailways. Up to
the present time they have a standard that
is flot equal to that demanded by the Board of
Railway Commissioners.
This Bill will give
tbe Board of Railway Commissioners power
to say to tbe Governrnent Railways: "The
public are demanding a fence, and you must
build a fence of the right standard." It may
be necessary also to build extensions to
stations, and so on.
So far as such matters
are concerned, the Government Railways will
be placed in the same position as the company
railways. The Government Railways retain
one or two privileges wbich seern to be
essentiel, such as the power of expropriation.
Cases in dispute will not be handed over to
the County Courts to be decided, but will go
to the Exchequer Court for decision. Then
as to, the location of a liue and ahl such
matters, they wihl remein, as they were, under
Otherwise
the Government Railways Act.
this Bill is to place tbe Government Raihways
in the same position as the company railways.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.
ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAYS PROJECT
DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed the adjourned debate
on the inquiry of the Hon. Mr. Reid:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the St. Lawrence Waterways project, and
inquire if it is the intention of the Government
to lay on the Table of the Senate the report of
the Advisory Committee on the proposed scheme.
Honourable
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
gentlemen, this is a rather lengthy subi ect, but
I suppose I may proceed with it.
In the first place, I believe that to the honourable gentleman from Grenville (Hon. Mr.
Reid), who introduced this question, we owe
a profound debt of gratitude.
This is cer-

tainly one of the most important matters, if
not the most important, coming before Parliament in a long time, and had it not been
for the honourable gentleman the Senate
might not have deait with it so thorougbly or
tried to acquire ail the necessary information
about it. The honourable gentleman is very
He

bas been for thirty-seven years continuously
in publie life, witbout the exception of a single
day.
He was first elected in 1891, and to
such a dcgree dîd hie enioy the confidence of
bis constituents that no one could beat him in
bis county, and he was re-elected and reelected over and over again until he found a
haven of rest in the Senate of Canada. He
was also for a long time, during that period
of thirty-seven years, Minister of Railways
and Canais, and as such hie bad an opportunity to acquire special information. This
information hie bas given to the House. I
consider it of very great value indeed, and I
believe that not only this bouse but also the
Government of the day and the country at
large owe himi a debt of gratitude for the very
clear exposition that hie gave of this matter.
I amn sure that when the honoura-ble gentleman replies and closes the debate he will
have the Senate almost unanimously in favour
of his contention.
He told us sometihing very interesting, and
it surprised me to learn it, al-though I have
been going over that route for the last fiftyfour years. He told us th-at instead of 25
feet of water in the channels approaching
Lake Superior Vbere is now only 18J feet.
The water there bas fallen some %~feet.
Looking at the old maps, I always saw that
the level of Lake Superior was 605 feet, but
I see 'by the report we bave here that the
engineers now find the level to be only 601
feet. That difference already aocounts for
four feet of the apparenrt reduction. Whether
the reduetion bas actually taken place or
whether the difference is due to new sets of
levels having been taken I cannot say. I
know that the Governrment bave had levele
taken right from the ses level to ajl the
different parts of the waterway; I know also
that there are differences. In any event the
old maps that I saw shoçwed the level of Lake
Suiperior to be 605 feét, and to-day, according
to this report, it is down to 601 feet. In the
d*ays wben I used to pass the Sauft Ste. Ma-rie
fals the bead wae some 26 feet. Now it also
seems -to have dimiinished. Naturaily, the
bead being lowered, you could not expeict that
there would be the samie distance between
thst and the bottomn.
Away back in 1900, the year when I had
the honour of being summoned to thîs House,
Hon. Mr. Tarte, wbo was then Minister of

SENATE

272

Publie Works, conceived a very bright idea:
hie thought that by clearing out the outiet
of Lake Huron he would give better navigation facilities. A client of mine, a man
by the namne of Piggott, was; then excavating
the harbour of Seiiforth, and <this man had
agrced to give a certain depth of water, but
while he ivas digging Hon. Mr. Tarte and hir
Department were opening the outlet of the
lake and the water ivas fall-ing. Hence thcre
was considerahly more excavation required
to get the 20-foot navigation in this harbour
and I was asked to go there. Naturally 1
wvas empleyed in a professional capa.city. I
persuaded Hon. Mr. Tarte, who wvas aliways
a very good friend, of mine, to corne and sc
for himself. When we went there Nvhat did
we find? There .vas a gauge there, and the
engineer had lowered the gauge sorne 20
inches, and that was quite visible on the face
of the wharf. The removing of seine obstacle
at the outlet of Lake Huron had lowercd the
level of lake Huron and Georgian Bay, and
partly Lake Michigan aIse, by somne 20 inches.
Weil. with that 20 inches. or nearly two feet,
we have just about found the diflerence tha,
the hionourable gentleman lias mcntioned: the
four feet in Lake Superior and the twvo feet
in that vakust expanse which is all supposed
te ho at one level-Lake Michigan ani Lake
Huron and Georgian Bay-accouint for six
fcet. Now if we look for the additional six
inches. wc find that it has heen admit tedaînd the honourable gentleman has seen this
hoek-that the Chicago diversion has reduced
the level by six inches. So the honourable
gentleman's contention was perfectly right.
But 1 must say that I was astounded when we
wvere told that instead of having, as in the
old days, 25 feet of navigation, there wa.s n-ow
only 18ý feet.
However, that contention does nlot agree
with this book. If you read this book from
cover to cover you will see that these wise
engineors who prepared the report find that
there is still 19 feet 3 inches on the silîs of

crepancy there.
Another thing. The engineers do not agree.
1 suppose you know that. Anybody who has
taken the trouble to read this report is aware
that the Amnerican engincers want one stage
and the Canadian engineers want two stages.
That statement may mean very lîttle to a
layman, but in plain language it means this.

I quite understand,
but the very few rernarks I have te make may

I think, honourable gentlemen, flic tidings

bocause I observe to-day that an officer of the
Mounted Police is on duty at the eastern

Now, it happcnied on the very evening I gave

tion bas been raised in this House and publie
attention drawn to it, but apparently we
are waiting until some casualty occurs before the trouble will be rectified. It seems ta
me that there are two factors which contribute
ta the present danger: one iB the lack of a
traffic regulator, particularly on occasions when
there are large numbers of people in attendance at this building; and the other is the
Iack of a speed limit regulation within the
gates to these grounds. I do not think the
suggestion of my honourable friend that a
traffic officer at either of the gates, or even
the routing of traffic in at one gate and out
at another, would entirely answer the purpose.
1 think tihe regulations shouid go further,
and that they shouid prescribe a speed
limit within the grounds. It seems ta me
absurd that, with a thousand people in attendance at this building, in addition ta the people
whose duties bring them here, pedestrians
should be subjected to the danger of a nonregulated traffic which is allowed to go by
these buildings at the rate of thirty or thirtyfive miles an hour. Such a condition wouid
flot be allowed under any other circumstances
that I can imagine. I would not like ta suggest that the lack of attention upon the part
of the Government authorities, or the failure
of my honourable frîend the Leader of this
House ta hring this matter ta the attention
of the proper authorîties, is due ta any deliberate design on their part ta cause casualtics among the mcmbership of this side of the
same time
House, because that at .the
mxght involve a reduction in the membership of the other side as wcIl, something
which my honourable friend can iii afford ta
suffer. This matter has been brought offlcially
and publicly to the attention of the Government, and if no action is taken,' and an
accident docs happen ta any member on
either side of this Chamber or of the House
of Comm ons, the Government will be faced
with a vcry grave rtesponsibiiity.
Hon. .J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I 'wouid like to see this go a littie further.

that perhaps the trafie officer might be posted

56109--181

do flot know why we have not got traffie
officers there now. If you go dawn to Sparks
street, where there is flot as much traffic as
there is on Wellington street, you will flnd
plenty of traffic officers. In addition ta that,
1 think the Government of the country is
responsible if there shouid be an accident, because Wellington street is owncd by the Govcrnment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it?
Hon. Mr. REID: I undcrstand, I =~y be
wrong-t bat the Government has ta keep the
street in order from O'Connor street ta Elgin,
and that it is their street.
As ta spced within these grounds, I would
flot allow mare than ten miles an hour. Even
then it would not take more than three
mîinutes ta go aIl around the premises.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I happen ta be a
member of the Committce an the Grounds.
The Chairman of that committee unfortunately is ili, and the other member present at
the only meeting we held is not here to-day.
Two or three weeks aga we had before us
the Deputy Minister of Public Works and the
Controller of the Police, Colonel Starnes, and
we went into the matter very fully with them.
Those gentlemen promised ta make a report
dealing with this matter.
It came out at
that meeting that while the Governmcnt is
bound ta keep Wellington street in order, the
police contrai, as ta speed and other conditions, rcsts with the city, and that same
arrangements have ta be made with them ta
contrai the speed on that street.
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friand bas forgotten who is the Chairman of
the Committee of which ha speaks. The
Chairman happers ta ba here in my persan.
We had a meeting this morning, and we have
had two or three bef are. I wilI not speak
of what we did, because we are not prepared
ta make a report; but I wiil say that a great
deal of difficulty arises on Wellington Street
because of the question of control, or perhaps I shouid say mixed contrai. The city
ciainis ta have certain rigihits and certain
obligations on Wellington Street with regard
ta traffic and other things, and the Department of Public Works also dlaims certatin
rights. I think a good deal of the trouble
might be avoided if tha Public Works Department and the Corporation werc asked toi

do I think there need be any fear in regard
to expenditures. Personally I had no thought
of summoning witnesses whose presence would
involve a large expense to the country. My
idea at the beginning was that we would get
ahi the prehiminary information from persons
conn ected with the various departments of
the Government; but of course when the
committee is constituted, the members of it
may desire to get a litthe more than that.
So far as expenditure is concerned, this motion
expresshy puts the matter within the control
of the Senate itsehf; that is to say, any expen(hiture must have the approval of -the
Senate. Then there is the final control in
the Government itself, inasmuch as they hohd
the purse, and if this or any committee desires
to make an expenditure it eau onl3r do so
wlien the Go,;ernment is williug to provide
the funds; so that even if there were any
inclination ou the part of this or auy other
committee to make expenditure, they are very
carefuhly surrounded with safeguards.
There is just one other point I wish to,
mention. W/hen I gave notice of the motion,
without thinking very much about the matter
I flxedi the number of the committee at fifteen.
The notice was prepared in a hurry, and I
had no particular reason for fixing that number. Since that time I have learned tiiat
quite a number of honourable members of
this House wouhd hike to be on the committee,
and after consulting with the leader of the
House, we -have 1omne to the conclusion that
the number shouhd be increased to twentyfive; so, I amn going to ask the House to agree
to an amendinent of the motion for that purpose. I will read what I propose:
That the motion lie aînended by striking out
the word "flfteen" in the eighth line thereof,
and substituting the word "twenty-five"; and
liy adding the following words, "and that the
comrnittee lie composed of the Honourable
Messieurs-"
My houuurable friend, the leader of the
House, bas some names, and I have some
other naines, which together will make twentyfive, and with the permission of the House
I wouhd now submit this as an amendment
to the motion.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND READINC

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
veading of -Bill 170, an Act to amend the
Special Wa.r Revenue Act.
Ha said: This Bill amends a number of
clauses of the Special War Revenue Act.
By section 1, Part Il of Chapter 179 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is ýrepealed. This Part imposes a tax of one per
cent upon the gross interest from, bans and
investmants in Canada and upon the gross
mncome fromn business transactions -in Canada.
The Icorne Tax Act provides t-hat this tax
is a daduction from the income tax. This
tax is eollected generally fromn companies
having practically no profits, as companies doing a large business as a rule, are not hiable
to the tax, because their income tax is greater
than the amount undar this Part.
The reduction in revenue is estimated at
$30,000.
Section 2: There is an excise tax under
section 19B on passengar automobiles manufaetured and sold in Canada or imported into
Canada. If, however, a transportation. coinpany or private individual buys a chassis or
bus body, or both separately and puts them
together, for its or his own use, and does not
sali, he escapes this impost. This discriminates against the bus or body builder who selîs
to the trade.
The new section provides that automobiles
for the use of the manufacturer or producer,
and not for sale, are hiabla to the tax.
Section 3 states that the sales tax is reducad from-n 4 to 3 per cent. Lt ie astirnated
that the reduction will ba $16,000,000.
As to section 4, I may say that item 54
in the customs tariff was changed to item 538,
and this nacessitated the amendment.
Sections 5, 6 and 7, corne under the Commissioner of Excise. There are side notes to
these other clauses which. give a fair idea of
the reasons for the changes. When we go
into Committae on the Bill I wilh bring to
tha Chamber any further information that it
needs.

I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second tîme.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It seems to me
that this opens up a very important question.
The Turtle Mountain reserve, in Southern
Manitoba, ;s the on.e with which I am most
familiar. There is a considerable quantity
of land in that reserve which is suitable for
agricultural purposes. During the time I was
i member of the other Hoiuse I was frequently
called upon to see if I could not have some
of that land opened for homesteading. and
while it was my duty, as a representative of
the people of that district, to make inquiry,
and perhaps make some pretense of having
those lands opened up, I was always pleased
whven the Government refused to open them

up.

I think we should be exceedingly careful
bow we witid-aw land fron the reserves in
Western Can'.da for homcsteading or agricultural purposes. The number of acres of
forest land in the West is comparatively
small. I know that in my particular district
pople are constantly wanting to get part of
those lands away fron the reserve, and it
looks to me as though this were a case of
that sort. There is any amount of land in
rhp West for farming purposes without withdrawing lands from the forest reserves.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I have only
glanced at the Bill, but it appears to me that
the lands to be withdrawn are on the boundaries of the reserves.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. They are
agricultural lands devoid of trees, and are
withdrawn in order to help the settlement
and development of those districts. This work
is donc most carefully after an expert survey,
and is very closely superintended by the
officials of the Department.
My honourable friend can see the smaliness
of the invasion brought about by this Bill.
Of course, never having visited any of these
reserves personally, I do not know the exact
condition, but since I have been in my present
position, the Department has occasionally
presented similar Bills. Under this Bill there
is but one quarter section withdrawn in
Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
ing Mountain reserve?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Is that the RidYes.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Perhaps my honourable friend does not know that there is an
agitation, in fact more than an agitation, to
have a public park established in the Province
of Manitoba, and that there is some controversy as to whether it should be located at
the Riding Mountain reserve or at another
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

reserve to the east of Winnipeg. It seems
almost ridiculous that we should go to the
length of passing an Act of Parliament to
withdraw a single quarter section of land.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
There are
vithdrawals in the other Privinces too.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
I am talking
of Riding Mountain. I understand that we
are putting a Bill through this House for the
purpose of withdrawing one quarter section,
160 acres of land, from the Riding Mountain
reserve. I would like to know why that is
being donc.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: It seems to me that
the Government should go very slowly in
withdrawing land from these reserves. There
is always somebody who is ready to ask for
the withdrawal of land froam reserves for some
particular purpose. Sometimes one can make
the Department believe that he wants the
land for a farm, whereas he wants it for a
mineral claim, or for establishing a stopping
house or something of that kind. These stopping houses, and all conveniences of that kind,
are under the control of the Government as
long as they are within the reserve. Surely
there is some particular reason why a quarter
section should come out of a reserve. It
cannot be that we are so destitute of arable
land that we must do that in order to get
farms. There must be some reason behind
it. Let us know what it is, and let us be
careful what we do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the members
of this Chamber froni the West, who know
conditions there. need further information, I
can postpone this stage of the Bill, and can
either ask them to go to the Department before the Bill is adopted and examine into the
matter with the chiefs of the Departmnent, or
refer the Bill to a Committee, if it is thought
worth while, where honourable gentlemen
could see naps and get into direct contact
with the Department officials. There is no
reason why in such a matter as this we should
not satisfy all the members of the Senate who
are interested. The Departments have nothing to hide, and will lay all their cards on the
tabl e.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I am not suggeeting that at all. What I would like to
know is why one quarter section in the Riding Mountain reserve is being withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There do not appear to be any withdrawals from the park
areas in Alberta, consequently I do not speak
with anv knowledge as to the parts affected
by the Bil. It secms to mae that it is mcrcly

APRIL 20, 1M2
a question of whether these deductions are
arrived at on the motion of the officers of
the Department, honestly conceiving that the
land in question is arable land and therafore
should be taken for agricultural purposes
rather than ha allowad to remain cumbarad
with forests t-hat may taka years to grow, or
whether behind these withdrawals are applications of individuals who covat this land and
Who, whan it is thrown open, propose to acquire it and add it to their own holdings
If it can ba established here that this Bill
cornes about fromn a desire of the experts of
the Dapartment to make agricultural land
avai lable for agri-cuflural purposes, it is another stor.y. It seems to me that is the whole
point.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Perhaps the question I asked can be answerad now.
Hon. Mr. GRIFSBACH: There is another
aspect. The way in which this Bill has been
drawn is apt to arouse suspicion. Instead of
jhe Bill having bean drawn Vo take out the
quarter sections in question, it bas bean drawn
so as to repeat the whole description of the
whola area under di*scusion. The Bill is apparently much more consaquential than the
land itself.
Hon. Mr. DANDU RAND: 1 was under
the impression that I had stated the policy
of the Department when I presented the Bill
for second reading.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What bas been
said in refarence to Manitoba is almost equally
applicable to Saskatchawan, whare they are
withdrawing a half section.

pertaining to advertising and importing inferior grades of seed to the disadvantage of
consumers in general.
With thecse explanations I move the second
reading of tihis Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would gladly
send this Bill to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, but I doubt if the members of that Committee will dlaim a special
knowledge of seeds.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It seems to me
thnt this question of seeds is very closely
allied to the question of weeds. The whole of
the prairie provinces are tremendoushy intercsted in the growth of the sow-thistle and
obnoxious weeds of that sort. I have not
read the Bill, but if it bas for its object the
purification of seeds and the control of the
sale of seeds, it will prove a very interesting
piece of legislation to the provinces which.
are now very much worried about the seed
question. I saw a statement that a great deal
of thc secd sown contained a large proportion
of weed seed. It is a large question, and the
Bill might well go to the Co-mmittee on Agriculture for examination, and we might hear
something from the provinces in connection
with it.
Well, I might
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
put it down for Committee of the Whole on
Wednesday next, and see meantime if we
cannot select a Commnittee of specialists to
deal with it.
DOMINION LANDS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 199, an Act to amend the
Dominion Lands Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the object
of this Bihl is to facilitate the securing by
settlers in the West of a second homestead if
they have disposed of or have lost 'their
original homestead.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not understand that case. The losing of a homestead
has surely nothing to do with the matter.
As I read thc Bill, it confers upon a person
the right to a second homestcad if lie had a
homestead prior to the first of January, 1925.

283

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read the
clause and then see if my explanation accords
with the terms of the Act itself.
Except as otherwise provided in this Act.
every person who has received or receives, or
bas become or becomes entitled to letters patent
for a homiestead by the performance of homestead duties, with or without payment of purchase money, or by the location of scrip thereon,
shall be deemed to have exhausted his homestead right and shall not be entitled to obtain
another entry for a free homestead;
Provided, however, that any person who on
the first day of January, 1925, had obtained
or had become entitled to letters patent for a
bhomestead as aforesaid, may be granted the
righit to imake entry for a second homestead,
subject to the provisions of this Act.
The holder of a pre-emiption or purchased
hiomestead entry small not be permnitted to
abandon the saine in his own f avour or in
favouir of a relative for the purpose of making
entry for the land as a second homestead under
the provision of this subsection.
The explanation which I intended giving
this Chamber is based on my understanding
of the matter, and is subject to correction,
for I arn not myseif familiar with the working
of the Act. However, I think my information
is correct. Under the present law-for it is
not yet amended-if a settler received his
patent before 1889 lie was and is entitled to,
a second homestead. That grants the right
to ail the old settlers. Those who came in
after 1889 could not obtain a second homestead. The son could, on reaching eighteen
years. The father could not.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Just a moment.
The honourable gentleman does not mean to
say that the son could take a second homestead.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He could take
a homestead in his own name.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But any son, or
anybody aged eighteen, could do that.
Yes. If for
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
any cause a homesteader had lost or disposed
of his farm, hie -could not obtain a second one
after 1889. IJnder this Bill the advantage
which the old settier had Up to 1889 is made
available to nîl those who settled prior to
1925. Practically it means that the year 1889
is replaced by the year 1925.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Was not the time extended after 1889? I was under the impression
that the time in whidh one could take advantage of a second homestead was extended
after that year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA'ND: It is being extended to 1925 by this Bill.

284

SENÂTE

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: But I understood that
prior to this change that is now being made
the time up to which. a settier could take
advantage of a second homestead was exf eaded after 1889. I may be wrong in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is not in

APRIL 20, 1928
but 1 do think this is a very important piece
of Iegislation. It confers upon every person
who has had only one homestead the right
to amother one. That is clear from the
.explanation. It is clear also that this will
te'nd to exhaust the number of homesteads
available for general settiement. Whether or
flot there is a measure of justice due to those
who homesteaded prior to 1925, which entitles
theai to this sppcial conideration, is a matter
for very careful thought. but this proposed
legisiation would have, I think, a profound
effect upon the whole settiement question in
t he West andi I.gravcly doubt whether, with
the small nuraber here present to-day, and
wxithout a very careful inquiry, we shoulti
assume the responaibility of dealing with it.
Han. Mr. GILLIS:
loft over.

I think it should be

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 think the Western men wvill agree with me that from the
point of vieav of our western people this is a
désirable piece of legislation, 'but if you are
goia.g to confer upon ail the people who have
ever had a homesteati the right ta take another one it is obvious that yo-u will seriously deplete the aumiber of homesteads that
are available.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Couiti the honourable gentleman expiain what has been the
effeet upon settiement in the Western provinces of the privilege which was aacordeti to
the boniiesteaders who oYbtained their patent
before 1889?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND:
0f course the
homegteaders were thea less numerous.
lion. Mr. GRIES3BAiCH: That is a long
time ago, and there were comparatively few
settiers in the country at that time. My recollection is that the législation was passeti long
after 1889. Speaking from memory, I think
it was -a good maay years later, probably
about 1906; but thé legislation was dated baek
sa as to apply to those pioneers as a measure
of reward for their efforts in settling this
country. Everybody agreeti to it at that
time. In the first place, the num1ber of those
who could take ativantage of it wa-s comparatively small, and when, the legislation was
passed, in 1906, or whenever it was, there
were still aiany homeisteads available, so that
the nuaiher of settiers who hati taken homnesteads prior to 1889 and coulti take advaatage
of the Act did not seriously affect the situat ion. Ta-day the situation is quite different,
because this Bill would extend the saine priviloge to ail those who obtained patents up to

2&5

1925, and there may be six or seven hundreti
thousand of theai. There aiay be many more.
Other honourable gentlemen from the West
can make as gond a guess as I can. But if
there were 600,000 settîcrs with homestead
entries in those three Western provinces in
1925 and they decide to exorcise their right
or take advantage of it somehow, as most of
them will do, it will ýseriously aff ect the settlement situation, if the granting of free homnesteatis is any inducement to settiement.
That is another question. Somne people think
it is. others think it is not. However, %vehave
offered free homesteads ta incoming settiers.
Son e people aiay say that our nId timers
and present settiers are more entitleti to free
hoateads than are the newcoaiers. This
Bill involves a serious question of policy
which, it secais ta me, ought ta be carefully
inquired into. I am bouati ta say that I had
not heard of the Bill bef are. I shoulti have
t.houglit that it would have attracteti a great
deal more attention in the other House. Certainly I think aur Western mien should speak
on it.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Under section 3 is there
not a change as ta the initial payment and
the period over which the payments are
spread? I think the in-itial payment was
forierly 5 per cent and this is aow increased
ta 10 per cent.
Section 3 refera to sales of
school lands.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
There
are two clauses to which I have nt referreti:
they cover sales of school lands, andi ternis of
payments. Section 2 would enable the Minister ta selSehool lands required for reservoir, church,
ceaietery or hospital sites, orand this is the ameadmentor for other public purposes, or as righit of
%vay for any project.
The Minister may sellat a price to be fixed by an officer of the Departaient as the actual nmarket value of the
land, and upon sucli teras of payaient as the
Minister niay prescribe, provideti that the Governaient of the Province in which the land is
situated expresses its approval of the sale and
price in each case.
I shoulti think this would be very gond safe-

guard.
The last clause, section 3, says:
In respect of sales of school lands made subsequent to the first day of April, 1928, the
amount ta he paid in cash at the time of sale
shaîl be one-tenth of the purchase priceHon. Mr. GILLIS:
5 per cent.

I think the old rate was

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
per cent.

Yes, it was 5

g86

SENATE

and the balance of such purchase shall be paid
in eighteen equal, successive, annual instalments
with interest at the rate of six per cent per
annum.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The old regulation was
ten annual payments, I think.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
From 1908 to 1923 the Act required onetenth of the purchase price to be paid at the
time of sale. with the balance in nine annual
instalments.
In 1923 the Act weas cianged to allow the
payment of one-twentieth of the purchase pries
at date of sale, the balance to be paid in nineteen annual instalments.
It is now proposed to provide that in the case
of future sales of school lands the original
arrangement shall prevail as to the amount to
be paid at the date of the sale, that is to say,
one-tenth must be paid down. The remainder
of the purchase price may be spread over
eighteen annual payments with interest.
The principal reason for the proposed amendment is that experience goes to show that the
payment of one-twentieth of the purchase price
at time of sale is not a sufficient guîarantee of
bona fides, and that one-tenth of the purchase
price would not be too much to ask as the
initial payment fron those-who purchase school
lands.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is very true.
We might take

PARLIAMENT GROUNDS-TRAFFIC
REGULATION
REPLY TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) has made an inquiry concerning the regulation of traffic on Parliament Hill and on the street in front of the
Hill.
I have, in answer to his query. a state-

APRIL 24, 1928
ment addressed by the Deputy Minister of
Public Works to his Minister, which reads as
follows:
I beg to call your attention to a discussion
is regard to traffie regulations on Parliament
grounds, which took place in the Senate on
Friday, April 20th instant. Attached is copy
cf Hansard which contains the remarks then
made.
I might say in regard to the subjects
referred to, namely, parking and speed of
cars on Parliament Hill and speed of cars on
Wellington Street, that when the walks and
drives around the Parliament Buildings were
completed, special spaces were allocated for
parking on the east and west sides of the
building, and as it was found that these were
not being utilized as intended, in the fall of
1925, lines were drawn on the pavement in
front of the building prohibiting parking in
front thereof, and instructions were given the
constables on duty on the grounds that cars
were to be properly parked. This was continued in 1926, 1927 and up to the present,
but the constables on that duty find themselves
unable to enforce the instructions.
A great many people, as you are no doubt
aware, in attendance at Parliament have the
idea that they are a law unto themselves when
they are on Government grounds and resent
being spoken to or directed in any way as to
what they should do.
The constables have
had the experience that when they spoke to
drivers of cars, the latter seemed to imagine
that because they drove for a Minister, member
of Parliament, a Senator or other high official,
that they were privileged to do as they liked.
The whole trouble apparently is that there is
no neans of enforcing the regulations made.
That is, there is no penalty.
The city by-law of course does not give the
Magistrate any jurisdiction on Parliament Hill.
Therefore there is no way of summoning anyone
w'ho does not abide by the Government regulations and having him fined. I imagine the only
course would be to pass some special legislation having to do with Government property,
giving the Governor-in-Council authority to
make regulations relating to Parliament Hill
and any other Government sites where necessary. In that event. infractions of the regulations could be dealt with and the offending
party summoned and fined the same as he
would be in any other part of the City.
Similar efforts have been made to enforce
the same speed limits within Parliament Hill
grounds as apply elsewhere in the city, but
these efforts have failed for the same reason,
no attention being paid to the constable, as
the offending party knew that the latter had
no recourse against him if he did not comply
with the constable's request.
With reference to Wellington Street, this
street is under City jurisdiction so far as
traffie regulations are concerned, and I attach
a copy of letter which I have written the
Mayor, requesting him, in view of the complaints made about driving at excessive speed
along that street, to place sufficient traffie
officers to prevent any excess over the legalized
speed limit.
The Parliament Buildings being situated as
they are makes it a much more difficult proposition to handle traffic than if they were on
the level, as it means driving up and down hill

287

when approaching or leaving them. Moreover,
the difficulties of the situation are accentuated
by the fact that the entrances are not opposite
the City streets nor opposite the driveiays
within the grounds, which results in double
turns, which are always dangerous.
It bas been suggested that the only entrance
to the Parliament grounds be through the
centre gate, and that the entrance there be
enlarged so as to provide for ingoing and outgoing traffic, the present centre gate now used
for vehicular traffie to be used by pedestrians.
it would require of course an appropriation
and time to carry such a change out during
the coming summer.
In the meantime, if it is desired to enforce
one-way traffic, the only way apparently to
do that is to have all vehicles enter by the
east gate and leave by the centre or west gate.
A great deal of the trouble now, it seems to
me, arises from the fact that motorists proceed
in both directions-come in the east gate, turn
around in front of the Parliament Buildings
and depart through the east gate. If the traffie
were all moved in the one direction, pedestrians
as well as motorists themselves, would know
what to expect and be able to guard themselves
more effectively.
(Signed) J. B. Hunter,
Deputy Minister.
The letter which Mr. Hunter wrote to the
Mayor of Ottawa reads as follows:
April 23, 1928.
Dear Mr. Mayor:
You may have seen in the Press an account
of the discussion which took place in the Senate
on Friday. April 20th, in regard to fast driving
along Wellington Street.
To give you an idea of the nature of the
complaint, I may quote the remarks of one of
the Senators, which were as follows:
"I would like to see this go a little further.
I do not think I have ever been in any city
where J have seen such fast driving as there
is right through Wellington street. That is
where danger is. When you are going out of
either of the gates. the parking of automobiles
right up to the gate, makes it impossible to
see others coming along the street. You cannot cross Wellington street but you will see
automobiles coming along at forty or fifty miles
an hour. I was going to su gest that perhaps
the traffic officers might be p aced in the centre
of the road opposite the gate to put an end to
that sort of thing. I do not know why we
have not got traffe officers there now. If you
go down to Sparks street, where there is not
as much trafic as there is on Wellington street,
you will find plenty of traffic officers."
I would ask you to be good enough to
authorize some traffic offBeors to be placed on
Wellington Street immediately in order that
motorists may conform to the City regulations
regarding the rate of speed at which they are
allowed to travel.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) J. B. Hunter,
Deputy Minister.
I bave asked the Minister to kindly consider what solution he could give to the
trouble which is indicated in that report.

SENATE
BREACH

OF AEROPLANE

CONTRACT

EXPLANATION DESIRED

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. POPE: I desire to draw the
attention of the honourable leader of the
Government to a matter in connection with
the contract of a Mr. Cannon, who seems to
re.present the aeroplane service for the city of
Quebec. I do not know exactly what the style
of his organization is, but I understand he
holds the contract for carrying Canadian mails
from Father Point to Montreal by aeroplane.
The Associated Sereen News, Limited, of
Montrea], made definite arrangements with
Mr. Cannon to carry down to the landing
place of the aeroplane Bremen at Greenely
Island a representative of the Associated
Sereen News and Canadian Press representalives. I understand the arrangement was for
the payment of $100 per plane mile.
Eerything was concluded satisfactorily, as
it was supposed, with Mr. Cannon, who represented the Canadian Transcontinental Airways Company; but when the time came
for carrving out the contract, the New York
papers came forward with another offer, and
the Screen News of Canada was not asked
to coridcr anything further in the way of
price, but they were notified that their contract fer representing Canada on that very
auspicious occasion 'as cancelled, without any
busnoss reason being stated.
Now, Mr. Cannon and his associates are
carrying mails, as I understand, from Father
Point to Montreal, so they must have some
government contract or some relations with
the Government of Canada; and I do not
think it is fair that anybody having such a
contract should take the opportunity of receiving frcm the learst newspapers of New
York an increased price, to the detriment of
our owi people, who dcsired and arranged to
be represented upon an occasion so important.
I therefore take this opportunity of calling
the attention of the honourable leader to this
matter, in the hope that he may look into it
and ascertain whvere the difficulty was, and
why Canadians were not given the opportunity
of being represented on that occasion.
I confess my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ignorance of any arrangement that may have
been made between the Federal authorities
and any association, aeroplane or other; so
that, from the statement of my honourable
friend, I cannot see that there is any contract between that association and the Federal authorities; but I will find out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. POPE: The honourable gentleman is aware that that organization, the
Canadian Transcontinental Airways Company,
carry our mails from Father Point to Montreal by acrial service, is he not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know there is
such a service, but I did not know that the
society or corporation of which my honourable friend speaks was on a contract with the
Federal government.
Hon. Mr. POPE: But they could not make
a contract with any other Government to
carry the Government mails, could they?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I did not
know that my honourable friend was referring
to a company that bad the carrying of the
mails.
Hon..Mr. POPE: Yes, I am.

LAC SEUL CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
rea.d'ing of Bill 195, an Act to facilitate the
provision of storage in Lac Seul, in the province cf Ontario, and te repeal the Lake cf
the Woods Reguýlation Act, 1921.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, those who
were in this Chainher or in the other Chamber
in 1921 will remember the legislation wbicb
was passed dealing with the administration
of lhe Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul, and
the difficulty there was in reconciling the
interests cf Manitoba and Ontario. At one
time it had been decided bctween the Dominion Government, acting in the right cf
Manitoba, and the Ontario Gevernment, te
appoint a joint board, and it was agreed that
there should be concurrent legislation îpassed
by this Parliament and by the Ontario Legislature. The Parliament cf Canada did its
part, but througb some difficulty in the Ontarie Legîslature prorogation teck place witheut the concurrent legislation being passed.
The Government of the day at Ottawa then
decided te act on its ewn authcrity and te
legislate regarding the administration cf the
two lakes and the English river. It passed
an Act declaring that the works on those
waters wcre for the general advantage cf
Canada, and tbus assumed jurisdicticn over
that part cf Ontario and Manitoba.
Efforts were made later on between the
parties te coma te some understanding, and
we had some echo cf it in the Bills that came
te this Chamber at twe succeeding Sessions,
but which did net meet wîth the approval cf
the malerity ef the Senate. Now, in a far
more serene atmcsphere, I have again te deal
with what in the past was a very vexed
question. Ahl the parties interested have
agreed upon the Bill which is now in my
hand, and therefore I will explain the events
leading up te the agreement between the
Dominion, Ontario, and Manitoba, whicha provides for the securing ef sterage in Lac Seul,
and for the repeal cf the Lake ef the Woods
Regulation Act cf 1921:
The Department cf the Interior, in the exer.

t.erests. The terms and conditions of the agreement have been checked over and agreed upon
hy the responsible administrative officiais of the
Ontario Goverument, as well as by the Engineers of the Ontario Hydro-Electrie Power
Commission; they have also been checked over
and agreed upon by representatives of the City
of Winnipeg, the power interests of Manitoba
including the City of Winnipeg, Winnipeg
Electric Railway Company and the Manitoba
Power Company, and have further been considered and agreed upon by the Provincial Government of Manitoba.
In explanation of the repeal of the Lake of
the Woods Regulation Act of 1921, provided
for in Section 3 of the Bill, it might be stated
that Concurrent Legisiation embodying the samne
principles as the Itegulation Act with respect
to contrai of the flow frorn the Lake of the
Woods and Lac Seul, is already on tie Statute
Books of the Dominion and of Ontario. The
Ontario Act bas, however, not been prociaimed
and( its proclamation is contingent upon the
rescinding of. the Dominion Lake of the Woods
Regulation Act of 1921, -%hich contains a
"Igeneral acivantage" clause declaring structures
on the Engligh and Winnipeg rivers to be to
the general advantage of Canada. The execution of the agreement herein-above referred to
between the Dominion. Ontario and Manitoba,
in conjunetion witli the bringing into ýforce of
the~ Concurrcnt Legislation, makes the "general
advantage" legislation contained in the Lake
of 1ie Woods Regulation Act unneceqsary for
the further protection of Mani toba interests.
The repeai of the Lake of the Woods Regulation Act has, therefore, been concurred in hy ail
autiioritice concerned. includfing the Government
of Manitoba, the City of Winnipeg, the Winnipeg Electrie Railway Comnany, the Malnitobat
Power Coinpany and the Province of Ontario.

them was mucli as the oid Tiber was to the
Romans. An agreement was then reacbed
that these Commissioners should have power
to enforce their regulations. The Ontario
Government. entered into a soiemn agreement
tbat tbey would pass legisiation concurrent
witb that passed by the Dominion. The
Drury Government, however, feli down, and
was unabie to pass it. Perhaps it wouid not
be proper to mention the cause at the present
time. At any rate, it was flot on account of
any adjourniment.
The Dominion Government, under Mr. Meighen, in the face of these.
facts, passed wbat is calied the Lake of the
Woods Regulation Act, which deciared that
ail works on the river sbould 'be for the
generai advantage of Canada, and unider
w'hich the Dominion Government had the
power ta regulate the flow of the water, thus
protecting the people of Manitoba, and
especiaiiy the people of Winnipeg; because
if the flow was reduced to a certain extent it
wouid deprive tbemn o! electric power for
lighting and manufacturing purposes. On twa
occasions the present Government presented
a Biii to repeal the Lake of the Woods Act,
which, as I said before, wouid have le! t
the city of Winnipeg and the province of
Manitoba at the mercy of Mr. Backus and
bis interests.

The statement which I have read is signed
by J. T. Johnston, Director of Water Power
and Reciamation for the Federal Government.
With these expianations I move the second
reading of this Biii.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is net quite rigbt. The Federai Government brought in legisiation because of a
clear understanding with the Government of
Ontario, an understanding whieb bad satisfied
the Meigben Government, but wbich was not
at tbe time carried out by the then Provincial
G avernment.

Hon. L. MeMEANS:
Honourable gentlemen, with your permission 1 sbould like to
add juFt a few words to the explanation given
by the Leader of the Government.
This
matter bas been before the House on two
separate occasions, and I arn happy to say
that it bas now reacbed a final issue. I would
like ta ppint out, however, that wben the
Lake of the Woods Bill was first passed, it
was because the two Commissioners, appointed
by the Dominion and by the Province of
Ontario, had no0 power to enforce any regulations, aithough they were appointed to
regulate the Aiow of water. This condition of
affairs lef t the city of Winnipeg and the
Province of Manitoba at the mercy of a
gentleman welI known to ail of us in Canada,
Mr. Backus, who bad bought up the old
Keewatin Power Company, and bad a dam
upon the river upon which the city of Winnipeg and the Province of Manitoba depended for their electrie power, and which to

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I beg to differ with
the bonourable gentleman. An attempt was
made to raise the cry tbat this was anl interference with the provincial rights of Ontario.
These waters, the Lake of the Woods and the
Winnipeg River, were not merely interprovincial, but they were international, and
portions o! tbema were within Manitoba,
However that may be, I am coming to this
one point, tbat on two occasions the Government presented legisiation for the repeai of
tbe Lake of tbe Woods Regulation Act, and
on two occasions, I am proud to say, the
Senate tbrew it out. Now, you may imagine
the dismay tbat went tbrough the city of
Winnipeg and tbrough the province of
Manitoba wben it waq known that the Governiment of Canada intended to repeal that
Act, the only protection that tbey had. Therefore they relied-and I arn happy to say they
relied witb a good deal of security-upon this
hon-ourable body, and tbey appealed ta it.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
also.

That is what I said

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (rcading):
-and the Dominion Parliament; during the
sanie Session tank power ta establish a Confrol
Board and declared that the works were for
the general advanfage of Canada.
My honourable friend will sec that, word for
word, I have been repeating what my memory
had rctained of the events.
In 80 declaring the Dominion of Canada was
able ta legisiate. The 'stafute has been an aur
Sfatute Book ever since. The Legisiature of
Ontario af ifs nexf Session did do its part,
implemenfing ifs obligation ta legisiaf e.
When the Dominion Parliament passcd that
second Act-containing the clause with respect
ta works for the gencral advantage ai Canadapower ta deal wifh the mnatter as
-asmig
anc dleclared ta bie fo r the general advanfage
of Canada. the Prime Minister af the day
raaed fa the House of Commons that the Acf
would be repealed when Ontario carricd ouf ifs
agreemnent by enacfing the promised legisiafion.
Thaf Prime Minister was not at the helm in
the following year, but the Prime Minister
who followed him assumed the obligation
which had been declared ta be binding on
the Federal Gavernmenf, and fthc legislation
followed.
The Prime Minister who made thaf statement and bis Cabinet wenf ouf of affice and
the succeeding Covernmenf lasf Sessian proceeded fa implement the under'taking af ifs
predecessor by hringing in legisiafion for the
repeal of the Federal Acf. But the proposed
legisiafion met in this Chamber wifh some
opposition; if was opposed alsa in the other
Chamnber.
Sa I could nat allow f0 go unchallenged the
stafement of my honourable friend thaf I

The

The contention was
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
as to wbcther the Ontario government would
pass the Act and sign the agreement, but they
would not do it until this was repealed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Ah, naturally.

Hýon. Mr. MeMEANS: There is just one
other thing I would like f0 point ouit f0 my
honiourable friend, in a sqpinit of friendliness.
Depufation after depufation came down from
the city of Winnipeg, from the Electric Railway Cornpany, and from the Province of
Manitoba.' kndcking at tàhe doors of the
CGnvernment, .begging tîhem not to repeal that
Acf., saying that the whole future of their
province and the very life-blood of the ci-ty
of Winnipeg were at stake; but a deaf car
was týurned ta ail that; and, in spite of t-hose
proteets, and in spite of the represenitations
which were made, the Dominion, Government
still passed in the House of Commons that
Act ta repeal tihe Lake -of the Woods Regulation Act. The Senate threw it out. That
is all I wanted ta say. I am very happy tliat,
a solution has been arrived at; and, I repent,
if is a matter of groat congratulation to the
Senate of Canada thaf if is still alive to the
fa&t that there are intercats in this country
whichi if is bound f0 proteaf, and in that
case if certainly did pratect fbem.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, on the

Navigation with Spain, a clause of which provided that the terms could be extended te

British Dominions
any cf the
Dominion's option. On the 27th of June, 1924,
Creat Britain and Spain entered into an

entered into an agreernent with Spain whereby
Canada, granted the intermediate tariff in
ecange for the second colurnn cf the Spauiish
tariff. It was a clause cf this Agreement:

APRIL 24, 1928
While the second column of the Spanish
tariff is considerably lower than the first,
Canada is at a disadvantage at present, owing
to the Conventional rates being considerably
lower than the second column. This is true
of many manufactured produets that we might
seIl, and in respect to fish it places Canada at
a disadvantage as compared with Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Could my honourable friend inform the House what constitutes the imports from Spain into Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will give the
principal imports. My honourable friend will
remember that the total imports I gave as
$2,221,149. The principal imports in 1927,
with a total value of about $1,500,000, were:
Nuts, $770,572;
Rice, uncleaned, 3,006,341 lhs-that is on
the free iist;
Raisins, 1,035,829 lbs.;
Wines, non-sparkling, $294 ,381;
Cork manufactures, M30,907;
Salt, 403,088 cwt.; that is on the free list.
Our main exports have been:
Rubber tires, $37,932;
Farm implements and machinery, $236,202;
Automobiles, $27,266;
Automobile parts, $689;
Machinery, 323,936;
Electrie apparatus, porcelain insulators, etc.,
$23,576;
Codfish, $4»37;
Salmon, canned, $119;
Cheese, $918;
Soda and Sodlitra compounds, $25,481;
Ail other articIcs, $161,771.
Quite a number of articles, which I need
flot put on Hansard, will benefit largely by

the Treaty or Convention rates.
The United States has substantially a mostfavoured-nation status with Spain.

Item
No.

The following Canadian articles are at a
dýisadvantage in comparison with like goods
from the United Kingdoma and certain other
countries: Canned salmron, sait codfish, rubber tires, hay rakes, tihreshing machines, and

automobiles.
The United Kingdom bas most-favourednation treatment with Spain. If Canada accept the treaty, she will enjoy the same advantages as the mother country.
The foilowing articles are free of customs
duty in ahl tariffs: Oranges; rice, uncleaned;
and sait for sea or gulf fisheries.
On the following articles the general and
intermediate tariffs are the same: Currants,
dried; figs, dried; raisins; fruit in airtight
cans; nuts; onions; olive oul, spices and corks.
On the f ollowing articles there is no difference between the rates of the intermediate
tariff and thbe rates of treaties granting mostfavoured-nation treatment: Grapes; onions;
olives; spices3; spirits; wines, non-sparkling,
con.taining more than 26 per cent of proof
spirit; and certain corks.
Honourable gentlemen will see that most of
our i.mports f com Spain are not of a similar
nature to what we produce ourselves.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Does Canada get any
advantage under the propose-d legislation in
the article of fish?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes. Honourable gentlemen will see that the Spanish
tariff speaks of pesetas; a gold peseta equals
19.*3 cents in Canadian money; a kilog. equals
2.2 pounids. The Spanish tariff is divided
into First Tariff, and Second Tariff, and the
following table shows the rates for these, and
also the treaty rates. We are get'ting the
Treaty rates aecording to the second column
in the folocwing table:

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: How does that tariff
on fish compare with the tariff against Newfoundland? Will we be placed on an equalitY
with Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, we will geV
on an equal footing with Newfoundland if we
pass this Treaty.
Hon. Mr. PREID: May 1 ask the honourable
leader if he intends to urge that this Treaty
should go tihrough to-night? 1 understood hiým
to say that he had several pages of tables, and
of course it is impossible for us to follow the
changes and understand themn as they are given
verbally in this House. 1 was going to suggest
t'hat he put those in the Hansard, se that we
could see them and bring the matter up tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I can do that.

Hon. Mr. REID: If that is idonc I wish to
get some information about one or two clauses
in the T1reaty.
Hon. 'Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And others of
us will want to have something Vo say on certain phases of that Treaty.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: As uay honourable friend would like to look at this statement, I wili place it on Hansard so that he
may examine it before I move the third
reading to-morrow.
There is no ps.rticular
reason to go to Committee with this Bill,
because its objeet is simply the approval of
the Treaty.
Hlon. Mr. REID: I was geing to suggest
Thursday, hecause we ;vill not get Hansard
until noon to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will do whatever my honourablc, friend desires.
Hon. Mr. REID: I do net wish to delay
the matter, but I would suggest Thursday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would ask
Mr. Russ~ell to, corne to the floor, if some
questions are to be put to, me.
I think I have spoken. of the agreement
between the United Kingdom and Spain
regulating the treatment of companies. There
i., speclal legisiation in Spain which. permits
cf a, heavier levy on foreign than on domestie
corporations, and the British Government bas
made an agreement by which no extra rates
wilil be levied on British corporations. That
will apply te the Dominions, provided the
Domrinions join in the acceptance of the
Treaty. Fer this reasen, and for the obvieus
advaniage that we would obtain, we have
decided te ask Parliament te approve of that
agreement.
I move the second reading of the Bill.

297

Hon. Mr. REIDThe explanatiens that
have been given by the honourable gentleman would lead us to believe that this is a
Treaty in se far a-s t.he tariffs between te
two ceuntries are ýconcerned; but it strikes
me that it gees farther than that, and gives
te Spanish vesseIs the right to navigate our
in.land waters.
Hen. Mr. DANDURAND: My honeurable
friend dees net mean that the Treaty gives
thema coasting rights?
Hon. Mr. REID: That is my interpretatien. That is why I say I would like te have
it theroughly undersVoed. Perhaps the hononurable gentleman could make inquiries,
and dater give us a little fuller explanation
thaiq he oan give to-night. Article 1 of course
affects navigation, but there is aise another
clause which might do se.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that?

WhaV article is

Hon. Mr. REID: Article 19. Article 1, I
think, refers almost entirely te navigation. I
will read it:
There shall be between the territories of the
two contracting parties reciprocal freedom of
commnerce and navigation.
The subjeets of each of the two contracting
parties shall h-ave liberty freely te comie, with
their ships and cargoes. to aIl places and ports
in the territories of the other. te m-hich subjccts of that contracting party are or may ho
permitted te come. and shaîl enjoy the samne
rights, privileges, liberties, faveurs, immiiunities
and exemptions in matters of commerce and
navigation as are or may be enjoyed by subjeets of that contracting party.
The subjecta of each of the contracting
parties shail net bie subject in respect of their
persons or property, or in respect of their
commerce or industry, te any taxes, whether
geiieral or local, or te iinposts or obligations,
of any kind wliatever, other or greater than
those whichi are or miay be imposed upon suhje<ets of the other. or subjects or citizens of
the inost favoured nation.
It is nevertheless uinderstood thtat the treatment te be accorded in the territeries of each
centracting party te the cempanies registered
iii the territories of the other shall form the
suhject of a separate special agreement between
the entracting parties.
I wouîd like to be certain whether that can
be interpreted as I suggest or net.

Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: I would ask iny
honourahie friand Vo look at Article 15, hocause it bears on the coasting trade.
Hon. Mr. REID: Ail right. 1 will reaýd
Article 15:
Tlie provisions if this treaty relating te the
iintial concession of national treatmient in
inatters of navigation do net apply te the
e.oastinig trade, in respect of which the subJects and vessels of the contracting parties
shaîl enjoy rnost-favoured-nation treatment.

You wili notice that thc last part of clause
15 gives Spanish vessels the right, ta take
merchandise from ane Canadian port to an'other, prox idedl that it is consigneod on a
through bill of iading. If a vessel took on at
Port Arthur a cargo consigned to Liverpool.
it could nioad it at Montreal. At ail evonts,
that is the way it appears ta me.
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAN-"D: No. A Spanish
vessel 0:11 take part of its cargo and beave it
in a British port and proceed ta another port
and delix or the balance of the cargo.
Hon. Mr. REID: 1 quito understand the
argument of the honourabie gentleman, but I
arn a littlo afraid that tihat is not quito as
plaio as it should be; therofore I wouid like

Thcon, as ta clause 19, 1 understand that any

A nuinbor of years ago we started out ta buiid

rez:uit was thaýt the uscfuiness of aur Canadian

extent that no ncw vesse 0 were construeted
for soine time. When compiaints were made
ta the Govcrnmont, they passeil a law that

ta a certain extent.

As 1 understand Article 19, a Spanish vesse
can go ta Eogiand andi ho registereti there
and become a British vessel. She wili thon

or sixty miles entirely within Canadian
territory for carrying cargoes from the United
States to Montreàl; but I think I arn riglit
when I say that 1 suppose every man in this
Huse knows that the largest proportion of
the grain, grown in Manitoba, Saska/tchewan
and Alberta, Ioaded at Port Arthur and
delivered to the city of Montreal and shi'pped
to England, was carried *by American vessels.
If my memory serves me, 60 per cent of that
traffic was carried in American vesels.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Were they flot excluded at one time from the carrying trade,
and is it not true that at th-at time we could
flot get the 'business carried on?
Hon. Mr. REID: I wjlI answer the honourable gentleman.
When Ogdensburg was the
American terminus and Presco'tt the Canadian
terminus-that is 'before large 'vessels were
buit on the Great Lakes-an Americait vessel
wouild load grain at Port Arthur and carry
it to Ogdensburg.
Then another American
vessel would take the grain through to Montreal, where it was discharged, and if týhere was
an American ocean-going vessel there, it would
carry the grain to the Old Country. When
large vessels were constructed on the Lakes,
of course the Canadian merchant marine built
large vesels, and the Canadian Government
built an elevator at Port Coiborne for the
transfer of grain hrou'ght down fromn Port
Arthur in our Canadian vessels, so that it
could be taken through to Montreal. Immediately the American vessels commenced to carry
grain to Buffalo, and there put it into Amenicen vessels-end I think the right honourable
gentleman fromn Brockville (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Graham) will bear me out when 1 say thet I
see them going down the river every day.
American vessels are earrying the grain ali the
way.
When this was brought to the attention of Sir John Thompson, hie said thet was
flot right, and accordingly, I tihink by order
in council. a smail tarit! wes put on Canad-ien
grain passing t'hrough the Welland Canal or
being cerried 'frorn Port Arthur to Montreal
entirely by foreign vesseis.
A considerahie
sum of money wes collected in tolls: of course
1Iarn oniy trusting to my memnory, but I think
it -amounted to probebly $160,000. Immediatciy the American Government took issue
with us, because it was considered an unfriendly act, and we had to back down and
give back the money. Ever since that time
a considerabie portion of the grain shipped-I
think it is 50 or 60 per cent-lias been carried
from Port Arthur to Montreai by American
vesseis.
Now, I wil t-eil you how this has effe'cted
the West. We have oniy a small merchant

29(

Marine es compared with that of the United
States, 'for the reason, tiht it is an imipossibility for us to get more of tha-t traffie, and
wîýth aIl those other foreigo vessets that are
comîng in there is of course only one way
in which our Cenadian Merchant Marine can
make any money, and that is to go into the
comibine, the Marine Associetion, whiose head
office is in Cleveland, and who make th~e
rates. We mnust either ýaocepit those rates or
be put out of business. 0f couine we agiree
to themn and they make pienty of money.
Let me give you an instance to show the
position in which we -are pliced. I remember
wel'l, andi I think other members of the House
wïll1 remerrlber, when vesseis wi4h a capa.city
of 85.000 bushels, the presenit Welland Canal
size, used 'to be 'the lergest vessels on the
Lakes, an'd they carried grain. and made
m'onuy in the 4uSineos, at five cents a bushel
fromn Port Arthur ito Montreai. Two or 'tirce
years ago the rates were 9,t something like
12 *eenits. If you want to see whaýt was the
rate lest year ail you have to do is to ask
the Bureau of Statistios. The average rate
from Port Arthur to Port Colborne or Buffalo
was three cents an'd a fraction; that is. bet'ween th'ree and four cents 'for 800 miles.
From Port Cýolborne 'to Monitreel the rate
was five !cents ansi a fraction. Whv, the Erie
Canal vesseis are caerrying grain down to
Montreal, and I see them passing every day.
Now, the reason I have explained to honourable gentlemen what hias happened in the
past is beceuse I thirek that if this Spanish
Treaty comes into effeet andi a Spanieh vessel
can 'lie made British simply by regi'steiring as
British, you wil have engaged on this traffie
between Port Arthur andi Monitreai a great
many vessels that have been built in Spain
and are rnanned entirely by Spanish seiýlors,
except for one man, the pilot.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Can that not be donc
now unsier British registry?
Honi. MT. REID: Not liv a Spanish vessel
as I understand. Norwegians arc the only
ones thit I have seen. I think it was lest
sumnmer I sew some Norwegian vesseis. I
m'ay be 'tolsi: "Those vessels corne w'ith a
cargo throu-gh 'to Port Arthur andi then they
go back with another cargo througli to Norway." Thait 'miay be. I do not know whether
we 'have themn n-ow or not, but we used to
have on 'the St. Lawrence veasels that would
leave at night with a cargo of whisky for
Cuba and wouild arrive baeck the next rnorning
ready for another load, when they had had
only about enough time to go as fer as
Monitreal.
What I fear is thait the propos2ed arrangement may 'be interpreted, as I have stated.

can take a

Hon. Mr. REID: Very few vessels take
cargoes up. Vessels come down with cargoes,
but they go up to Port Arthur empty. So our
coasting trade is affected by foreign vessels
carrying a large quantity of grain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. My honourable friend is in error, for the cargo taken at
Fort William or at any other port must be
delivered at a foreign port.
Hon. Mr. REID: Why should they go any
farther than Montreal? However, the honourable gentleman has referred to what happened
in 1913. Of course I am not finding fault
with that. It is possible that in 1913, when I
w-as a member of the Government, a treaty
of some kind may have been made which in
some respects has not been carried out in the
way intended; like the United States Treaty
to which I have referred. A mistake may have
been made. But now that we are makîng
new treaties J think we should be very
careful. The honourable gentleman will remember a concession that was maide to the
Norwegian vessels; I do not know whether
by his Government or by the Government of
which I was a member. Norwegian vessels
vere permitted to do a coasting trade in
Canada for a number of years, and if my
memory serves me aright that privilege
continued until we came into power in the
fall of 1911, towards the close of that season
of navigation. Norwegian vessels had for a
number of years the right to carry coal from
Nova Scotia to Montreal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That privilege
was given for good and valid reasons, but I
understand that they could not do so to-day
Hon. Mr. REID: No, because when we
came into power we started to adjust the
situation. We took up the matter at once,
and I will tell you how it was straightened
out: the war came on, those vessels were all
commandeered and had to go back to their
own country, and afterwards we did not permit them to start over again. That is the
explanation. It was rea|lly no government
that made the change.
Again take the clause that the honourable
gentleman has just read. M'aking a Treaty
with Ja.pan would not affect our Merchant
Marine. If Japanese vessels could go around
to the Atlantic and corne up the St. Lawrence
and do business up at Port Arthur and Fort
William our ships might be affected, but the
Japanese Treaty has not much effect on the
situation because the Japanese vessels are on
the wrong side of the continent, over in the
Pacific, and could not do a coasting trade.

301

Article 19 of the Spanish Treaty says:
All vessels whieh, according to British Law,
are to be deemed British vessels, and all vessels
which, according to Spanish Law, are to be
deemed Spanish vessels, shall, for the purposes
of this Treaty, be deemed British or Spanish
vessels respectively.
Now, the question I asked the honourable
gentleman -was this: could a Spanish vessel
register in England and then, like a British
vessel, be entitled to corne over here and
do a coasting trade? Anyone can go over
to England and buy a vessel cheap, and if
that vessel retains British registry and is
brought over here she competes with our
vessels and has the same right to do a coasting trade as a vessel built here in Canada. It would take a good lawyer to interpret that Article, but I would like to have
the Justice Department assure us that there
is no possibiliy of any Spanish vessel being
allowed to do any coasting business in Canada under this proposed Treaty; also that
no Spanish vessel, by sailing into Liverpool
or some other English port and there changing to British registry, as can be done without the payment of any duty, would then
be permitted to corne to Canada and enjoy
the same rights as a British-constructed
vecsel..
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am advised
that, on the contrary, such a vessel would
not have that right.
Hon. Mr. REID: Very well.
brought up the question.

I have only

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
gentlemen, there is one small matter-though
it is not small in its consequences-on which
I would like a little explanation. I refer not
to the Navigation Treaty, but to the agreement dealing with companies. The proposed
arrangement with Spain has to do with two
things: one is the subject of trade and
navigation, and the other is the treatment
of companies. Article 1 of the Agreement
regulating the treatment of companies provides:
For the purposes of the present Agreement
the expression "Companies of a Contracting
Party" means Joint Stock Companies and other
associations engaged in commercial, industrial,
transport, insurance, financial or other description of business, constituted and authorized in
accordance with the laws in force in the territories of that Contracting Party, and having
their central management and control situated
in those territories.
Now, it is of course obvious that the provinces would be included'in the territories of
the contracting parties. It may be truc, as
pointed out by the honourable leader of the
Government, that the financial arrangements
between us and Spain as to taxation may

that iii, ont hanks, particularly. may in consequence of this Treaty be placed in a botter
position, with less taxation on thern than they
have at present.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: AUl right. Take
the province of Québec, by way of illustratiýon: that is part of our teirritory.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is broad enough
to cover ail of those provinces. If rny 'honourable friend will rend the Treaty, he will
find that ail we bind ourselves to is flot to
discriminate against those foreign corporations, so that any law of the province of
Ontario or of Quebec whieh is made to cover
citizens of those provinces will apply to ail
those f oretign oorporations that would corne
under the Treaty; and Spain would have no
occasion to complain provided it got equal
treatment with our nationals.
We do not
ask Spain for anything else, but we assure
ourselves of an equality of treatment with
the Spanish people, .Iust as we will assure
them of an equality of treatment on Canadian
soul.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I wovld ask the hionourable gentleman if on the particular point
iE, is discussing, there would be, found any
differ,zence between this Treaty and those
mientioned in the next Order of the DayNo. 18, the Trade Convention with the
Czechosluovak Republic, and No. 19, the
Trade Agreements
between Canada and
Fsthonia and other countries. Thtis Trcaty
seems to have been made by the Imperial
Govcrnment acting for the Crown; but the
ne'<t two seem to be treaties made by our
own Government.
Reading the B. N. A. Act, I do not think
there is any trouble about titis Treaty, or one
that bas been made by the Imperial Government, for then we are given power by te
Impérial Parliament to see that ail parts of
this country obey that Treaty. But I do not
know about the otiter two, for it seems as if
the Treaties mnight be different, unless some
of our people change their position witen we
make a Treaty.
After ail, I suppose te
three Treaties purport to be made by His
Majesty King George, but Vwo of themn seem
to be made by him as advised by his Canadian advisors, and one as advised by his
British advisers. I think we need some liglit
on that question, on account of te difference
between the three Treaties.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: "The Treaty
referred Vo in Order No. 18, that is, Bill 202,
entitled an Act respecting a certain conven-

303

tion between is Mai esty and the Preàident
of the Czechoslovak Republie, is made
between te Canadian people and Cchosiovakia, and on page 2 of that Bill my honourable friend will find the Scitedule which
reads:
Convention of Commerce between Canadà and
Czechoslovakia.
His Majesty tite King of Great Britain,
lreland and tbe British Dominions beyond the
Sens, Emperor of India, ili respect of the
Dominion of Canada, and the President of the
Czechsiovak Republic, being desirous of improving and extending the commercial relations
betwcen Canada and Czechoslovakia, bave
resolved to conclude a Convention with that
objeet, etc.
Now, my honourable friend will see that
His Majesty te King of Great Britain,
Ireland and the Britisht Dominions beyond the
Seas, Emperor of India, in respect of te
Dominion of Canada, is represented by te
Honourable James Alexander Robb, a Mcmber of His Majesty's Honourable Privy

one or two clauses of each of these Treaties.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, but the particular
point is, are we dealing in those treaties with

say that we are anr independent nation, independent of Great Britain, and that Australia
is an independent nation. Now, have we here
two or tree nations that we are dealing with

My own opinion is titat there is one nation,
the head of which is Ris Majesty Ring

His Majesty the King appearing in this
Treaty? It is "in respect of the Dominion of
Canada." It is not in respect of the British
Empire, or of Great Britain and the north of
'Ireland, but "in respect of the Dominion of
Canada."
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Where is that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the schedule
of Bill 202. Of course we are discussing the
Spanish Treaty, and my honourable friend has
drawn my attention to an objection which he
sees in Bili 202, the Czechoslovak Convention
Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I only mentioned it
because the point I raise was raised in connection with the Spanish Treaty.
Hon. Mr. LAFLAMME: I am somewhat
vague as to the second schedule of Bill 201.
Would the Leader of the Government explain
what significance he attaches to the words
in the territories." Whidh territories?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
clause?

What is the

Hon. Mr. LAFLAMME: Articles 1 and 2,
on page 12 of Bill 201. For instance, Article

1 says:
For the purposes of the present Agreement
the expression "Companies of a Contracting

Party" means Joint Stock Companies and other
associations engaged in commercial, industrial,

transport, insurance, financial or other description of business, constituted and authorized in
accordance with the laws in force in the territories of that Contracting Party.
Now, what was intended at the time this
agreement was signed? That is what I am a
little skeptical about.
I would ask
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend to read Article 1 in conjunction with Article 11. Article 11 says:
The stipulations of the present Agreement
shall not be applicable to India or to
any of His Britannic Majesty's Self-Governing
Dominions, Colonies, Possessions, or Protectorates, unless notice is given by Hisi Britannic
Majesty's Representative at Madrid of the
desire of His Britannic Majesty that the said
stipulations shall apply to any such territory.
So it is quite apparent that when clause 1
was drafted it was meant to cover not only
Great Britain but the other parts of the British
Empire mentioned in Article 11, as they are
mentioned in the Treaty, and tihat explains
the very wide expression used in Article 1:
For the purposes of the present Agreement
the expression "Companies of a Contracting
Party" means Joint Stock Companies and other
associations engaged in commercial, industrial,
transport, insurance, financial or other description of business, constituted and authorized in
accordance with the laws in force in the territories of that Contracting Party.

56109-20

305

Sc this expression was used in order to
oover any and all of the parties mentioned
in clause 11, so that when we join and agree
to this Treaty it covers the territories of the
Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. LAFLAMME: Let me see if I
have that right. That means that notice is

given under Article Il?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LAFLAMME: And the expression "in the territories of that Contracting
Party" means the territories of the United
Kingdom, and that is all. It applies to Canada, for instance, if notice is given under
section 11?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING POSTPONED
Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose I have
Hon.
answered satisfactorily all the questions that
have been put, and I would suggest that we
now take the third reading.
Hon. Mr. REID: I thought the honourable
gentleman had agreed that this would be
printed, and that we would have until Thursday to look it over.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend has asked me a few questions, which I
have answered.
Hon. Mr. REID: No. I have asked the
honourable gentleman some questions, but
not on the tariff, because I took it for granted
that what he said would be carried out. I
think what the honourable gentleman agreed
to was to put on Hansard several pages of this
information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend agree that we take the third
reading to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. REID: I stated that we would
not get Hansard until noon to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes, we will

The United States had a most favoured
nation agreement, and as Hungary, thc principal neighbouring flour-producing country,
was negotiating a Treaty with Czechoslovakia,
Canada wvas in danger of being discriminated
against on that market. The present agreement places Canada on an equal footing with
ail countries.
At present the importation of mater vehicles
into Czechoslovakia is restricted chiefly

There is a market in Czechoslovakia for
certain agricultural machines, such as binders,
etc., but in the past it has been difficult to
build up a market eowing to the fact that
Canada not having a trade agreement, our
manufacturers could neyer depend on the
Customs Tariff rates, which made it difflcult
to compete with.other countries and particularly the United States.

The Customs duties collected on the total
imports of $1,726,922 in the fiscal year 1927
amounted to $462,631.28. 0f this amount
$421,382.58 was collected on imports coming
under the general tariff ra-te, and $41,248.70
on imports entered. under treaty rates.
I have given the main items of the importations of Czechoslovakia and of Canada.
Statistics of exports from Canada to Czechoslovakia show that our exports of flour, including that which. goes via the port of
Hambourg, are valued at $5,289,000, and our
total sales to Czeehoslovakia are estimated
to reach 85,476,632-a figure which is perhaps
less than the correct amount. It bas been said
that possibly our large sales of flour were due
te the fact that Russia was nlot exporting.
Well. for a number of years past. since 1922,
as the American statement which I have read
testifles, we have graxdua.lly made gains in
that market in our sales of flour. Wc hope
also te increase our sales of rubber tires, f arm
implements and machinery, and calculatinýg
machines. We have sold $21,763 worth of
adding and calculating machines. We are
developing a satisfactory trade with that
country.
Wjth these remarks I move the second readinga of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to ask just
one question. I will not detain the House a
ininute. In the first place, I want to say
that it does seem strange that in these other
treaties, which are ve'ry plain and can be
understood by anyone, no mention is made of
navigation. Take Portugal: it is in exactly
the same position as Spain, but you do not
mention any.thing about navigation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND : If my honourable friend, with bis inclination to traveJ, wi:ll
go to Czechoslovakia, he will find that it has
no port.
Hon. Mr. REID: I know that, but I am
speaking of the next Treaty, in whicb
Portugal is mentioned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we
speaking now of Czechoslovakia.

are

Hon. Mr. REID: But I desired simply to
remark

that in this Treaty and in the next

one there is nothing about navigation. The
Treaty that we are at present discussing is,
as I have said, very plain; it deals with
nothing but the question of tariff. And I sec
in the next one that we are coming toHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Take for instance the arrangements with the Baltic States.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. REID: But what about Portugal?
Yeu have nothing about navigation in the
arrangement with Portugal.
But Great
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Britain made a special Treaty with Spain
concerning navigation. Great Britain felt the
necessity of covering that phase of its dealings witi Spain. I do not know that it has
done likewise in the Treaties it has negotiated
with other countries, but these countries with
which we intend to come into commercial
contact through the treaties that I shall submil in a moment have offered us their mostfavoured-nation treatment, and we offer them
like treatment and stop there. We have not
thought of accepting the treaties of Great
Britain with these countries. We can limit
our adherence to those treaties by going as
far as we propose. So we have not dealt
with the question of navigation with these
other countries.
Hon. Mr. REID: I think the honourable
gentleman has now answered me fully with
reference to the right of Spanish vessels to
do a coasting trade in Canada. He says that
a treaty has been made between Great Britain
and Spain with reference to navigation. That
means that Spanish vessels can coast in Great
Britain, and if we are to carry out the Treaty
as made between Great Britain and Spain,
and if vcssels built in Great Britain have the
riaht to coast here, Spanish vessels wili under
tiat Traty enjoy the same right. However,
I will net detain the House by discussing that
at present; I will refer to it again.
I am told that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend is in error, and I believe
it, fron my reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. REID: The honourable gentleiman and I differ. He gives his opinion on
that side, but he must remember that we have
on t his side lawyers who are also quite
capable of giving good opinions. You never
find two lawyers to agree on anything.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But there is
no one on the other side se far.
Hon. Mr. REID: No one bas differed with
the honourable gentleman?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No one but
my honourable friend has contended that a
Spanish vessel, either directly under the Treaty
or by transferring its registry te Great Britain,
could come and do a coasting trade here.
Hon. Mr. REID: I am the only one on
this side who bas made that contention, but
I heard the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) state his views on another clause,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and on this the honourable gentleman from
Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) bas taken
a position directly opposite. So did the bonourable leader of the Opposition (Hon. W. B.
Ross). I mean, it is net strange that I should
disagree with the honourable gentleman.
However, the question I desire to ask is
this: as to these goods on which we are going
to give a reduction in duty, must they be
shipped direct from Spain, say, to Canada, or
could they be shipped to the United States
and from the United States to Canada? I
thouglit in aill these Treaties that we are
making that the principle had been adopted
that the goods must come direct frem the
other country to Canada if they were te have
the benefit of these reductions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am informed
that Czechoslovakia must send its goods
direct to a Canadian port.
Hon. Mr. REID: I asked the honourable
gentleman about the Spanish Treaty. Is it
necessary for the goods to come direct from
Spain to Canada, or can they be shipped.
say, te New York, and from there to Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am advised
that they must come direct te a Canadian
port.

TRADE AGREEMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bi'll 203, an Act respecting trade
between Canada and Esthonia, Hungary.
Laýtvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Roumania, and
the Serb, Croat and Slovene Kingdom.

APRIL 24, 1928
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the United
Kingdom has made various commercial
Treaties with the countries that have just
been ýmentioned and that are named in this
Bill. Those Treaties do not apply to any
of the self-governing Dominions unless the
Dominion gives notice that it is its intent
to acept the Treaty in whole or in part.
In -treaties with:the countries mentioned in
the present Bill it has been deemed advisable
to accept the clause providing for the mutual
exchange of .the most-favoured-nation treatment.
Our trade with these countries for the fiscal
years 1926 and 1927 was as follows: in 1926,
our exports (totalled $1,250,693 as against imports of $433,350; and in 1927 the relative
figures were $2,374,021 as against $673,760.
In the dlasses of goods that we export our
chief competitor is the United States, which
enjoys the most-favoured-nation treatment
with each country. As our exports are considerably in excess of our imports from these
countries, the benefits, both present and potent.ial, are obvious. Several of the counitries
in question are new entities, and from time to
time there is a gradual adjusttment of tariff
barriers, and as the United States is entitled
to the mostfavoured-nation treatment that
country would immedia.tely get the benefit of
any local adjustment. Canada is now being
placed on an equal footing with the United
States.
Here is the tariff position in each of the
countries affected:
Esthonia has recently adopted minimum
and maximum tariff schedules. The minimum
rate is 50 per cent less than the general.
Hungary has one tariff but has special treaty
rates with a number of countries. There is
aiso a provision that she can increase the
normal rates three times where there is tariff
discrimination against her goods.
Latvia has now introduced a two-column
tariff, the preferential being 50 per cent less
than the general.
Portugal has two rates, the maximum being
generally double the minimum, although
sometimes it is greater.
Roumania has two rates, and it is provided that non-trea:ty countries may be called
upon to pay the maximum, which is 50 per
cent higher tihan the minimum.
The Serb, Croat and Slovene Kingdom has
two rates. The maximum is often three times
the minimum.
Lithuania early in 1926, amended its customs
tariff so that goods coming from non-treaty
countries might be made subject to a duty
of 30 per cent over the presenit one-column
schedule. This new rating was never put

into effeet, but now that Latvia and Esthonia
have adopted coventlional rates Lithuania
may do the same.
The future benefits to Canadian industries
in one way alone were set out in a letter
received from a Canadian firm doing a large
export business in Europe:
We are extremely anxious that we should
extend our European business in every way
possible, and especially to do so at the present
tine in those countries which are again
beginning to import our goods. The situation
we find is that in certain European countries
where the United States bas a more favourable
agreement than Canada, goods are being inported from the United States such as we
manuf-acture, trade connections are being made,
and we are absolutely unable to sell and to
make favourable connections. We know that
we are losing a number of good opportumties
now and we fear that it will be very difficult
for us to make good those losses in future
years, because many of the valuable connections
which might be concluded will be taken up by
United States manufacturers.
It seems to me that I need only draw the
attention of the Senate to the fact that all
those states are agricultural and can never
compete in our industrial market. I hope,
nevertheless, that they will increase their
sales to Canada, because we have so many
things that we can sell to them that I would
like to have them, in return take advantage
of our market to a greater degree by exporting to Canada things that we do not produce,
and that we buy abroad.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

With regard
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to Esthonia, its chief industry is agriculture.
Flax growing is becoming a most important
branch. The population of the country is
1,110,000.
The unit of currency is the Esthonian mark
or kroon; value 26.8 cents.
The trade between Canada and Esthonia
is in favour of Canada. In the fiscal year
ending 31st March. 1926, there were no imports from Esthonia, and during the fiscal
year ending 31st March, 1927, the total
imports were valued at $3,310-fibrilla, flax
fibre and flax tow. The exports for the year
ending lst March, 1926, amounted to $86,317, made up as follows: wheat flour,
11,352 barrels, value $79,463; combustion engines, $2,671; agricultural implements, $4,183.
The exports for the year ending lst March,
1927, amounted to $212,174, made up as
follows: wheat flour, 31,746 barrels, value
$209,027; rubber manufactures, $630; agricultural implements, $3,507.

The United States has a commercial agreement with Esthonia which provides for mostfavoured-natjon treatment.
Hungary has a population of 7,980,143.
Agriculture forms the staple industry of the
people, the principal crops being wheat,
naize, oats, barley, rye, beans and sugai'
beets.
The total imports into Canada from Hung-ary during the fiscal year ended 3lst March,
1927, were $60,956, of which $58,000 wvas beans.
We imported heans that year because our
crop of beans was short.
The rates of duty on beans are per bushel:
British preferential, 15 cents; intermediate,
222' cents; general, 25 cents.
The exports from Canada to Hungary during the fiscal year ended 3lst March, 1927,

The population of Portugal is 6,041,000. The
Treaty that Canada is now subscribing to is
the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation,

Portugal in August, 1914.

Can-adian imports have been subject to ýthe maximum
rates.
The United States has most-favourednation treatment.
One of the chief items
of jnterest to Canada is flsh.
At present
Newfoundland fishi have a perference of 55
cents a quintal. 'thus niaking it impossible for
Nova Scotia fish to comipete îvith Newfound]and or Norway.
On agricultural machinery
the rates are net higb, but United States
manufacturers have an advantage of 50 per

We selI comparatiî ely little flour to Portugal, although
Canadian millers are interested in marketing
flour in the' Azores and the Madeira Islands.
Recently the Quaker Oats people of Peterborough wrote urging a Treaty îvith Portugal,
as it woud bo hiclpful to them.
It ivili be
notcd that there ivas a substantial increase
in the exports in the fiscal year 1926.
This

For

Islands $160.737.

Portugal and $65.487 from the two islands.
While Portuge..e Africa is flot included in the

The chief item of importance is non-sparkling
wines.
The riext is corkwood.
The present

The maximum tariff rates are usually 50 per
cent or 100 par cent higher than the minimum,
although thère are somae variations from this.
Article 29 of the general rules for applying
the tariff states that "the minimum tariff will
ba applied in whola or in part to goods originating in countries to which this privilege is
assured by commercial treatias." There is,
moreover, provision in Article 5 of the Dacrea
establishing the preseut customs tariff (Apri
20, 1923), which. gives the Government piower
to increasa fivefold. the navigation and import
taxes, or to fix rates upon duty-frea goods
when the ships or goods are f rom countries
not extending to Portugal their minimum customs tariff rates, and when such countries
impose restrictive or special measures, as defined, which would ba ragarded as prejudicial
to Portuguese exports.

Canada's records show that wheat, codflsh,
agriculturai implements, automobiles, rubber
manufactures and neadles and pins are the
chie£ exports to Portugal. The total Cariadian exports to that country were $121,773
in 1925-6, and $1,273,457 -in 1926-7, there baing
over a million dollars of wheat exports in the
latter period.
Privata firms are flot allowed to import
wheat. which. is Canada's chiai axport to
Portugal. The salas were $1,141,908 in the
calandar year 1926, and 8813,2M8 in 1927. The
Portuguase govarriment opens competitiofi
from time to time for specific quantities, and
at those times the rates of duty are fixad.
Thera is no indication of a praferential rate
on thesa importations. Wheat flour is controlled in the same way.

Another question I would like to ask is:
wvould the situation under any or ait of these
Treaties he the saine as under our Treaties
wvith France and Austratia, namely, that after
they are in force, the countries with whomn
we have negotiated them will raise their
generaI tariffs and thereby place greater
harriers against our goods, white our concessions, being specifle, wvitI bind us? I think
thiat point shoutd be cleared up, and that hionourable Senators should have an opportunity
to sec the record and to discues in detait these
various important matters. To my mmnd this
treaty-making with the various nations of the
wvorld is nothing more nor tees than carrying
on the tariff-tinkering procees which has been
so prevalent during the past seven years.

that we have net every year met with euch
satisfaction as we eoutd have desired in the

Hon. Mr. REID: I did not ask for that.

I said that the Leader of the Governmnent
had mentioned that so far as navigation was
concerned, the favoured nation Treaty between England and Portugal applied. I think
the honourable gentleman understands ahl
right. I would like to sec that Treaty, and

The motion for the third reading was postponed.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
THIRD READING POSTPONED

The Senate resumed from Thursdsay last the
adjourned debate on the motion:
That with leave of the Senate Bill 169,
intituled: "An Act to amend the custnms tariff,"
be nrw read a third time, and the motion in
arndmnent, that ail the words after the word
"that" be hef t out and the following suhstîtuted
therefor: "the Bill be referred to the Standing
Conimittee on Banking and Commerce."
Hon. G. G. FOSTER:

Honourable gentle-

men, when I suggested that the third reading
of this Bill should be postponed until to-day,
I did so because I thought that, in view of
the fighting spirit that was being demnonstrated
by the Leader of the Government,' and the
more or less worried condition of certain
memnbers on this side of the H-ouse, an adjournment would save a conflict that might
have serious consequences. I had no intention of adding an'ything except that I did not
agree with the honourable gentleman from
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) in his
Montarville
amendment. I did not think it wise that this
legisiation should be referred to a Committee
at that timne, and I do not think so 00w; but
1 hope the Leader of the Government i; prepared to make a stat-ement that will satisfy
not only those who are here but those who are

not here that the legishation is not as iniquitnus as some thought when it was presented to
this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to thank
my honourable friend for preaching peace to
this Chamber. I have raised my voice in
other halls in favour of peace, and I wekcome
my honourable friend as a recruit and an a11y.
In the course of the debate hast week, I said
that the Sonate should take advantage of the
presentation of this Bill to secure information,

and that the Tariff Commissioner was here to,
hehp me give that information.

I have asked

for a statement which I believe fairly covers
the Bill as presented. I thought that if there
was any particular item in the tariff upon
which special information was desired, a question would be asked from the other side of
the House, and that I could satisfy the in'quiry. Be that as it may, I wiUl read the
'statement which explains the object of the
present Bill.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Would the honourable
'gentleman mmnd taking it as read and handing
*it in? I do not think there will be any
trouble about the third reading to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. Do I un'derstand the amendinent will be withdrawn?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Thiat is my intention.
Then I will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
move to discharge the order and to place it
on the Orders of the Day for to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the order
was discharged and placed on the Orders of
the Day for to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Can the honourable gentleman inform me which of the questions are Eo difficult that it, would take a
long time ta answer themn?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It sa happens
that my honourable friend's questions caver
the operations of two or three departments,
and bulky files have ta be searcbed in arder
to obtain the information for my honourable
friend. I am simply transmitting the request cf the Deputy Minister cf Public
Works. He stated that his part was not yet
ready, but he could sce that the inquiry was
leading very far, and he thought, that a
motion for a return wauld be more suitable
in the present instance.
Could I not get
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
answers ta the first two or three questions,
with regard to, the cast of the removal af
the Russell buse and other property intended ta be expropriated, and the probable
cost of the proposed park?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my honourable friend should net forget that his first
question réads:
What properties in the City of Ottawa, in
addition to the Russell bouse property, have
been acquired, or does the Governent propose
to acquire?
That covers nearly all the operations cf
the Government, and it seems to extend
back without any limit as to date.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do not desire to
give the Department any extra trouble.
The inquiry was withdrawn.

SENATE
nient is too important to b.e allowed to pass
without a few xvords of comment.
The substance of the statement, wvhich cornes froma the
Departnient of Public Works, is that after an
e\perience of tw'o or three years the Depart-mient hax e come to the conclusion that t'here
is no authority to control traffic on Parliamient EHl.
It says--I am not using the exact
wordls-that efforts hav e been made and that
driveris of automobiles have tieliberately disrgairded any instructions or orders issued to
theni.
Žscw, my primiary purpose in making
the inquiry svas to ascertain whether or not
there existed authoritv and responsibility for
the confrol cf the traffle, and so far, at any
rate, the reply of the Departmnent of Public
W crIs throws light on the subjeet of my inquiry.
The position which I îînderstand the
Departinent te take on the subjeet is that
thiere is ne authority existing to control the
se ifie.
If the Department's statement be
correet, ail I can suggest is that the Governmient shouid forthwith make somne regulation
or provide somne statutory authority whereby
traffie regulations can ho enforced.
That is
ounr fslpcet of the matter.
Another aspect to whirh I desire to draw
-ýitention is that apparently another branch
cf the public service is not thinking the same
wtv : the Department cf Public Works.
Es iitnc, cf this is before the eves of every
linurable cuember cf this Heuse who
choeses to look cut on the grounds in front
Lbite building, because to-day, for the tirst
timie this Session, an officer of the Mounted
Felice Force is on duty reg-ulating traffie, in
spite cf tise faet that the Deparbment cf
Public Works :ays that that traffie cannot be
rePilated. I teck tEe trouble te watch fer five
or ten minustes; and whien drivers came up and

and, after a fexv moments cf conversation

CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 198, an Act to amend the Customs Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is composed of a number of amendments, the
principal one being contained in Clause 1.
It is to enable the Department of Customs to
make clear its jurisdiction beyond the three
mile limit in the matter of the seizure of
vessels that are suspected of carrying contraband goods. The right of the Department has
never been questioned as far as the three mile
limit is concerned, but the Department desires it to be made clear that it can go beyond
that limit, and it has fixed a twelve mile
limit.
There are other clauses which are of less
importance, which will call for eKplanations at
the Committee stage. I will therefore reserve
those explanations till that time.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: This applies only
to ships flying the Canadian flag?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
dian registry.

Ships of Cana-

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Do the words "territorial waters" simply mean waters within the
three mile limit?
That, I think,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
has been generally accepted as the territorial
linit; but although the right of a country to go beyond that limit, and to exercise
its authority over its nationals or its ships
is not settled, Canada claims that right just
as do Great Britain and the other Dominions.
I could perhaps give the opinion of the Minister of Justice on this point:
In 1923, as Minister of Marine and Fisheries,
lie introduced sone legislation with regard to
the north Pacific halibut fisheries. That legislation was designed to put into force the pro-

visions of the treaty with the United States
concerning the protection of the halibut fisheries in north Pacifie waters. Both in the
treaty and in the statute adopted by the house
there was a provision which conferred extraterritorial jurisdiction upon the enactment of
parliament. The minister mentioned the fact
that this was in the treaty also because that
treaty was ratified by His Majesty the King.
and no one either in England or in Canada
challenged the right of Canada in that respect,
and that statute never bas been challenged
since. It has been enforced since, giving the
right to our officers to seize vessels, even on
the high seas, which are engaged in fishing
halibut in the prohibited zone during the probibited season. However, at that time the same
objection that is now raised was raised against
the statute, and for the purpose of elucidating
the question, the Minister of Justice states that
he is free to admit that authority can be quoted
in support of a different opinion. It is a debatable question in some respects; it has been
debated, but the trend of constitutional authority is now rather to the effect that the
dominions have the same right within their
sphere of legislation as the Imperial parliament has within its sphere. This view is
specially supported in the case of the award
re Cooks' and Stewards' Union. That was a
New Zealand case, in which the court decided
that the award of a New Zealand court of
arbitration as to wages to be paid on vessels
trading between New Zealand and Australia
was binding with reference ta vessels registeted
in New Zealand.
In the well-known Canadian case of Cain
versus Gilhula, where aliens had been deported
under the Canadian législation with regard to
alien labour, for having come to this country
in contravention of our law, those men took
proceedings by way of habeas corpus, and the
court of first instance decided that as there
was a question of extra territoriality involved
our statute was not constitutional; but the
Privy Council decided otherwise, and that Canada may exert extra territorial powers for the
purpose of exercising ber sovereign powers as
effectively as the Imperial authority.
There have been two cases decided by the
Supreme Court of Canada, in re Frederick
Gerring and re North, in which vessels had
been captured outside the three-mile limit,
taken in bot pursuit, and the seizure was declared valid by the supreme court.
The circumstances in the present legislation
may be a little different, but still the extra
territoriality was admitted in that case. The
minister realizes there is a certain element of
doubt attached to the matter, and it is for that
reason that in 1920, the then government submitted to parliament the resolution for the purpose of amending the British North America
Act, in order that it should be made clear that
any enactment of this parliament within its
jurisdiction had the same effect with regard to
extra territorial rights as an enactment of the

adopted by the parliament of Canada in 1920.
There was an exchange of views between the
law officers of the crown in Great Britain and
the Department of Justice; and as a result, in
1924. the Minister of Justice. introduced a new
resolution to this parliament with somewhat
different language. It was to the effect that:
"An enactment of the parliament of Canada.

came to the House of Commons on the last day
of the session n(d was accepted. It was afterwards found that the language was not exactly
what it was intended to be. and that a new
resolution would have to be passed to amend it.
The whiole question came before the Imperial
conference of 1926, not brought there by Canasua but by other dominions, and it was then
decided that this matter as well as other matters should be submitted to a committee of
jiurists which is to be appointed for the purpose of looking into all those questions. Meanwhile, as it is a very important metter concerning peace, order and good government in Canada. the minister thinks parliament should take
the saine view as was taken in regard to the
halibut fishery treaty, and that it should be
made clear that as far as we are concerned we
believe that for the peace, order and good government of Canada soe should have in that
respect the extra territorial jurisdiction wohich
tlie legislation of the Imperial parliament has
provided with regard to their own affairs.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: If this Bill passes,
would it extend to vessels that had changed
their registration to Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: I cannot answrcthe honourable gentleman on the spur of the
momenýt. When we go into Conunittee I vill
be able to give bim the opinion of the Departiment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gontlemen, the questions of constitutional lasw involved here are ceitinly very debatable.
However, my purpose in rising is to suggest
to the Leader of the Governmenit that it
would be well if he could get from the Minister of Justice a statement of the principle of
law upon which the Imperial Parliament bases
its power to attempt to give to its legislation
this extra-territorial effect beyond the threemile limit. I do not contend for one moment
that it does not exist, but I am not aware of
such a principle.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: For our own nationais.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Of couie, but exrights against other people.
The
jurisdict.ion now proposed is one which is going
to be exeroised against other people who have
equal or superior powers ta our own. That is
the debatable point. So far as any extra territorial legisiation is oancerned, whether it
extends to twelve or fifteen miles, our
nationals are bound. But to what extent are
the rights conferred upon our nationals binding upon the nationals of other countries?
For my part I iwould like to sec on what the
authority of the Imperial Parliament in regard
to this extra territorial jurisdiction is based.

ercisinig

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
the point that has risen about this Bill is
not new to me at all. It came up in two or
three cases in whieh I was interested, and I
think I know very well its history. There
was a case of a marriage in New Zealand, or
New South Wales, in whiclh the question was
raised, and the jurisdiction of the province
of New South Wales to legislate for one of
their own subjects as to what he should do
out.side .the territorial limits of that province,
was denied by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council.
W ith regard to Empire legislation, the
Imperial Parliament has no territorial limitation at all, so far as its own citizens are concerned. A law passed by the Imperial Parlianient binds all citizens of fthe Empire. But
we are not in that position: we have a territorial ilimit; from certain legal points of
iew we arc a province, with jurisdiction that
exteis certainly three miles from the shore.
At one time the point was very mueh in
dispute what rights we hiad over the water extending for the three miles; but as to the land
under the three miles of water, which has been
a subject of as much litigation as any point
that ever caine nu) in the Britisi court, the
Judical Comnmittee of the Privy Council, in a
ver elaborate juidgmient in 1919, decided that
this land under the Ihree miles of water is a
part of th nainlind, and they who own the
soil have a right to the water.
But there is a douht whether or not we ca n
exercise jurisdiction even over Canadian
citizens beyond the tiliree-mile limit. Some
legislation was put on our own Statute Book
which tried to overcome that difficulty by
say-ing that a man who Jeft Canada with
intent to do a certain thing in a foreign
country could be punished when he came back
here.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is, the national
only?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, I say one of our
own people. Now, the question is one thar
cannot be satisfactorily settled here or anywliere else, except in the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council, and the sooner it gets
there the better for all concerned, I should
say.
There is the difficulty my honourable friend
refers ta, about changing the registry of a
Canadian vessel to Newfoundland. Of course,
it might b said perhaps that this soas a
colour-able transaction. I woulfd be in-clined to
think that if you cover Newfoundland registry, you cover any registry at all..
So far as this House is concerned, I think
the proper thing to do is to let the Act

APRIL 25, 1928
pass, and let the Government struggle with
it as best they may. It is just possible that
some vessel that is taken outside the threemile limit will challenge this legislation, and
the point will be brought up; but I do not
think we gain very much in discussing the
question here to-day, aithough it is very interesting for every one to have his say and
ask his questions.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
EXCISE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 54, an
Act to amend the Excise Act.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1-rates binding and payable
by His Majesty:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was asked at
the second reading to obtain the opinion of
the Department of Justice on the constitutionality of this clause. It is as foHows:
Dear Sir:-I understand you require to be
advised upon the probable constitutional effect

of section 1 of the Bill to amend the Excise
Act, which provides for the application of
excise duties to His Majesty in the right of
any province. My view is that the decision
of the Privy Council in the case of the Attorney
General of British Columbia vs. the Attorney
General of Canada, 1924, A.C. 222 (which
related to customs duties and sales tax in the
case of goods imported by the provincial government) is a binding precedent in favour of
the constitutional validity of the legislation
now proposed.

Yours truly,
W. Stuart Edwards.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
DOMINION FO'REST RESERVES AND

REFERRED TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE

On the Order:
The House again in Committee of the Whole
on Bill 193, an Act to amend the Dominion
Forest Reserves and Parks Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, when we were in Committee on
this Bill last week, some information was
asked concerning the policy of the department
in the withdrawal of some parte of these
forest reserves and their distribution to setthers. I suggested that we should send this
Bill to a committee, where officials of the
Department could be heard, and maps produced, so that we could have first-hand information. This was accepted as a proper
suggestion, but I did not know to what committee we could send the Bill. I propose now
to move that the Bill be referred to a Special
Committee, to which I intend to send.also the
Seeds Bill, the Hay and Straw and the Fertilizer Bills, so that we will get information
from the technical officers of those departments.
I therefore move that the Bill be referred
to a Special Committee consisting of Messieurs Béique, Benard, Black, Buchanan, Dandurand, Donnelly, Gillis, Green, Lessard, Pope,
Prowse. Raymond, Riley, Ross (Middleton),
Ross (Moose Jaw), Turgeon and Webster

SENATE

With regard to that portion of the Bill
which has to do with the taking of a second
homestead, I mentioned when the Bill was
last before us that it was a very radical departure from the policy that has prevailed
all these years. Our immigration policy is
based on the granting of free lands. These
free lands are growing less from year to year.
They are going to be secured only by going
long distances from the means of transportation, and transportation facilities will have to
be extended to them at great cost. A number of questions are involved in that phase
itself. But it seems to me a most extraordinary thing that in this very year when
we are confronted with the possibility of the
public lands of those provinces being transferred to them, we in this House, who are
trustees of these lands, should be asked to
pass a Bill for the purpose of conferring upon
all those who have had a homestead the
right to take a second one. Briefly, my point
is this, that Parliament should do nothing of
the sort: that this is a question of provincial
policy. The whole Bill deals with provincial
policy for that matter. The Bill deals, for
instance, with school lands, which are a concern of the provinces. I can sec no objection
to the clause relating to school lands, but I
do sec very great objection to the clause that
hia ta do with the taking of second homeMy view is that if the Government can
put before this House a statement in writing
from the Prime Ministers of those three
provinces that they have no objection to this
Bill, we should have nothing more to say,
as it is a matter of provincial policy. If, on
the other hand, such evidence cannot be put
before us, or, rather, if we have reason to
believe that the provinces oppose this Bill,
then we ought to oppose it here and it ought
not to carry. Before we are asked to vote
upon it the Government should inform us,
or we should take steps to ascertain, whether
or not the provinces are in favour of this
section of the Bill. My suggestion would be
that instead of sending this Bill to Committee of the Whole House we might send
it to a special committee or one of the
standing committees of the Senate, which
committee might instruct its secertary to
communicate with the Premiers of the three
Prairie Provinces and ask them the definite
question, "Are you in favour of this Bill or
net?" Then we shall have their answers in
writing -and shall know where we are, and
I shall be prepared to abide by the decision
of the Premiers of the Western Provinces
without further discusison.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that my honourable friend allow the Bill to
go te Committee. where we can discuss this
question. I have here a statement regarding
it which I obtained after a conference with
the representatives of the Department. This
is an important question of policy concerning
the West. I do not intend to press the matter,
but we might consider it in Committee and
report progress if the honourable memibers of
the Senate are not unaninously in faveur
of proceeding further. If any objection is
raised, or if more information is needcd. of
thit kind or any other, I will readily agree
to our postponing the Bill for such time as
will permit of the production of the desired
information. So I would suggest to my honourable friend that ho allow the present metion to pass and that we go into Comrmittee
and dîscus this question. It is a very interesting one. I shall read in Committee the

diriectly

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACI: Very well.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was
a.griel to, and the Senaie again went into
Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
Previous legislation.-At the presont titre a
settler is not entitled to a second free hotmestead unless lie had completed the duties in
connection -with bis first hoiestead by 2nd
June. 1889.
This legislation was passed in 1892 (55-56
Victoria, Chtapter 15, Section 4). The law has
iot been amended since, except that in 1923
a special provision was made dealing with
Southern Saskatchewan and Southern Alberta.
Atendment of 1923-This special provision
allowed a second homestead to any man w-ho
had received patent by the 1st January, 1923,
but w-ho is no longer the owner of a farm.
Such a settler bad to produce a certificate of
approval fron the Province. This was part
of an arrangement under whici settlers were
troved north froin the dry areas of Southern
The
Saskatchewvan and Southern Alberta.
expenses of such renoval were borne in equal
shares by the Dominion, the Province and the
Railway Company. For this reason the Province had to approve the settler in every case.
Settlers not helped by 1923 amendment.It was fou0nd that there were other settlers
in more northerly districts who were not
covered by the 1923 amendment. These settlers
have suffered from frost, drought, etc., and are
equally entitled to a new start.

APRIL 25, 1928
In sone cases families could go into a new
district and the sons could take up land, but
they are hampered in doing so because tbe
head of the family has exhausted his homestead right. The present provision is intended
to restore that right in the case of every settler
wlIo earned his patent before the lst January,
1925.
Danger of rush to take up land.-While
great many settlers have earned patent, it is
not expected that any large number will avail
themselves of the new provision-only. those
who have located on inferior land, where they
cannot make a success of farming, or the heads
of families who wish to accompany their sons,
as already explained.
It must be borne in mind that of those who
homesteaded in 1889 and years immediately
following, many are dead and others are so
advanced in years that the present offer will
not appeal to them.
Of those who homesteaded in more recent years, many are comfortably located and will not be attracted by
the offer of another homestead. There remains
the settler who made a bad choice and found
himself on inferior land. He may have beei
forced to let it go af ter struggling for years,
or, pseibly, be still owns it but finds be cannot make a living on it.
It has been asked, why throw the privilege
of second homestead open to everyone-why
not confine it to those who have lost their
farms?
The answer is that the Department has
found in the past, in dealing with cases in
Southern Saskatchewan and Alberta, that in
many instances the settler's debts are more
than his land is worth and he cannot divest
himself of title. No one is willing to accept
a conveyance of the land on account of what
is cbarged against it. For this reason it is
thought advisable to avoid any restriction
which wonld prevent an unfortunate settler
fron making a new start merely because be
cannot get rid of his first homestead.
Danger of present locations being abandoned.
-( 1) Many settlers will not move in any case;
(2) Others have already lost their lands, which
have been disposed of to other parties; (3)
ln some cases a man who still owns his homestead and who wants to move, will be able to
sell out to an incoming settler many of whom,
especially from the United States, prefer
improved land. In a case of this kind the
settler who removes is replaced by a newcomer.
What lands remain available for homesteading and where are they?
That is one of the questions I put to the
Department.
A glance at the homesteading maps of the
Western Provinces shows that with some
exceptions the land adjacent to Railways bas
been largely taken up. At greater distances
from the Railway there are in the northern
parts of the Provinces large areas which are
available for future settlement.
The Natural Resources Intelligence Service
of the Department of the Interior furnishes
the following rough estimate of surveyed areas
available for settlement:Acres
Manitoba.. ............
1,850,000
Saskatchewan.. ..........
1,800,000
Alberta.. ..............
8,000,000
Total.. ..........
56109-21j

11,650,000

323

In addition to the surveyed areas there are
nillions of acres of unsurveyed lands in
Northern districts of the quality of which but
little is known.
As to the surveyed areas it is of course
admitted that a considerable percentage must
be deducted to cover land which upon further
examination may be found unsuited for farming; but the fact remains that there is still
a very considerable field for new settlement
in the northern parts of the Province.
Demand for second homestead.-The Department has been in receipt, from time to time,
of numerous communications on behalf of persous who desire to take another homestead.
Some of these are men with large fanilies who
want to start again in a new district. The
father would be able to accompany his sons,
but is debarred from taking up land for himself. In other cases, pioneers have gone through
nany difficulties but have got into a serious
position because of adverse circumstances.
At the suggestion of Western Members, it
w-as decided to arrange for a Conference on
the subject, which was held during the past
Sunimer.
Public Meeting at Regina.-On October lOth,
1927, a Public Meeting was held at Regina for
discussion of the subject of second homesteads
in Saskatchewan.
The following gentlemen
were in attendance at this meeting: Messrs.
A. F. Totske, J. F. Johnston, George Spence,
.T. G. Ross. C. R. McIntosh, J. Millar, E. J.
Young, John Vallance, C. E. Bothwell, Dr.
Thomas Donnelly, John Evans, all Federal
Members from the Province of Saskatchewan,
as well as the Honourable Mr. Hamilton,
Provincial Minister of Agriculture and Mr. F.
H. Auld, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture,
and Messrs. Waddington, Naismith and Anderson. Provincial Government officials.
Messages of regret at not being able to
attend have been received from Messrs. M.
McLean. Dr. Young and A. M. Carmichael,
M.P.'s for the Province of Saskatchewan, as
well as from some of the Provincial Ministers.
Resolution Adopted.-After a lengthly discussion of the subject, the following resolution was
submitted and adopted, with only one dissentient:
"That this meeting go on record as favouring the necessary amendments to the Dominion
Lands Act to allow those who have taken up
a free homestead and proved sarne up, to file
on any available quarter section of land in
Western Canada as a second homestead."
Suggestion that individual applications should
be investigated.-This suggestion was dealt with
at the Public Meeting but it was the opinion
of practically all that investigation of each
application would be a very difficult, tedious,
and in some cases, possibly, unfair and unjust
task.
Classes of deserving cases.-Among the classes
of people who should be given -second homesteads are the following:
Persons who retain their first homesteads and
are struggling along under unbearable obligations;
Those who have lost their lands and who
are living in cities, towns and villages or on
rented properties, or working for others and
wish to secure farms and homes of their own;
Settlers who have not sufficient lands to
carry on successful farming operations;
Farmers with families of small children who
require additional land and who cannot for

APRIL 25, 1928
but I do not think there could have been very
much opposition to it in this House, or I
would remenber it. I think there are members present from Saskatchewan and Alberta
who would not be willing ta admit that most
of the land in the southern part of those

Provinces, extending ta a distance of 180
miles from the boundary, is of such a character as has been described, and that it was

given up because of drought. In my opinion
a lot of the very best land in those Provinces
is south of the boundary of Township 31.

As I said in the beginning, if there was justification ýfor passing the Act of 1923, I can see
no reason why we should not pass an Act
relating Ito lands farther north. As I understand it, this incl-udes all parts of the three
Provinces; there is no limitation.

Hon. Mr. POPE: And while they are doing
that they had botter grant some charters to
the railroads to build branch lines. They wili
be around here before noon to-mrrow.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The answer to
the honourable gentleman is that the Act
of 1923 was passed after there had been a lot

of trouble in the southern part of Alberta
growing, out of drought, of course, but mainly
out of the larger question of whether or not
farming operations should have been alaowed
in that part of the Province. It was the late
Minister of -the Interior, the Hon. Frank
Oliver, I think, who expressed the opinion
that that country should have been reserved
for ranching; and in the discussion in another
place that point is brought out. In an attempt
ta deal with. that situation it was agreed that
because of the lightness of the soil, 160 acres
was not enough land on which ta farm in
that country; and the Government believed
that they would remedy the situation ta some
extent by allowing another homestead ta be
taken. But it is ta be borne in mind that
this gives ta everybody who ever had a homestead the right to take a homestead in the
area mentioned.
I am not greatly impressed with the memorandum thait has been read. I am a little bit
diffident in saying thait I do not care ta
accept the statement that the Premiers of the
Western Provinces have agreed, because I
fancy that according ta parliamentary practice
such a statement should be accepted; but I
draw attention to the fact that only two
Provinces out of the three are reported on.
I would also point out that the Minister made
his statement with respect ta the Bill as
introduced in the House of Commons, and not
with respect ta the Bill as now before us, and
that he was willing in the course of the
discussion ta agree to almost any amendment
that anyone cared ta offer.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
open mind.

325
That shows an

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It showed so
open a mind that it deepens the suspicion that
lurks in my mind, and makes me think that
we should look very carefully into the whole
matter. Lot me put it another way in order
that the House may get a certain slant on it.
There are in every constituency in those
three Provinces a certain number of people
who have taken up homesteads and who would
The
like ta take up second homestead.
gent-lemen whose names have been mentioned
are mombers of the House of Commons.
Suppose there are 1,000 homesteaders in each
constituency, and that 250 of them would like
a second homestead; if those members of
the House of Commons disapprove of this
proposa. they will come into conflict with
these people at once. Consequently there is
something to be gained politically by supporting the Bill, and a good deal to be lost by
opposing it. But we in this House, the
traditional guardians of the oights of the Provinces, were not invited to that Conference. Probably there is a reason for that ton. This involves a question of policy-I might alrmost say
of national policy. One can see the political
wheels going around, and I think we ought
to step in, and, as far as we can, assist the
Premiers of those Provinces in the enunciation of a sound policy, which they will contral,
by the Dominion. I do not want to be at all
offensive in saying that I hesitate to accept
the statement the Minister made in another
place as to the acquiescence of the Prime
Ministers of those Provinces; but I woiild
like to sec a statement from them in writing,
laid upon the Table of the House. If they say
it is a good Bill, I have nothing more to say.
Hon. Mr. CROWE: Could the honourable
Leader answer the question I have asked?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question is:
Does this cover British Columbia? I do not
bellieve it does.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, it does, in this
way. This is an amendment ta section 11 of
the Dominion Lands Act, chapter 113 of the
Revised Statutes, and sections 3 and 4 say:
3. Except as provided by this or any other
Act of the Parlianent of Canada, this Act applies,

The Sonate ro-uniod troni Tiîirsday, Api-il
19, tiie icl.ournoci debata on the iîiquiry ot
the Hon. Mr. Rcid.

APRIL 25, 1928
That he will cali the attention of the Senate
ta the St. Lawrence waterways prajeet, and inquire if it is the intention of the Government
to lay on the Table of the Senate the Report
of the Advisory Committee an the proposed
scheme.
Hon, J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen. last week, in order ta facilitate
Government 'business, I consented ta the adjournment of this discussion. I had said Vhat
thîs Hanse owed a~ debt of gratitude ta the
honourable member for Prescott (Hon. Mr.
Reid) for having brought this matter before
it. I think we also owe a deht of thanks ta
the honourabie member from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) who. bas obtained the appointment of a ýCommittee on the sutbject. I conaider that such a Cammittee will be very
useful, because the menibers of the Cammittee
and of the Senate generally wiIl be able ta
control whzat bas been said in this House; and
I understand further that tihe Committee will
have before it experts who wiil either admit
what bas been said in the Hanse, or, if it is
wrong, correct it. I think this Cammittee
should take cognizance of what bas taken
place here.
Now, the hanourable gentleman fram de
Saiaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) spoke after the
honourable Senator from Prescott (Hon. Mr.
Reid). 1 may nat a.grea with the honourable
gentleman from de Salaberry, but before diaagreeing with him may 1 say that lie knows,
from what lias ap.-eared in a certain newspaper in Montreal, the sentiments that I entertain towards him. I venerate hilm as a man
who will attaîn four score and three years
next May and is still full of vigour. His mind
is as bright as that af a man of fifty; and
physically-Whyl 'when some of us get off the
train with him and waik towards the hotel, we
have ta say; "Don't go so fast, we are flot
your age." When he goes up Beaver Halil
hilI very few men can foiiow him. He bas
reason ta th-ank divine Providence. He is
very active as a legal gentleman and in many
other capacities. I have said befare naw that
as -a member of the Board of the Canadian
IlPacific Raiiway he is not a silent member, but
very often he advocates what becomes the
poiicy of that great enterprise. Having said
that, may I now be permitted ta differ fromn
him on certain thînga. 0f course, a man cannot be universally expert, and 1 think he
would be the first one ta admit that about
navigation. He cannot possibly be as weli
veraed as he might have been had he been a
sailorman. For instance, he believes that big
canais can have rates as 10w as smail anes,
when the fact is absoluteiy the reverse, as is
proven by a book by Moulton, entitied,
"'Waterways vs. Railways", a mast illumin-

ating book which helangs to the Library
'arliament.

of

Hon. M.r. BFLOOURT: It is aid.
Hon. Mr. cAJSGRAffN: It is dated 1.912,
but there -bas not been very much change. The
hanaurabie gentleman firat spoke a great deal
about Mr. W. D. McULchian. Well, Mr.
~Molachlan is a very good engineer, 1 dare
'say, but his opinion is that of an engineer.
He spent four years, fram 1914 ta, 1917, an the
'shores of Hudson Bay, and at iast, in 191,7, he
'discavered that Part Nelson wai nat a very
'gaod port-i fact nat a good port at ailand he made the matter public, and of course
both gavernments have spent inuch money in
deveioping that part. Mr. Bowden was Deputy
'Miister of Railways and Caais.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Chief. engineer.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Chief engineer, and
I think my honourable friend was Minister at
that time. Mr. McLachlan might have inquired from, the first captain who tried t<j
mnake that part, and that captain would haver
told hjm at once that the port was not iof
mucb us-.
To give you an idea af the difference between the engineers, this very valuminaus report that we have here shows that the
engineers themselves do nat agree at ail taThe Canadian engieers submait one
day.
thing. and the American engineers another.
I think that at least thase engieers, who were
eniployed for some years, should have braught
ta this parliament and the Gavernment a
report in which they agreed.
For instance, take the one point-that of
regulation of 'the levels of the great lakes.
The Joint Board af Engineers, in their repart,
point out that regulation af leveis is practieable only wi'thin. very restricted limits, and
that the benefits ta be dbtained are incammensurate with the cost. They canclude that
generai regulation is clearly inadvisabie foar the
purpose of improving lake levels for lake
navigation, and that there is no present justification for the great expenditure necessary ta
provide regulating works in the interest of
They further draw attenpower production.
tion ta the confliet of înterests involved. If
levels are maintained in the Great Lakes it
will be at the expense of na\Vigation in the
St. Lawrence River. Il lake levels are drawn
down for power purposes it will be ta the
detriment of navigation in the Great Lakes.
The interests ta benefit by maintaining lake
leveis are largeiy in the United States. Those
ta benefit by impraving navigation in the St.
Lawrence are in Canada.

APRIL 25, 1928
Canal, which is called the New York State
Barge Canal. It was a five foot canal, and it
wras increased to a 12 foot navigation with
the idea that it would im.prove the tonnage.
Here is the State of New York department
of Public Works special report to His Excellency Alfred E. Smith, Governor of that
State on the New York State Barge Canal,
by Frederick Stu'art Greene, Superintendent of
Publie Works." I wish honourable gentlemen
to see what happened to the United States for
increasing the depth or enlarging that canal.
That report says:
That the traffic carried on the Barge Canal
bas fallen short of expectations cannot be denied. Tie canal has a theoretical annual capacity of 20,000 tons. In 1919, the first year after
the canal was opened throughout its length,
1.238,844 tons were floated, last season 2,344,013 tons were carried. This increase has not
been sufficient to prove the canal an economic
success.
That report is dated February
Now, note the figures as to cost.

26, 1926.

The cost of the canal during 1925 was:
Maintenance and operation.. .. $ 2.081,841,26
Capital charge.. .. .. .. .. ..
6,137,495 08
Permsanent betternents .. .. .. .1,092,051
52
Claims paid.. ..........
722,175 89
Cross Cost.. ............
Less Receipts.. ...........

$10,933,563 75
359,936 91

Net cost to the taxpayers.

$10,573,626 84

The greater part of the tonnage was bulk
freight-grain, sulphur, salt, etc.,-which is carried at low rates by water and rail; a fair
aierage rail rate on the commodities carried
by canal fron Buffalo to New York, the longest
haul, is $3.70 per ton. In 1925 it cost the State
$4.51 per ton for all freight floated on the
canal. recardless of the length of haul. From
these figures it is evident thsat it would have
been cheaper for the State, if all the freight
carried on the canal had bee put on railroad
cars and the State had paid the freight bills.
The canal is only floating one-tenth of its
tonnage, and the report adds:
If twenty persons, knowing the Canal, were
asked why it is so little used, probably twenty
different answers would be given; but the
fundamental reason is ice-the Canal is closed
by ice for five months each year.
To go on still with the Erie Canal, when
it had only five feet for navigation it did
quite a tonnage, but when they increased it,
it does not do now one-third of the tonnage
that it did before it was increased
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Why?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will proceed and
you will see. There are a large number of
terminals named, about 16 in all that have
received no canal freight either in the warehouses or out of them during the past two

329

years. . Then, the report goes on and gives
what all these places cost, and proceeds:
Official records show that many of our
Terminais have never been used for canal
tonnage since the day they were built. The
Terminal at so important a city as Albany
costing $312,914 bas received but one snsall
canal shipment (lumber) during the past two
seasons, and in that time no canal freight at
all bas gone in or out of the freight house.
Naturally thinking that because it was not
prospering it might do so if they built elevators, they decided to build a 1,000,000bushel elevdtor at Oswego, and it was represented to them that ships would be waiting
to unload there and give freight to the canal.
The report says:
The 1.000.000 bushel elevator at Oswego bas
beenss in service too short a time to say in fairn tss that it is a failure, but it is entirely
proper to show its cost and earnings

up

to

January 1, 1926. During thedays of agitation for the construction of this elevator, it
was clained that lake steamers would be waiting at the wharf to discharge grain on or
before the opening dates. This elevator was
ready to operate on May 16th, last, but it
was not until October 21, 1925, that any conmsercial grain was handled. This was Canadian
wheat placed in the elevator for winter-storage.
And it goes on to say how much money
this has cost.
So you see, honourable gentlemen, that it
is not always wise to think that by increasing
the size of canals you will increase the
business. The question whether you have a
big canal or a small one will not affect the
quantity of grain grown in the West. However, I will deal with that point later.
But let us come back to the remarks of the
honourable gentlema-n from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Beique). The burden of his speech was
that we could make a treaty. I have no
doubt in my mind that the honourable gentleman could draft a treaty perfectly; perhaps
nobody could do it better than be. That is
all very well. We know, for instance, that
in another place Monsieur Ernest Lapointe
gloats over the fact that he signed a treaty
all by himself, aithough the representative of
His Majesty in Washington was willing, nay,
eager to sign the treaty. Now I leave it to
honourable members of this House, do you
think tihat that treaty would have been
weakened if it had been signed by the representative of His Majesty? Does the honourable gentleman who presides with such dignity
over the deliberations of this House think
that the treaty would have been weakened
if it had been signed by the representative of
the greatest empire that the world bas ever
known? Does the honourable leader of the
Opposition think that the treaty would have
been weakened? As for my honourable leader

d30

SENATE

on this side of the House, he will close this
debate and will tell us whether ho thinks it
would have been weakened or not. These
treaties are all very well. Net only Monsieur
Ernest Lapointe, but anybody, can sign a
treaty, but how about enforcing it? That is
the question. Notwithstanding all the perfect
clauses that the honourable member from De
Salaberry might draw, is there any court to
which he might appeal to have that treaty
Supposing that such a court
respected?
existed and the honourable gentleman got a
judgment from the court, where is the sheriff
to execute that judgment? It is sad to say it,
but it seems to me that in international
matters, in the last resort, might prevails over
right. It may be all wrong, but that is the
fact. It is true that we might refer a dispute
respecting a treaty to the Court at the Hague,
but the question can be referred only when
both parties are willing, and if both parties
are willing to adjust their difference, what is
thb good of going to court? They can settle
the disp ute between themselves if they are
both willing, but if one party is unwilling, that
great international Court sitting at great expense ai The Hague cannot even issue a
subpoena or summon a witness. Nobody can
deny that. Therefore the less we have of
th e treaties the better, for the interpretation
lia will prevail will probably ho the interpretation placed upon the treaty by ihe richest
aind lie mightiest.

of Quebec; cerfainly a man who has occupied
very high positions. This is what he said in
conclusion: "We hear rumours about certain
trea tics and other matters, but let us hope
that the St. Lawrence River may always be
a Canadian river. And remember Chicago!"
Thait was said yesterday afternoon in the
good old Chateau Frontenac in Quebec.
The honourable niember froin De Salaberry
will admit, I think, that it would be very
hard for him to scull a dory across a crcek,
or that lie could qualify for captain or mate,
or even coxswain. We ought to leave everyone to his own vocation, and, I repeat, when
you want to know about navigation you
shouîld consult marine men-sea captains,
navigatois, and the rest.
Mr. D. W. McLachlin occupies, I dare say,
a good position in the Government Service,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

but it must be remembered that just as it
is net the best lawyers who want te become
judges, se it is net the best engineers who
work for the Government. One of the members of this Commission, M. Olivier Lefebvre,
who is Chief Engineer of the Quebec Streams
Commission, is such a valuable man that
various companies outside wanted his services,
and he told the Government: "I am offered
so much by "-never mind the name of the
company; I know it well-" and I must resign and accept that salary." Thon, in order
te retain him, the Government of Hon. Mr
Taschereau votel him a salary of $15,000 a
year. 1 do net know that there is any engineer working for this Government who is
receiving such a salary, but the Government
of Quebec is paying it because they did not
want to lose his services. So I think that if
the Government desire to secire the very
best engineers they will have to pay a much
higher remuneration than Mr. MeLachlan and
others are receiving.
The honourable gentleman said also that
the enginieers disagree. The American engineers want to have a one-stage development, that is. one dam on Barnhart Island,
near Cornwaill, and the dam there would b
83 fet in height. Mark you what it means,
honourable gentlemen, to have such a dam
The
towering over the town of Cornwall.
Canadian engineers want a two-stage devolopment, with one dam about 60 feet in height
at Cornwall, which would still be very higih,
and above Morrisburg another dam, 20 feet
in height; the two making the same head,
giving the same power, but without as mucli
risk. With regard to the big one, the onestage devclopment, I have here the figures
showinz the pressure that would be exerted
by the ice in the spring.
According to the report of the Joint Board of
Engineers the maxium pressure that could be
exerted by ice at the dam would be 32,000
pounids per linear foot. That is ten tons per
square foot, if the pressure was exerted by the
thrust of a wave.
lu the discussion that took place the American engincers were asked what would happen if an accident occurred-if, for instance,
tlere were a break in the dam. This question
was considlered a good while ago. I need not
tell you that the captains and pilots are
agains any such dam, and when we want men
to navigate steamers we do not look for
enlgine'ers, even the most competent and most
renowned. If there were a break in this dam
what wou'd be the consequences? Suppose
there were an ice jam, the formation of which,
it is admitted would be facilitated by the dam
at the Long Sault.

APRIL 25, 1928
The tirst report made by Canadian Government engineers on the damming of the Long
Sault discussed the possibility of the dam
being destroyed. This report was made nlot
lately, but on December 15.. 1908--almost
twenty years ago-to the then Governor General, His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught,, and was signed by Wm. P. Anderson,
who was Chief Engineer of the Department
of Marine and Fisheries; Mr. M. J. Butler,
e-ho wvas Deputy Minister of the Department
of Rail'ways and Canais; and M. Eugene D.
Lafleur, the Chief Engineer of the Departmcnt
of Public Works. In section 6 of their report
these engincers said:
The possible destruction of the proposed dam
by natural forces or by malice of an evilyintentioned person; (an earthquake might be
the means of destroying the dam) certainly a
very few pounds of dynwnitc in the hands of
a man knowiiug how to use it, would be most
disastrous. The volume of water which the
dam would contain, would ho sufficien.tiy great,
if liberated in the form of a wave to, at any
rate. destroy the greater portion of the town
of Cornwall--certainly the Cornwall canal or
that portion of it helow the dam-and without
doubt; tue mens of flooding Lake St. Francis
and alarge section of the land on thie river hank
protectel l'y the Hungry Bay dyke; besides unque.,tionably iniperilling the Soulanges canal, as
well as th'- villages fronting the river between
Lake St. Francis and Lake St. Louis. Whether
the effect of a suidclen break avould be taken
care of 1w Lake St. Francis and Lake St. Louis
is a question. Experience had on a very manch
smaller scale woll( lead one to expect that the
damage weould ha continued on through the
lower portions of MI\ontreal, with the possible
dlestruction of the Lachine Canal as well.
Honourable gentlemen, t.he question is, will
this Senate take the responsibility?

When in -the discussion tbe Ca'i,'adian ongmineers represented to their Amierican friends,

think , in the Mont-eai Gazette:
Some fifty steamers are oxpected to cross
the Atlantic this spring to enter the grain,
wood-pulp and pu]pwood carrying trades on the
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence. This includes eighteen new lake vessels that are heing
specially vonstructod in British Shipyards for
the Canadian service, and a numbor of them
will be Norwegian boats, similar to the smnall
craft that hai;e.visited this country in the past
f exv years. trading on the Great Lakes durine
the sunimer and sailing from Montreal to
Enropean ports on the conclusion of navigation.
About 32 of these steamers wi1l como up
again this year.

lake steamers engage in carrying wvood-pulp and

Considerable complaint has heen made from

and operation of the canais is a public charge
on the people of Canada and, to a smaller
extent, the United States, they are free te

to another on an oquality with the vessels of
the two boundary countrios. It la also stated
that these craft spend littie in Canada, and

Honourable gentlemen, I called attention
to this matter last year. Those ships coming
liere use our canals without paying a cent, and
we have to .pay. Is that fair to Canadian
bottons? The foreign vessels bring ail they
red of ship stores. They pay their men
about one-quarter of the wages that ours
receive, and they are ýcareful net to pay them

to Norway. Of course no man will quit and

I think the Minister of Customs should inst igate the stores brought in by those vessels

They operate on the Lakes the whole summer

mark you this. We are told that if this great

corne ail the way back; but net one of those
foreign steamers ever crosses the ocean during

Hon. Mr WILLOUGHBY: We were discussing that question last night.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And that bas been
going on for years. When our vessels are tied
up on account of the ice, those foreign vessels
are engaged somewhere else; they go and
operate in some southern clime. So they get
steady employment for twelve months of the
year.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Why could not ours go
away in the winter-time too?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Our big lakers could
not come down, because they are, some of
them, as long as 680 feet, whereas our canal
locks are only 275 feet in length. It would
be necessary to reduce them to half their

size, and that would hardly pay. So our boats
have to be tied up during the winter months.
This subject may be very dry, honourable
gentlemen, but I think it is worthy of careful
consideration. I have given it thought for
years. and for the last seven weeks I have been
devoting special attention to it, because I
know that the proposed scheme cannot be carried out without the permission of this House.
The Senate can vote for it or against it. We
have te take the responsibility. Therefore I
am doing my best to give to honourable members the benefit of'the hours and hours of
work that I have ,devoted to this subject.
With regard to ocean ships I would like to

of the Engineering Institute of Canada. He
says:

Before enlarging our canals, let us ask those
who use the present canals if they are used
to their full capacity, or even three-quarters
of it. This bas never been done.
This report of the engineers would have us
believe that there are 100,000,000 tons of
freight to be carried. That is not se at ail.
I have the exact figures, wlhich I will give you.
The average for many years past has been

APRIL 25, 1928
about 90,000,000 tons, and of those 90,000,000
tons only one in ten goes east of Lake Erie;
and as even that one ton has to be divided
with the United States, and as they are getting
60 per cent and we 40 per cent of it, you will
see that there is no need of increasing the
capacity of our canals.
I have here a letter from Mr. J. Lambert
Payne, in which he says:
I am sending to you herewith the report of
the Superintendent of the 'New York State
Barge Canal for 1925.
With regard to the traffic on the old Erie
and the new barge canal, the latter having
been completed in 1921, the facts for certain
are as follows:
The proposed St. Lawrence
development originated in the United States.
It would seem, however, that our neighbours
make very little use of the present waterway.
They have a big business at the Soo, but very
little indeed for the St. Lawrence. For the
year 1926 the total traffic through both the
Canadian and American locks at the Soo was
85,679,087 tons.
Here may I draw your attention to the

report of the Board of Engineers, in which
they say it is 100,000,000 tons. Mr. Payne
goes on:
Very little of this reached either the
Welland or the St. Lawrence canals. As a
matter of fact, 53,874,364 tons consisted of ore
which goes out at Buffalo to Pittsburgh. A
further 12,874,336 tons was coal, and about
9,000,000 tons was Canadian grain and flour-of
which the United States takes 60 per
cent, and we take 40 per cent.
So far as the St. Lawrence canals were
ooncerned in 1926, out of a total volume of
6,123,701 tons, 1,772,860 originated in the
United States. Yeu will sec at once that the
American business is of very little importance,
and I cannot sec how a larger canal system
would in any way stimulate American traffic
on the St. Lawrence. The United States cannot expert to increase its exports of farm
proditcts because cf growing domestic consirumption.
The attitude of our American
friends towards the St. Lawrence canal scheme
is merely a mask for the water power project.
As I told you, I am convinced that the three
inctors of increased overhead, the short season,
and one-way traffic, would make it impracticable
for large ships to operate through to Montreal

at present rates. The larger the ship the larger

would bc the overhead, and it is also true that
the larger the ship the slower would be its
progress through the canals. It is time that
governs freight rates by water, and not
distance.
Yours sincerely,
J. L. Payne.

It is not my intention to-day to discuss
the question of power, but I have here something about the diversion of water through
the Messina canal: At the top of the Long
Sault there is a canal cut from the St. Lawrence down to the Grassy river, a distance of
ten or fifteen miles, and a diversion is made

there of 86,000 horse power.

During the war

333

we permitted the company to build a submerged dam in order to throw more water
into their canal to increase their power for
the purpose of making more munitions.
Hon. Mr. REID: May I interrupt for a
moment? I just want to explain that neither
the Government nor the people of this country permitted that; it was one vote of the
International Joint Waterways Commission
that did it in opposition to the Government.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Thank you. And
what happened? It was well understood that
that submerged dam should be dismantled

immediately the company stopped manufacturing munitions. That was ten years ago;

and what has happened since? Not only
has the dam not been dismantled, but there
is to be an application in Washington on
the 15th of June to raise it six feet more. If
honourable gentlemen will permit me, so
as to save the time of the House, I will file
the details instead of reading them. This
is just a statement of the facts.
Diverting Water From St. Lawrence Through
The Messina Canal
Ottawa, April 7.-The International Waterways Commission, at the request of the Canadian Government, has postponed consideration
of the application of the St. Lawrence Power
Company to divert more water from the St.
Lawrence river through the Messina canal,
New York.
That such an application should be made at
all is of considerable importance, as indicating
the possibilities of complication that might arise
if the United States and Canada should agree
to proceed with the proposed St. Lawrence
Deep Waterway and Power scheme, as a joint
entierprise.
The proposal to divert more water via the
Messina canal is of special concern to navigation interests, since the water so diverted debouches into the Grassy river and is lost to the
St. Lawrence system. The proposal also demands consideration as showing that when a
vested interest is allowed to be established in
the St. Lawrence, even contractual obligations
are in danger of being lost sight of.
The Messina canal bas been diverting water
from the St. Lawrence for a long time. During
the war the power company operating the canal
asked and secured permission to construet a
weir extending into the St. Lawrence, to increase the flow of water into the canal. The plea

was that the companies deriving hydro-power
from the canal needed additional power to
manufacture munitions of war. The agreement
was that when the need for additional power
to manufacture munitions ended, the weir would

be removed.

But ten years have passed since

additional power was needed for munition
manufacture, and the weir bas not been removed. On the contrary, the company bas come
forward with a request to raise the weir, or
submerged dam, by six feet, in order to enable
it to divert more water.
River pilots have testified that the existing
weir appreciably affected navigation, making
the sehooting of the rapids more difficult. The

SENATE

334

pilots are unanimous in declaring that the weir
should be removed, instead of being raised ta
divert more water.
The Canadian Government engineers have reported strongly against the proposal that the
crest of the weir should be raised six feet, or at
aIl. Shipping companies have lodged vigorous
protests.
Some surprise is expressed that the Canadian
Government bas not served notice that Lt will
nove to have the St. Lawrence Power company
carry out the undertaking to remove the
dam. The niatter may be a sibject of negotiation between Ottawa and Washingtôn, but
the Canadian Governmient would have helped
its case if it bad formally requested the International Waterways Commission to withdrav
the recommendation under which permission was
granted to contrnct the weir.

One's impressions when one is young are very

water power energy is ncow sold at 50 cents per
liorse power per annm, and at Angusta,
Ceoigia, it is sold for $1 per annun.
From this you see quite plainly, honourable
gentlemen, that the United States are not
starving for power. Why should they want te
develop it here when they have se much?
Now, here .is a strange thing. If every drop
of water that fals on the United States were
turned into electrical power at every stage
until it reaches the ocean, it would not produce nearly as much horse power as is to-day
produced in the United States by coal. There
are many instances in which coal is cheaper
than water power: it is all a question of the
price of coal.
Now, honourable gentlemen, may I be allowed to make just one personal allusion-the
first time in twenty years that I have done sa,
I think. I have been familiar with the St.
Lawrence route-I am almost ashamed to admit it-since 1874, 54 years ago, when I, like
many other young men learning to become
surveyors, pulled a chain on the C.P.R. I have
passed through Sault SteýMarie on many occasions, and if anyone tells you that you can
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is quite posis
sible, but I want to be conservative. It
admitted that the steamers would take it from
Fort William to Prescott for 4 cents; so even
if the rate from there to Montreal were 3
cents, you would have a rate of 7 cents. The
further west you go the greater the saving
bppears to be. Around Chicago they say they
would save 10 cents or 15 cents, while in this
House it has been stated that 3 cents a bushel,
or perhaps 6 cents a bushel, could be saved.
The Canada Steamships last year carried
wheat from Fort William to Montreal for 5
tcents. If that is so, how could there be a
saving of 6 cents?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
any money on it?

Did they make

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will tell you how

it is done.
In the spring of the year when the season
opens up there is a rush which continues until
about the beginning of June, during the first
week of June it commences to diminish, and
about the 15th of June all of the grain is
down, and the ships have verr little to do,

APRIL 25, 1928
and many of them are tied up till the new
crop comes in. The new crop comes in about
the 15th of September, and the grain-carrying
trade continues until the end of the season.
Very often there is not a profit in operating
boats on the Lakes, but as ships cost almost
as much when they are tied up as when they
are moving-the only difference being the cost
of the coal-they take freight for almost
nothing.
Wheat has been carried on more
than one occasion from Fort William to Port
Colborne for 14 or 1l cents a bushel. On the
other hand, the rate on the return cargo is
very low.
The great bulk of the freight
comes east. Coal is transported from Lake
Erie to Fort William or Duluth, a distance of
900 miles, for 30 cents a ton, or no more than
it costs to take it from the curb of the street
and put it in your cellar. Nevertheless, this
is found money.
I said the honourable member for Hamilton

also proved-and I won't go into that question, because that is a lawyer's business-that
the United States is not competent to make a
Treaty with Canada without power of attorney
from New York State. It would be necessary
for the Washington Government to acquire
rights. And if the Supreme Court here, or
the Privy Council afterwards, so decided, it
would be necessary for this Government, before entering into a Treaty, to obtain the permission of the Provinces of Ontario and
Quebec before doing entering into a treaty.
However, that being a legal question I leave it
to the lawyers and the courts.
When Canada deals with the United States
in regard to matters in which the individual
states are concerned, she must realize that
she is not dealing with a sovereign body, but
with a Ibody which has only a partial-control
over the integral units, namely, the individual
states, unless conditions are so radically
changed that the states will surrender to the
union their sovereign rights; and as it is upon
this feature that the union is founded, there is
absolutely no possibility of the states giving
up their sovereign rights just in order to allow
the union to enter into a waterways Treaty
with Canada. In fact, the tendency is all the
other way. and, led by the Governor Ritchie
of Maryland, the states are more than ever
expressing their sovereign rights.
Now I come to the great question of ocean
ships. Ocean ships are costly. A 10,000 ton
ocean ship would cost this year $1,250,000, or
$125 a ton. The biggest laker on the Lakes,
15,000 tons, was built at the Port Arthur
shipyards at a cost of less than 35 a ton. It
carries 500,000 bushels of wheat-more than
would be carried by a train three miles long.

i

335

I claim that if an ocean vessel were to undertake one trip, it would never make another.
The overhead is too large. In the first place,
for what one ocean vessel would cost you
could buy three lakers of the same tonnage;
and in the second place, the ocean vessel,
because of her construction, the bunker coal
she has to carry, and fresh water, and the
winches and derricks and other appliances, of
which she carries many tons, would carry only
60 per cent of the load the lakers would carry.
This means that if the laker was making 5
per cent, an ocean vessel could make only 1
per cent. Now, suppose that an ocean vessel
did come here, how many days do you think
it would take her to make the return trip
from Liverpool to Fort William? It would
take 50 days. I verified that siatement by
steamship men. I said: "Surely I cannot have
the face to tell the Senate it would take 50
days," and they said they would not take off
one day, that it would take 50 days for the
trip provided the vessel had luck, no stoppages
in the canals, no fogs, and no storms. I
inquired next, "What is the ost per day of
a 10,000 ton ocean vessel?" and I was told it
was $800. Consequerntly, the cost of a 50-day
trip would be $40,000.
The westbound freight is very small. If you
can get one ton for ten you are doing very
well. Now that we are getting coal from
England a vessel might get a cargo as far as
Montreal, but from there it would not get
anything until it reached Port Arthur. At
Port Arthur it would take in 200,000 bushels
of grain, end I have figures here to prove that
il cents is all it could possibly get for taking
the grain right to London. Consequently, on
200,000 bushels its owners would get $22,000,
and as the trip would cost $40,000 there would
be a deficit of $18,000. So I leave it to honourable gentlemen to decide whether ocean
vessels will ever ,corne to that trade.
Now, there is another phase of this matter,
and that is this American made propaganda
for a deep waterway. I do not know that
there is really very much clamour for it in
this country. I am sure the Maritime Provinces are not very much interested in it, and
do not want it very badly; Quebec does not
want it; the northern port of Ontario does
not want it-if northern Ontario wanted anything, it would be the Georgian Bay canal;
the three western Provinces have an outlet
through Vancouver and Prince Rupert, and
very shortly they will have another through
the Hudson Bay, so they are well provided
for. Well, who does want it? Of course there
is the allegation that bas been made that it
would placate the people of the western

When we used to speak off the Georgian Bay
carnal they always spoke of "Chicago to the
Gulf," and now they have got additional
water by reason off the Chicago diversion.
This may flot mean anything to you when
mentioned in cubic feet per second, but when
1 tell you tiîat it is twice the normal flow
off the St. Maurice river, you will appreciate
what it means. It means the entire flow off
that mîghty river, the Saguenay, that is fiowing year in and year out, that gives them

This diseharge off the Mississippi is something ineredible. It is equal to twelve timos

Mississippi river, values 'the cost of tihis work
that we arc about to enter into at more than
twice the price men'tioned by the Joinbt Engineer's report. 0f course, somne years ago
tibis was going to cost $252,000,000, but now
the figuee bas reached about $650,000,000.
Colonell Cooper, a very well known engineer,
puts down tbe coat at $1,300,000,000.
I was speaking a minute ago about negotiating the Welland Canal. There is very
mueli discussion whether that canal can be
negotiated witb those large slips. If there is a
beam wind and tbe ships are com.ing- up, they
have to tic up. Anyone who knows anytbhing
about navigation wiil know that a ship cannot stecer if she 'bas no headway, and, as
it approaches locks, it must approach very very
slowly; so it would be very diffloult to negotiate that canal.
Tîten there is another objection, and a very
serious one. Whcn one of tbhose great freighters of 10,000 or 15,000 tons enters the Welland
Canal and gets near a look, it bas to comne
almost 'to a standstill, for if shc would move
in the leaet a way to touch the gate of a
lock, the wbole thing would be goie; so she
is brouglit vcry carefully, and once she is in
thc dock she bas to be warped; they wouýld
flot d'arc to turn steani on,, and sIc rnuý. lie
warpcd from one lock into thc other. Fancy
thc time it would 'take, and the effort wi.th
steam winches, etc. On the Panaina Canal
tîcre are huge locomotives, thc biggest in thc
world-they call thcm mules; and there are
steel hawseris holding the ships firin bchind,
and steel hawsers in front; and sometimes
there are eigît locomotives, if it is a big
ship, and sometimes there are four. That is
tIc wvay they negotiate those big ships from
one lock to another with the greatest care.
Thc locomotives arc on terra firmna, so they
have a chance to hld the slip se-curely,
There is notbing of tîat kinýd in the Welland
Canal. How it wais forgotten 1 do not know.
I have read only to-day that people arc
saying that even when the Welland Canal is
flnished, it is very dotbtful if slip owners
will use it. If thcy did not use it, wc would
be .just as we are now; ehips with fourteen
feet draft would comne down the Welland
Canal, nnd we would be just as we were.
Big ships are not made to navigate -restrictcd water; that is one tbing that should
be undcrýtood once and for all. They cannot
be economnically operatcd in restricted water.
Only small and chcap slips can spend the
time in canals. The overhcad is too great
on the expensive sbips to spend their time
there. Besides that, they are very slow in
moving. If you are expecting friends from
Europe, you know tIc time it takes to bring
to the wharf an ocean steamer. of perhaps

10.000 or 12,000 tons. It takes one half or
three-quarters of an hour, with tugs. That
operation has to be done when approaching a
lock, when in the lock, and when coming out
of the lockC; so the tixne that is wasted can
be judged. For instance, starting from Port
Coîborne at present with a load, with smaller
bouts, Montreal can be reached in a littie
over three da-ys, and the trip going up occupies
nearly four days, the round trip taking seven
days. Starting from Port Coîborne and going
to Fort William, the round trip could be made
in about the same time. So it can be seen
that there is no advantage whatever in having
týhose big vessels, for they would take nine
da3-s to go from Port Coiborne to Montreai
and back. That is the information I have
from people in the business. A fourteen foot
barge going from Port Colborne to Montreal
would take seven days. wbile a twenty foot
boat would take perhaps nine days.
People often wonder why so much of our
wheat goes to New York and Buffalo. It is
becatîse this wheat has been contracted for,
and bas to be at a certain place at a certain
time, and the parties interested will flot take
chances on a canal. For instance, if there
should lie a lock broken, or one of the boats
9ground in the canal, there is an entire tic-up
for one, two or three days; and if the cargo
misses connection, the buyer of the wheat on
the other side may refuse to take it, or will
take it only at his own price. That is why
so rauch goes to New York, because there are
alwe-ys many steamers that want to take it at
cheap rates, and they want to stabilize the
shipa. Instead of building or enlarging these
canals from Prescott to Montreal. it would
lie mnuoh cheaper and better for the Government simply to send the wheat down by train.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Casgrain, the debate
was adjourned.
PATENT BILLS
RECOMMENDATION

0F COMMITTEE

lion. Mr. BEIQUE presented the report of
the Committce on Miscellaneous Private Bills,
to whom wvas referred Bill 16, an Act respecting certain Patent Applications owned by the
British Steel Piling Company, Limited.
H1e said: We bave a number of applications
of this kind. The Patent Act a few years ago
granted one year to anybody who bad
patented an article in a foreign country, durin- which lie was allowed to ask for a patent
in Canada. This bas heen extendcd to two
years, by a judgment of the Exchequer Court.
1 do not think that Canadians have the same
privilege in foreign countries; I think it is
only one year. Howcver, there appear to be

56109-22
REVISED ÉDITION

SENATE
a number of persons who delay for three,
four or five years, after they have obtained a
patent in foreign countries, before making
application in this country. The Committee
have considered the matter fully and report
that the preamble of the Bill was not proved
to their satisfaction. The Committee have
arrived at this decision on the ground that
the passage of the Bill would not be in the
public interest.
In making this report I desire to inform
the House that the Committee, on the occasion of considering this Bill, deemed it
advisable to adopt a motion expressing the
poli.cy intended to be followed by the Coimittee. It is not made in the form of a
motion. because that would not be regular.
Your Conimittee is of opinion that the
provisions of the Patent Act, as to the time
within which applications may be made, should
be ahllered to, except in cases of extraordinary
illeri t.

It was brought to the attention of the
Committee that when a patent is granted in
a foreign country, say the United States, and
a factory is erected in that country for the
manufactue of the article patented, it is
manufactured on so large a scale that we can
hardly hope, when the article is patented two
or three years afterwards in this country, that
it will be manufactured here, because the price
of the article will be 25, 40 or 50 per cent
cheaper in the United States than in this
country. The consequence is that for twelve
or fifteen years, for the life of the patent, the
people in this country will be purchasing the
patented article from a foreign country. In
view of these facts the Committee thought
that this practice of extending unduly the
time within which applications of this kind
may be made should not be encouraged.

PENSIONS FOR DEPENDENTS OF

CIVIL SERVANTS
INQUIRY

Hon. J. D. REID rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That hie will eall the attention of the Senate
te the question of a pension for the dependents
of deceased Civil Servants retired under the
provisions cf the so-called Calder Act, and
iuquire if if is the intention of the Government te introduce legislation granting pensions
te thiose dependents.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, 1 will take
only a f ew minutes te explain the meaning
of this inquiry, seo that the honourable leader

of the Government in this Chamber may be
able te get the desired information for me.
The honourable gentleman will remember
that there was in force for a good many years.
a Civil Service Superannuation Act whereby civil servants were granted superannuation
as they retired. Later that Act was replaced
by the Civil Service Retirement Act, under
which civil servants were compelled te pay,
I think, 5 per cent of their salaries, which was
credited te their account and on their retirement refunded te them. Next came what
is commonly known as the Calder Act, the
purpose of which was te permit of the retirement of civil servants unable te performn
their duties and the payment te themn of a
pension for the rest of their hives. They
couhd be pensioned off on the lines of the
original Civil Service Superannuation Act.
The Calder Act was pasFed as a temporary
measure te remain effective until a new pension Acf couhd be passed through Parhiament.

340

SENATE

Finally fthc Civil Service Superannutation Act
xvas passed. This measure, as I remember
if, provided that aIl Civil Servants, even
those who had flot been on the superannuation list, shouid lie eligible to receive a superannuation allowance aceording ti tihe nmber nf years they had. been in the Service,
and
if I
remember
rightly, tbey were
required to make payrnents equtivalent to
flic prcmiurns they would have paid hiad
they been contribuiting aIl those -%ears. In
that Act there 'vas a clause providing fliat
certain deitendents of deceased civil servants
-for instance, the widlows-sould. le entîtlcd to pension. Tînt, I tbink, is the situation to-day.

APRIL 26, 1928
Men who had been in the service for, say,
twenty-five or thirty ycars f elt that they had
to accept retirement under the Calder Act or
would probably have had to retire without
any allowance. Their widows have been lef t
without anv assistance whatever. Many civil
.servants who retired under the Calder Act
did flot know that a superannuation measure
would be introduced shortly afterwards.
Besides cases of that kind, there are also the
cases of persons who had been a long time in
the Service and who died even hefore the
Calder Act came in. They should have heen
under the Superannuation Act, but t hey could
flot corne under it on account of the way it
wvas drafted at that time.
The information that I would like to obtain
is along somewhat similar uines with the information which the Covernment had to get
when the question of annuities to civil
servants' widowvs was under consideration. I
know the Government made inquiries with
respect to the civil servants who had died
and the number of dependents who were left,
and I think that the amount of money
required was found to be not very great and
the Government were glad to do justice to
the dependents.
I will transmit
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the ramarks of my honourable friend to the
Department of Finance.

in accordance with the historical facts. The
Communists and Socialists are flot distinct
tribes of people; they are the same people,
but they are endeavoring, by the sornewhat
different methods, to approach the goal which
they seek to attain. They both rest upon the
conception that private property is wrong.
Our whole experience of human life and
human p"session is based upon the acquisition of private property. It is upon the
principle of ownership of private property
that ail our civilization rests. The Comrnunists think that the possession of private
property, dividing rich from poor, dividing
the great from the ]owly, dividing those in
places of power from those who follow, is ail
wrong in itself; that it should be cured; and
that the cure is the communal idea of ownership and Possession, and ail the rest of it.
There is no distinction between the attitude
and the philosophy underlying and behind
Cornmunism and Socialism.
The methods that they seek to employ,
particularly the revolu tionary Communists, is
of course to be sought along the line of revolution based upon force, and the Socialists
in endeavouring to work ont the same idea,
follow along the line of what we understand
to be constitutional development. To that
eutent I arn in accord with my hononrable
friend from Edmonton. But the idea that I
desire to bring before hononrable members
this afternoon is that the constant evolution
and developrnent, the historical growth of
Commnnism, the historical development of
Socialism, is a constant breaking-down from
revolutionary to a middle view and later to
what 1 have termed a constitutional position.
The whole history of those movemnents across
the seas, in ail countries, even' inclnding
Russia-to which I shall presently refer-I
Lhink entirely proves that proposition.
Let me for a moment or two mun quickly
across the history of the years. You al
understand what it means when one speaks
about the Industrial Revoîntion

in English

if e, for example-the old system of manufacturing at the close of the eighteenth century, when the cottage manufacturer emuployed helpers who lived in lis house, and
whose ernployment ended in a happy way so
often, with the favourite apprentice marrying
the favourite danghter of the owner. That
meant a hurnanitarian connection between the
employer and the employee. Then came the

invention of machinery; then came the
creation of capital and capitalistie production;
then you had at the one end of our civilization, of our economie life, the owner of money
and the factory, and at the other end the
employee; and, as Carlyle said in 1830 and

1840, there was nothing between them except
a cash nexus-a man worked for his employer,
and the employer got what hie could out of
the employee.
This was the basis of the developmeînt of
the
the
stili
and
was

trade union movement in Britain across
nineteenth century, a movement which
continues in various towns in ail places.
in the Dominions to-day. That movernent
constantly wrought out from the nine-

teenth century, sometimes involving fights and
turmoil, but more partîcularly, when it accomplished anything doing so through a constitutional kind of procedure following the
kind of precedent that hroadened slowly
down.
On the continent there was a different con-

dition.

You had old establishments-that of

France bruken at the timie of the revolution.
But those in Austria, Germany and Italy held,
and particularly Russia, where there was no
establishment at aIl except the establishment
ofan entirely autocratie regirne. There you
had a different attitude, a different sou, a
different method of procedure.
l'hen cornes the proper European movenment of Kari Marx. Before 1 deal with hirn
-for his Comniunist Manifesto was flot issued
before 1848, that year of the revolution, the
yea r of the beginning of a Nationalist movenient in countries of Europe-may I briefly
point out that in the haîf century before
Marx came vou had a series of Communist
sociptic's formed by the radicals in France, in
Gerniany, and in England, too, and they proceeded to formi sncb communities, chiefly upon
this side of the sea. You had Robert Owen,
a Scotchinan, a manufacturer of cottons near
Glasgow on the Clyde, and you have his
establishmnent on this side of the sea. Thien
you have the moveinents of Cabet and others
in France, sometimes objecting to the conditions they found because of military rule,
sometimes because of the irnpossibility of
making their way ont of tihe industrial life,
sometimes becanse they wanted a freer systern
of education, and what not, but ail of thern
based upon the notion that community in
property was the ideal, and that the old notion
of private .property and institutions and ]andholding based thert-on, and aIl the rest of it,
must go by. I arn not going to repeat the
stories of them. They had many branches

in varions American States of America; they
offered various exhibitions of establishments
in varions sections of American life; but
every one of them failed, and only in 1895
did the last one go out of existence. They
were communal attempts of a variety, net of
the variety perhaps that we are more particularly acquainted with to-day.

APRIL 26, 1928
For instance, a writer who frequently offers
bis expressions of opinion in the New York
Times, proceeds to review a book which is
just out--"Marx an-d Lenine," writtein by Max
Eastman, bein.g also an exposition of what
the author calis the Science of Revolution.
Hie proceeds to show that thie old Marxian
doctrines on whioh a kind of reasonable
Socialism ba-s been founded, were fiinislied, and
that Lenine had proceeded to replace them
in Russian life by a revolutionary f ormn of
the same doctrines. But that is vanishing, too.
As hie says: Lenine did not hesitate to cali in
the bourgeois experts whom Lenine had
formerly dcspised, on the ownership of private
property, that older syqstem which Lenine and
bis system sought to overthrow. When the
wliole structure of War Communism ran up
against peasant resistance, Lenine did not
h1esitate to abandon War Com.munismn and
restore private trade. So hie goes on further
to illustrate wvhat that means, and hie adds
that Communiýsin has created a mass of 120,000,000 peasant proprietors, privýate owners,
-pett.y bourgeois. That is the condition for
the destruction of Communismn. Just so soon
os a man ceases to belong to the proletariat
and rises into the bouigeoisie state, just that
moment does lic cease to be a Communist.
Andc what bas happened to those 120,000,00
peasants?
The Russian Soviet state calis
upon those present proprietors of Russia to
provide grain to keep up the exports of Russian grain to the world. They begin to do so.
Buit it is taken for state uses. Tliey find it
therefore un-profita:ble for thern to do so, with
this resuit that instead of providing grain for
the Cornnunist State they provide only what
grain they reqiire for tliemselves, and the
wheat export of Russia has vanished into
almost nothingnes-anotlier example of many
wliereby the whole movement constantly falls
and breaks, from the establishment of a basis
of revolution to a new establishiment on the
basis of the ownership of private propertyin short, to thbe practice and the conduct of
private if e as we in our civilization understand it. 1 have made this statement in outline for the express purpose of laying a foundatien for 0one or Vwo furtlier observations and
one or two conclusions to which I think
logically my reasoning- on this subj ect must
eventually follorw.
May 1 then proceed to discuss the Ukranians o-f this country very briefly, and then
more partîcularly make some references to
the interesting statements offered by the hionouraible gentleman from Montarville?
Thie Ukranians of t.he older generation are
numbcred among the strangers wit'hin our
gates. They comne frorn a civilization which,

in sorne respects, is quite as old as ours.
For cenjturies the ITkranian lias heen kept
poor and ignorant, lest lie grow strong enougli
to throw off tlie master's nIle, made without
bis own consent. For centuries hie bas been
told that bis one chance of life lay in becoming a Pole or a Russian. If anyone bas
read Polish bistory or the liistory of thie LJkranians, lic will sec bow, period after period,
flret by ýthe Poles, tben iby the S'Wedes, then
b ' the Russians, and then by Russia, Prussia
and Austria in the years of the partitions o>f
Poland at the close of the Eigliteenthl Century. theýe people were liarried and wastcd
and oppressed witli fira and sword. No wonder, then, when they corne into our country
tliere is a still lingering tradition of fear toward the establishment of government even
ini Cainada, to which they find tbemselves
bound ýto ronform. And what kind of people
wvere tbey? Thie followving comes fromn a distingiiished European publicist later living and
writing in Amrneica:
1
They semn to surpass the Great Russians in
iiatî,ral intellect. good taste and poatical fancy,
bunt they are less practical, solid and perseveri]1îg.
Thev are gayer and gantIer than their
lirothers to the northward. Their wonien are
soft-voicedl and picturesquely dressed. Art and
poetry, iiioue and craftsmnanship bave always
becn at homne amnong tlmem in so f ar as their
inlers liva permitted. They lova the theatre.
Tlieir foll- melodies are admiired througbout
Butssia and oughýt to ha known everywhere.
l'le national poetry of f ew languagas excels
thmat of the Ukranians in anergy of expression
and depth of feeling. They are good wvorknaen,
tno. and great gardeners. Eveni a very poor
Ukram,,
nian home looks like a bouse rather than
a bu1 is kept scirupulouisly clean, contains sone
iit,
touelh of beauty, and possesses a gardai patch
that yields flowers as well as vagetables.
I bave seen many pictures of these Ukranian
bornes brought from that country by travellors; and by reading I have learned something of their very distinguished culture in
the universities thougli perhaps it does flot
appear in the poor peasants wbo settle on
<air western plains. I miglit add that the
culture of England, Scotland and Ireland,
great as tliey bave been in the past, did not
appelir, for instance, wlien some of my forefathers, for example, settled in the bush forty
or fifty miles from this capital city and
struggled with the toits of settlernent. I offer
this retrospect from this point of view; I
sometimes think that wc are not quite charitable enough to those who corne frorn such
situations, out of lands of oppression, and
have a history of tbis kind, and that we deal
with tbem a little too brusquely.
I do not think I need offer any apology for
what I say. I arn the son of an Englisb man
and an Irish mother, and I arn the busband
of a Scottish wife, and wlien I say to yen

APRIL 26, 1928
to which the Continental must conformn; for
the French system spread to ýother countries
of Europe.
In this matter of deportation we are coming
to the principle of the law of Europe and flot
that of the law of England. I quite recognize
that the honourable gentleman from Montarville off ered a sample of an English Act passed
a year or two ago. It would certainly be
presumptuous in me to criticize or comment
upon the work of the legisiature of England:
1 leave that to Professor Dicey.
He does
point out th-at in comparatively recent years
it has seemed as if the practice of the carlier
years had not been so clearly followed in
England, and this ýhe regrets. After ail, the
judge of an established court is the man who
eau most elearly, fully and definitely offer us
the best samipie of justice, and I will place
myscîf in the hands of any .iudge, but not
in the banda of an administrative official unless I arn driven to do co by statute. Let us
keep to the rule of Law.
This is the difficulty that comes to me when
I hear the honourable
gentleman from
Montarville offer certain suggestions and ask
what the Government is going to do about
the matter.
So far, then, as the Ukrainians are concerned, or any people of alien enigin within
our confines, they have in the past looked
upon government as the hand that was consta.ntly raised against thtim. They have been
held down by repressive measures, the power
of the sword, the power of a strong autocracy.
In the Australian section of Ukrainia you find
thie peasants in the flot very distant past
working for twenty-two cents a day, and in
places where they are employed all the year
round they were paid $5 for the entire year.
As a resuit of 8uch conditions there can be
nothing but a feeling governmental oppression ingrained in their constitution. It may
take a second generatien to remeve it.
The honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) said that in an
endeavour to put down the movement of
Cornmunisma his Government in days past
issued a pamphlet pointing out, for the information of the country, the meaning of
Communisým and that sort of thing. I quite
agree with the ho-nourable gentleman that
pubiicity thrcughi the pre.%s, the force of
h.bour unions, the intervention cf labour
ministers in industrial situations are quite
wortb while; but 1 do not at ail agree
that the repre8sion must co.me from the
hand of government. That is what in days
gene by, created oppression, the only conditions that.these people knew. It was to
escape from such a condition that they came

to this country. Therefore, se, far as tliere
sany imlplication that the Gevernment
at, Ottawa -sbould seek to intervene in matters
of that kind, 1 take exception te tbat, no
matter what. the political complexion of the
Government may he, because it is a violation
cf that rule cf law which lies at the basis
of British life and British legal practice. It is
compliance with "le droit administratif",
placing oneself in the hands cf the officiai,
within the power cf the bureaucrat.
The honourable gentleman mentioned the
sebools, and asked what the Government intended to do about the matter. I think he
will agrea that if those are Cathelie sehools,
in bis province or any other province of
Canada, the Church may very well be trusted
te take care cf the situation. I have offered
examples from the Protestant side cf sehool
life to indîcate that such a situation as has
been described by the honourabie gentleman
bas not made its a.ppearance in the public
sebools. If it is a question cf law, then the
offences come against the law cf the province
and must be attended te by the administration cf the province te w.hose jurisdiction the
law heiongs.
I do not know that I can add anything cf
particular interest in this respect except te
offer a further quotation from a paper
publi'ihed in Oshawa with reference te the
settlement cf the recent strike. Several newspaper references bave been made te the work
of the Minister cf Labour, reviewing the many
disputes which have arisen and the admirable
achievements cf the Minister in settling these
various difficulties, in Winnipeg, in Toronto,
An
in the East-in a variety cf places.
attenîpt xvîs made at Oshawa the other
day te set the labour unions by the cars by
persons professing themselves te be Coininuniý,ts, who came frum the city cf Toronto,
led by Mr. Jorhn McDonald, this dissatisfied
labour rman te wbom 1 have referred. Here
is the concluding comment of the Oshawa
Daily Times, a paper which, I understand, is
not entireiy in accord with the politicai views
of the Minister:
In or opinion great credit is due the M.%iniister of Labour for coming te Oshawa in person
and lending his good offces te bring about a
settiement of tbe strike. Ris arrivai here
yesterday, was, in our opinion, imost opportune,
and bis wise counsel and f air dealing, -,vas, we
believ e, al)preciated by both parties te the
eontroversy. The people cf Oshawa will have a
higher opinion of Hon. Peter Heenan as a resu It of his visit here this week.
This is the intervention cf common sense
and reasonableness.
I understand that the
bonourable gentleman from Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) may hold tbe view that tbe

propaganda such as described by the honourable gentleman will be speedily ended. That,
in my opinion, is the only effective way to
deal with the matter.
With regard to the foreign settiers generally, I have this to say: If we are desirous
of « seeing those people become the type of
citizens they éhould become, we sbould by
cxample set before them proper principles.
IJnfortunately, fromn a political standpoint,
this has flot been the case as far as Western
Canada is concerned. At election after election since those people have had the right
to vote they have been told ail sorts of outrageous yarns about what a certain party
would do if tliey got into power. At election
after clection, I remember, the cry was raised:
"If you vote for a certain party you wiIl be
dcprived of your land, you will lose your
home, and you will probably be deported."
That wvas a common misrepresentation, and it
undoubtedly .had its effect. 'Later the party
that had been so maligned by political heelers
came into office. Then the foreigners discovercd that there was no truth whatever in
such statements; that they hiad been made
only for political purposes, in order to catch
votes.
In order to show how statements are misconstrued 1 desire to cite one instance that
oecurred more recently, in the 1926 election.
A picnic was held in the neigh1bourhood of
Toronto, at which Mr. Meighen was the first
speaker. Immediatcly after speaking hie lef t
the platform. During the afternoon a man
by the name of Wright, a hotel-keeper in
Toronto, was called upon to speak. He made
the remark that the right of foreigners to
vote should 'ha restricted. This gentleman bas
no political standing in the Conservative
Party, and had no right whatever to indicate
what should be the policy of the party in that
or any other respect. This statement was
made without Mr. Meighen's knowledge or
authority. It is well known to every one that
Mr. Meighen always stood hy his policy and
proclairned it from one end of Canada to the
other without the slightest variation. Rad
hie intended to make any change in the franchize in relation to foreigners hie would have
proclaimed it just as definitely and clearly
among the foreigners in Manitoba and Saskatchewan as hie would in Toronto, but he
neither thought of nor uttered anyýthing of
that nature any'where in Canada. But wbat
happened? The statement of Wright was
twisted and turned and it was made to appear that this man was speaking on the
authority of Mr. Meighen. Wright'a utterance was used tbroughout the Western provinces. Thousando of copies of it were printed
56109-2S

in foreigni languages and distributed two or
three days before the election. It is needless
to say that this had its effect, and in consequence, I amn safe in saying, at least a dozen
seats in the Prairie Provinces and probably
a great rnany -more, were lost to the C'onservative Party. The political significance of
actions of that nature may he of comparatively littie consequence, but when we are
trying to make our foreign settiers good
citizens, why do we not act honestly witb
thern? Why do we not say that we are above
Surely the great
tactics of thait nature?

facts for the sake of a littie political gain. It

REGULATIONS AND ORDERS IN
COUNCIL BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
readig of Bill 62, an Act relating to the
submis.sion to Parliament of certain Regulat:ons and Orders in Council.
He said: In 1906 certain amendments were
nade to the Acts nentioned in this Bill, and
in addition there was a revision of the
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

While the Department of the
statutes.
lIr vior has been tabling the regulations,
action was not taken for complete validation
by resolution of parliament, and therefore
there is a doubt as to the validity of the
regulations that have been passed since 1906,
and by this Bill we are seeking to validate ail
these orders in council that ha.ve been passed
since that time.
The Bill has reference to Orders in Council
or Regulations made by the Governor in
Council under authority of The Railway Belt
Water Act, chapter 47 of the statutes of 19,12;
The Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act,
chapter 10 of the statutes of 19'11; The
Dominion Lands Act, chapter 20 of the
statutes of 1908; The Rocky Mountains Park
At, chapter 60 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada. 1906, or the Yukon Act, chapter 63 of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, which
are hereby declared te have the same force
and effeet as if they had been- approved by
both Houses of Parliarment -as required by said
Acts respectively.
The Acts referred to contain a provision
that Regulations passed thereunder shall
remain in force until the day immediately
succeeding prorogation of that Session of
Parliament and no longer unless approved by
resolution of both Houses. During a number
of Sessions froi 1906 onward the requiied
iesolution was not passed and consequently
this legislation is nceded to validate Regulations and Orders in Council made under the
v arious Acts.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I would ask if the
practice of governing this country by Orders
in Council is to be continued, and tien the
Acts to be validated. Since I have been in
this House I have heard a great many diseussions in whici the late Covernment was
accused of having governed the country by
Orders in Couocil. Now I flnd this Government passing Orders in Council, and then
passing an Act to validate them.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I believe
ny honourable friend is in error. If he will
allow mie, I will try to correct him. Every
session we pass Acts which need to be applied
and which can only he applied by regulations
to be approved by the Governor in Council.
This legislation which is submitted to us is
of the regular kind, and we approved of it;
but certain of those Acts state that not only
will these regulations as made and modified
be tabled at each of the following sessions in
the two Houses of Parliament, but also that
resolutions of Parliament will approve of
them. Apparently, since 1906, there has been
an omission in the procedure which was

APRIL 26, 1928
dictated by the Act itseif., Those regulations
were regulariy tabied, so that. the members of
Parliament were seized of their contents, but
in rnany cases there was an omission of a
resolution approving of those regulations.
A number of actions have been taken under
those Acts, and under the procedure made
in those regulations, and the Government f0day is obiiged to corne before Parliament and
ask that they be validated.
Mv honourable friend xviiI remember that
this is an omission which can be placed at
the door of sorne high officiais, and of ministers themselves, probably; but it covers
more than one administration. The cause of
the inaction would probably lie with the
officiai of the department who should have
seen to preparing the resolution, or calling
the attention of the Minister to the fact that
such resolutions should be submitted in order
to conform with the Act which called for
them.

as possible everything should be put in an
Act, and then people wouid know wbere tbey
were; but to lea 've power. in the banda of
the Minister to issue an Order in council
was wbat he greatiy objected to. Since tbat
time tbe Engiisb Parliament bas drifted
largeiy to a new system: it puts the principle
in the Bill, and leaves the rest to regulations
to be made afterwards. Tbat is an important change in the science of governmcnt.
We are probabiy doing the same tbing. In
that event, it may be just as well f0 insist
upon tbese tbings being tabled. To a certain
extent it is a f orm; but perhaps it is an important one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is much

impression that the mere depositing on the

EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 190, an Act to amend the
Exchequer Court Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this bill
offers some slight amendments on matters of
procedure
For instance, there are now two
judges of the exchequer court, the chief justice
and a puisne judge, and this bill is for the
purpose of making it clear that either the
president of the court or the puisne judge may
exercise the power which in many statutes is
conferred upon a judge of the exchequer court.
There is also a section of the act which provides that the practice and procedure in suits,
actions and matters in the exchequer court
shall be regulated by the practice and procedure in similar suits in His Majesty's high
court of justice in England. That provision
was made in 1877, and since then the practice
and procedure in the high court of justice in
England has been amended in many respects.
This bill is for the purpose of having those
same amendments apply to our exchequer
court.
The bill will also give to the judges of the
court the right to make general rules and
orders, instead of only the chief justice as formerly.
I move the second reading of the Bil.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would think it would
be a good plan to require that whcn thcse
rules and orders are made be published in the
Gazette. Perhaps that provision is in the
main Act. However, we can take that up
to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
YUKON QUARTZ MINING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 196, an Act to amend the
Yukon Quartz Mining Act.
He said: The object of this Bill is to introduce a system of percentages to replace the
present method whereby the federal government collects royalties on minerals.
We
are adopting the Ontario system.
The
difficulty in the Yukon has been that owing
to the very excessive cost of operations in the
outlying districts-transportation and other
costs incidental to mining-it has been impossible for the companies to operate and te
pay royalties, and year by year we have been
extending te them a privilege in allowing them
to escape payment of these royalties. Had

APRIL 26, 1928
we compelled themn to pay the royalties--we
have the assurance of responsible people ta
this effect-it would have closed down mining
operations in that district; and in order ta
obviate that I arn introducing this legisiation,
putting the systemi on precisely the samne basis
as that of the province of Ontario. Upon
annual profits in exeess of $10,000 and up ta
$1,000,000 the payment shall be three per cent;
in excess of $1,000,000 and up ta 85,000,000
five per cent; and in excess of $5,000,000 and
up ta $10,000,000, six per cent. On the excess
above 810,000,000 there is a proportional increase of one per centum for each additional
$5,000,000.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill wasread the second time.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
THIRD READING

May 1 add simply this? I regret that the
information furnished is not camplete. My
purpose was ta enable honourable membera
af this House, in dealing with this measure,
ta abtain at least a fair idea of the effect of
aIl the changes made. I observe that same
machinery is ta he admitted free of duty.
To what extent will this change injure our
home industry? I do nat know. Should we
not be informed on such a point? The tariff
an no iess than twa hundred items has heen
c'hanged. Should we nat know what the
effect of those changes is going ta be? A
grat many of them, I arn tald, wilI not affect
Canadian production at all: so much the
hetter. Some of them, I understand, will
affect Canadian production. The Government
contends that in the interest of the country
at large it is better that such should be the
case. Very well; but should we nat be fully
informed? Therefore I accept the information
as the modicum required ta save the principle
at stake, hut I regret that I can find in suoh
information very littie that is useful in ascertaining either the importance of the changes
contemnplated or their effect upan Canadian
industry.

Though I do not pretend to imagine the circumstances which would justify us, we have
the legal power to interfere; but the commonsense way of dealing with a matter of that
kind is to leave the Government of the day
unhampered, except in what is te nie an unimaginable case. The same is truc of the
Customs Act.
The honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), I think, was quite
riglit in asking for information. The House
has power to send a Bill of this kind to Committee if it chooses te do se, and the Committee may say, "We want te correct some
mistakes," or, "We want to make a recommendation."
Yeu cannot tell.
It is the
same with the Income Tax. That was
amended in this House two years ago, but
it was amended at the instance of the Governnent. The same thing may happen again.
However, apart from such instances, I think
that unless there is a very urgent reason
against it, this Chamber should pass such
locisla tion as tli Supply Bill, the Tariff, the
Incomo Tax Bill and that sort of thing.
Nevertheless it maxy be verv wise at times te
msbjiect these measures to discussion and possiblv even to make recouimmndations.
Honourable
Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, tihe remarks of the honourable
leader on the other side will meet with very
little criticisn on my part. We committed
ourselves by adopting unanimously the resolution of a Special Committee, signed by my
honourable friend (Hon. W. B. Ross), in
which it was declared as the first principle
to which adheredThat the Senate of Canada has, and always
lad since it was created. tlie power to anend
Bills originating in the Commîmons appropriating
or imposing a tax ly
any part of tlie revenuec

rediin.g tlie aiounts thereiii. but has niot the

riglt to increase the sane withmout the consenit
of the Crown.
Wlien I took the seat which I now occupy
I expressed concurrence in the principles of
tlat resolution. Changing sides did not mean
that I had changed principles. But I would
point out te honourable members the distinction that we ought te niake between the
assertion of a principle and the appropriateness of applying it. We have our limitations.
The Senate was created for a certain purpose
and was given those powers with which flie
Fathers of Confederation felt the Upper
Charnier should be vested. It never occurred
to them that the Senate of Canada should
interfere with the taxes which the people consent to pay. I hold that the levying of taxes
lion. W. B. ROSS.

is a matter which belongs very specially to the
House of Commons. There the people are
directly represented, and when the members
of that House consent to certain taxation I
doult very much that we should interfere
with it one way or the other.
The Tariff Bill which is at present before
us involves essentially the principle of taxation. It deals with the amounts which must
be paid by Canadians who desire to purchase
foreign goods. Those duties came into force
on the very day that the Budget Speech was
made, and the House of Commons has sanctioned theim. since the Bill is now before us.
This being so, I consider that the Senate
should be very careful about doing anything
which would thwart the popular will, as expressed in the House of Commons, as to a
levy which is to bc made upon the people
of this country. The doctrine or tradition of
this Chamber has been that the House of
Commons is supreme in this matter. As a
fact, since 1867 Bills of this nature have never
been referred by us to Committee for examination in detail; they have passed from the
sc roml to the third roading.
This doos not mean that the Senate is not
interested and has not the riglit to ask for
information. As I stated on the second reading, I recognize the Senate's riglit to inforination, because, first and foremost, the Bill
is before us and although our power is simply
that of acceptance or rejection. we may lbe
in need of further liglit before we can decide
to reject the Bill.
But I suggest again that in such a matter
as a levy upon the people the Senate would
not be justified in interfering with the proposed legislation and rejecting it-and thus
bringing about the dissolution of Parliament
and an appeal to the people-unless it felt
that flie whole economic system was being
revolutionized by a Bolshevistic governmnent
whicli did not represent the will of the people.
For this reason I felt that the tradition of the
Senate should be respected and such a piece
of legislation, emanating as it does from the
House of Commons, should not be submitted
to a Standing Committee of this Chamber,
before whom private interests could be
brouglit in to explain how they were being
affected; inasmuci as the House of Commons
is supreme on the question of the extent to
which the people shall be taxed, and in what
direction they shall be taxed. That is what
prompted me to object to a change from the
traditions of this Chamber, and to say that
I invited inquiries of all kinds and was ready
to give the desired information. I gave some
information to my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), but le knows how liard it is

aÔ9

to say what will be the direct effect of a
particular change upon one industry or
another. If he asked me what would be the
effect of a reduction of the tariff on a certain
class of article and an increase of imports of
that class, I should most likely be obliged
to tell him that I could not say, because the
manufacturers of that article in this eountry,
if they were afraid of greater competition
from abroad, would in many instances readjust their prices in order to meet that competition, and might do so perhaps without
very.great loss to themselves and with considerable advantage to the consumer. There
I enter upon the broad question of freer trade,
but I do not intend to go further into that
aspect. I simply mention it in order to indicate how difficult it is in many instances to
answer a direct question as to the probable
effect of a change in the tarif.
With these few remarks I move the third
reading of this Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I desire only to add a
qualification to what I said a few moments
ago, for fear I might be misunderstood, with
regard to this House in some extraordinary
event interfering with any such Bills as I
mentioned. The action taken by this House
in that 'event could be only in the way of
reduction or rejection. A proposal on the
part of any member of this House to increase
the levy would, I take it, be at once ruled
out of order by the Speaker of the House.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable gentlemen, at some time during this Session I wish
to make some observations in support of the
idea that it would be in the interest of Canada to have the customs and excise duties on
spirituous and malt liquors and on cigarettes
reduced. I was under the impression that I
would have to make those observations while
either this Bill or Bill 198 was before this
House. I am not very particular, but I would
like to have an opportunity of discussing the
matter at whatever time it would be in order
and would suit the convenience of the honourable leaders-whether on tihis Bill, or on
Bill 198, or at any other time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might perhaps dispose of this Bill first.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Any time would suit
me.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Beaubien was
withdrawn.
The motion for the third reading of the
Bill was agreed to, and the Bill was read the
third time, and passed.

CUSTOMS BILL
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 198, an
Act to amend the Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
I would ask
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Mr. Blair to come to the floor.
On Section 1-vessels found hovering in
territorial waters may be boarded and brought
into port:
I was asked
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
by the honourable member from Souris (Hon.
Mr. MoLean) what would happen if a ship
transferred its registry to Newfoundland. My
answer is that in that case we could not
follow that ship beyond the three mile lirnit,
or the territorial waters; but the terrn
"territorial waters" does not mean exclusively
the three mile limit. My attention has been
brought to the fact that in the Bay of
Chaleurs there are rum-runners who stand a
few miles away, or in the centre of that bay,
and sell rum to our fishermen when they go
out, to the very great detriment of the
families of those fishermen, who come back
with more of a load personally than their
own barges carry.
To the detriment of
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
the Customs, too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All those ships
that are within territorial waters will be
reached. including our own Canadian ships.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But any ship that was
found within the limit could be taken.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The waters of the
Northumberland Straits between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, which are
much farther apart than six miles, are called
territorial waters, are they not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a recollection that they are, but I would not give
a decided opinion.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: The honourable
leader .has mentioned the Bay of Chaleurs,
which we might say is a store for liquor of
all kinds. A request was made to me to look
into the question, and I find that ever aince
Confederation we have been infested on both
sides of that Bay, in the county of Gaspe,
and more particularly on the north shore, and
ye find that that bay is territorial water all
along from one side to the other.
I wish to be permitted to read to -this
House from the Imperial Statutes of 1851,

30u

SENATE

in which the limits of the Province of New
Brunswick are given, and the northern portion of New Brunswick is right in the middle
of the Bay of Chaleurs. I have also a report
of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, as far back as 1880, on the question of
fisheries, and that Court held that the waters
o-f the Bay of Chaleurs were territorially from
one side to the other, and that therefore we
bave been unduly infested for sixty years
during Confederation with smuggling which
has taken place in that bay.
I believe I can prove to the satisfaction of
this House that the Bay is territorial water,
and I ask that we may be exempted from
that infestation, because I understand that
rum-runners from St. Pierre de Miquelon are
preparing to come with new boats to Bay of
Chaleurs with cargoes that they hope to be
able to dispose of before this Bill comes into
effect.
I shall read from Chapter 63 of 14 and 15
Victoria mnreference to the boundaries of New
Brunswick. In order to make it shorter I
will read simply the portion which is sufficient
for my argument to-day:
-thence along this meridional Line to the 48th
Parallel of Latitude; thence along that Parallel
to the Mistouche River; and thence down the
('entre of the Stream of that River to the
Restigouche, thence down the Centre of the
Stream of the Restigouche to its Mouth in the
Bay of Chaleurs; and thence through the Middle
of that Bay to the Gulf of the Saint Lawrence;
the Islands in the said Rivers Mistouche and
Restigouche to the Mouth of the latter River at
Dalhousie being given to New Brunswick; And
whereas it is expedient that the said Boundary
should be settled in conformity with the said
Award; Now, therefore, be it enacted by the
Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with
the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and Comnmons, in this present
Parliamnent'assembled, and by the Authority of
the sanme, as follows:
1. New Brunswvick shall be bounded as in the
said Award mentioned; and it shall be lawful
for One of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries
of State to appoint such Person or Persons as
ne may think fit to ascertain define, ,nd mark
the Boundary Line between the said Province
of New Brunswick and the said Province of
Canada, according to the Intent of the said
Award.
I think that description makes it perfectly
clear that the boundaries of the Bay of
Chaleurs are from the centre of the bay to
one side, and the south of Quebec province.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada was given in the case of John Mowat
vs. William McFee, and was an appeal from
the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. The
case is reported in Vol. V at page 66.
In
order to be brief I will just read the last
section of the judgment:
Now, as to the issue in fact joined upon this
pl s: there being no new assignment disputing
Hon. Mr. TURGEON.

any of the inatters averred under the quae
sunt eaden, nor any replication avoiding the
conviction and condemnation pleaded, all that
remained to be proved waes the allegation of the
committal of the offence of illegal drifting for
salmon in contravention of The Fisheries Act,
and the plea was proved by the record of the
conviction and condemnation of the property
which was produced. Independently, however,
of the conviction still remaining in force and
unreversed, it is clear that the act of drifting
for sahmon, ewhich vas proved, and indeed
throughout admitted, although that drifting
muay have been more than three miles from
either shore of New Brunswick or of Quebec
abutting on the Bay of Chaleurs, was a drifting in Canadian waters, and was within the
prohibition of The Fisheries Act, and of the
regulations made in virtue thereof, produced in
evidence; for the Imperial Statute. 14 and 15
Vic. c. 63, makes the boundary line between
old Canada and New Brunswick proceed from
the mouth of the Mistouche River, at its confluence with the Restigouche, down the centre
of the strean of the Restigouche to it month
in the Bay of Chaleurs. and thence through the
middle of that Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence;
so that the whole of the Bay is within the present boundaries of the Provinces of Quebec and
New Brunswick. and within the Dominion of
Canada, and the operation of The Fisheries Act.
The Court allowed the Appeal with costs.
I believe it is quite evident from these
quotations that the Bay of Chaleurs is territorial water all through, and that the
Government of Canada since Confederation
has been dormant as to conditions, I therefore call upon the Government, through the
honourable leader of this House, to look into
this matter immediately, without waiting for
the passing of this Bill, and if it is found
that I am right, to see that instructions are
given at once to officials of the Department
of Customs to take command of the whole
Bay of Chaleurs from one side to the other,
and stop those boats from coming before this
Act can be put into full effect. I trust that
my honourable friend the leader of this
House will call the attention of the Government to this matter at once.
ion. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, my honourable friend is only partially in the right. His statements cannot be
gainsaid, but we are now dealing with the
Customs Act, which we are amending to
allow the Customs authorities to extend beyond the three-mile limit.
The reason why we are amending the old
Act is that section 151 of that Act at present
reads as follows:
151. If any vessel is found hovering in British
wators within one league of the coasts or shores
of Canada, etc.
That restriction would preclude the Customs authorities frorn going beyond the three

APRIL 26, 1928
miles out from the coast or shore, and the
Department of Justice felt that we should
amend the Act in order to go farther
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: 1 do flot object
fa the amendment of the Act, but it should
be found out by the Department of Justice
that the Bay of Chaleurs is. to-day territorial
water, and orders should be given, with'out
waiting for the passage of this Bill, to the
officers who are situated in that Bay. That
is what 1 arn most anxious about.
Hon. Mr. BEAUTBIEN: May I ask my
honourable friend if he has a great deal
of confidence in the virtue of the section
providing for the extencion of the arm of
Canada ta its own citizens beyond the threemile limif, as far as vessels are concerned?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes; that is
the opinion of the Department of Justice.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: He holds no misgivings as to the probability of an ever-echanging registry?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would not
like ta give my own personal bond s to
what the Privy Council may decide.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, but 1 arn
referring ta a practical point. I know that, s0
far as jurisdiction is concerned, the value of
this amendment is very questionable; but
does my honourable friend not think there
might be a change of register? Canadian
vessels will be on a footing of inferiority with
foreign veîsels as far as search and seizure
are concerned.
Surely, if any Canadian
wants tp use his boat for the purpose of
rum-running, the first thing he will do, if
under aur own flag. he is subject ta seizure
within twelve miles, will be to seek shelter
under the flag of some other country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then we will
have ta do what our neighbours ta the south
have done-scek agreements with the countries whose flag hovers outside aur jurisdiction, so as ta extend our right to seize up
ta twelve miles.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend knows that there are 55 nations who sit
at the League of Nations. It would be very
easy ta change the regîster of a boat as aften
as required ta get out of the reach of Canada.
For my part, I do not think this is a practical
way of getting around the difficulty; and,
after ail, you place Canadian boats on a footing of inferiority.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, we will
do the best we can, and we will report ta my
honourable frîend and ta Parliament next
year as ta the value of this legislation.

.361

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The question is not
whether you are doing the best you can, but
whether this legisiation is good or bad. Yau
are certainly placing Canadian ships on a
footing of inferiority.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This was the
recommendation of the Commission which investigated this matter.
Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 were agrecd ta.
On section 5-burden of proof:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What is the meaning of this section?
If my honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend will look at the explanatary note
he wvill flnd:
The burden of proof that the proper duties
payable with respect ta any goods have been
paid and that ail requirements of this Acf
with regard ta the entry of any goods have been
complied with and fulfilled shall, in ail cases,

are many men in this lieuse
who are perhaps more competeot than I arn
te give an opinion on that suibject, but if
thiese ex ils could bo removed by legisiation
it would ,surely bo the duty cf Parliameor te
pass such leg islation. If the largo number
of men engaged in the preventivo service, as
well as those rnployed in this illogal traffic,
could ho put into productive work, that of
it.self wouid be an advantage te the country.
To my mmnd this traffic is very injurions,
looked at from any angle, and I believe that
the best cure we cao find is by removing the
temptation of largo inducornents tbat hring

I do net think the legisiatien proposedi would

and received back a prompt answer that he
was sending the steamer Margaret to seize
those vessels. That steamer went down from
the Magdalen Islands, but got on the rocks,
and she was there for some time, and of
course those vessels got clear.
I have always been under the impression
that if the duty on liquor was reduced one
half, the Customs Department would receive
more money than they are doing at present.
When the duty was put on during the war,
all of us in the Maritime Provinces approved
of it, but before the duty was raised we had
no smuggling to any extent.

Hon. Mr. McLEAN: No, there was no

chance of making $9 a gallon on liquor he
goes down to St. Pierre or other places on
the coast, where it is impossible to catch
them on account of the expense of looking
after them, which amounts to as much as
the duty, and he buys from the smugglers.
I read the other day about two vessels that
were caught at Charlottetown for smuggling
continue to do so.
For these reasons, and many others that liquor, and they were fitting out to go to St.
might be mentioned, I think it is the duty of Pierre to return with liquor.
So far as home brew is concerned, the same

provinces can prevent importation if they wish
to do so, and they have a right to place any
restrictions they please on the internal trade.
In my opinion, the high prices of liquor do
not help the provinces in any way to enforce
prohibition, and I think the suggested amendment would be a help rather than a hindrance.
I think that legislation along the lines that I
have indicated would be a considerable advantage to Canada from every point of view.
Prohibition is a good ideal, a splendid thing
on paper, but I remember that when I was
attending school I read about the Legislative
Council or Areopagus of ancient Greece
having employed Solon to codify the laws.
He performed that duty, and came before
the Council of the Areopagus to explain it,
and made his statement: "These are not the
best laws possible; they are not even the best
I could write; but they are the best the
Athenian people are capable of receiving and
obeying." That is supposed to be the very
embodiment of wisdom for all countries and
all times in legislative matters; we must
take conditions as we find them, and must
remember that a large number of people in
Canada consume alcoholic liquors, and will

ELECTRICITY INSPECTION BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 36, an
Act to aniend the Electricity Inspection Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will ask Mr.
Stiver, Director of Electricity and Gas Inspection Services, ta coine to the floor.
On section 1-short title:

Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-unit of supply:
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Before we proceed,
I would like to ask the honourable gentleman
if there is any provision for inspecting the
connection of the current through the wires
with the meter.

Hon. Mr. HAYDON.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As the loss
would be simply on the company, the public
are net interested. The control starts only
at the meter, because it is according to the
meter that the consumer is called upon to pay.
Hou. Mr. McLENNAN: It is according to
the iceter, but in this case two consumîsers
were paying for the same electricity.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under the Act
it is only the meter that is tested.
Section 3 was agreed te.

The gencral
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND:
principle of this Act, which is that electricity
sold by ncasure shall be measured accurately is to be moaintained. In order to do
this the amiendments and alterations proposed
ar necessary, owing to the tremendous developrent in the methods of distribution and
mcea-ireient of clectricity during the past
twety years.
Duiring the administration of the Act the
officers of the Department have obtained an
intimiate knowledge of the requirements of
both sellers and buyers of clectricity, and in
drafting the amendments the interests of all
concerned were very carefully considered.
Before the draft was presented to Parliament it was discussed with the representatives
of the Canadian Electrical Association, the
Hvdro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario
and the National Research Council. As the
public has no organization which could be
called to consultation, it was necessary for
the Department officials to exercise special
care to insure that their interests did not
suffer.
When the Bill was before the Couimons in
Cominittee the represerntatives of the people
decided that six vears was the maximum time
that a meter should b left in service for reinspection, consequently section 8 of the Bill
was amuended by inserting the word "lesser"
before the word " periods."

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bouse to the meter?

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Yes. I know one
case where an electrie company was paid twice
for the same current over a considerable
period of time.
I am bound to say it
promptly made good the overpayment.

From the power

Sections 4 and 5 were agreed te.
On section 6-inspection standards:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to ask
the Minister, are all electrical supply stations
inspected by official inspectors of the Department here, or are such stations simply under
the control of the people who manufacture
the electricity and sell it to the consumers?
Is there an official inspection of all the meters
and things of that kind, wherebv it is ascetained how much should be charged the consumer of electricity?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The inspection
under this Act is limited to the meter. It
covers the sale of electricity all over the
country.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Are all the meters in
use inspected by officials of the Department?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Thev are inspected by the Government officials.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is there only the one
inspection, or are they inspected from time
to time?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Every year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The meter is inspected by the departmental official sufficiently to assure him that it is in order, and
every six years, or oftener, the meter must
be re-tested.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable geintleman froin S't. John (Hon. Mr. Daniel) bas
brought up a point on which I would like
to ask a question. Suppose a meter bas been
installed for, say, three months, and a man
after paying one or two bills suspects that it
is not right. I have not examined the Bill
thoroughly, but I would like to ask, is there
a provision in it whieh would entitle that
man to have an inspection if he wants it?

APRIL 27, 1928
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He can get an inspection, and if the meter proves to be right
he must pay the cost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Section 17
reads:
If at any time the contractor or purchaser
is dissatisfied with the condition or registration
of any of his meters, the inspector shall, on the
request of either party, and upon deposit of the
required fee, proceed as prescribed by regulations made by the minister. Tests made under
such circunstances shall be designated disputed
ineter tests.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is all right.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Section 7 to 20, inclusive, were agreed to.
On Section 21-focs and stamps:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: This Bill does not
state what the fees shall be, but it states that
the Governor in Council shall establish them.
Can the minister give any idea as to what
would be the fees for these inspections?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The

present

schedule of fees is as follows:
Schedule of Fees
For meters verified at regular testing places:Class 1. Ampere hour meters of any
type or capacity for use on circuits
of any voltage, and two wire watthour meters of any capacity, for
use on circuits not exceeding 250

an'd put it in this elevator where another
American vessel will pick it up and take it on

flot do that with our srnart neighbours to
the south; they would soýon "get wise" that
this was going on. But it bas been going on,
and it wiIl continue to go on again this summer. This is another matter that the Coinmittee can inquire into.

Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: May 1 ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Does he
know any way by which that could be prevented?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Absolutely. It is
the easi*est thing in the world. It can he
done by Order in Couneil, in th~e saine way
that these vessels are permitted ito carry
wheat frorn one Cainadian port to another
wit.hout the payment of duty. That is done
in the busy season.
I do niot think that Mr. Wood of Missouri
and his satellites in the M'est have very mueh
love for Canada or the Empire. They have
been "putting it over the Goveroment of thi.3
country like a tent," and we have stood for
it, and apparently are going to continue to
stand for it for no one knows how long.
American ships have been allowed ta corne
here more than once. As honourable gentlemen know, d.uring the latter end of June, and
during July, August, and the beginning af
September, Canadian ships have been tied up
with their crews--for it is very difficult to
get a crew just whenever it is needed-waiting for the crop to grow and to be harvested
and thrashed and carried by the railroads to
Port Arthur or Fort William. After that aýn

That is what is going on, honourable gentlem'en.
You rnay say that when those American

only aggravate the congestion. These Amenican ships carry ore aIl through the summer
from the Mesaba Range to Conneaut, a port
on Lake Erie, from where it is taken by rail
to Pittsburgh. The ore is extracted in very
large quantities ini the Mesaba Range, and
it is brought in carload. to the end of a
dock where a big derrick takes a whole carHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

ship is completely loaded in a few hours.

That is done in fair weather. In the fall,
when the ground is frozen, it is not profitable
to extract the ore, and just about that tirne,
towards the end of the season, which is the
only time the Canadian ships might make a
few dollars, somebody secures the passage of
an Order in Council, and these Amenican
vessels corne over and take the bread and
butter out of the rnouths of our sailors and
their wives and families.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The present laýv
as to the operation of ships on the Great
Lakes, is that noue but a Canadian ship can
carry from one Canadian port to another.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Except an Order
in Council is passed.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: P'recisely.
Th e
situation is occasioned by the American ship
ha.ving to carry to an Arnerican port, and to
reload, so as to evade the law. Now, you
say that by Order in Council the operation
of the law is suspenýded during that peniod to
permit the movement of wheat, in the course
of whieh the American ship carnies the wheat
from where to where? To Amerîcan ports or
Canadian ports?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

A Caniadian port.

Oûherwise there would be no need of an Order

in Council.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I arn asking the
question in order to bring out the point.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 0f course, congestion takes place, because those Arnerican ships
crowd arounýd the elevators and they seem. to
get ahead. A whole fleet succeed in getting
down with a load, because to those American
ships it is found money; their purpose bas
been fulfilled; the ore lias been brought down
fromn the West. So they have this spare time,
and they are willing to accept even starvation
pnices, and thus they can always outbid the

Canadian ship that is trying to make a living,
and has been ticil up while they were busy. If
there was sorne reciprocity in this m-atter, and
if the Canadian ship was allowed to go and
take ore in the Mesaba Range and bring it
down, it would be fairer, but ahl we bring
down is a little ore to Sarnia. Our ships are
idle for weeks and weeks.

cornes eastward through Sault St. Marie is
ore, as everyane knows. and the wheat is only
9 per cent. However, when the ore is
finished, then the wheat cornes in. It would
be a good thing if this matter was arranged sa
that our own Government would not out our

throats by passing an Order in Council te do
something that is actually forbidden by the
law.
Ini order that I rnay not lie mistaken 1
wish to read frcêm another document issued. by
the Legislature of the State of New York,
Document No. 40, these few lines:

The cost of construction of

an ocean-going

vessel is three-fold the cost of the construction
of lake carriers of like displacement, and their
carrying capacity ils about 60 per cent of the
carrying capacity of lake vessels; so that the
ratio of earning per dollar invested in ocean
vessels is only about one-fifth of the earnings
of each dollar invested in lake vessels. This
is exclusive of higher ilisurance on ocean vessels,
and other larger operating expenses, which
would stull further reduce the returns from the
cargoes of ocean vessels while attempting to
compete with lake carriers on the Great Lakes.
That simply means this, that a Isker that
will carry 500,000 bushels will cost just about
31.00 per bushel, whille an ocean steamer wil
cost $5 per bushel for ail that she can carry.
There is the difference, from one to five.
Now as to elevators, the finest elevator in
Canada is at Port Colborne, and it is perhaps
one of the best, -anywhere. It ls a wonderful
elevator. It was built some twenty years ago,
costing only 60 cents a buahel at that turne.
It is a 2,000,000 busheïl elevator. If we wauted.
to duplicate it now, the cost would be nearer
90 cents per bushel. Naturally if big ships
are able to negotiate the Wellanid Canal, and
corne down to Kingston or Prescott, huge
elevators will have to lie placed there, and
the best type of"elevator would lie the one
ut Port Coîborne, which was made by Mr.
Jamieson, who built more elevators tban ail
others put together.
To give you an idea of the perfection of
that elevator ut Port Col;borne, when a canal
boat cornes up from Montreal and docks at
that elevator, she can be filled to her capacîty
cargo, 85,000 bushels, in 34 minutes. Thut is
the turne between the casting off her Uines and
her heading back for Montreal. That ia not
done every day, but during the season eve
or eight vessels are being loaded or uniloaded
at that same elevator in one day. There
is no trimming required. The wheat ls supposed to be spread evenly ini Vhe bottom,
and the trimrning la avoided because the
wheat travels at such a rapid. rate cd epeed,
5,000 feet per minute, se that the trajectery
is almoaet horizontal for 40 feet, and it spreads
the grain at a dead level all over the ship.
This la what permits the loading to be done
in that short space of time.
Such an elevator at Kingston or Prescott
would require at least a capacity of 3,000,000
We would then have our perfect

succeeded in negotiating the Welland Canal.
I hear that a good many of them will not attempt that, and so we will go on as we have
been going except f or those that will unload
in this new elevator. Then we will have from
Kingston or Precott the cheapest equipment
-those river and canal barges; that is, a smal
barge with sý4ittle power and consorts. They
do not require much power, because they move
at the rate of only five milles an hour. Some
one may ask how they can pass through the
locks. WeHl, the tug shoves one in, and týhen
the next one cornes, and the next and the next,
and generally the tug stays bè,hind and takes
these at tihe rate of five miles an hour, and
that is the way this is oarried. on, on the Erie
canal.
That is the cheapest of the cheapest, but
the honourable gentleman from Prescott who
brought up this question (Mon. Mr. Reid)
thinks it could lie done equally cheap, if not
cheaper, by railroad, because the distance from
Preseott to Montreal is only 120 miles, and it
is ail down grade, there is no trouble with the
grade, and so a huge train can corne down.
I might say that Mr. M. J. Butler, when he
was Deputy Minister of Railways and Canais,
suggested this idea as agains.t the Georgian
Bay Canal. He would have the big ships
coming tic Prescott or Kingston, and then
trains to carry. the freight, and those trains
would work twelve months ini the year. The
whole trouble, honourable gentlemen, is
located between Prescott and Montreal. You
neyer know what time one boat will get stuck
somewhere, and tie up the whole traffic. We
had some gentlemen here who were advocating
the waterway systems; some came from
Kansas, and some from the shores of the Mississippi, and I accompanied them. There was
a beam. wind, and when our boat went in the
Canal there ws a boat on the other side, and
we were stuck there the whole day, and everything on the Canal was stopped. You know
very well that when a ship has no headway
she cannot steer any more, and if the wind
is a beam. one she lias to stay there tiill it
abates.
There is another very nice idea. here also;
it is the creation of a zone like there is at

from the international part of the river and
have a width of fromn five to ten miles, and
take in Montreal and right down to the Gulf,
and the same thing on the other side. Now,
I corne to what you may think is strange, but
here it ils, and it is not the raving of an
excited, petty local politician, but I finrl this in
the documents of the State of New York.

SENATE

After I have read a few lines I think the honourable gentlemen will bear me out in saying
that this is the kernel of the whole matter.
This legislative document of the State of New
York, published at the expense of the public,
states:
For a hundred years the two nationsThat is, the United States and Canada-- have been in perfect accord and no thoughtful person would suggest that these cordial
relations should ever be severed, butNotice the "but"-but as a matter of prudence and good statesnanship, if a ship canal were ever to be built
down the St. Lawrence river, and for ninetenths of the distance fron Lake Ontario to
the Gulf of St. Lawrence wholly within Canadian territory and inder the sovereign control
of the Dominion of Canada. if not the British
Empire. then there should be a cession of
territoryMark vou: cession of territory.
-the entire length of the St. Lawrence river,
5 or
10 miles back from
the river,
eonstituîting a zone like the Panama Canal
Zone, secured by treaty with the Republie of
Panama. or like the zone recently established
by allied powers along the Bosphorus extending from tIc Black to the Aegean Sea. Such
zones should le neutral territory or iunder the
joint sovereign control of both nations.
Yes. 120,000,000 against 10,000,000. Well,

it is just like a baseball team with its full
complement, and one man making the other
team. That is what it amounts to.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who is the irresponsible being who wrote that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is the State of
New York. It is published at public expense.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But those are
only the ravings of someone.
Hon. M. CASGRAIN: It goes on:
Some such concessions onght to be inade by
both lmtions-

Yes, but they do not give us any expectations of a concession from Uncle Sam.
-to secure the freedom of the St. Lawrence
from the domination of either nation if it were
to become a highway built and maintained by
both nations. That must be apparent to all,
otherwise it may become a waterway for
military or naval purposes of transcedent
importance in dominating the sovereign control
of the Great Lakes, whose neutrality is now
preserved by international treaty.
Now, that needs no comment. Is net that
enough? Is there a member of this Senate
who would agree te a clause like that in, a
Treaty? I do net believe there is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment has ever suggested it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

But no govern-

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, the honourable gentleman believes that the United States
Government at Washington will make any
kind of a Treaty, but they have no right in
these premises. It is the State of New York
that wants this, net the Government at Washington, which is net a party to the Treaty
at all; and they say, "That is what we want,

or you will get nothing."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is that a statement issued by the State of New York? Is
it a resolution of the legislature at Albany,
or what is it?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is a legislative
document of the State of New York issued
at public expense. I remember having the
pamphlet in which it appeared sema time
ago, and I really could net give you the full
details; but I think honourable gentlemen in
this House know me well enough to know
that I would net fabricate this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do net surmise or suggest anything of the kind, but I
say it may be a speech made by a member of
that body at Albany. We have speeches made
in this Chamber and in the House of Commons that are printed, and that appear as
printed by our printing office.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Everybody knows
that the honourable gentleman is too good a
Canadian te invent that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Se much for the
zone, and we will not comment on it; but

here is another thing that we forget altogether

in this matter, and it is one to which I would
draw the particular attention of the Committee. It is the matter of insurance. Anyone who is not a sailorman, or captain, or
navigator, or mariner, would think that a ship
when in a canal was safe, and that the insurance rates should net go up; but the
Comniitee will prove that rates are almost
prohibitive for large boats in canals.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
That applies te
all marine in every country in the world.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

In canals?

Hon. Mr. BELICOURT: In a harbour you
have to pay more insurance than if a ship is
out, going to any place in the world.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, but supposing
this canal is built, if those large ships enter
the canal their rate would be perhaps double
or treble; the Committee will say exactly the
proportion. One would have thought a ship
was perfectly safe in a canal, and could net
be ship-wrecked, but all sorts of accidents
happen in canals. Never a summer goes by

APRIL 27, 1928
but we hear of a barge being sunk, or sornething else. Last year an American boat went
through the locks, and the water emptied out
into the lower canal; it was a great big pleasure yacht, and they chased it down to the
Gulf, but it made its get-away. The Canadien
pilot had to jump into the river opposite
Quebec.
Another thing is that they talk of making
this canal some 25 feet deep, and the Amenicans ta]k of 27 feet, but even that wîll be
absolutely no good. At Galveston and New
Orleans the freighters have a draught of 35
feet, and the ships are 25,000 tons, and carry
about 825,000 busheis. Now, why 35 feet?
Why is it necessary to be so deep? It is to
give sufficient rigidity to, a ship, which must
have a draught in proportion to its length,
otherwise, in a storm she would break her
back.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: No, it is the breadth,
the beam, is it not?
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: No, the depth.
A ship should be very deep, and when you
take off a foot or two from the standard depth
it costs immensely, because you have to
strengthen the ship, and that raises the price
very much.
Now, as soon as conditions become normal,
the Atlantic ships will be 25,000 ton boats,
and will run like a ferry between the same
two ports. They will have a draught of3
feet, and would eail fromn New York or Newport News or Portland to Liverpool, or from
Quebec to Liverpool, with a 35 foot draught.
Both the American and European terminais
would be equipped juet as our lake ports are,
with proper terminal facilities go that those
boats could be loaded and unloaded et both
ends of their journey, and not have to carry
hundreds of tons of equipment such as derricks,
swing-beams, winches, and dummy-engines
which waste a great deal Vf steam on account
of the long pipes leading from the hoiler to
where the steam engine is working especîally
in cold weather; skippers are obliged to
keep steam up in port. All these appliances
would be installed at the terminais, and their
weight of hundreds and hundreds of tons
would be replaced by good paying cargo. The
8,000 and 10,000-ton freighter oould net cernpete at alI with the 25,000-ton freighter, which
would use only 67 men, whilst the 8,000 or
10,000-ton boat uses 45 men; and the
hundrede of tons of expensive machinery now
carried for nothing froma one side to the other
would be replaced by a paying cargo.
Before this St. Lawrence River Ship Canal
could ever be 'bult, opened te navigation and
used, proper f acilities would have been installed, with stationary electrical plants on the
wharves. as I have said, and loading and un-

373

loading would be done by the quiekest
methods. 1 have already mentioned bhe instance of 85,000 bushels of grain loaded into
a veasel at Port Coiborne in 34 minutes.
I have said very little about the cost of the
power, but may 1Irefer to the statement made
on that subjeet by M;r. R. M. Wilson, who is
Chief Engineer oyfthe Montreai Light, Heat
& Power, and has developed the odars Power.
That je a very suoceseful development; so tee
ie the one at Messina. Mr. Wilson has stated
under oath, in different cases, that this scheme,
in hie opinion, would cost $30 per horsepower. We 'have also thè statement of Colonel
Hugh L. Cooper, who says that the dam at
Cornwall alone would ceet M30,000,000; and
Colonel Cooper should know what he is talking about, for he ie one of the most eminent
engineers in the United States. Hle built, the
famous Keokuk Dam on the Mississipi River,
which je supposed to be a wonder, and which
'people go a long way te see.
I have r.eferred to the dumping of cars et
Mesaba Range. 1 might draw the attention
of any honourable gentleman who takes an
intereet in this sort of thing to the fact that
there are in Montreal Hlarbour two places
where cars are taken within the jaws of a
tremendous piece of machinery and are simply
tossed this way and that, and emptied just as
you would empty a plate. One je et the lower
elevators and the other at the upper elevators.
So it would be very easy to handle all the
freight with these new appliances.
The question of cargo lots is another vexy
important feature. I spoke some time ago
about return cargo. Now, I muet aay that
there je a very remote possibilîty of an ocean
vessel, going te -the Great Lakes, getting a
cargo lot from. one foreign port to one lake
port. And an ocean vessel cannet go distributing here, there and somewhere else; it
muet unload where it makes its terminal. You
have an instance of tha.t in the city of Quebee.
Vessels with considerable freight for Quebec
pass right by that city and go right up te
Montreal and unload there, and that freight
has to be hauled down. by rail te Quebec. It
is difficult to get foreign products in cargo
lots for such ports as Montreel, Portland, Boston, Providence, New York, Philidelphia, Baltimore, Newport News, New Orleans an.d
Galveston. These are ail great distributing
centres. It je especialily difficuit te get cargo
lots for thoee ports from the Continent of
Europe.
Now as to tonnage. This je a rather cemplicated matter, and I would like honourable senatore to give a little attention to
it. There are se many diff erent kinde of
tonnage that the word may be very deceiving.

SENATE

For instance there is the tonnage of a manof-war; that is its displacement, which means
the number of tons of water that it takes to

support the weight of that ship, including
coal in the
the weight of the guns, the
bunkers, the fresh water carried for long
voyages, and everything else on board. When
you see the tonnage of a man-of-war you
say: "My! What huge tonnage!" It is the
weight of the volume of water displaced when
the warship is full.
Then there is what is known as the deadweight tonnage. A vessel that is light will
come next to an elevator: we will say it is
one of the big boats. Five hundred thousand
bushels are poured into it and sink it down
to the Plimsoll mark, or the water line. You
have put in 15,000 tons: that is called the
deadweight tonnage.
But that is not the tonnage that you hear
about. The gross tonnage and the net tonnage are differen't things altogether. They are
not a question of avoirdupois at all. Gross
tonnage is calculated at the rate of 100 cubie
feet of capacity per ton. The cubical content
of the ship is measured by taking the areas
of a number of cross-sections, and the closer
they are, the more accurate is the result.
Measurements are taken of the height from
the keel or bottom of the vessel, generally to
the main deck, in 'tween ships. You multiply
the figures of the length, width and depth by
a certain co-efficient to get the cubical content. Dividing this by 100, you have the
gross tonnage of the vessel. It must be remembered that, as I have said, this tas
nothing to do with the weight, but is simply
the capacity. Then you have to make certain
deductions in order to ascertain the net tonnage; and that is where captains and mariners
anS Lloyds get in their fine work. It is on
the net tonnage that tonnage charges and
harbour dues are paid. From the gross tonnage there might be deducted the space
occupied by the engine, the accommodation
for the crew, the space taken by the bunkers
for coal, the space for the water tank, and
so on and so on.
I have here Lloyd's definition of these
various tonnages, and with the permission
of the House I will place it in Hansard so
that honourable gentlemen may read it.
It is much more exact, but harder to understand, than what I have said:
Ocean Ship
Displacenent.-To the lay mind, displacenient tonnage must convey the most ready and
accurate idea as to the relative sizes of ships,
as it gives their actual weights, or, in other
words. the weights of the volumes
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN

of water

they displace.
It
is the system used in
denoting the tonnage of ail warships. As Sir
William White says in his classie work on
Naval Architecture, it is usual to express the
volume in cubie feet, and for sea water to
take 64 lb. as the veight of a cubie foot; so
that the weight of the ship in tons rnultiplied
by 35 gives the number of eubie feet in the
volume of displacement when the ship floats in
sea water.
If our ships were simple paralelopipedons, the displacement in tons would,
of course, be quickly arrived at, by simply
nultiplying the length in feet on the load line
by the breadth, also in feet, on the load line
by the mean draught in feet, and dividing the
product by 35.
But as the under bodies of
our ships are anything but simple rectangular
formts, two processes are generally made use
of in comnputing a vessel's displacement, as the
calculations in each process are required to
determine the position of the centre of gravity
of displacement, or centre of buoyancy, and
also because the two results are a check on the
One process
correctness of the calculations.
consists in dividing the length of the ship on
the load water-line by a number of equi-distant
vertical sections, computing their several areas
by one of Simpson's rules, and then treating
them as if they were the ordinates of a new
curve, the base of which is the Joad waterline. In the other process the depth of the
vessel below the Joad water-line is divided by
a number of equi-distant longitudinal planes
parallel to the water-line. The areas of these
are conputed by Simspson's rules, and are
treated as if they w'ere the ordinates of a new
curve. the base of which is the vertical distance
betwecn the load water-line and the lowest
longitudinal plane.
Gross Register Tonnage.-Gross register tonnage is reckoned at the rate of 100 cubic ft.
of capacity, and is measured according to the
Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, by taking the
areas of a numnber of transverse sections, varying in number from 4 in ships not exceeding
50 ft. in length to 12 in vessels of over 225
ft. The ar as are then treated as the ordinates
of a new curve of the same length as the vessel,
and the area of the new curve, found by Simpson's first rule. will be the capacity of the vessel
in cubic ft., which. being divided by 100, gives
the gross regicter tonnage. The gross tonnage
consists of the sum of the following items: (a)
The cubical capacity of the vessel below the
tonnage deck; (b) the cubical capacity of each
space between decks above the tonnage deck;
(c) the cubical capacity of the permanent
closed-in spaces on the upper deck available for
ca-rgo or stores or for the berthing or accomodation of the passengers or crew; and (d) the
"excess of hatchways". From this total certain
dedluctions are allowed for passenger shelter,
and crew accomodation for propelling space,
bunkers. etc.
Net Register Tonnage.-This is arrived at
by deducting the varions allowances specified
above from the gross register tonnage. It is
the usual basis for tonnage taxes and port
charges.
Deadweight Tonnage.-This is the weight
expressed in avoirdupois tons of 2,240 Ibs.
required to depress a vessel fron the light
water line (i.e., with only the machinery and
equipment on board) to the load line. It is,
thierefore. the weight in avoirdupois tons of the
cargo, fuel, stores, water, crew, etc., which a
vessel is designed to carry with safety.

APRIL 27, 1928
in connection with the proposed echerne
we have to consider custoixa inspection and
prohibition. Suppose that.Vhe plan advocated
by ýthese engineers were carried out and that
three miles below Prescott the waterway
crossed from Canadien territory into the
Unit-ed States. WhM1e going through the
lock there your baggage would have to be
inspected. There is no guarantee that you
would not get off at that. lock, and, as the
other aide is very dry, you would undoubtedly
be put to a great deal of trouble and would
be searched carefully, just as you aire in a train
going to New York. An inspector rnay take
away something that he finds un your satchel
or under your bed, and that you may be
trying to hide. I know f roïm experiexice. Then
there la the Cuistoms inspection: betWçen the
time of entering and the time cd leaving the
Ujnited States terribory you do not know what
bother the Customs officers rnaY give you.
Ail that for the pleasure of leaving our good
Canadian territory, where there la plenty of
water, mark you, honourable gentlemen, and
where the oanal is at present located and hais
always given satisfaotion.
There ia another point to be borne in xind.
We are ail aware that sea water weighe about
64 pounLda per cubic foot, and fresh water about
62 pounds. Consequently if ocean vessels of
a certain draught came into our fresh water
the draft would be increased. In order to
make this perfectly understandable, let us take
a concrete case. If the draught of a ve~e
in sait water is 31 feet, the draught in fresh
water will be exactly 32 feet.
Let me mention another thing en pasant.
The loas caused by the Chicago diversion is
admitted by everybody to be six inches. It
bas been admitted again, lately, even by the
Suprerne Court of the United States. It took
a long -time to obtain that acknowledgment,
but we have it now. Well, supposing you have
a shiip of 500,000 bushels on a 20 foot draught,
each foot would repreeent 25,000 bushels, and
the six inches would reresent a loas of 12,,500
bushels. If that ship could be kept moving
she couid easily make tweuty tripe in the
season; consequently, ýalthough under practically the sanie expense, for wages, for fuel,
for insurance, etc., she would mie$ 250,000
bushels. It would require nearly three big
canal boats to take that down. She must
leave that quantity behind because of the
Chicago diversion.
We hear a great deal of tslk about treaties.
A treaty is ail a question of confidence. In
the old days, in the city of Quebec, if a
mani borrowing rnoney were asked for an
I.O.IJ. it would be ýconsidered an insuit. Men
were lent money on their honour. I remem-

bei particularly a very worthy ald gentlema.n who would never take notes of that
kind. He was Judge Panet, the grandfather of
ail those Generals Panet that you hear about
in the Militis Department and elsewhere.
Somncone asked him: "Why do you not?" He
said: "J'aime mieux la parole d'uxn homme
honnête que l'écrit d'un coquin."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Translate it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I amn asked to
translate it. "I would sooner take the word
of an 'honest man than the writing of a crook."
So, as to ail thes treaties, 1 would sooner
teie thPe word of the United States and rely
upon their honour tha.n depend upon any
instrument in writing that can be wiggled out

of.

Just one more point and I shall conclude
After all, wemust take care of, an& muet not
interfere with, the St. La«wrence tourist traffle,
which would be very mucli affected by the
proposed river dam.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That. is the fly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, indeed it is.
The Government bas to coneider how the
various interests which cater to the St.
Lawrence tourist trade would be affected by
an agreement with the United States to conetruet dams acrose the St. Lawrence and drown
out the rapids--the moet wonderful chain of
navigable rapide in the world.
Shooting the rapide bas long been advertised as a principal lure to touriste. Not without reason. Men who have stormned the Horn
in sailing ships have gotten a thrill out of a
The

opportunity of sbooting the rapids ie undoubtedly, a big factor in determining the decisioný
of excursionists to visit Montreal and go on
to Qîuebec and the Saguenay.
1 have taken this from the Standard of
Iast Saturday. So there la where the fly la.
Then if there were an interruption in the
navigation, as honourable gentlemen will
realize, the whole system. from Niagara to
the sea, would be wasted. Ninety per cent of
the tourists corne from the West. If there
were any one place in those rapide where it
would be necessary to turn into a canal,
nobody would want to take the trip down
the rapids, for there is no pleasure in navigating a canal, Here is the proof. The sarne
boats that corne down the rapids with 1,000
or 1,20 passengere and that have to go up
by the canal, leave Montreal on the return
trip at noon; at 4 o'clock they have travelled
seven miles and are at Lachine, and at ô
o'clock next morning they are in Prescott.
In eighteen hours they. have gone 121 miles,
and those are fast boats, juet as fast river
boats as can be built fur passenger service.
When going up those boats have hardly any

SENATE
passengers. The fare is very cheap, and, as
1 say, the boats are full on the trip down,
carrying sometimes 1,000, sometimes 1,200
passengeî s. Why are there so few passengers
going up? Because nobody wants to waste
bis time in a canal. bonourable gentlemen
know that it is forbidden by the Government
regulations, and rightly so, to go mure than
five miles an hour in a canal,' because the
wash would destroy the banks. The money
that is left in Canada by those touriets on
the St. Lawrence is an enormous amount.
Honourable gentlemen, these are my closing words. We in Canada are at present in
an independent position. We have our own
system of canais and rivers so fixed and ordained that we can go from Montreal to Port
Arthur or Fort William, a distance of over
1,200 miles, without docking at a foreiga
whar'f or entering a foreign lock. We have an
absolute sovereignty over that long distance.
We are independent and have to consult no
one as to when to opýen or close our canais.
Ever since the birth of Confederation it has
been the policy of ail Govemnments to guard
most jeaiously our complete independence in
our administration of our regimen of navigation. Although Canada had spent, without
anyone's help, a comparatively immense
amount on the construction of its waterways,
allowing others to use them without paying
touls, still at Sault Ste. Marie, where there
are three parallel canaIs on the American
side, our government has built an expensive
canal on the Canadian side. We had a perfedt
rigbt to use the United States canaIs at tbe
Sault, but the policy of Canada is that we
sbould have always an absolutely independent
waterway from the head of ocean navigation
to Port Arthur. That is a wise policy and it
bas served us well. Why should we depart
from it to-day? The bonourable member
from Prescott (Mon. Mr. Reid)- tells us that
three miles below the place of that name it
is the intention to abandon the present location of our waterway and remove it to the
Amnerican side for a distance of twenty-four
miles and build the Power buse, locks, etc.,
and the regulating weir in United States territory. The day this project is executed we
shaîl have lest the sole control of our waterway between Montreal and Port Arthur.
Wby should we be asked to sacrifice our independence? This cannot be donc without

saying that I do not believe one member of
this honourable Ilouse would agree to sacrifice
our present absolute independence from

'We are trustees appointed for life to safeguard the interests of Canada. The representatives of the Canadian people select the advisers of bis Excellency who recominend to
him who shalh sit in the Senate. They have
faith in us, and rigbtly so, because the Senate
bas neyer betrayed its trust. Why, I repeat,
should we move our waterway to the United
States and thus lose our liberty of action?
Remember, we have a saying in French "Qui
a compagnon a maitre"'-"He who has a companion has a mnaster." Migbt we not say a
partnier instead of a companion? If you take
a partner who is much more powerful and.
many times richer than yourself, is there any
doubt as to wbo will rule? Now is the hour
for bonourable members of this bouse to consider whether we should go into tbis partnersbip. To-day we are free men. Where is the
necessity of sacrificing our freedom for genera.tion and generations and perbaps for ever.
The Senate of Canada, with the people of
Canada at its back, is stronger than any
government. Let us unite as one to save our

WATERWAYS TREATY OF 1909
INQUIRY

Hon. J. D. REID -rose in accordance with
the following notice:
1. That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the development of water power on the St.
Lawrence River, and inquire if an application
bas been made to the International Joint Waterways Commission by the Beauharnois Power
Company, to whom a charter was granted by
Quebec Government during its last Session, or
any other person, persons, corporations, or the
United States Government, for the purpose of
getting the authority of the International Joint
Waterways Commission to proceed with the construction of the works as authorized in said
charter?
2. Has the International Joint Waterways
Commission authority or jurisdiction of waters
all in Canadian territory between Cornwall and
the Atlantic Ocean?
3. If not. and application bas been so made,
will the Government take action to prevent said
Commission functioning in waters between Cornwall and Atlantic Ocean?
He said: The remarks which I wish to make
will deal entirely with the Treaty of 1909. I
do not wish to address myself to the project
that has been before this House several times
in regard to the waterways, and the reason
whieh impels me to speak to-night is that important questions are raised by this item
which I found in one of our newspapers:
Quebec to Maintain Counsel in U.S. When St.
Lawrence Power Case is Up
Engineering Advices to Province Intimate Raising Crest of Long Sault Dam May Jeopardize Navigation Below Cornwall and
Hydro Installations Just West of
Montreal-Hearing on June 15
Special ta The Mail and Empire.
Quebec, April 15.-Navigation below Cornwall,
Ont., and Iydro installations just west of Montreal, may, in the opinion of Quebec Government
experts, be jeopardized if the St. Lawrence
Power Company, of Massena, N.Y., is allowed ta
raise the crest of its Long Sault dam. The
Taschereau Cabinet, therefore, bas ordered
Arthur Amos, chief of Hydro Service and member of the Running Streams Commission, and O.
Lefebvre, chief engineer of that commission, to
defend Quebec's interests before the International Joint Waterways Commission at Washington, D.C., on June 15, when the applications
of the United States company will he considered.
The St. Lawrence Power Company, a subsidiary of the Aluminuin Company of America,
bas a dam traversing the section of the River
St. Lawrence between the south side of Long
Sault Island and the U.S. shore. At Massena
it has a power bouse, where St. Lawrence
waters develop 86,000 horsepower.
These
waters pass into the Grasse River and return
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

to the St. Lawrence near Cornwall. The company's application now is that it be allowed
to raise the crest of the dam six feet.
Although the dam and power house are outside of this province, the Quebec Government
bas had the Running Streams Commission study
the project closely, to ascertain in what manner,
if any, Quebec may suffer. It is understood the
engineers fear that raising the dam might retard the opening of St. Lawrence navigation
from time ta time, and might also change water
levels adversely ta affect hydro power plants
at Soulanges and at Lachine, Quebec. In 1923,
it is said, an ice jam formed at Long Sault and
hindered the opening of St. Lawrence navigation. Expert opinion here seems to he that a
raised dam would only aggravate that danger.
It is for these reasons that Quebec is preparing
ta figbt for its rights at Washington.
That despatch, together with the rumour I
have heard that an application has been or is
to be made by the Beauharnois Company,
which got a charter from the province of Quebec at its last session, supply the reason why
I wish to discuss the Treaty to-night. At the
outset let me say that I hope no one will interpret my remarks as objecting to or taking
issue in any way with the action of the Quebec government in granting that charter. They
had an absolute right to do so, and I would
be the last to stand in this House or elsewhere and criticize any action of that Government.
But if this rumour be truc as to the application of this company, I am afraid the granting of it may interfere with the rights of the
province of Quebec, and of Ontario as well;
and as the International Joint Waterways
Commission will meet in a few days, I think
it well to bring the situation, as I believe it
exists, to the attention of honourable gentlemen and the Prime Ministers of Canada and
of these provinces, and their cabinets.
When this Treaty in 1909 passed the House
of Commons and Senate and became law, I
was a member of the House of Commons and
took a very active part in that discussion. Sa
far as I can remember there was no member
of the House of Commons who took issue with
the making of a Treaty with the United
States-I can say that for myself, and I think
I can say it of all other members-but their
interpretation of the Treaty was different from
that of the government that made it.
Let me first say how I believe the making
of this Treaty occurred. In 1907, I think we
had in the House of Commons one of the
greatest fights that we ever had, over what
was known as the St. Lawrence Power Company's Bîl. There was a propaganda throughout Eastern Ontario that this Company was
to furnish light and power between the towns
of Cornwall and Brockville. Everyone in that
locality was delighted at that prospect, for
we al] wanted light and power, and had been

MAY 1, 1928
looking forward Vo some way of getting power.
I, f or one, was in favour of the St. Lawrence
Power Company bringing power up Vo Brookville, as we understood the Bill, but when I
read the Bill was presented Vo Parliament, I
found a clause in it which gave the oompany
power Vo build a dam from, the Canadian shore
Vo, the Un.ited States shore, in addition to
building a transmission line and supplying
power along between Cornwall and Brookville.
Others in the flouse or Committee took
issue with that clause which, gave that company the right to build that dam from Vhe
Canadian Vo the American shore. The company already had a deed in perpetuity noV
only from United States Federal Government,
but also from the New York State Government, and those charters included a right Vo
build a dam or dams in the St. Lawrence so
far as those Governments could give such a
right The Company bad also the rig-ht to
build canals, locks, and everything necessary
on their own side of the river.
When that Bill was brought Vo the attention
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and bis Government
they took the position that that clause should
noV be in it. Though the preamble of the Bull
merely stated that the object was Vo build a
transmission line, it contained that objectionable clause; but, Vhanks Vo Sir Wilfrid Laurier
and bis Government, they took Vhat clause
outV of the Bill, and gave the company only
the transmission line, as asked for, between
Cornwall and Brockville.
As I say, we had a very bard fight in that
Parliament, and it came out at that ime that
instead of the St. Lawrence Power Company
being a corporation, as we believed, that was
owned and controlled by Canadians, it was .a
company which the Alumînum Company had
purchased; therefore it was the Aluminum
Company Èhat wa.s really asking for that charter, and trying in that indirect way Vo geV
absolute control of the St. Lawrence at Vhe
Long Sault.
That action of the Laurier Government, I
think, satisfied the Aluminuin Company that
they could neyer geV those rights unless they
got them from, the Parliament of Qanada. 1
believe they realized that from the discussion
that took place in the flouse of Commons at
thst ime by mnemberE of both sides of the
flouse-for there, was no party feelmng in it
at ail. Thanks Vo the honourable gentleman
who was Minister of Railways and Canals
at that time, the Right Hon. George P.
Graham, that clause was struck out, and they
went home without a charter, such as Vhey
wanted, because the main clause was noV in
it. Realizing that it was impossible Vo get

i

authority to build a dam from the Canadian
to the American side exeept through Parliament, I believe the Aluminum Company
threw up their hands, and then started out
on a new plan.
In connection with this Treaty on the
Waterway, I may say that the first one was
made in 1842, long before Confederation, and
continued till 1870, when a new Trcaty was
made; and from 1870 until 1907, when this
Treaty came into Parliament, there was no
difficulty about the St. Lawrence Waterway,
and no trouble between Canada and the
United States. But immed!iately after, or as
soon as it could -be done, the Aluminum Company got the United States Government to
suggest that the time had arrived when this
Treaty should be revised. There did not
appear to be anything wrong with that suggestion, and accordingly the two goveoenments got together with the idea of reviewing this Treaty, and where it was at fault they
tbought they would have a new Treaty
between the two governments. That is only
a murmise of mine, because no one exoept one
who is in the Goverument at that time would
know whetber or not that was the true reason. At ail events the Treaty wau brought
into Parliament, was agreed to and signed by
both parties, and came up in the flouse of
Commons about 1910 or 1911; 1 have the date
here, and I will perhaps confirm it in a minute
or two.
When the Treaty, wau brought before Parliament, it was subi ected ta very long criticism, before being passed. Honourable gentlemen can read in the Gommons Hansard
of that date the whole discussion that Vook
place, whieh in my judgmtent was almost entirely on three points.
One point was that I took issue with the
jurisdiction that was given to the International Waterways Commission. 1 believe
it was the opinion of more than one member
of the Commons--it is bard for me Vo remember the number-but I know that àVwas
the. opinion and judgment of the best lawyers
in the province of Ontario with wbom I discussed the question. I took iV up with each
lawyer individually, and hie did not know
that I had discussed it wjth others, and I got
the strongest opinions any of the men could
give-and they were pTominent lawyersthat if Vhat Tretaty ever went throngh the
question might arise as Vo the jurisdiction of
that Commission. I mentioned in Parliament that in taking issue I was not expressing «merely m.y own opinion as a layman, but
Vhat of the most prominent lawyers I could
find in the province of Ontario.
Following Vhat up, we had the Hon. C. J.
Doherty, who afterwards became Minister of

ôbu

SENATE

Justice, joining in the criticism, and he took
the same position as I did. Sir Robert Borden, another lawyer, took the same position.
Then we had in the House of Commons at
that time Mr. Lennox, who later became one
of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the
Province of Ontario. He joined in opposing
the Bill unless the Treaty was amended so
that there could be no difficulty in regard
te it. I remember well that when the issue
came farward I raised the question not once,
but many times, and pressed it very hard in
different ways, and I was told by the gentleman who was then in charge of the Bill, the
late Hon. Mr. Pugsley, that thera was no
jurisdiction outside of Parliament. In order
to show that I not only got the assurance
of the Hon. William Pugsley that my interpretation was wrong, but that I also received
the same answer from Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
may I read from Hansard? I am not doubting that Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Hon. Mr.
Pugsley believed at that time that they were
quite right when they expressed the opinion
that they did. I am convinced that their
answer was in accordance with what they
oelieved to be correct.

anyone else the results of the discussion that
took place prior to the making of the Treaty.
But as I say, the Opposition were not satisfied with Mr. Pugsley's interpretation, and accordingly I suggested to him that an amendment should be added to a certain clause. The
proposed amendment did not change the
Treaty at all, but it made it plain that the
Government should be consulted in case any
serious question should arise.
There were
three important questions involved. Mr. J. A.
Currie I think it was, raised the question that
the Treaty being made gave to the United
States Government or a United States citizen
if they had a claim in connection with the
works under this charter, the right to enter
action against a Canadian citizen or company,
or even against the Canadian Government. I
am not a lawyer, and of course cannot interpret a legal question, but it appeared to me
that they were getting special privileges. If a
Canadian has a claim against the Government,
he has to get a fiat from the Government before he can sue them or take any legal proceedings against them; but under this provision it was not necessarv for the United States
Government. or the Aluminum Company, say,
Here is the question that I askea:
to do so. Whether that interpretation is corMr. Reid (Grenville): Will these Commis- rect or not, only lawyers can decide. At all

Wouid no>t the

or of a citizen of Canada against the United

Hon. Mr. REID: I would say iu reply to
the honourable gentleman that that, of course,

the interpretation of the TreatyHon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amn afraid my
honourable friend d-oes nlot apprehend the
purport of my question. Would net the matters which fhe has been discussing be subject
to the Treaty, and they nlot be deait with in

questions would be settied by the Treaty
itself.
Hou. Mr. REID: Exsctiy.
Hou. Mr. BELCOURT: So you would not
have to have recourse to the common law of
the United States, or any statutory iaw.
Hon. M*r. REID. I will try to answer that
a litie later, if the honourable gentleman
does not mind waiting, although, as I say, the
question that I arn arguiug this evening is one
that some able lawyer is better able to discuss than I amn.
Now, -that is the situation as we understood
it aîter the Treaty was passed, and 1 may say
to the honourable gentleman who asked the
question a minute ago, that I will flot attempyt
to deal wiith the matter of jurisdictiou so far
as the courts are concerned. But I arn goiug
to take this position: When that Treaty
passed I do not believe there wae a man on
either side of either of the Houses of Parliament but, believed that the powers of that
Commission were limited. When I say liruited, I mean that the Commission could onfly
go so far, and that the Parliament of Canada
had to dec'ide in matters of great importance.
When that discussion was taking place one of
the members of the House of Gommons was
Mr. Charles Magrath, who afterwards became
a member of the Commission. I do nlot wish
in any way -to refleet on Mr. Magrath; I de
not believe a better appointment was ever
made; lie was an engineer, and an honourable
and upright mnan. No man could find any
fault wi.th him or cast auy reflection upon
him. I do not wish it to, be understood that
I arn casting any reflection upon any member

of that Commission. Whatever they did was
doue, I believe, in accordance with their interpretation of the Treaty. But one wouId
think that after suoh a lengthy discussion in
the House of Commons the Commission,
when appointed, wauld take that discussion
into consideration, and would know the meaning of the Tresty. One would thiuk that that
discussion would have been au indication to
thern of the position they should take in connectiion with matters that came before theru.
Several matters did corne before them. I
could not this evening go into theru ail. I
waut to take only one as an illustration and
to lay it before the House to e if my con.
clusions are those of ho)nourable members
presenit. I have told you what were the
opinions and decisions of members of the
House of Commons and members of the Senste. 'rhat Treaty wss made in 1909. In 1918
su application was made to the United States
Goverumeut by the Aluminuru Company or
one of its subsidiary companies. There are
three or four of thern. One ie -the Long Sault
Developmeut Company, on the Arncan eide
of the river; another la the St. Lawrene'
Power Company, of New York State; and there
are the St. Lawrence Power Company of Cornwall and several others. Suffice it to say that
the Goverunent of 1918, of which I was a
inerber,were iuformed verbally, not from any
officiai communication from the United States,
that the Alurninurn Company had made application for permission to place a dam across
the South Ssult channel. This question ha&
been discussed so often lu this Chamber that
you ail remember, when I spesk of the South
Sault chaunel, that in the Treaty-which I
will not read, because I desire to take no
longer than necessary-there is a clause that
ssys that the channel. on the north side of
Barnhsrt Island sud the ohannel ou the oeouthf
side of Baruhsrt Island shaH not be obstructed
iu any way, but must be kept free sud open
to both parties in perpetui-ty. There eau be
no mistake or misunderstanding about that
clause of the Treaty. The Uuited States Governmeut, without consulting the Goverument
of the Doinion of Canada, and on their own
motion, received the application sud granted
-Permission to the Alurninum Comnpany to
daim the South Sault channel. Then, if I remember rightly-I arn subject teo correction
by anyone who has foilowed Vhs matter upthe cornpany appiied te the International
Waterway? Commission; .or possibly the
United States Governmeut gave them thsa
permission subject to the approval of the International Waterways Commission. These
details are liard to remember iu fuil1, but I desire to put the matter as f airly as I eau.

SENATE

When the company applied to the United
States Government in September, 1917, they
claimed that the matter was very urgent; that
they had to get this dam built before winter,
in order to obtain the benefits of it in the
interval from September, 1917, until the spring
of 1918. They stated that the object was to
develop more power at their plant for the purpose of prod'ucing more munitions for the war
that was then in progress.
The application was heard by the International Waterways Commission. It was then, I
think, that our troubles began. The Dominion
Government, hearing of the application, sent
representatives to the meeting of the International Waterways Commission to oppose, first,
the taking of any action except in accordance
with the rule of the Commission to the effect
that about thirty days' notice must be given
to the other contracting party. The Government of the day were represented by Hon.
Hugh Guthrie, who was Solicitor General, and
Mr. F H. Keefer, M.P., another prominent
barrister. They were sent not at the request
of the United States Government, not on any
notice from the Aluminum Company, nor on
any notice from anyone, but simply on the
understanding that the application was before
the Commission and was to be heard on a certain date. An Order in Council was passed
authorizing these men to go to the meeting,
and also drawing the attention of the United
States Government to the fact that the Dominion Government should be informed and consulted in the matter. I have a copy of the
Order in Council here, but it would take too
long to read it ail.
The effect of the Order in Council was
that the Commission should not go ahead
without further information, without knowing
what the application meant, and so on.
The Commission met in Atlantic City and
took evidence. The United States Government had their solicitor present, and at the
first meeting they urged and insisted that all
rules be suspended and action be taken on the
application at once. Our solicitors, Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Keefer, took issue, pointing out
that we were entitled to thirty days' notice.
The State of New York had a representative
there, and he also took issue. Our solicitors
not only pointed out the requirement of thirty
days' notice, but also objected to any permission at all being given to dam the South
Sault or place any obstruction that completely destroyed navigation, for this was
specially forbidden by the Treaty. After some
discussion the Commission did postpone final
action, and adjourned to meet in the city of
Montreal about three weeks afterwards.
Hon. Mr. REID.

At the meeting in Montreal the United
States again insisted that action be taken at
once. The position that the Dominion Government of that day took was this. They passed
an.Order in Council dated the 2nd of September. It is not a very long one, but there is
attached to it a rather lengthy memorandum.
These documents are very interesting but it
would take me some time to read them. I
will do so if that is desired, but perhaps it
would be better, if honourable gentlemen
would not object, to place them ail in Hansard.
That would save the time of the House.

What is the

The first one is short:
The Committee of the Privy Council have had
before them a Report, dated 31st August, 1918.
from the Right Honourable Sir George E. Foster, Acting Secretary of State for External
Affairs, submitting that there has recently been
before the International Joint Commission an
application of the St. Lawrence River Power
Company, a corporation of the State of New
York, for the approval of a project to construct
certain works in the South Sault Channel of
the St. Lawrence River, an international navigable boundary water; that as a result of this
proceeding a situation has arisen that may
seriously affect Canadian interests; and that
for the reasons set out in the Memorandum
liereto annexed, it is desirable that the whole
matter should be made the subject of direct discussion and settlement with the Government of
the United States.
The Minister, therefore, recommends that representatives of this Government be delegated
and empowered to approach the United States
Government through the appropriate channel
and to enter into negotiations upon the matter
with representatives of that Government upon
the basis of the annexed Memorandum.
You see, when the United States Government or the Aluminum Company ignored entirely the Government of Canada, the Dominion Government took this position: "We will
send representatives to Washington to discuss
this matter direct with the Covernment of the
United States." And may I say for your information that not only this entire Order in
Council, but the one that follows it, and also
the instructions to the Government representatives, show that the Dominion Goveinment were willing to make, with the United
States Government, or with any individual or
corporation,
whatever
arrangements
were
necessary for the winning of the war. Hon.
Arthur Meighen and Hon. Arthur Sifton went
to Washington, and they took our engineers
with them, to explain how Canada would be
affected and to discuss the matter with a view
to endeavouring even if our interests were interfered with, to assist the United States to
make more munitions. The memorandum is,
as I say, a very lengthy one, but perhaps if I
Hon. Mr. REID:

MAY 1, 1928
read a portion you will understand the gist of
it and of the instructions given to our representatives when they went to Washington:
The St. Lawrence River Power Company, a
corporation of the State of New York, has made,
under what is conceived to be the authority of
the Treaty of January 11, 1909, between the
United States and His Majesty the King, an
application to the International Joint Commission for the approval of a project to construct
a submerged weir in the South Sault Channel of
the St. Lawrence River. The South Sault
Channel is an international boundary water,
and the Government of Canada and the United
States having appeared by counsel in the proceeding and the hearing thereon, certain questions have arisen that affect not only the
treaty relations between Canada and the United
States and the powers of the International
Joint Commission, but also the prosecution of
the European War. For the reasons hereinafter indicated, it appears desirable that the
matter should be made immediately the subject of direct consultation and negotiation between the two Governments.
The position as reported by counsel for the
Canadian Government may be here summarized.
In September 1917, the St. Lawrence River
Power Company applied for and secured permission from the Secretary of war of the United
States to undertake certain works in the South
Sault Channel, namely, to dredge a channel
through what is known as Dodge's Shoal, to
construct a moveable ice boom, and to extend
to Long Sault Island, by means of a submerged
weir, the jetty or deflecting dyke already existing in the South Sault Channel. It was stated
that the object in view was, through the effect
of these works on the river ice-formations, to
secure during the winter season an increased
development of hydro-electrie power in the
Company's power plant at Massena, New York,
which is dependent for its operation upon a
diversion of the waters of the St. Lawrence
River. The construction of the submerged
weir, was only permitted by the Secretary of
War subject ta the approval of the International Joint Commission; the other works, however, were approved, without the knowledge of
the Canadian Government and without any reference to the Commission, and have in whole
or in part been proceeded with.
Although the immediate completion of all
these works has been represented as being
highly desirable and even urgently necessary,
almost a year was allowed to elapse before the
St. Lawrence River Power Company took steps
to fulfil the condition imposed by the Secretary
of War in respect of the proposed submerged
weir; it was not until August 9th, 1918, that
the Company's plans and application for approval thereof were filed at the offices of the
International Joint Commission at Washington.
Thereafter, on August 12th, before any notice of
the application has been formally served upon
the Canadian Government, counsel for the
United States Government presented a motion
before the International Joint Commission in
the course of a hearing upon another matter,
praying that the hearing on the application
should proceed at that session notwithstanding
the Commission's rules of procedure, which require notice and publication of the application
and provide for a considerable -period for the
filing of counter statements. In support of his
motion counsel represented on behalf of the

383

United States that the St. Lawrence River
Power Company was supplying the electrical
power essential to its parent corporation, the
Aluminum Company of America, one of the
world's chief producers of aluminum; that the
proposed works would result in an increased
production of aluminum during the coming
winter months estimated at six million pounds;
and that this increased production was urgently
necessary for the purposes of the Government
of the United States and the Allies in the prosecution of the War. Counsel, therefore, urged
that it should be made possible to hold an
immediate hearing on the merits of the application.
Counsel for the Canadian Government, having
had no opportunity to secure instructions, opposed the motion, declaring at the same time
the readiness of his Government to co-operate in
all necessary war measures and urging that
ther
matter was more properly one for direct
consultation between the Governments.
After consideration the International Joint
Commission ordered the suspension of the rules
and fixed the hearing of the application for
August 29th at Montreal.
At the hearing at Montreal counsel for the
United States, for the first time, came forward with a definite request that the application
should be granted forthwith as an urgent war
measure, and presented in support thereof a
letter from the Secretary of War of the United
States. Counsel for Canada submitted, and
argued in support of, a statement presented to
the Commission, copy of which is attached hereto. It was contended that under existing .
treaties the Commission was without power to
grant the approval sought; and the suggestion
was repeated that in any case the proper and
more expeditious procedure was that of direct
negotiations between the two Governments and
the Government of Canada was prepared to
enter upon such negotiations immediately.
The International Joint Commission has taken
the application under advisement until Sept-.
ember 12th, when it is possible, though of
course not certain, that a decision may be
announced. It was urged at the hearing that
unless the proposed work was commenced before
September ]5th there would be a risk that it
could not be finished before the winter.
Having regard both for the necessity of securing the most effective prosecution of the War
and for the great desirability of a wise regulation of the boundary water system between
Canada and the United States, it is believed
that the procedure pursued in this matter is not
calculated to result in a mutually satisfactory
solution. The Government of Canada is strongly convinced that some other and more direct
means of settlement should be sought, and in
this conviction it submits the following considerations and suggestions:
Article VII of the Webster-Ashburton
Treaty of 1842 declares that the Channels of
the River St. Lawrence on both sides of Long
Sault Islands and of Barnhart Island... shall
lie equally free and open to the ships, vessels
and boats of both parties . This declaration,
relating as it does specifically to the South Sault,
Channel, clearly prohibits the construction of
the proposed submerged weir, which admittedly
would prevent all navigation through this Channel. So far as the Treaty of January 11, 1909
goes ta the question, it is equally conclusive
against the project. Article VIII lays down

384

SENATE

an order of precedence to be observed among
the various uses for boundary waters enumerated therein, and declares that "no use shall
be permitted which tends materially to conflict
with or restrain any other use which is given
in preference over it in this order of precedence". In the order of precedence that follows, "uses for navigation" are given preference over "uses for power and for irrigation
purposes". The construction of the proposed
submerged weir is sought purely for power purposes, and as such it must be held to be prohibited by Article VIII, since it would not only
"tend materially to conflict with or restrain ",
but it would wholly prevent, the use of this
channel of the St. Lawrence River for navigation. Clearly, therefore, the International
Joint Commission is without power to approve
the proposed structure, and it is apparent that
the application if pressed as at present must:

for permanent and comprehensive application,
the establishment of a system of principles
under which a great natural highway, common
to the two countries, might be wisely and
deliberately developed for the common benefit.
The circumstances in which the present matter
has been brought forwar.d and heard need only
be recalled to show how little calculated they
are to afford to the Commission the opportunity
for careful and fully informed consideration
that is so essential to the fulfilment of the
Commission's real purpose.
5. If, therefore, the United States Government still considers that the proposed works
ought to be constructed as a war measure, the
Government of Canada is prepared to enter
into immediate discussion upon the matter, and
to that end it would propose the following as

and therefore the South Sault Rapids were

was of no more use from that time on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Might I ask my
honourable friend if, in rendering their decision, the International Commission in any
way referred to the Order in Council?
Hon. Mr. REID: No, they never referred
to it at all. The decision was made on August

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think the honourable gentleman said the case was adjourned

Hon. Mr. REID: Here is the decision:
Whereas, by its application dated July 25,
1918, as subsequently anmended with the permission of the Commission, the St. Lawrence
River Power Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New York,
having its principal oflice at Massena, New
York. applied to this Commission for its approval of the construction and maintenance of
a submerged weir in the St. Lawrence river.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps my honourable friend would read the conclusion and
give us the date?
Hon. Mr. REID (Reading):
Therefore, without at the present time finally
deciding the question whether the Commission
should approve the'construction and permanent
maintenance of the said weir, and without prejudice in any way to its right to decide such
question hereafter, and in view of the pressing
necessity for the immediate increase for war
purposes of the available supply of aluminum,
Hon. Mr. REID.

and at the urgent request of the United States.
It is lereby ordered, as an interim measure,
that the construction of the said weir and its
maintenance until the expiration of the term of
five years from the date hereof, or until the
termination of the present war, is hereby approved upon the following conditions:(1) That at the expiration of said period of
five years, or upon the termination of the present
war, whichever shall last occur, said weir shall
be remuoved by the applicant; reserving, however, to the applicant or any other interested
party the right to apply to the Commission at
least one year before the expiration of the
said period for a further continuance of the
said weir, and on such application the Commission may approve of such continuance on such
terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate and equitable for the protection of the
riglts and interests of the people on either side
of the line in accordance with Article VIII
of the Treaty of 1909.
(2) That the said weir shall be constructed
and mnaintained in accordance with the plans
mentioned and under all the terms and conditions set forth in the paragraphs numbered
from 1 to 11, both inclusive, in the permit therefor granted by the Secretary of War dated
September 10, 1917. so far as same are applicable.
(3) That for the purpose of protecting the
rights, property and interests on either side
of the boundary from any injurious effect resulting fromu the construction and maintenance
cf said weir the Commission will, during the
berm of its approval hierein, retain jurisdiction
ove, the subject matter of said application, and
may make such further order or orders in the
premises as may be necessary.

Provided. that in naking the foregoing order
the Commission shall nbt be deemed to have
considered nor passed upon any question pertaining to the right of the applicant to divert

Hon. Mr. REID: As far as I can see, it was,
I think the two Governments should have
decided that, because it is stated in the Treaty
that neither of the two channels was to be
obstructed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is a very
important phase of the question. May I ask
what is the opinion of the honourable gentleman with regard to the permanence of these
works? I undersiood my honýourable friend
to read from the decision of the Commission
Chat the application to make these works permanent was to be made by the interested
parties at least twelve months before the expiration of the five years.
Hon. Mr. REID: They neyer made that
application then, but when the five years was
'up they did apply to make it permanent, and
the Commission neyer acted on that application, and I have read in the newspapers that
at the last meeting in Washington, within the
past monthl, thr application te make themn per-manent was renevied, and the Commission
refused to act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is exactly
the point. What is the honourable gentleman's opinion as te whethe.r or flot the rigbt
to have these works made permanent is gone
forever?
Hon. Mr. REID: I was just going t0
explain Chat. I think it is. We -have the
evidence cf Mr. Davis--I known him wellthat tbey intended it to be permanent when
they applied for cnly five years. However,
ho Chat as it may, rightly or wrongly, I think
the pioper thirg would have been for the
United State~s Government to meet our Government and arrange the matter instead of
tak-ing the position that the Commission had
entire power.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I hope my honourable fricnd wiIl not think I am too botherseine, but this is a very important feature.
Will my bonourable friend tell us whether, in
bis opinion, the Government of Canada could
not to-day cc.mpei the people to take down
the works?
Hon. Mr. REID: I will answcr that if the
bonourable gcntleman will just wait until I
read what I claîm to be the authority of the
Commission, and what they say. The position
taken by evory man in the House of Commons
was tbat the Commission had not that power.
Iýerhaps I can settie that question at once ini
this way. At a meeting in connection with

issue and said this Commission had power to
settie anything. At that time each of the
Commissioners gave bis opinion of the whole
matter. Mr. Magratb's opinion does net
appear in writing on the file, but everyone
knew wbat il. was. Mr. Mignault gave a long
written opinion whioh I would like to read.
It is a very valuable opinion, and, as I judge
from reading it, was that the Commission had
not the power te permit that obstruction, or to
grant the prayer in the petition for a permanent obstruction in the South Sault river;
but bie did sav that tbey bad a right to deal
witb it as a temporary matter, because of the
war and otber conditions, and that they were
responsible for ifs removal again.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That temporary
period waS determined.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes, but fhey have not
removed it.
Now, a mai rify of one Setties the decision
of the Conmmission se far as the Commission
is concerned. Mr. Powell gave his opinion as
to the pewers o! the Commission. Re, of
course, had the Trea-ty before him, and he
must have read, as Mr. Mignault did, the
discussion that took.place in the House o!
Commons, sel 1 take it that in expressing an
opinion tbey knew just what Sir Wilfrid Laurier and bis government intended when they
made that Treaty and appointed the Commission. I will not read Mr. Pawell's opinion,
for if is very long, but I will read the parts
tbat are pertinent.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:

What is the date of

Hon. Mr. REID: Yes.
I find here at page 18 o! the report of these
proceedings that Mr. Powell says:
Navigation rights exist in ail navigable beundary waters, some by virtue of sovereignty,
semne by virtue cf the Treaty cf 1909, and some
(it is assumed for the purpose cf discussing
question 3) by virtue cf the Ashburton Treaty.
The most searching analysis, however, cf the
language of these provisions or cf their context, would f ail te detect anything from which
an inference might be drawn that the ownership or enigin cf navigation rights qualifies or
limits the power cf the Commission in dealing
with navigation uses.
It isimmaterial b hmor in what way these

rights, irrespective cf origin or ownership, are

must net be exercised arbitrarily, but in accordance with the requirements cf the treaty.

Mir. Mfigeanît:
W7iil yeu give me the reterence. piease?
Mr. Gîsttrie: The reterence is te volutme VI
et the Works et Daniel Webster, published by
Little, Brene & Censpany, et Boston, je 1856,

MAY 1, 1928
at page 282. The first reference is to a letter
written by Lord Ashburton and addressed to
the Henourable Daniel Webster on July 16,
1842. In this letter Lord Ashburton entera a
mild protest or suggestion that under certain
circumistances the passage ot a British vessel
migiht be refused, and he suggests"We want a clause in our presenit treaty to
say that, for a short distance, nainely, from
the upper end of Upper Long Sanit island to
the lower enci of Barnhart's island, the several
channels of the river shall be used in commen
by the boatmen of the two countries."
Mr. Webster replied te that letter in a comFrom hie
munication dated July 27, 1842.
letter I read the tolloiwing, at page 284:the line of division
"Beside agîeceing upen
through whi ch these controverted portions of
the boundary pass, yen have suggested also, as
the proposed settiement proceeds upen the
ground of compromise and equivalents, that
hoats belonging to Rer Majesty's subjects mnay
pass the fails of the Long Sauit, in the St.
Lawrence, on either aide of the Long Sault
islands, and that the passage between the
islands lying at or near the junction of the
river St. Clair wjth the lake of that namne shall
be severaliy free and open te the vessels ot both
couintries."
Mr. Webster's interest was in the river St.
Clair. ht happened that at Detroit the channel
passes thruiugh Canadian waters. He saw that
if the clause were made plain and the treatment for both countries made equal, it might
afterwaruls ha contended that the important
channel at Detroit was wholly in Canadian
waters, and that might not accord equal treatnment to the ships of the United States. He
agreed tliet the matter should be straightened
out, and toward the end of bis letter he says:"Ift being understeod that ail the water
communications and ahl the usual portages,
ilong the line fromt lake Superior to the lake
of the Woods, and also Grand Portage fromn
tho shore ef lake Superior to the Pigeon river,
as now actually used. shail be free and open
te the lise of the subjeets and citizens of both
countrips."
At the close of Lord Ashburton's letter of
July 29, 1842, hie says:"I shoid remark, aise, that the free use of
the navigation of the Long Sauit passage on
the St. Lawrcnce must be extended te below
Barnhart island, for the purpese et clearing
those rapîds."
At pige 352 et the samne volume in the letter
et Mr. Webster it is said:"Se, again there are several channels or
passages ef different degrees of facility and
iisefulness, between several islands in the river
St. Clair, at or near its entry inte the 1lake
et that name. In these three cases, the treaty
provi(les that aIl the several passages and
channels shaîl be free and open te the use et
the citiz"ns and subjects et both parties."
After the draft treaty, which is said in thie
work te be in the handwriting et Mr. Webster,
and it had been transmitted by President Tyler
te Congress, the word "equally." was inserted,
and it is said here in the handwriting of Mr.
Webster, "To make plain and clear that the
usage And rights of those waters specîflcally
mentioned in paragraph 7 et the treaty should
be equally free and equally open te the slips,
vesls, and boats et both parties." Mr. Webster's interest being at Detroit rather than in
the St. Lawrence, and the interest ef Lord
Ashburton, according te bis original letter,

389

being more particularly in regard te the St.
Lawrence river.
That is se plain a declaratien, in se preminent a document as an international treaty,
that I do net sc bow any tribunal or any
court could vary it or set it aside in any way;
but, on the centrary. it muet be bound by it
and give it due effect.
Neîî. it wvas suggested in tbe argument of
iny 1-"a 1.d trienil. Mr-. Koonce, that perlîaps
it liail been superseded.
31!r. Tawney: Before yeu leave that. may I
ask yen a question? Do yen contend that the
word "equally" applies te any right other than
that ot the right et navigation?
MNr.Guthrie: It shahl be "equally tree and
open."
Mr. Powell: To the slips, vessels, and beats?
Mr. Guthrie: Yes; te the ships, vessels and
boats.
That is a limitatien.
Mr. Powell:
For the moment I would
Mr. Gutîrie:
think that navigation would be the only thing
in their minds. At that time the power development weuld hardiy have been presenit in
their minds.
The limitation te navigatien
Mr. Powell:
means exclusion et everything else.
Mr. Guthrie: "Ships, vessels and boats" is
as broad a term applying te navigation as 1
tbink it could well trame. It would inchude
aIl the craft that were known at that time.
It might include the righit
Mr. Mignauît:
te fish in these waters?
No-, I do net tlîink the free
Mr. Guthrie:
ri ts te beats wouid include a fishinig right.
çNow, ithbas been suggested that that treaty
bas in soe way been superseded by the sîîbsaquent treaty undar which the International
Joint Commission bas been establisbed.
There 'was a treaty of
Mr. Mignauit:
Washington in, I think, 1871, which reters te
the right et navigation.
Mr. Outhria: There is seme raference te it.
but net as affecting this portion et the river.
Mr. Powell: What section et the treatv of
1871 applies te the navigation et the St. Lawrence river?
Mr. Koonce: Article' XXVI.
Tbat is navigation bA'iw
Mr. Guthrie:
Cornwall. It dees net affect this matter at
al. Nowv. the Treaty et 1910 was a treaty, as
stated in the preamnle, made batweeiî the
United Statea et Amaerica and the United
Kingdomi et Great Britain,
lise of
" to prevent uispuites regarding the
boundary waters and te settie ail qu-stiens

tbe rights, obligations, or interests et citimer

ef the other, along their cemmen trontier. and
te make provision for the adjustment and
settiement et ail such questions as may liereaiter arise."
Undor that tneaty this Commission, 110(1er

VIII the jurisdictien et this Commission 'mas

international work, I assume. Then it becomes
all the more important to have the South Sault
as a navigable channel.
Mr. Powell: That is an argument addressed
te our discretion.
Mr. Guthrie: Yes; I am only pointing out
the importance of it in this. I am not yielding a point in regard to our rights under the
Treaty. Now, my information is that the
Government has in contemplation the construction of a dam across that north branch. It
will have to be undertaken internationally, I
assume, with the concurrence of the United
States. Probably it may be referred te your
Commission for settlement. But if such a work
is undertaken, and that north channel is closed,
the south channel becomes all the more
important. You may say that the Richelieu
boats are too big to come down it now, but
all that is wanted there is a lock to make
navigation good. My point is, however, that
the water is navigable, and that is se
abundantly proved that I do not think I need
labour the question.
Mr. Powell: There is one thing that bothers
me, and I think the case is stronger in your
favour than you are putting it, because the
two High Contracting Parties in their language
in the Ashburton Treaty have recognized this
very division of the water as navigable and
provided for it.
I would not expect for a
Mr. Guthrie:
moment that I could put it in language as
strong as the Treaty. I am relying on the
Treaty, but I am trying to point out some
of the reasons for the great importance of this
question to the Government of Canada. The
thing that is also important and should not
be lost sigbt of is this: that this very concern,
this Aluminum Company of America, with one
of its suîbsidiary companies, known as the Long
Sault Development Company, tried the very
thing that the Government wanted te do. They
tried to get the right te build a dam across
there, and they did not get the right from
the State of New York, but subsequently that
right was taken away by the State of New
York and the matter got to the courts and te
the Supreme Court of the United'States.
When the Long Sault Development Company
got its charter to construct that dam it was a
vcry broad one. They set out that "the rights
hereby granted shall never be se used as to
impair or obstruct the navigation of the St.
Lawrence river, but, on the contrary, that such
navigation shall be preserved in as good condition as, if net better than, the same is at
present, regard being always had to the amount
of the natural flow of water in said river as
affecting its navigability from time te time."
Now, New York State undertook to grant
lands under the South Sault to this company.
It was held by the United States Supremne
Court that they could net do se, but all
through the Development Company took the
position that it was navigable water and they
Their
were going te actually improve it.
charter certainly forbade them injuring the
and I point out also te the Commisnavigation,
sion that in every permit issued at Washington
the navigation of the river bas been recognized
because the clause bas been put in that they
must net injure navigation. The three permits
contain the clause. The charter of the St.
Lawrenee Power Company, obtained from the
State of New York bas the same clause-they
must net injure navigation. The navigation bas

391

been recognized. As I said before, though, the
matter bas been so clearly proven and demonstrated here that I need not argue the question
any further.
Now, I go back to the Treaty, and, as one
of the commissioners remarked, that is cerThat is the
tainly our strongest ground.
ground that we rely on as a bar to any action
in regard to this applicaby this Commission
tion. I stated in the beginning that in the
opinion of the Government of Canada the
Commission had no j.urisdiction. Whether I
used the word "jurisdiction" correctly or not
may be open to question, but certainly I am
putting it on fair grounds when I say that the
Commission bas no right te do it. We claim
a treaty right. If that Article VII of the
Ashburton Treaty does not give the people of
this country free and open right to those
channels for the ships, vessels, and boats of
this country, if this Commission bas power to
close that channel by this dam, it can close
the Detroit river, it can close the St. Lawrence
river. Where is it going to stop? This Government relies on that treaty. It looks on it
as sacred, and it claims its rights under it.
Treaties must be respected. The whole world
is convulsed with a war now because a nation
in a moment of madness undertook to deny
treaty rights. We want every right that is
given to us under that treaty. For that reason
ve ask this high tribunal not to seek to vary
it. not to deny our right in a single particular,
but to keep open and free that channel
specifically mentioned in Article VII.
Now, as I said yesterday, the Government
of Canada is not disposed to play dog in the
manger in this matter. We have no such desire
and no such wish. I think it would have
perhaps been better if my learned friend, Mr.
Koonce, yesterday had obtained a letter from
the Secretary of War directed to the Government at Ottawa instead of te this Commission,
asking that this matter be taken up. I can
assure him it would have been taken up and
would be yet, and the shortest eut te obtain
the relief in this matter is for the Government of the United States, it being the party
who should institute proceedings, te communicate at the earliest possible moment with the
Government of Canada, in order not only that
the whole of the greater question may be
discussed, but that this particular difficulty
may be discussed with a view of making it
operative and satisfactory for purposes of the
present war, and at the earliest moment of
time. My learned friend suggests that that

Mr. Koonce: Will you please state how that

Mr. Guthrie: Let the Secretary of War send
a telègraphic communication to Sir Robert
Borden, and two men can settle this matter in
an hour. We are dealing with the Government of the United States and not with a

out, that the waters of the South Sault channel
should be considered, and are, in fact, navigable
waters. As Mr. Keefer so well put it, waters
that are susceptible of navigation are navigable
waters, and there is abundant authority for
that statement.
Tliat being the case, New York State bas an
interest in these navigable waters, and a very
great interest. In Article VII of our constitution, the sovereign State of New York lias
conceded to the Federal Government the control
of navigation, but no further.
The State of New York lias retained its
sovereignty in the navigable waters and the
lands underlying these waters in the State of

There will te an opportunity for the diversion
of a greater amouînt of water. This naturally
affects the navigability of this river in which
the State of New York, with all its citizens,
has a very substantial and vital interest.
Therefore, it seemîs to me that we are pcfectly
i iglt and only acting in the discharge of our
duties, in calling your attention to these rights
of the State. We feel that the State and its
officers would be derelict in their duty to the
citizens if ire did not prescnt this feature of
the case to you.
The second point that I wisli to lay before
you is, that it seems to nie that any applicant
coîming before this International Commissiona body of great responsibility and high honour
-- sioti be exceedingly and essentially careful
that in prescnting the application and in
coming before this tribunal it should comle with
its title perfect and with its bauds absolitely
clean. I may refer to the equitable powers and
duties of this Commission. By reference.to the
charter uînder which the State of 'New York
incorporated the original corporation, you vill

I an quoting these words fron that charter.
Now. if in fact this dam Ioes affect the
navigation of the St. Lawrence river. it seems
to me that this applicant is without power to
niae this application.
Thiere is une point, under the first leading,
to whii T omoitted to call your attention, and
that is that in the voiy permit issued by the
Federai Government itself, the language of the
permit is in part as follows:Hon.

Mr. REID.

"It lereby expesses the assent of the Federal
Government, so far as concerns the public right
of navigation."
Not of the navigable waters, not of the
lands unîderlying the navigable waters within
the State of New York, but nerely the rights
of navigation. Our Court of Appeal, in a very
recent case, in ihieh is set aside the Long
Sault charter-212 New York, page 1, and
affirned in 242 United States, page 72:"The state can no more abdicate its trust
over property in wrhich the whole people are
interested, like navigable waters and soils

the use and control of private parties, except
in the instance of parcels mentioned for the
improveient of the navigation and use of the
waters, or when parcels can be disposed of
without impairment of the public interest in

what remains, than it can abdicate its police
powers in the administration of governnent and

Mr. Mignault: Did not the Nev York Court

and the

Supreme Court make a distinction

between an international river and a national
river, apparently holding that the State of New
York could not exert the rights of the state
in an international river. Is that the effect
of the decision?
I do not think it is limited
Mr. McLean:
to an international river. The prin"iple applied
not only to boundary waters but also to navigabl waters entirely vithin the boundary of the
state.

If
What is the principle?
Mr. Mignaîult:
the State of -New York owns the bed of
national and international rivers, why cannot
the State of New York alienate such rights?
It can under certain circumM\Fr. McLean:

the reason. of course. being that the sovereignty
of the state is in the people. The legislature,
mirely being the agent of the people, cannot
violate its trust in ceding away the riglîts of
the people in its sovereignty without an
atiequate return.
Mr. Mignault: That will apply to anv river,
the principle being that it cannot be alienated
for private purposes.

MAY 1, 1928
Mr. Powell: The effect of your argument
being that the State of New York cannot waive
these rights in favour of a private interest.
Mr. McLean:
I consider that this is not
a private interest. If you find that it is a
war measure, and is nêcessary for the prosecution of this war, for the United States and its
Allies, I say that that takes it out of the
question of its being a private interest. But
so that it may not be for a private interest,
I ask this: that in any permission which your
honourable Commission may grant, it should be
strictly limited to the period of the war, and
that it should be stipulated in that permission
that the title to any lands occupied, which now
are in the State of New York, should remain
there, and that the title of any structure
erected on these lands belonging to the State
of New York should remain in the State.
Mr. Mignault: As to the title to the lands,
is it your contention that the applicant company does not own the lands on which the weir
would be built?
Mr. MeLean: These lands are lands of the
State of New York.
Mr. Mignault: And cannot be alienated by
the State of New York for private purposes?
Mr. MeLean: Not without compensation, and
for purposes which the legislature would say
were public purposes.
And even then the
question as to whether it was a public purpose
would probably have to be passed upon by the
court. which would have to determine whether
it was in fact a public purpose or not. It has
been leld in some of our cases that public
lighting plants are a public purpose; streets
are a public use, street railways are a public
use. and I understand that this corporation, in
addition to supplying aluminum, also supplies
water to the community, and that-is a public
use. It may supply eléctrie light, and, in su
far as that feature would go, it would be a
public use.
the application is made here,
as I understand it, simply for the purpose of
manufacturing
an
additional
amount
of
aliuminum.
Mr. Mignault: Assuming that the additional
amount of aluminum is manufactured for the
prosecution of the war, would you say that is
a public purpose?
Mr. McLean: I would.
Mr. Mignault:
Irrespective of the profits
which the applicant company may derive fron
the sale?
Mr. McLean: That might cast some doubt
over the structure after the war, but the
structure would still be there and there would
be the fundamental principle that su long as
it was necessary for the winning of this war
it would be a public use. Of course that is
my personal view.
Mr. Magrath: Does the province of Ontario

Argument of George W. Koonce
Mr. Koonce: Mr. Chairman, I shall occupy
only a few moments of your time. I appreciate the courtesy of counsel for the Canadian
interests in limiting this thing simply to the
question of whether or not the Commission has
jurisdiction. They introduced no evidence and
made no arguments, so far as I could see, that
would causa you to think that these constructions that it is proposed ta put in the river
are in any sense a material injury ta the
interests of Canada or ta any of its inhabitants.
For the purpose, though, of setting the
department right, and it seems that nearly all
of the learned gentlemen have attempted to-

aBut

895

Mr. Keeffer:
What did you say that we
have waived?
Mr. Koonce: Everything but the question of
jurisdiction.
Mr. Keefer: No. The plea in bar is the
first plea we make. We are not waiving
anything.
Mr. Koonce: I suppose you would have gone
into the merits of the thing if you had any
objection to it other than the fact that you
question the jurisdiction of the Commission. I
cannot conceive that the great Government of
Canada that is so closely allied with us in
this contest, assuming good faith on our part,
would interpose any technical objection to this
proposition.
Mr. Keefer: Certainly not.
Mr. Koonce: And, therefore, that your only
doubt is as to the jurisdiction of the Commission to deal with it. That, I assume, to be
your position. Now, just briefly I will state
the action that the department took in this
matter. After the declaration of war, when
we began ta marshall our forces, we organized
what is known as a Council of National
Defence. That Council of National Defence is
a very large body, and it is divided into a
number of committees, among which is a committee known as the Federal Water-power
Committee. That committee deals entirely with
the question of co-ordinating, improving, and
accelerating the development of water-power
for the purpose of manufacturing munitions and
other war materials needed in this conflict.
This application of the Aluminum Company
of America is one of the results of the
formation of that .committee. Aluminum was
one of the things that we needed. They found
that there was likely ta be a shortage. Every
effort was made ta speed up and increase the
production. This power plant at Messena was
known to be in operation. It had been in
operation for twenty years unobjected ta, so
far as iwe know, by anybody on account of
navigation, the use of waters, or anything else.
So far as we know, it has never been objected
ta by anybody in either country. It was found
that the production of aluminum at this place
could be increased in a certain way. To do
that this company, proceeding along the lines
laid down in the federal laws, proposed these
tbree things and made application to the War
Department for the necessary authority. That
was all made in one application. One was
the construction of a submerged weir leading
across the South channel near the entrance ta
the canal for the purpose of deflecting the
water; a second was the dredging of a channel
across what is known as Dodges shoal; and the
third was the construction of an ice-breaker or
wing dam composed of piers and movable
structures between for the purpose of deflecting the ice down the Big Sny and thence down
the main chaunel.
Mr. Tawney: Do I understand you to say
that these three objects were all set forth in the
original application?
Mr. Koonce: Yes; they were all applied for
by the company at once. They were considered
as three things necessary ta effect the object
they bad in view. They desired ta remove the
ice difficulties at that place in order that they
could continue the full winter operation of their
plant. They were applied for at one time.
Mr. Mignault: In one application?
Mr. Koonce: In one application. The company had nothing ta do with the separation of

MAY 1, 1928
tien to the Secretary of State with the recommuendation that it be referred to you, the
Secretary of War distinctly states that "It is
important to the military interests of the
nation that this matter be given immediate
conusideration." That is all that it is necessary
te say in regard tn the fact that you have
not had the usual thirty or sixty days' notice.
I suppose you want me to say something
about the question of jurisdiction which bas
been raised by the Canadian counsel. The
learned counsel for the Dominion Government
lias gone back to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty
of 1842. Article VII of that treaty provides
that the channels in the St. Lawrence river,
on both sides of the Long Sault islands, and
of Barnhart island, shall be equally free and
open to the ships, vessels, and boats of both
parties. While at Atlantic City I made offhand
some remarks about the proper interpretation
of the word "equally".
I did not rely upon
that at all, and I do not think it is necessary
to enter into any serious or extended discussion of the nieaning of the word. But I would
like to call your attention to the fact that
apparently at the time this treaty was made
those who drafted it seemingly considered that
there was no navigation along this part of the
St. Lawrence river. You will see what they
say in Article III, which relates to the St.
John river, which is in Commissioner Powell's
part of the country. It is stated in Article III
that "navigation of the said river shall be free
and open te both parties, and shall in no way
be obstructed by either"; recognizing the fact
that there was a navigation that they were
providing for.
Then refer te the subsequent treaty of
1871. That-treaty, referring te the river St.
Lawrence, from the 45th parallel of north
latitude, where it ceases to form the boundary
between the two countries, states that it "shall
forever remain free and open for the purposes
of commerce".
The same treaty says that the navigation of
the rivers, Yukon, Porcupine and Stikine,
ascending and descending, from, te, and into the
sea, shall forever remain free and open for the
purposes of commerce te the subjects of Her
Britannic Majesty and te the citizens of the
United States.
Article XXVIII of the same treaty states
that the navigation of lake Michigan shall also,
for the term of years mentioned in Article
XXXIII of the treaty, be free and open for
the purposes of commerce te the subjects of
Her Britannie Majesty.
All that is said in this Ashburton Treaty
is that the channels shall be free and open te
the vessels, ships, and boats of both parties,
which indicates te me that they recognized at
that time that there was no useful navigation
in these rivers, and that they were providing
for a possible or potential navigation, fer
instance, something like the Cornwall canal on
the Canadian side and possibly seme similar
canal on the American side; in other words,
those channels should remain free and open for
the ships if those ships materialized and
navigation was te be provided for. They do
net use the word "navigation" or the word
"commerce".
Mr. Mignauit:
They say that these two
channels shal be equally free and open te the
ships, vessels, and boats of both parties.
Mr. Koonce:
But that may be for the
future.

Mr. Mignault: Would net that imply that
it was done for the rights of navigation?
Mr. Koonce: Yes; provided navigation would
be made possible. Uusing the word "navigation"
for commerce in connection with all these
streams where navigation existed, and the
omission of those words in relation te the St.
Lawrence, may have been due te the fact that
they' knew that there was no commerce or
navigation of these streams, but there was a
potential or a possible navigation which bas
been since created by the Cornwall canal.
Mr. Tawney: Article I of the treaty of
January 11. 1909, is still more significant, if
you are"discussing that. It says that the High
Contracting Parties agree that the navigation
of all navigable waters shall forever continue
free and open.
Mr. Koonce: Yes; that is in line with all
the language of all the treaties where they
mean te provide for present navigation.
Mr. Mignault: Mr. Koonce, the evidence here
is nerely that the south channel is navigable.
It bas not been used much for navigation, but
it is navigable.
Mr. Koonce: We will come te that later.
Treaties are nothing more than contracts
between nations making them. At the time
this Webster-AshburtonTreaty was made it was
probably wise te make this provision for free
and open channels. In those days probably the
only access people in the interior had te the
outside world was down the natural rivers.
They could float down the navigable portion
and when they came te impassable rapids take
the boats up, carry them around, and place
them in the river again and proceed te their
destination.
But a contract between nations is always
subject te modification. The Webster-Ashburton
Treaty was in full force and effect until 1909,
when the saine High Contracting Parties made
a new treaty. The Treaty of 1909 essentially
modifies the Webster-Ashburton Treaty. The
reasons for these modifications were due te
disputes and controversies that arose over the
use of boundary waters, and the High Contracting Parties proceeded te formulate a treaty
that was intended te cover boundary waters
and does effectually cover such waters. And,
se far as the use and diversion of boundary
waters are concerned, the Webster-Ashburton
Treaty bas now no binding force. The Treaty
of 1909 was concluded between the High Contracting Parties for the adjustment and settlement of all questions that might hereafter arise
between the United States and the Dominion
of Canada, involving the rights, obligations, or
mterests of either in relation te the other,
along the common frontier. That treaty defines
boundary waters as the waters from main shore
te main shore of the lakes, rivers, and connecting highways along which the international
boundary runs, including the. bays, arms and
inlets thereof. Tbe St. Lawrence river at the
point where these works are being constructed,
covered by this application, is a boundary
stream between the United States and Canada,
under the definition of this treaty, and being
a boundary stream it necessarily comes within
the purview of that treaty.
Mr. Tawney:
Have you considered the
preliminary article in that connection?
Mr. Koonce:
That is what I am quoting
from, but I put it more or less in my own
language.

question that you cannot lîelp coming to the
conclusion tiat this treaty was intended to
supersede all other treaties, so far as boundary
waters are concerned, and so far as questions
connected writh the use and obstruction of
Of course the
boundary waters are concerned.
Webster-Ashburton Treaty remains in force,
except where these waters constitute a common
frontier between the United States and Canada.
Article III provides that in addition to the
uses or obstructions and diversions heretofore
permitted, or here after provided for by special
between the parties bereto, no
agreement
further or other uses, or obstructions, or diversions, whether temporary or permanent, of
boundary waters on either side of the line,
affecting the natural level or flow of boundary
waters on the other side of the line, shall be
made except by authority of the United States
or the Dominion of Canada, within their respective jurisdictions, and with the approval of
a joint commission, to be known as the International Joint Commission. And, Article VIII
confers upon you jurisdiction in all cases
arising under Article III.
Tt is stronger than that.
\r.
Powell:
Mr. Koonce: Article VIII says that the
Joint Commission shall have
"International
jurisdiction over and shall pass upon all cases
involving the use. or obstruction, or diversion
of the w aters w ith respect to which under
Articles III and IV of this treaty the approval
of this Coninission is required."
Mr. Powell:
It not only gives the power to
approve but it confers on us general jurisdiction.
Mr. Koonce: Yes. The only point which our
friends opposite bave made is that this treaty
specially excepts navigable waters. Article I
provides that the Higli Contracting Parties
agree that the navigation of all navigable
waters--and as Mr. Tawney bas pointed out
this article further goes to confirm the view
that the Webster-Ashburton Treaty is superseded in that respect-that the navigation of all
navigable boundary waters shall forever continue free and open for the purposes of
commerce to the inhabitants, and to the ships,
vessels. and boats of both couintries equally.
Note the words "for the purposes of commerce".
The High Contracting Parties, the eminent
Commissioners who made the treaty, were well
awareMr. Powell:
It says the ships, vessels, and
boats.
Mr. Koonce:
It all goes back to the ships,
vessels, and boats for the purpose of commerce.
There are two classes there,
Mr. Powell:
and the preposition "to" connects it with the
word "commerce".
It all goes back to the word
Mr. Koonce:
"conunerce"
and is intended for commerce.
Hon. Mr. REID.

Mr. Mignault: Do you argue that providing
it be for the puîrpose of commerce these
channels could be entirely closed?
Mr. Koonce:
If it be entirely for the purpose of commerce, the treaty says it shall not
be closed,
and you have no jurisdiction.
Possibly neither the north channel nor the
south channel in this case are navigable within
the mîeaning of the words in the treaty.
Mr. Powell:
So far as I am concerned, I
do not agree with that. Even the driving of
logs bas been held in the courts to be navigation.
Mr. Koonce:
If there are no more logs to
drive, there is no more commerce in that line.
Mr. Powell:
Navigation does not necessarily
mean ships.
Mr. Koonce:
Here is the definition: A
stream is navigable within the meaning of this
treaty when it is navigable in fact, and it is
navigable in fact when in its natural condition,
and without the aid of artificial means, it
affords a channel for useful commerce of a
substantial and permanent character, conducted
in the customary modes of trade and travel on
water. A theoretical or potential navigability,
or one that is temporary, precarious, and unprofitable, is not sufficient.
Mr. Powell: What is that definition from?
Mr. Koonce:
It is a composite of the best
definitions I could find. In other words, the
navigability of a stream for the purpose of
.bringing it within the terms of this treaty
depends upon this fact, whether the river in
its natural state is such that it affords a
channel for useful commerce for the passage
and re-passage of boats engaged in transportation of the comiodities of thie country. Under
that definition I state there is no evidence
before you to show, and nothing to indicate,
that the South Sault channel ever was or is
now a channel for any useful commerce.
Nor
is the north channel, and the Canadian Government recognized it years ago when they built
We may recognize the
the Cornwall canal.
fact that there is a potential navigability on
this stream, and may build a canal on the south
side, but until that time comes, until these
obstructions wbich exist in their natural state
have been removed by artificial means, the
river remains as it is in a state of nature, and
it is net a channel for any useful commerce.
I appreciate very much the presence of our
friend representing the State of New York,
and the issue lie lias put before you, but I
ai sorry that I cannot agree with the learned
counsel fron my own country. The learned
coîunsel for the State of New York appeared
before you yesterday and made his statement,
and his appearance here is very desirable. and
be made a very creditable presentation of his
side of the case. But I submnit that so far
as the state of New York is concerned, this
is a donestie question between the State of
New York and the Aluminum Company, and
that wlitever right the State of New York
have to the soil on w hich the construction is
built, is a question that bas to be
to b
adjudicated and settled by the departments of
the Governiment of the United States, either
the executive or the judicial departments, and
that the State of New York bas its remedy
for any invasion of its property rights that may
be occasioned by this structure.
I submit,
therefore. that it is unnecessary for the International Joint Commission to consider whether
the Aluminumw Company of America owns the

MAY 1, 1928
soil in the St. Lawrence river upon which they
propose to build this weir, or whether the State
of New York owns it. If the State of New
York owns it, the State of New York can
prevent them from laying
igesoeo
t
and no decision you coïd reach could confer
on the State of New York any authority they
do not now have under the laws of- the United
States.
On the question of conservation, which bas
been so ably presented by Mc. King, and also
by my friend Mr. Keefer. I have a word to
say. They have spoken about the necessity of
co-ordinating resources, and of the two Govecomenits getting into an agreement and developing the watec-powers as an international
affair. That is a very creditable proposition,
and I have no crîticismn to make of it.
Mr. Tawney: Are you aware of the fact that
the Government of the United States, four
years iago, submitted to the Dominion of Canada a series of questions in the form of a
reference to be submitted to this Commission,
after investigation of ail these questions of
powec and navigation on this watersbed, and
also on the upper end of the lakes, and' that
no action bas yet been taken on it by the Dominion Government?
Mr. Koonce: I did not know that.
Mc. Tawney: In June, 1914, a reference was
made, recommending it.
Mr. Koonce: Mr. Keefer bas repeatedly said:
why don't you bring this matter to the attention of the Dominion Government, without aniy
reference to the International Joint Commission? Mc. Keefer bas not read this tceaty very
cacefully, if lie believes in sncb a thing as
that.
Mr. Powell: That would be only a matter
of courtesy between yon and the Dominion
Govecnment; that bas nothing to do with us.
Mr. Koonce: However desirous we miglit be
to communicate ivith them and to reach an
agreement, we eould not do it. Article III o!
the treaty refers to the uses, obstructions, and
diversions heretofore permitted or hereafter
provided for by special agreement between the
parties hereto. I suppose hie had reference to
that provision wben hie said that we could agree
on this thing. But, if lie will refer to article
XIII, lie will see a definition of special agreement. Article XIII says:"In ail cases wbere special agreements bietween the Higli Contracting Parties hereto are
referred to in the foregoing articles, sncb agreemnents are understood and intended to include
not only direct agreements between the High
Contracting Parties, but also any mutual
arrangement between the United States and the
Dominion o! Canada expressed by concurrent
or reciprocal Iegislation on the part of Congress and the Parliament o! the Dominion. "
In other words, to ceacli an agreement lietween the United States and the Dominion of
Canada on this question, we would bave to
have an Act o! Congress over there, and an
Act of the Parliament of Canada over bere,
and that would take an interminable time.
Mr. Keefer: So far as we are concerned, we
have a celebrated measure called the War
Mensures Act, by whicb, by Order in Council,
we can do almost anytbing in twenty-four
hours.
Mc. Koonce: We bave no sncb legisiation in
our country, and it would take a very long
timie to bring it about.

399

Mr. Keefer: We could do it in twenty-!ouc
houcs.
Mc. Koonce: It would be impossible foc us
to arrange a matter o! that kind by legislation, and the only other alternative would
be a new treaty. Conservation of natural cesources is a bigb-sounding phrase, and an attractive phrase, and it is a very good doctrine,
but I subniit that in this time o! stress and
wac, "conservation" is not the proper word"preservation" i8 the thing that interests us
n0w; self-preservation, national preservation,
preservation of our ideals, preservation o! freedom, preservation o! Anglo-Saxon civilization.
These are the tbings that are confronting us.
The preservation of these things is the tbing
that is engaging ouc attention, and everytbing
cîse sbould be ]ost siglt of for the time beng,
until we accomplish t b e great purpose we bave
in view. Until tbat time, conservation and
the discussion of aIl tbese economie theories
are of o more consequence than tbe rattie
o! a peblile at the bottom of a pauper's grave.]
New let me state what I understand the
situation is. You have to read ail the evidence
that was given before the Commission in order
to appreciate it. Summing it aIl up, the conclusion I bave arrived at, according to the
evidence, is this.
Mr. Magrath does nlot
write any opinion, but hie did express an
opinion wben lie was in Parliament. I think
ail bis actions in connection witb this mattec
sbow that lie takes the position that the
powers of the Commission are not sucli as
would authorize tbem to place a dam permanently in the South Sauît Channel. Mr. Migoauît did give a written opinion, and from
reading it I come to the conclusion that bis
opinion is the same as that of Mc. Magcatb.
With regard to Mr. PoweIl's opinion, wbieb lie
gives, I suppose, as lawyer, and as lie holds it.
I conclude from the question hie asked and the

statements lie made, as shown in the evidence,
that in bis opinion no other position could be
taken tban that the Dominion Parliament and
tbe Dominion Government alienated to this
Commission ail their jurisdiction and powersQ
in connection with the boundaries in the St.
Lawrence River hetween Canada and the
United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman allow me to put him a
question?
Hon. Mr. REID: Certainly.

Ilon. Mr. REID: The answer was given by
the Amierican represontative, Mr. Koonce, I
thn.I have the argument and can give
you the points in connection with it. This is
his argumentHon. Mr. DANDUI-AND: I do flot as],
for the argument. My bonourable friend bas
cited oniy the Canadian Commissioners, but
sureiy the Amierican Commissioners exprcssed
an opinion, and the point must have been
discussed by the rcprescntatives of the Amenican Govermont.

Beaubarnois Powcr Comnpany or anybody else
would have the rigbt to develop power. Tbey
bave no say wbatever in sueb matters; but
there is no doubt in rny mind that the Comnmission wouid give [bat Beaubarnois Company
aH1the power that tbey had to proceed with
that work and carry it on, just as tbe Quebec
Governrnent did. Therefore I tbhink that the
Governiment of tbis Dominion and of tbe
provinces of Qiiebee and Ontario .sbould join
and take issue with that Commission as to
ti)eir having any right to deal with that
que.sti on.

Hon. Mr. REID: This short note may explain it. Mr. Kooiice in bis argument-

Hon. Mr- BELCOURT:
mission lias none at ail.

Hon. Mn. BIICOURT: No, but wbat do
the Comnmissioners say?

Hon. Mr. REID: Weli, if you would read
the evidence that ivas taken-

Hon. Mn. REID: I want to give you first
the argument for the United States.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It bas no power
at ail of that kindý; it bas only power to
investigate.
It bas no power to make a bargain.

Hon. Mr. BITLCOURT- 0f course, ha was
bound to argue that; ho could flot argue any[bing cise.
lion. Mr. REID: He angued, of course, that
the Commission had entine jurisdiction.
lon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes; no doubt.
Hon. Mr. RiEID: You see, it takes a long
Limie to refer to it 00W. I have given you the
îxritten opinion of Mr. Mignault. Mr. Magratb
lias not made nv statement. The position
that 'Mr. Powell takes witb regard to the
attituide of Mi. Guthrje and to ail the evidence
that ivas givcn, is this, as I interpret it. Tbe
Dominion Pari int
and the Dominion Goveininent have aliinated ail their rights and
pon'ers to the Comnmission. The Commission
alone, and net the Government or Parliament
of Canada, have the power to decide wbetber
or not the United States Government, or
through tbem sonie other autbority, shall ho
given the right to dam the St. Lawrence river
at that point. The Commission alone have
power to decide that question.
Hon. Mr, DANDURAND:
vo te.

By a rnajority

Hon. Mr. REID: That is, by a rnajority
vote, certainiy. Therefore, so far as any decision of that Commission is concerned, a
majority of one, on eitber side, binds botb
Governments. Tbat is, as plainiy as 1 can
put it, the position that be takes.
Now, what 1 fear, and wbat I ask the
Goveroment to take action upon, is this.
Wben this Treaty was passed tbrough Parliament in 1909, Sir Wilfrid Laurier answered
Hon. Mr. Haggart that this International Coinmission had no power east of Cornwall. Tbey
wouid -bave no rigbt to decide wbetber the
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

And

tbe

Comn-

Hon. Mr. REID: You and I agree, but that
is not the position taken by one of the Coinmissioners.
If they are askced to take this
Inatter up they nmust inîet, and if oîîe of tbe
Commission agrees witb the view tbat tbey
have the right, they wiil do it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
not the right.

But tbey bave

Hon. Mr. REID: That is tbe point I arn
taking; 1 say they have not, but as I read
these arguments, tbey say they have sucb
righit, and that tbey cou'ld daim other parts
oî the river entirely across. I ask the Government to watch closely that the Commission
sbouid notify tbe Governement at once if
ever a suggestion or proposition is rnade to
thcým. This is a matter that affects not only
the province of Québec, but, also Ontario, and
iit is adnîitted that the Beauharnois Power
Comnpany cornes under the juridiction of this
Commission, tben tbe Cornmission would have
te be consulted if a dam was piaced across the
river below Montreal to raise the water barbour. If we ever admit that they 'bave a
rigbt to go into Cornwall I dlaim that we
arc in trouble, so far as the rest of the St.

Lawrence- is concernied, between Cornwall and
the Atlantic. The argumrent tbey put up in
support of that position is that Canada has
agreed that they shall bave tbe rigbt te deal

with navigation through te the Atlantic. If
tbey bave that right, of course they mnust be
consulted on any interference with navigation.
I arn making these remarks because I consider that now is the time for the Government to take this matter up and settie it
with tbe Commission once and for ail. If the

MAY 1, 1928
Commission, or any meniber of it, takoe the
position that this is within Vheir jurisdiiction,
I say that soine action should be taken; or if
the United States take the same position, and
admit such right, thezi I zay it is up to, the
Government to withdraw the power of that
Commission, or remove them, and flot appoint
any othera until they get that matter settled
definitely and beyond, doubt with the United
States Government.
According to thbe news item I read at the
outset of my remarks, the Commission ineets
on June 15th, and tume passes very quickly.
1 feel that this matter is of great importance,
flot only so far as the Beauharnois Power
Company application is concerned, but for ail
future time in reference to the damiming of
the St. Lawrence river.
Lt may be said that the Commission do not
intend to deal with this matter even if the
application has been made but I will try to
explain the position as I understand it, and I
feel that immediate action shou]d be taken
flot only to find out just where we stand with
relation to the Commission, but also what position is taken by the United States. I have
raised the question so that there can be no .possible doubt m~to what authority this Commission or any that may succeed it, will have
in any matter that comes before them. I
think my position is a fair and reasonable one.
T17he Government of Canada, because they believed it was right and in accordance with the
discussion they had in the United States,
promised the people of Canada that the Coinmission had no power to go east of Comnwall,
or to authorize the damming of the St. Lawrence. With that decision the Commission,
or at least ore member of it, takes issue. As
I read in the evidence to-night, the position
Mr. Powell takes is that this is a Commission
between England and the United States, and
that Canada has nothing to do with the carrying of it out, because they have abdicated their
powers to this Commission. Well, of course,
if we have niothing to do with it we should
neyer have passed the Treaty through this
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend allow nie to put another question
to him? Ras he seen a.nywhere that the Government of the United States has claimied that
they could go to the International Commission and make with it a bargain as té work
which is conteinplated?
Hon. Mr. REID: I think I can show the
evidence where Mr. Koonce was making that
argument. He said-

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that was in
regard to another matter altogether. Has the
United States made a pretence anywhere at
any tume that they could go to the International Commission and make a bargain with
them in regard to the proposed deepening of
the St. Lawrence, rather than make it with
the Government of Canada?
Hon. Mr. REID: As I read the evidence
here 1 came to the conclusion that the United
States Government through its solicitor, Mr.
Koonce, takes the position that the international Joint Commission has the right to
decide any question, even the damming of the
St. Lawrence; that all our powers have been
handed -over to this Commission.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That cannot npply
to the present proposition.
Hon. Mr. REID: At alI events, I draw the
conclusion from Mr. Powell's argument that
that is reuily how he interprets their powers.
A majority of one can decide these matters,
and I tjiink this question is of such importance
in many other ways that I cannot go into tonight, that I ask the leader of this Government to take up with his colleagues and also
the Quebec and Ontario Governments, the
matter of keeping tab on what is going on,
and if there is any action, or any meeting, or
any sugges-tion by the United States Governnment, we should take sanie action to find out
what thie members of the Commission are
going to decide, and they should be removed
or changed if they place any other interpretation than what, Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his
Goverament gave when this Treaty was being
put through. I hope the Premier of the Pro-vince of Quebec will also take action, on accotînt of he rumours, and the n:ewspaper item
which I read.
I thank you, honourable gentlemen, and
apologize for occupying so much tinie.

tion without the intýerference of the Imperial
Parliament or to modify those two Treaties in
agreement with the United States.
From the discussion this evening it would
seema strange to me if powers could be conferred on any commission appointed by this
Parliament to deal with a similar Commission
wppoint.ed by the Unîtýed States, and how
powers could be given to those men in the
way of obstructing navigation, contrary to
the provisions of those two Treaties.
Right Hon Mr. GRAHAM:
But these
Commissioners are appointed by the British
Government, not by the Canadian Government.
Hon. Mr. REID: On the iecommendation
of the Canadian Government.
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: The Treaty of
1871 included members representing the
United States, but in case of an Impetrial, Treaty
dealing with such matters, would not any
modifications t.o be made, or relaxation of
the authority and power of this country held
under such Treaty with the United States,
require the consent of the Imperial Government? That is what I want to know.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, 1 do flot want more than two minutes in
order to make this thing- plain. If one will only
remember that this International Waterways
Commission was created and set in motion
merely for the purpose of settling disputes
which may arise between Canada and the
United States in regard to their contiguous or
boiundary waters, then one need not bother
so much with ail the questions to which my
honourable friend bas referred.
The Commission bas no jurisdiction to
initiate any scheme or any new works, or to
prevent, any new works, or that kind of thing.
Their jurisdiction is merely as international
arbitrators, to settle disputes which are brought
to it by one party or the other, that is, by
the United States or Canada. They have to
interpret the statutes, the Ashburton Treaty
and the Treaty of 1909, and they have no
right under the Treaty to determine any
charge or any complaint that rights under
those Treaties have been invaded or infringed
by either one or the other. That is ail they
can do. That is ail they are there for. They
have. no power or jurisdiction of any kind ta
initiate any bargain, or provide for any new
work to be erected. They can only pronounce
on works that have been erected, and say
whether they are in confliet with either one of
those two sets of authorities. That is the
limit of their jurisdiction.
Hon.

Mfr. McOORMICE.

Hon. Mr. REID: But suppose the Aluminumn Company made application to dam the
St. Lawrence out as far as the boundary line,
the Commission could grant a right to the
Iternational line. Supposing the Aluminum
Company were to build a dam on the Canadian side-they own ail the property for a
mile or two on each side of where this dam
would go-and suppose they were to build
right to the water's edge, which would probably be a hundred feet or so froma there to,
the International lime; and supposing thay got
the right of the Commission to build not only
to the International waterivay but 9,1so across
to Canada?
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: If the Commission had not authority to give it they could
ot get it.
Hon. Mr. REID:
As I understand, the
Dominion Government has the decision of
one member of the Commission, who is an
able lawyer, that ail their powers have been
handed over to this Commission.
lion. Mr. BELCOURT: But that is nonsense.
Hon. Mr. REID: It is not nonsense, for
they have already acted on that.
Hon. Mr. GRAHIAM: Would not the plans
have to be handed over to the Dominion
Goveroment before the Commission could
interfere with navigation?
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes. but the Company
are nýot interfering with navigation if they
build their own dam near to the water's edge
on the Canadian siýde.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The words constituting the Commission, their rights and
their powers, are in these few uines:
To pýrevent disputes regarding the use of
boundary waters, and to settle ail questions
which. are now pending betweýen the United
States and the Dominion of Canada inv'olving
the right application or interest of either in
relation to týhe othe.r, or to the inhabitants- of
the other, along the-ir own, frontier, and to
make provisions for the adjustmnent and settlement of ail such questions as may hereafter
arise.

That is not giving jurisdiction to make a
contract or bargain of any kind for future
works. That bas nothing ta do with it.
Hon. Mr. REID: 0f course, that is the
position the honourable gentleman takes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I arn surprised that any one does not see it.
Hon. Mr. REID: But they have already
taken action in opposition ta what the Govern-

403

MAY 1, 1928
ment said they could do. They have agreed
to an obstruètion in -the South Sault Rapids,
and nearly diestroyed that channel. The
obstruction bas nlot been removed, and they
wili flot remove it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that was done
with the consent of the Governanent.
Hon. Mr. REID: No, the Govérnment
opposed it.
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: It fully complied
with the Order in Counoil.
Hon. Mr. REID: No, the Govern.ment
sent Mr. Gutbirie and Mr. Sifton to argue
against it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It wae temporary
work, only to last for a certain turne.
Bon. Mr. REID: That dues nlot make any
difference; they opposed that, because if that
channel was to be interfered with it would
involve a question between the two contracting parties. That is the position the
Government takes.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: But they gave
permission under certain terme.
Hon. Mr. REID: They gave no permission
at ail.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I understand the
Governrnent neyer agreed te it, but the majority of tihe Commission agreed, te it.
The Order i
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Hon. Mr. REID: No, it is not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I rend it before;
then on the l4th of the saine month the Commission decided., under the provisions and
stipulations of the Order i Couneil, to grant
permission in accordance therewith.
Bon. Mr. CALDER: My honourable friend
says the Commission wae appointed te settled
disputes. Once a dispute arises with reference
to the use of water, or an obstruction of the
waters, or the navigation of the water, then
tihe Coimmission has power.
Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Weil, it is very easy
to arrange for a dispute. Ail that has te be
done is to have an application from one party
for a certain thing to be done, and imxnediately there is a dispute.
56109--26à

Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend wiIl understand that a dispute will not
arise untîl some overt action is talcen contrary te the Treaty. It is not so easy to
arrange for a dispute as my honourable friend
pretends. It is for something done, not something to be done.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is exactly where
the Commission has stepped in and acted
before. Take the cases cited by the honourable gentleman frcm Grenville (Hon. Mr.
Reid). It is because they wanted something
to be done, in which the Commission actcd,
that there was a dispute; and there is no
reason why the Commission should net act
ini the same way in the future.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of rny honourable friend te the
narrow limits of his inquiry. Bis speech this
evening seems to go much beyond the two
questions put. I arn afraid that bis inquiry

if they answer the inquiry I must be satisfied.
THE LATE HON. SENATOR KING
TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY

Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: Bonourable gentlemen, by the psssing of the Hon. Mr. King,
of New Brunswick, the Senate bas bast one of
its oldest members. He stood second in order
of appointment, and I think ini age, of the
present members of the Senate. He was born
in 1836, and later engaged in the lurnbering
business, and devcloped it to a considerable
degree. Be was one of the lumber princes of
lis Province. More than half a century ago
he founded the King Lumber Company at
Chipman, New Brunswick, where iL is still
being carried on by the grandsons of the
deceased.
The late Senator King was a public spirited
man and soon became the representative of
the people i bis own county. As far back
as 1877 he was warden of Queens County, and
he sat in the Bouse of Commons from 1878 to
1896, with the exception of one year when he
was refused a seat by the action of the returning officer although he had received a majority
of the votes of the electors. The late Mr.
King was fifty years in Parliament, and during

Mr. King brought to his duties in the other
House, as he did ie this Chamber, a long experience of business affairs. For many years
be wvas an active member of the Committees
of tis House, but latterly bis stiength dirninislied. and during the past ten ' ears bis voice
was rareiy heard in this Chamber. I weil
remember the time when he would discuss ail

or to Canada generally.
We have lost a valuable and esteemed member of tbis Chambor, and te bis family we

Canadian National Railways, and (b) for which

statement 1 have obtained:

SENATE
present it is worth about $60.00 an ounce, but
it fluctuates and bas been as high as $180.00 an
ounce.
White gold of recent years has been used
more extensively, and sometimes contains a
percentage of platinum. It is impossible to tell
white gold from platinum without being assayed,
which of course is quite impossible for the
ordinary purchaser when shown articles of this
material. In course of time white gold will
tarnish. wbereas the platinum will not, but in
new articles shown across the counter when the
white gold is polished, in appearance it is
identical with platinum.
For this reason the Act states that when an
article is sold as platinum its metallic contents
must be at least 95 per cent composed of
platinum either alone or in conjunction with
iridiiui.

White goTd is composed of traces of silver
and iron, some nickle and copper in about
equal quantities, and zinc. It is sometimes
erroneously referred to by the trade as white
platinum. It is sold as is ordinary gold, by
the karat. It is a little more valuable than
the ordinary gold owing to the fact that it is
harder to work up. but it is by no means as
valuable as platinum, as it sells for approximately $20.00 an ounce.
Iridum is the most infusible and one of the
heaviest of metals, found associated with the
ore of platinum.
It is so called from the
iridescence of some of its solutions.
I move that this Order be discharged, because my honourable friend to my left (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) has asked me about an amendment I had suggested, that the Act should
only come into forceHon. Mr. BELOOURT: On proclamation.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND: I thought I had
moved the amendment, but as my honourable
friend does not see it, I will move that the
third reading be postponed until to-morrow
so that the amendment may be put in.
Hon. Mir. BELCOURT: I hope my honour'able friend will not forget, because I shall not
be here to-morrow at the hour when this Bill
is called.
The motion was agreed to, and the Order
was discharged.
DOMINION
CONSIDERATION

LANDS

BILL

IN COMMITTEE POSTPONED

On thre Order:
The House again in Committee of the Whole
on Bill 199. entitled, an Act to amend the
Dominion Lands Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen will recall that on the second reading of the Bill, and when we were in Committee some days ago, the question was
asked as to the consent of the various provinces to the present legislation. This inquiry
arose from the fact that the natural resources
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of the provinces now held in trust, or held
by the Dominion Government, may sooner
or later be returned to the various provinces;
so the question was a natural one.
I stated that the legislation had been submitted to the members of Parliament from
Saskatchewan, or a large number of them,
and that the result was the Bill before us.
Now, I have asked the Department and the
Minister for an answer to the inquiry which
has come across the floor and I have this
correspondence between the Prime Minister
of Saskatchewan and the Minister of the
Interior:
Ottawa, 17th February, 1928.
Honourable James G. Gardiner,
Premier, Regina, Saskatchewan.
There seems to be pretty general feeling
among Western Menbers that provision should
be made at this Session for granting of fresh
homestead entries with the reservation that
this privilege should not enable the conversion
of pre-emption or purchased homestead entries
into second fresh homestead entries. Understand you are not unfavourable to this. Please
confirim.
Charles Stewart.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is that a letter,
or a telegram?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That was a
night letter, and an answer by mail came from
the Prime Minister, dated Regina, February
18:
Your proposal in wire February Seventeenth
that second homestead entries be allowed with
the reservation that privilege should not enable the conversion of pre-emption for purchased homestead entries into second fresh
honmestead entries is satisfactory.
James G. Gardiner.
The same letter of inquiry was sent to
Hon. Mr. Bracken, Premier of Manitoba, and
his answer is dated December 22, 1927:
Dear Mr. Stewart:
Replying to your favour of the 16th instant,
re second honesteads, I beg to advise that the
Covernnent of Manitoba will offer no objection
to the aiendoment you propose to the Dominion
Lands Act.
Yours very truly,
(Sgd)
John Bracken.
As to the Prime Minister of Alberta, I have
this letter from the Hon. Mr. Stewart; dated
April 27:
The attacbed copies of my exchange of correspondence with the provincial premiers on the
subject of proposed legislation enabling the
granting of second free homestead entries, speak
for themuselves.
Premier Brownlee was here in January and
I explained the proposed legislation to him in
ny office. He bas raised no objection by letter,
nor lias he said anything further on the subjeet during more recent interviews here. I have

MAY 2, 1M2
taken it for granted that he is quite satisfied.
The bill was in the House of Commons durinq
Premier Brownlee's recent visit, and I feet
quite sure had he founid anything in it te criticise he weuld net have f ailed te tel me.
Yours faithfully,
Chas. Stewart.
Hon. Mr. Pattullo, and
I bad a call from,
I drew bis attention te the matter cf the
Lands Act, and te the discuission which teck
place in this Chamber, and I received from
hima the following telegrain. He seems te be
favourable te the legielation:

T. D. Pattullo.
Se we have these statemçnts, which fairy
cover the inquiry made te, me the last >time
we were -in Comnxitètee on th" Bill. I arn
suwe, aise, that the Minister cf the Interior
is the officiai representative cf the province
cf Alberta bere, and lie bas a fair knowledge
cf the sentiment cf that province. The statement he makes, that the xuembers from the
House ef Oommons axe geuerally satisfied, la
estsiblisbed by the faut that the legisiation
passed unanimoualy. There was some criticism
bearing on one clause which allowed some
discretion te the Minister of the ntrior,
but that clause was eliminated; se tihat we
have this Bill comning from the Cemmons,
where quite a large representation f rom those
western provinces sit, and it bas their sanctien. I doubt whetber a Bill presents itself
that is surrounded with greater safeguards
tban this Bil.
I asked on the second readîng, or in Coinmittee, for the opinion of the varieus Senators fromn the Weet. I have beard a few
statements, but I belive the cse- is sufficiently made for me te move this B-il into
committee.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
gentlemen, I would like te speeak on this Bill
before that motion is put. I tbink a select
committee of this House would be the proper
one te deal with this matter, a committee
not composed exclusively cf Senators ooming
from the western provinces, but the majority
being ge irrespective, cf course, as te which
side of the Hause they are on.
It may be very properly eaid that the tbree
premier~s having been oommunicated witb, as
bad been suggested, ttiey fbad certainly a
right te some extent te reflect the opinion

from those provinces. I cannot gainsay that;
I have a right te admît that, but I do not
know whether the ma.tter had been very mlich
considered by them. At least in one province, the middle province, from wbich I corne,
I think that any suggestion emanating from
the Dominion Governent at the present
time would receive hearty endorsement; I
do flot expeet. to get criticismn from that province.
Individually, I think that the right to the
second homestead is tee wide. 1 arn not antagonizing the idea of the second h<>mestead; I quite support it, because 1 think
there are many cases in whioh it will bring
another chance ini life te a man who has
been unfortune.te, perhaps oometimes due te
lis own fauit, sometimes due te climatie or
But 1 think that in al
other conditions.
justice a second homestead should 'be limited
in its scope te the province in which the
man had c'btained 'bis first hoinestead. The
lack of such a proviso is the only objection
I bave to the Bill, and I would like to see
that phase sent te a Special Committee tihat
would inquire especially inte that point, and
decide whether that suggestion would be a
preper one.
I do not want to move' in the first instance;
I think any one who bas my opinion might
move that the Bill be referred to a select
committee in preference to sending it to the
Committee cf the Whole House.
It 18only fair that every one of those provinces, which have been looking after those
who have been finan-cially unfortunate, be the
reason wbat it may, sbould have an epportunity again of taking charge cf the financial
dereliet, shall I say, and giving bim the oppertunity te re-establish bimiself in the province which bas been helping te carry in on.
Very frequently the settler's taxes bave becorne derelict, and bis property ia net only
lest te hlm, but frequently lest te the province. I tbink in the old provinces cd Saskatcbewan, Manitoba and eertainly in Alberta,
there will be f eund lands fit for settiement
and new homesteada adequate te take care
cf those who desire te avail themselves cf
this Act. If that be net se, then our campaign cf immigration in both Ma.nitoba and
Saskatchewan is idie and absurd. We know
that in the northern end cf Saskatchewan we
have a very large area of land stili open and
fit for settiement; and what is true cf Saskatchewan l8 perbaps true te a more limited
extent cf Manitoba.
Without reflecting at ail on Alberta, of
whicb I have ne intention, I think it only fair

that in tbose provinces which have carried
the hurden of the day the Act sbould ho rez-tricteti iii suchl a way that the hoinesteader
nm-Lst, make his selection in the province in
wbjeh he hall bis first homestead, or proernption, as the case may be.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourablo gentlemien. in wvhat I have said on this Bill 1
have rcfrained from discussing the merits of
the particular question referrcd to. 1 have
nierely taken the ground that in view of the
filet. as we are informed, that, thoso lands are
about to he rcrurned to those western provines~ in tbe very near future, or within the
coming yetr, xxe ought not to legisiate on the
subject at al, or if w-e do so, wc should flot
legi-late in this sense. unless we are catisficd
that tbe Governuiients of those provinces aipprove.
-Now the leader of the Governiment bas put

Personaily I do not feel the ncessity for the

a question of policy ;vhicli does flot, need any
special investigation as to facts.
Because
of t]aat conv iction I thought that it was a
mîatter on which our friends from the xvest
should give uis freely -their opinion and their
advice, whichi I welcomed.
The bonds of
the provincial goveroments seern to be content, anti they have spoken, and I doubt very
much the neoti for an enqtîiry as to facts.
If niy hionourable friend haô expressed any

MAY 2, 1928
opinion as to the necessity for information
on some branch of the matter, as coming from,
the Department, which would enlighten him,
1 wouid giadly join him, but I cannot se
what will be gained by any investigation the
Committee -may make.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
The point J
raised a few days ago was that we should
hav'e very definite statements from the Prime
Ministers of those four provinces that they
agreed to the iegislation. in this Bill, for the
reason that it is practically a provincial
matter.
We are morally trustees, and the
trusteeship is about to end, and I question the
wisdom of bringing in this legisiation at ail
at this time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my hon3urable friend knows that since he has 'been in
Parliament, in the Commons as weIl as here,
the transfer of those natural resources has been
on the tapis. WiIl we have a solution in one
province within twenty-four months, or twelve
months? And as to the others, will we have
any solution within twelve years?
So I can
see that Saskatchewan is not very much interestÀed in abandoning the cash income it has
for the natural resources that remain.
But,
ail the same, we must continue to administer
these lands, and my honourable friend is facing
a whole delegation from Alberta which sits in
the other House. The silence of the Prime
Minister, who is lxild of the legisiation, offers
no objection.
Must we wait and press the
Rlon. Mr. Brownlee for an opinion whicb he
nay not be ready to give? R1e may not like
;o take the responsibilîty. Perbaps bis silence
narks prudence, but a Government which has
bhe responsibiity must act, and here the hon.
jurable gentleman has an entire delegation
from his own province in the other Chamber.
That is why I cannot exactly see where an
investigation wilI lead us.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: An investigation
into the Bill itself is what is in the -minds of
various members of the Senate and of other
persons who have discumed the matter with
me. They desire to discuss the Bill further.
Personally, I have pinned my objection to the
Bill upon the fact that there are not before
this House definite statements from these
Premiers to the effect that they want this
passed. It is sucb definite statements that 1
want, and they are ail I want. The honourable
leader of the Goverament bas brought down
two or three replies of a sort. Those from
Manitoba and Saska.tchewan seemn to be fairqy definite. There is nothing in wri.ting fromn
the Prime Minister of Alberta; and the situation that bas developed within the past few
weeks with respect to lands dn British Colum-

bia, it seems to me, qualifies the reply from
that province to &ucb an extent as to nke it
of no value at aIL There is my point. The
Committee wouid merely, so far as I arn concerned, take steps to get definite replies.
The honourable leader of the Government
has said that it is the duty of the Government
to act. Well, it is the duty of the Provincial
Governments also to set. I can, quite believe
-and I mentioned it the other day-that this
legislation wil be extremely popular. 1 can
quite believe that the constituency representatives in the other House would sca.rcely dare
oppose it. But our position ie different: we
are the historie guardians of the interests of
the provinces. We are their historic wail of
protection. It is our business to know definitely that these provinces approve of this legisiation. If they do, as the land às about to be
transferred to their hands, 1 shouid think that
we would bave nothing more to say; but if
there is rea-son to believe that they do not
âpprove of the legisiation or that it is likely
to interfere with the policies which they themselves propose with respect to these lands,
then this House ought to know about it. We
tshould know what we are about.
Hon. R. F. GREEN: Honourable gentlemen, I arn flot quite sure that I understood
just what the honourable leader ini this House
bad to say as to Britieb Columbia. As 'I understood it, he said that Hon. *Mr. Pattullo
had been consulted and that lie had a wire
from Mr. Pattullo saying that the land laws
of British Columbia provided for a second
homestead entry.
Hon. Mr.« DAN DURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: If that is the only
answer that we have at present from British
Columbia, it means nothing. The homestead
Act of British Columbia is entîrely different
from the homestead Act of the Dominion.
'Under the British Columbia Act a man, of
course, must perform certain duties, and then
he has also to pay Si an acre for his land.
The bonourable leader on the other side
stated that this question of the return of the
lands had been before the country for a long
tîme and that we should not, look for an early
settlement of it. There bas been no dispute
lately, as far as British Columbia is concerned.
The Commissioner has recommended the return of these lands unconditionaily, and the
honourable leader of the Government in anýother place, in answer to a direct question,
snid: "We are going to aet upon the recommendation of this Commissioner, and ive are
going to return the land." Tbp only quali-

410

SENATE

fication hie made was the statement, "We have
flot dccided yet as to the time."
Now, surely, unless you are going to exclude
British Columbia from this particular Act,
we shouid have somet.hing more definite froïm
the Goveroment of British Columbia as to
what they think of this proposed amendaient,
because it applies to lands which are not at
prcsent under their coritrol, but whieh they
expect will be as soon as there i.s an opportunity to bring ini the necessary legisiatiori to
put the lands, where they shou:ld have been,
under the control of the Province.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I have scarcely anything to say upori this
Bill. There seems Vo be a good deal ini the
suggestion of the honoyurable member from
Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby). There
is no dýoubt at ail, I think, that if we pass
this Bill as it is, it wiil have a somewhat
disturbing effect upon the population in the
Northwest. It is quite .possible, at ail events,
that it may have; that people in Manitoba
and Saskatchewan who have a right to a
second entry may leave those provinces and
go away to the Peace River. Whether that
ia -wise thing or flot is a question on which.
the people in the Northwest are better able
to give an opinion that I arn, but I think it
wouid be well to get some information in that
respect.
Then there is the other point, about the
consent of the Premiers. 1 arn satisfied as to
ail except Premier Brownlee. We shouid be
in a rather awkward position if on the
transfer of these lands to the provinces in the
Northwest we should be bilied at $10 an

acre for ail the land that wiii *be taken up in
second1 entries. I think we ought to know
definitely that the provinces are at one with
the Dominion iri ailowing this thing, so that
there may be no future dlaim -made against
the Dominion Government on account of

thc'se iandýs. You do read in the newspapers
of possible dlaimis made *by some of the
western provinces for the value of lands
transferred in the past, with compound
irnterest added to it. It wouid be weil for

us to look a littie ahead and try to avoid
aliv dlaim or misunderstanding on that point.
If the Biii goes before a special coinmittee
we can ask for a definite answer from Alberta.

We cari further ask for information in regard
to the other point, as to whether or not this
right of second' entry should be iimited to the
province in which the mari lives who makes
the entry.

Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen, regarding the merits of this *proposed
legisiation I do rot think there is any conflict
Hon..Mr.

GREEN.

of opinion.

I think thiat as far as Western

Canada gencrailly is concerned, this would be
a popular move, and the best evidence of that
is the fact that the Government of the day
is in favour of it and, has introduced the proposai, and -it -hm received the approval -of the
Western members in the House of Comnions.
So I think we may take it ithat as to the
merits of the legisiation there are probaibly

flot two opinions. The oniy objection that I
cari see to it would be that from some province-Manitoba,

for instarice-where

there

is flot much availabie homestead land left,
there might be a gerieral exodus to other
provinces, and this might leave some unpleasant resuits followirig in its wake.
But the question that arises in my mind

is whether it is advisable for us to pass this
legislatiori at this piartinular time. What
more evidence have we to(-day than we had
the other day when this question was before
the Houge? I think we may take it for
granted that the statemerit of the Province
of Manitoba refleets public opinion in that
province

and

that no

objection

would

be

raised *by Manitoba to this legisiation. The
saine. 1 think, applies to the Provioce of
Saskatchewan, and. if you wiil read between
the lines of the message received from Premier
Gardiner of Saskatchewari you wili see the
reason why, so far as that province is concerncd, hie baig no objections to raise. The
reason is thiat iniasmuch as Saskatchewani, like
Manitoba, bas few public resources, except
land, it is the intention and probabiy the
poiicy of the Saskatchewan Goverriment to
dlaim, in lieu of resources, the cash grants
which
they are
at the
preserit time
receiving. But the situation is different
in British Columbia
arid Alberta.
The
telegram read from Mr. Pattullo, who is
the Minister of Lands of the Province of
British Columbia, so far as I was able to
foiiow it, ineant notbing. In the first place
Mr. Pattuilo is not the Prime Minister of
British Columbia; and, in the second place,
lie is at present in the province of Ontario
and therefore would not naturaily be in a
position to consuit with the Governn'ent
which lie represents.
But if you consider
what he actuaii 'y states in the telegram you
find that he gives no opinion at ail on the
question: hie simply says that the poidcy of

the British Columbia Government tio-day is
that second homesteads are riow being given
under certain conditions, which are different

from those of the Dominion homestead Act.
He does not say whethcr or not the British
Coumtbia Govecniment would bc favourable
to the Federal Government giving srecond
hoinestrads. That is the point at issue in this

MAY 2,1928
legislation. Then we corne to the province
of Alberta. I think it is most eesential that
we should have an officiai expression of
opinion frorn the Governinent of that province. They probably have more to gain,
or more t-o loSe, than any ether of the four
Western provinces.
Therefore, while in my opinion it niay
not be necestaTy te refer this matter to a
select committee just to satisfy ourseIves as
to the opinions of the Western provinces on
this question, I think it would be within the
realm of propriety for the Senate ta proceed
no further with this Bill for, say, a week,
until the Govern'ment could get an officiai
opinion f-rom the province of Alberta, and
probably an officiei opinion from the province
of British Columbia, with regard to this'Bill.
Then, Eo far as I arn concerned as a Western
man, if they have no objection to it, the Bill
Éhould be accepted. I think it would be the
part of wisdom to give these two provinces
the opportunity to say whether or not they
have any objections to this particular Bill.
The giving of second homeeteads by the provincial authorities is another questioýn entirely.
Hon. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
gentlemen, 1 wizh to make just a few remarks
on this matter. I made soine the other day.
1 arn very much in favour of the Bill, provided there are sufficient restrictions, which
I consider extremely important. I do not
know much about British Columbia or the
homestead -regulations of that province, but
I do know something about the Prairie provinices. I see a great deal in the suggestion
made by the honourable senator from Moose
Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), that it might
be well to restrict the homesteading privileges to eaoh province, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, or Alberta. This Bill was ýconsidered
in another place and, as I understand, the
inembers from the three Prairie provinces
were unanimously in favour of it. There are
in Western Canada many cases in which
settiers were confronted with very difficuit
probleins, and I assume that that condition
had something to do with the initiation of
this Bill. Some of those cases have already
been mentioned. In other instances land was
homesteaded that was absoluteiy useiess. I
know of somne instances of that kind in
Alberta. It may be said that people should
flot have taken up such land, but in a great
many dietricts in those three Prairie provinces it i8 somewbat difficuit for a man to
tell just what kind of land he is taking up.
So I amn in favour of this Bill. I concur
in the remarks made by the honourabie mein-

411

ber from Moose Jaw, and I see not the
slightest occasion for referring the Bill to
a speciai committee. I entirely agree with
the honourable leader of the Governinent.
He might, as the honourabie senator f rom
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) suggests postpone
this matter for a week or so, but so far as a
speciaI committee is concerned, I see nothing
that it could do further than we have now
done. I amn in favour of the House going
into Committee on this Bill at once, and I
hope that the Bill wiii be passed by the
Senate somne turne during this Session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I need not state that I have
aiways taken the position that this Chamber is entitled to ail possible information.
1 was going to say that I would object most
strenuously to the Bill being referred to a
committee which beIieved that it had authority to make amendments and bring back an
amended measure. We have sometimes sent
a public Bill to a committee simply for the
purpose cf getting direct information front
the heads of Departments. In this instance
I cannot see that we could get more information frorn the departinental heads than I
myself secured from gentlemen who had reflected upon this Bill and given me a full
statement of their views, which I placed on
Hansard Iast week.
I arn willing to have this Bill postponed
until the middle of next week for any further
information that can be obtained. In the
meantime, if any constructive suggestion can
be made, I will1 giadiy submit it to the Minister of the Interior, who wiil refer it to his
chiefs of branches. My honourabie friend
froin Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
suggested one amendinent, in which my
honourabie friend from Boissevain (Hon. Mr.
Schaffner) has concurred, that the homnesteader shouid not be entitied to a homestead in another province. I do not know
the particular reason for such a limitation,
but 1 amn ready to submait that to the Minister of the Interior, and it may appeal to
his judgment. If wîthin the next week any
other suggestions can be made for improving
this Bill, I shal -be glad to receive them
either from honourable memibers in this
Cham-ber or privateiy, and in a week's time
I shahl bring the Bill back for further conidertion in Committee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is ail very
well. I rnay not agres with the honourable
gentleman from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr.

reply from one of the Prine Ministers. We

Hon. Mr. DANDURÂND: The honourable

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
If the Prime

MILITIA

PENSION BILL

COXSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senatc xxent into Commiittec on Bill 197, an
Act te anienci the Mfilitia Pension Act.
lIon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURANý\D: I will ask Col.
Orde, Judge Advocate Gencral of the Departmient, to corne te the floor.
Sections 1 to 6, inclusive, ivere agreed to.
On section 7-pension te officer or inilitia,
nman of His Majc.ity's Army. Rveýervc. etc.:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I would like to
ofici' the observation wît'h respect to tiuis
clue thlait i t (u1 d bc, a good dcalI ot ter
tIlIn it is, but tiblît inasinuch as any arnndment t bat I would offer would ho iii the
nalure of an increased charge, and therefore
out of order, I can do no more than comment.
This section deals with the treaiment that
thi- vounitrv metes out Io reservîsts of the
Btis armnv who were -erving in our Per.h
tonnent Force at the cutbreak of the war,
t'nc ixho, by' reason of the fact that the '
wcre on the Army Reserve, and because of
,arrangements existing between the Governnent of Canada and tbe British Government,
ivere entitled to he released from the Cenedian service and to be sent back to join
their Imperial army units. Inasmuch as they
owere ail highly trained mcn, and for the most
part specialists, the Government of Canada
eit the outbreak of the war asked that they be
c-tained in Canada. Thev were s0 retaincd,
for the most part against thoir xviii, and
scrved in Canada for the duration of the ivar,
and as a resuit lost opportunities of adi encement and promotion that they otherwî,,e would have had. In addition, the Goveromiient of Great Britain, I arn informed,
f owards the conclusion of the war made a
special offer to ahi reservists who at that time
would have had about 17 years of service to
thieir credit. sfeting that if they wouid continue
to serve for four years more, which would
give them 21 years of service, they would

MAY 2, 1928
be entitled to their pensions as British
soldiers. We in Canada made no such offer.
What we did was to keep them in our service
and demobilize tbem, and the day of their
demobilization is determined in this Bill.
When the Expeditionary Force was demobilized their demobilization was complete.
A reservist is a British soldier who serves
five years with the colours and seven years
on the Reserve, or seven years with the
colours and five years on the Reserve; sO at
the outbreak of the war the maxn with the
most favourable case would be one who had
less than twelve years service. That is to
say, if he had twelve years service his time
would have expired. The man with the most
favourable case is one who had eleven years
and eleven menthe; service on August 4th.
IL bis demobilization took place in 1920 he
would have had six years service so that his
combined Canadian service and British
service would corne to less than eighteen
years. We cut him. off at that, and therein
lies bis grievance, because had he gone back
t o England he would have had the opportunity
of another four years servioe, and would have
been given a 21 year pension at the end of
that time. There are not rnany of these men:
there were 149 to .start with, and they are
down to fifty something now.
This clause is designed to meet their complaint. Under it a reservist will be able to
count his Imperial service and Canadian
service, which in no case will anîount to
more than eighteen years--indeed, in ail cases
ta lese. The Government will then geek to
ascertain what pension he would have been
cntitled. to, receive if bis service had been
wholly Imperial, and undertakes to give him
an equal pension. But my information is
that there is no pension for less than eighteen
years in the British Service; consequently
this particular regervist will get no pension
at aIl from the Canadian Governrnent. It
bas been contended in another place that the
purpose of this leislation is to put these
reservists on tbe same footing as our own
soldiers. But this is uncalled for, because,
as far as 1 am aware, the only way to bring
about any sort of equality is to count the
Irnperial service on and towards a Canadian
pension. If that had 'been provided for in
the Bill, I think-indeed, I arn sure-the
reservists would have been satisfled. You
are aware of the fact that shortly after
the war we 'brought down an amendrnent to
the pension legisiation affecting flot only
rnilitary but also, civil pensions, in order
to enabie the Government to clear the deck,
so ta speak, of its surplus officers and officiais
by a systern of pension-ing after ten years

413

service. Under the ten years service arnendment a number of these men were disposed
of. The effect of this Bill, therefore, is that
a reservist discharged from the Canadian
service with ten or more years service to
his credit is better off than a reservist who
returned to England and completed 21 years
That is a

statement made by an officer of the Department, and I think it may be relied upon.
That, from the point of view of doing justice,
is a cornfortabIe statement. We are able to
say that we have done better for him than he
would bave been done for if he had twenty

out to those wbo complain.
Now, this furtber statement may be made.
Clause 7 is primarily designed to benefit
those discbarged frorn Canadian service who
did not bave sufficient service-that is to say
ten years-under the Canadian systern to
qualify for a Canadian pension; and after this
section is passed the Government will ascertain
what any reservist in the ten year class might
bave got from the Imperial Government had
he returned, and will then ask him to eleet
wbether be will keep tbe gratuity which he
got on bis Canadian disebarge, or return the
gratuity ta the Government and take in lieu
thereof the pension contemplated by section
That is where the sticker cornes in, if I

section as drafted may confer a benefit upon
the reservist of lower rank than warrant or
commissioned officer, but I gravely doubt it.
If this bas any advantage for those reservists,
it will be very small, and will serve to do
little more than recognize an oibligation which,
by experience of the operation of the clause,
the Government in subsequent years may sec
fit to recognize in further amexidments.
I desire to put this statement on record,
because as a class these were a very useful
set of men and did a very valuable service to
Canada bere during the war.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Poasibly the informiation bas been given, but I tbink we should
get from tbe Department a statement of approximately thse number of men who will
henefit from tbe changes suggested in this
Bill.

IMMIGRATION
SECOND

READING

BILL
PROPOSED

Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND moved the second
reading of Bill 187, an Act to amend the
Immigration Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, if new
members werc not coming into this Chamber
each year, I should hesitate ta make any
lengthy remarks on this Bill, because most of
the arguments in favour of this repealing
measure have already been, advanced, as well
as the abjections to the repeal. Perhaps I
may be at iault in failing ta canvince the
mai ority in this Chamber in the past. It
may be t.hat I did not enter inta the matter
at sufficient length ta, win the support of the
mai oritry for this Bill. I will try to, add some
arguments, if possible, ta, those which honourable gentlemen have already heard, and I
think that by a fair presenrtation I shail bc
able ta enlighten. the faith of my honourable
frienda and obtain thoir judgment in favour of
this measure.
The amendment -ta the Immigration Act ta
which this Bill refera was passed in 1919, if I
am not mistaken, at a time when there was
some excitement ini the country icllawing
event8 that had occurred in Winnipeg and

415

the upheaval in Russia. There was an impression that the country was threatened with
a wave of Bolshevism. People were nervous,
and as a resuit of the fear which seemed ta
seize a number of officiais, not only did we
pass this amendxnent to the Immigration Act
and an amendmeit ta the Criminal Law which
1 shall discuss later on, but we also deeined i-t
necessary - to transfer the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police to, the East and have thein
caver as well as passible the large centres of
population, lest there might be an uprising ot
some sort. I tbink that to-day there is a
clearer understanding of the character of aur
people and we are ready ta recognize that the
fear which permeated the minds of the
authorities in 1919 was a vain anc. We now
realize that there is a great deal of sanity
amongst the population and no danger of their
being carried away by any such wind as blcw
over Russia.
1 will read the section of the Immigration
Act which came into force as a resuit of that
emotion, and I would draw the attention of
honourable gentlemen ta the wording, because
I think they will find from my rcading of the
Immigration Act without this clause that it
cantains practically ail the safeguards that are
contained in this one, but prescribes them in
far less dangerous terni&, as many people
believe, than the clause which we are naw
asked ta repeal. Section 41, ta be repealed,
reads as follows:
41. Every person who
(a) by word or act in Canada seeks ta overthrow by force or violence the government af
or constituted law and authority in the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or

Canada, or any of the provinces of Canada, or
the government of any other of His Majesty's
dominions, colonies, possessions or dependencies.
or advocates the assassination of any officiai
of any of the said governments or of any foreign
government, or who, in Canada defends or suggests the uniawful destruction of property or
bv word or act creates or attempts ta create
any riot or public disorder in Canada; or
(b) without lawfui authority assumes any
powers of government in Canada or in any part
thereof; or
(c) by common repute belongs ta or is suspected af belonging ta any secret society or
organization which extorts money from or in
any way attempts to contrai any resident of
Canada by force or by threat of bodiiy harm,
or by blackmaii; or
(d) is a member of or affiliated with any
organization entertaining or teaching disbeiief
in or opposition ta, organized gavernment;
shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed
ta beiang ta the prohibited or undesirable
classes, and shail b e liable ta, deportatian in the
manner provided by this Act, and it shail be
the duty of any officer becaming cagnizant
thereof and of the clerk, secretary or other
officiai of any municipality in Canada wherein
any such persan may bie, forthwith ta send a
written complaint ta the Minister, giving f ull
particulars: Provided, that this section shali

I believe that this section 41 is useiess,
discriminatory and arbitrary.
I say useless
because the State is sufficiently armed and
protected by sections 3 and 40 of the Immigration Act and sections 132 and 134 of the
Criminai Code, which cover sedition. Section
3 of the Immigration Acft specifies the prohibited classes:

My honourable friends wilI see that under
the Immigration Act the State eau refuge

the clause which, I now asic the Senate te

they can be deported for offences that are

enactments neceesary te preteet society, and
had we net added this amendment we would
stii have been armed with ail the necessary
authority te main.tain law and order in
Canada.
The Act cf 1919, which. I gtated was tbe
resuit cf nome feeling througbeut the land,
which bas since been found te bave been a
vain emotion, was neyer called inte action
or utilized, which akows that we could have

We are the offspring of a country tbat

that it ie repuguant te any buman being te
think that bie eaul be se esxmmarily and arbitrarily sent away frein a country without
a fair trial. I believe it le repugnant te the
lawe which have been enacted thrcughout the
realm., whiob we bave been in the habit cf
judging as tihe highest mark cf civilisation
since the Habeas Corpus Act was proclaimed
lu Great Britain. Those laws we bave largely
reprcduced in car own. statutes.

exception. We have an aid saying, wben
using the French language in the courts, wbdch
rune as f olows: "Lois d'exception sont de
mauvaises lois." That in, laws cf exception,
or laws made for inidividual case, are dangereus, laws. This le eue cf the laies that fall
under that categcry.
My bcmourable friend may gay that it ig
very difficult te define seditious intention
which rune through a certain nuruber cf
clauses lu -the Criminal Code, whicb I bave
read. The British legielators bave tried their
hand at defining that and put it an the statuite
books, but I have a definitian wbldb I think
f airly represents the matter, and it was better
te allow the judges te decide in each ceue
what was the seditiaus intention. It was defined, and le generally recognized as f oliowe:
A seditioue intention ie an intention te bring
into hatred or centempt or te excite disaffection
againet the pereon cf HIer Majeety or the gevernment and constitution cf the ÛJnited Kingdom or cf any part cf it as by law eetabliehed,

we bave aIl the powers we need te cope with

that tbey were not bound by any law

SENATE

Hlon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, a short time ago I submitted to this
flouse an inquiry whicb was narrowed down
to one phase of the subjeict-matter now being
digcussed, in thie Huse. The inquiry was a
simple one: whether the Governient jntended
to grant the petition sent to it by the Cathol-ic
Wnrnen's League, requesting the deportation
of Communistie teachers from this country.
WXe had last week the opportunity of listening to a very interesting speech by the
honourable gentleman from Lanark (Hlon. Mr'
Haydon), wvbich, I am hound to say, has
wîdened connsiderably, if not heigbtened, the
discussion that I had introduced in this
Huse. My honnurable colleague has given
to the discussion the background of history.
fie seemed to paint with a liglit hand-almost, I might say, with a light heart- a pictuîre of Cnmmunism as asseciated witb Socialism for the past fifty or one hundred years.
1 could not help thinking as I saw my honourable friend draw this picture, which. seemed,
as it were, to be softened by distance, that
he would have had to use different colours in
order to paint a living picture of Communism
as it exists in our day; I mean the real Communismn of the Third Internationale. Here,
at the outset, I fear I must decline to admit
that Socialisin and Cornmunism are one and
the samne thing. My honourable friend was
right when ho spoke by the book and cited the
history nf the last fifty or seventy-five years,
or of one hundred and flfty years ago, that
of Jean Jacques Rousseau; but, honourable
gentlemen, are we dealing nnw with a matter
tbat concerns our great great great grandfathers, or dealing wvith a real menace knockI
ing at otîr doors at the present time?
take it that I must refuse to follow the
honourable gentleman thrnugb. the arcanas of
history, and mugt come to grips with the real
problem nf to-day.
Socia-lism and the Conmmunism of the Third
Internationale are totally, ahsolutely different
things. S-ocialism, it is true, is based on the
principle that ail private ownership should disappear and that property should be held in
common and spportioned amonýgst ail the
members of the cnmmunity. Ve:ry well. May
I now sbow tn this honnurable House what
kind of Socialisma exists under tbe Third

was not intended for publication. It wua sent

from Ruasia; this one because he was a fýriend

think will en-lighten this Bouse as wo the deeprooted sentiment of eynicism and cruelty which
actuâtes that government:

between socialism and the communism of the
Third Internationale, but the latter is nothing
but a cruel, selfish, autocratie system, and I
intend now to follow my argument by calling
it by its true name; Bolshevism is the real
term. My honourable friend called it Conmunism, and he said it was disappearing quietly and gradually; I think his terni was "flattening out and breaking down." Well, may
i refer to other authorities that I have in
hand? I refer now to the English Review for
June, 1927, an article en-titled "Circling the
Scorpion", by Ernest Remnant:
Any real evolution of the Bolshevik regime is
impossible unless the dictatorship is abandoned.
"The dictatorship of the proletariat", writes
Stalin, "is opposed to democracy, that is to
say, to the equality of aIl citizens". If there
is a justice in the Soviet State, it is a "class
justice". Lenin proclaimed that "ail is moral
that is useful to Communism; ail is immoral
that is injurious to Communism." There are
elections in Russia, but they are class elections
in which only certain categories of citizens can
take part. They are entirely vitiated by the
Communist monopoly of party politics.
Such are the essentials of the political regime. But if and when the Soviets transform
their foreign and economic policies, will they
not be able similarly to transforn their political
systein-to abandon the dictatorship?
The
answer is No, if only because the social experiment which has been thrust upon a great people
at the cost of more than twenty-five million
lives through famine, civil war, pestilence,
stifling of the birthrate, and political assassinations will not be forgotten easily. The vietims of the Tcheka. estimated by those responsible at two million persons, will suffice some
day or other to raise up thousands of avenging
hands. These hands have been powerless so far
simply by reason of the system of universal
espionage, but wvhat if it were abolished? Even
if the Communist leaders were ready and willing to turn their backs on the past and establish a new regime. their own personal security
would still demand a continuance of the terror
and dictatorship. And the Tcheka itself compels the leaders to remain dictators because of
fear for its own safety at the hands of an
avenging people.
But in any case the dictators have no idea
of transforming their foreign or economic policies. To consider the former question first. In
November, 1926, after the victory of the "moderate" Stalin, the congress of the Communist
Party adopted a motion which began thus: "The
party considers that our revolution is a Socialist
revolution, that it not only constitutes the
point of departure for the Socialist revolution
in the Occident, but also furnishes the basis for
the development of the world revolution." Then
followrs a lengthy criticisn of the tactics of
Trotsky, who urges speed, and a defence of
those of Stalin, who urges temporization. To
pretend that it is a spirit of proselytism that
spurs the Communist party to foment the world
revolution is an error. The instinct of selfpreservation is the key to their conduct.
Lenin himself was convinced that the "dietatorship of the proletariat" could not be maintained for long unless the social revolution
spread to other countries. A Communist oasis
in a capitalist desert was bound to disappear
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

sooner or later. Speaking after the proclamation of the Nep, Lenin said that the collaboration of the Soviet power witlh the peasants was
a makeshift, and that if the world revolution

delayed too long the collaboration would cease
and the Soviets perish. Thus it is that despite
the disastrous economie situation the money
that is available goes first to fomenting the
world revolution.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I would refer
you to a news item from Moscow published
in the Montreal Gazette of May 2, 1928, in
which the power of Russia was displayed in
such a demonstration as may not exist the

world over. The article is as follows:
Moscow Gives Military Show For May First

To-day's scene in Red Square was an astound-

ing demonstration

of the might of the armed

proletariat. just as it was intended to be.
For the first of May in Soviet Russia is not

just a Labour Day, as elsewhere, but the day

of labour victorious, to serve as an example
and encouragement to the revolutionary spirit
throughout the world.
So the celebration opened with a inilitary
parade, to which I venture to suggest no country in the world could show a parallel to-day.
Over the cobble stones of historic Red Square,
past the towering Kremlin wall and the sinister
squat un-European mausoleuin where lies Lenin,
wlio achieved this miracle, marched thousands
after thousands of soldiers in quick step, cheering till the sky echoed.
Artillery rnumbled
along at a canter, cavalry--wide lines of
barbarie horsemen on tough ponies-galloping
furiously boot to boot with machine precision
and yelling.
That would have recalled to Amanullah. of
Afghan blood, the memory of ancient days
whnen his own savage tribesmen swept down
to loot rich India. Then tanks came, roaring
and grinding. then armoured cars. then
nachine-guns, heavy with motorcycles and liglt
witli bicycles. And above ail the airplanes,
first in battle formation, and later "stunting"
recklessly. And there was the shattering roar
of Kremlin guns.
It was an amazing exhibition in the heart
of the capital city of the country iwhose
representative a month ago flung the challenge
at the world powers, assembled at Geneva. to
abolish navies and armies completely within
four years. What followed was less splendid,
less nerve crashing, but to me personally--who

but in battle-far more inpressive. Civilians

I turn now to .the propaganda of Russia
throughout the world, and may I quote
Senator Pittnam, of the United States Senate,
in a statement reproduced in the Annals of
the American Academy of Political and Social
Science, 1926:
Stalin. the most powerful man in Russia
to-day, said just last Deceinber: "The theory

and practice of the Communist International is
the - organization of the mass revolutionary
movement against capitalism.
This is true.
This is the task of Communists."

MAY 3, 1928
Let us see how they fulfil that task. I refer
to the Revue Politique et Parlementaire,
March 10, 1928, in whieh A. de Gouleviteh
Says:
Kamereff, on lot March, 1924, in a speech
reproduced in "Izetia" of the 13th of April,
1924, decIared that the budget of Soviet Rusasa
omits 200 millions gold rubles spent on foreign
propaganda.
May.1 again refer to the letter ýfrom Boukharine, which touches on one propaganda
made by the Soviet:
Read Well Our Two Constitutions
It is frankly stated that it is nlot the
Sovietic Union, nor its parts which interest
us, but the figlit against the capital of the
world, and universal revolution, to which we
have always sacrificed everything, to which we
sacrifice the country, to which we sacrifice ourselves (it is evident that the sacrifice docs not
include the Sinoviev).
Because we only look to the future harvest,
wc shall neyer have any pity for those that
wc need as manure to fertilize the "communistic
fields".
We shall leave it -(Russia)-if we leave itwith enough money to buy half the world and
to organize a social revolution in ail the planets
and stars of the solar system. The if e of
the conspirator does not frighten us. It will
flot be for us a novelty.
It stili bas the
advantage of making a big impression on the
masses. I repeat (and it is a pleasure to do
so) that we now possess unlîmited means
placed already out of reach of those from whom
they have been taken.
But why these dark 'thouglits?
We have
always had luck, and it will not forsake us.
Then listen to this laet part:
The Russian sow which peacefully lias rested
on the riglit side for somne three centuries, bas
turned over, and now shall rest on the left side
with the samne equanimity, perhaps, for a perio&
stili longer, and until the advent of the universal social revolution.
Now, honourable gentlemen, will you allow
me to ref er briefiy to the effeet of that
propaganda throughout Europe? Do 1 need
to briug back to the memory of this House
what took place. after the war ini Hungary? I
happened to be there in 1921, ini Budapest,
and etrange to say xny companion was a
Canadian in charge of the Ameriean Westingbouse Company of Budapest. He took me
first of aiýl to the resid.ence of Tirza, the Prime
Minister of Hungary, and told me that whcn
the red revolution began the Bolsheviks went
te hie house and shot hlm down like a dog
before hie wif'e and daughter. He then took
me to the municipal hall, where every morning
scores of people were shot down.
You will say that le old history. Yes, but
it has been repeated practically continually
since the war in Austria. I remember being

in Vienna immediately after one revolution,
and finding practically every store on the
main etreet had been looted and partly demolished, the store fronts were still boarded
up, and I was told that for days the mob had
raided hall of the city.
I would like now to refer to a despatch
to the London Times of July 20, 1927, concerning the activity of the Bolshevik propaganda concerning AuStria. This will show
that ail those raids were the immediate resuIt of money sent from. Moscow;
Excited Speeches.
(Froin our Correspondent.)
Riga, July 19.-The disorders in Vienna
claimed a great share of the attention of
Boîsheviet leaders at Moscow over the weekend, and supplied a freeli theme at numerous
mass meetings in connexion with the end of the
first stage of "Defence Week"'.
To-day the Ikki, or Executive Committce of
the Communist International, published an appeal to the "workers, artisans, peasants, and
soldiers of the whole world," not to allow the
"heroic" Viennese revolutionarjes te suifer defeat.
The Soviet Press greets the fact that the
dlemonstrators disregardcd their leaders a.nd the
instructions of their own Central Committee as
the rnost hopeful sign. The Pravda says that
this emancipation from the restraints of its
leaders proves the truly revolutionary character
of the outburst.
Anmong many extravagant
speeches reported from Mfoscow is one by
Bukharins who declared that the spaik which
had already started the conflagration in Vienna
would rapidly spread throughout the whole of
Europe. The U.S.S.R. would enter this new
European war fighting for a revolution which
would enable the workers and peasants to conquer haîf, the world.
While the Boisheviet leaders evidently did
not expect any attempt in Vienna to seize the
reins of Government to succeed they hardly
dieguise their satisfaction that real fighting
actually occurred and that the blood of workers
was spilt in the streets of "peaceful Vienna."
where "bourgeois politicians conoidered such a
thing impossible." They compared the Vienna
riots with the Bolshevists' first open attempt
to overthrow the Provisional Government in
Petrogcrad in July. 1917. adding that "although
order appears to be restored, we confidently look
forward to Vienna's October, as the revolutionary blood shed to-day muet certainly bear a
rich harveet."
May I also eall the attention of this house
to a depatch to the London Times of April 29,
1927, in Which it ie stated that the Belgian
Government bas been obliged to. expel the
communiet agitators, and they were supported
by the House in doing so.
Saine objections
were made to sucli drastic mesures, but the
reply of thc minister was that it was an

there. The
Government
the established
despatch is as follows:
Communists Expelled from Belgium
(From our Correspondent.)
Brussels, April 27.-Communist deputies questioned M. Hymans, the Minister for Justice, in
the Chamber to-day in regard to the recent expulsions of Russian and Polish Communists who
had formed a Communist school at Liége where
workmen were instructed in methods of sabotage in factories.
M. Hymans replied that the Government insisted that foreigners should conform to the
laws of the country in which they lived. It was
not to be tolerated that they should set up
propaganda centres. The Liége police authorities were keeping a close watch on the dissemination of Cominunist and anarchist propaganda in that industriel region. It was being
carried on by foreigners, most of them Russians
or Poles. These foreigners were known to receive their instructions from abroad, and their
ideal was revolution on the Soviet model. Many
of thein possessed funds which came to them
foin

chanaels. If foreigners abused the hospitality accorded to them by inflaning passion and disturbing the internal life of Belgium their presence in the country would not be tolerated.
Now may I call the attention of the Senate
to La Presse of Montreal of the 21st of
February last, which contains a very striking
piece of news from Europe. Probably very
members know that a
few honourable
Bolshevik Government was in charge of
Norway for a time. Such, however, was the
case. At the general election of the 27th of
October last Norway returned 62 Communists,
31 Radicals, 31 Conservatives, and 28 Farmers.
The Radicals joined the Communists, and they
formed a Bolshevik Government with 9 Ministers, 7 of whom were without education.
When the program of the Government was
published there was a panie and a run on
the banks; everybody wanted to get rid of his
property and to hide or protect whatever he
had. Then the Government fell. But what
does the article say? It says that the success
of the Communists in Norway was directly
traceable to the propaganda of Kollontay, the
Soviet representative of Russia in Norway, and
his wife.
But let us pass on. My honourable friend
from Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haydoný) told us very
sympathetically how poor Carl Marx had been
expelled from his own country and from
France, and had sought refuge in Great
Britain; and how, while living there in two
small roms, he had had to beg a few pieces
of silver to bury his dead child. England, the
honourable gentleman said, had not refused
him the time-honoured hospitality always
extended to foreigners by that country.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I am going to
ask you to be patient with me while I refer
to the policy adopted by the British GovernHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

ment. Firat of all, may I refer the honourable
Leader of this House to the London Times of
the 21st af September last, which reproduces
a speech delivered by the Home Secretary, in
reference to the raid on Arcos House. During
the course of his speech, the Home Secretary
said:
These people were trade representatives of
the Russian Government, here for trade purposes, and for nothing else. Instead of carrying out those duties in the interest both of
Russia and Great Britain, they acted as spies
upon a friendly country, and as propagandists
of influences which are hateful to the majority
of our people. As such we came to the conclusion that the time had come for us to turr
them out and once more be masters in our owr
houasehold.

I have always held, and so bas English lau
that political opinion is free in this country
but rebellion is not. Rebellion is to-day E
crime, as it always has been, and the time
bas in my view come to say that preparation,
even if only mental preparation, for rebellior
is, or should be, made a crime in this country.
When you find that the whole Communist
organization devoted its time, its talents, and
its propaganda to undermining the rights of
democracy the time bas surely come to call a
halt. The ballot box of the country is free
and open whenever an election takes place.
The whole basis of democratie government is
the right of majority rule.
Not so these people. They care nothing for
votes of Parliamentary action. They are for
general strikes and Councils of Action. They
are for propaganda and sedition in the Navy
and the Army. Here is a short extract fronm
the Workers' Life of last month:
"The Fighting Force must be told the truth.
To refuse to make the . . . . designs of the Tory
Government clear to the workers in fighting
units is a gross betrayal of working-class
interests. People will find, presumably in the
next war, that an instructed corporal in charge
of the patrol dump will drop a match. They
will find that bomb racks in aeroplanes will
have a pin loose and the bombs will drop out
before the machines leave the ground." What
is that but an attempt to seduce the soldiers
of the King from their duty?
Another of their Communist papers of last
month says: "We carry on continual propaganda for the general strike against war." I
mnight quote you endless similar statements.
These are not the views of friends of Great
Britain. They are not the views of democracy.
They are the views of traitors within our
country, paid and directed by enemies withont; and I call upon the Labour leaders, both
inside the House and in the Trades Union
Congress, not merely to cut themselves off from
the Communist Party, but to join with ns in
stamping out those grave attempts ta destroy
our Constitution.
I place these articles upon Hansard so that
those who are interested in the subject may
be enlightened. Perhaps then the Government will realize that what Great Britain,
with a compact, homogeneous population,
trained for centuries, has been constrained to
do, we are much more obliged to do, not hav-

flcattered. over an enormaus area, where they
are very difficult ta reach, many of them
being entirely out of our reaeh beeause they
do flot know our language. Perhape the
Governinent will learn a lessan: from Mr.
Winston Churchill. Here is an extract fromn
the London Times of May 30, 1927:
Trade Unions and the Extremias
The Chancellor of the Exchequer bas sent a
long letter to the Conservative candidate for
the B3osworth Division, fromn which the following are extracts:
In the seven years ending in 1928, no f ewer
than 322,000,000 days' wages have been lost
through trade disputes. In fact, the number of
days' wages lost bas quadrupled twie over,
or multiplied 16 fold (as compared ith prewar times). This is the bitter fruit which has.
been brought to the wage-earners by the extremists increasingly getting hold of the old tradeunion movenient and using it for clas warfare
and political ambitions.
Juqt as the trade unioniste have let themselves be led by the nose by the Socialist extremists, no the Socialiat extremists have f allen
increasingly under the influence of Moscow.
Many of them. are fascinated by the spectacle of
a gang of conspirators baving succeeded in toppling over the Russian Empire and now ruling
it with a rod of iron. Tbey think they might,
with a little luck, do the samne sort of thing
here and get the country into their grip by
violence and hold it down afterwards by terror.
Then, again, ini the London Times of the
same date I find the warning of the Bishop
of Durham, which is as follows:

Past and present students of Bede Training
College assembled in large numbers at Durham
on k5aturday on the occasion of the college

At the luncheon the Bishop of Durham (Dr.

Hensley Hanson), in proposing h toast of
"The Cýollege," spoke of the need that teachers
should c-ounteratt the malefficient influences of
Russia in elucation in this country. "The axe is
laid at the root of our civilization", hie said,
'and the poison is working here in our country.

In the London Times of May 7, 1927 a.ppears another article an this suieet:

because hie uttered a truth no obvious that 'no

a moment that that movement has been making
headway in recent years and that it cows the
older trade umaonist and infects the younger
trade unianist by its deeply-considered proSag anda. Just as the trade union movement,
as been increasingly dominated by the extreme
elements, so the extreme elements have been
increasingly dominated by foreign influences
and by foreigu influences which are avowedly

tragic and shameful spectacle could we have
witnessed than the vast calamitiee which last

on aIl classes, and of the fact that these
calamities were due to the influence of leaders
like Mr. Cook- (laughter)--at one and the same

moment the master of the British miners and
the abject slave of Moscow?

In the English Review of June, 1027, appears "Circling the Scorpion" by Ernest
Reminant, which rmade as follows:
For, whatever may, or may not have been
discovered in the hiddeni safes in Moorgate,
ample and irrefutable evidence has long
been in possession of the Foreign Office ta

justify the strongest possible steps against a
treacherous enemy-even war.
In less sophisticated days, indeed, a declaration of war, followed by the blockade and
hombardment of ]Russian ports, would have
provided a simpler, quicker, cheaper, and more

cffective means ta enforce observance of treaLies essenitial to the maintenance of international peace than the intermediate exchange
of futile notes. In face of the evidence accumtlIated aIl over Europe and in Ansa of

Bolshevik plots to destroy civilized goverument,
the most patient believer in negotiation (unless,
like our bemused labour leader, hie is avowed
or secret sympathiser with Bolshevism) muet
by this time have given up hope of useful result
from conciliation and parley.

Now may I caîl attention ta the meastires
which the Japanese Goverrument were obliged
ta take no longer ago than the l2th of kpril
laïat, 'when several hundred Communiste were
arrested. I quote from the Montreal Gazette:
In connection with the recent arrest of many
Communiste, the prociirator-general made the
statemeut to-day that "the predominant aspect
of the whole aiffair is the seriaus fact that
Japan now is confronted by an unusually grave
national difficulty, înasmuch as revolutionismi is
pretty well diffused."

The official opinion was that "the present
attempt ta undermine the foundation of the
Empire from within is more serious than the
threat of armed force f rom without."

The strength of the Communist movement
in Japan is attributed in part ta the return
from Russia last year of "leaders trained in
fighting metbods by th:e leaders of the Third
Internationale."
Lt is understood that the Government plans
ta diismiss numerous college professors and ta
dissolve student groups owing ta their radical
sympathies

the prosecution of 150 has already begun, and
if the investigations now going an produce
sufficient evidence the prosecution of many
others is certain. The Communist movement

under commissars, and every facility for carrying out extensive propaganda.

allowed to, corne back on promising the Goverriment flot to off end again.
May I also cail the attention of the Senate
to an article in the London Times of August
Ist, 1927, which states that Brazil had to
protect itself by deporting the Communists.
I desire also to rèfer to an article in the
Times of September 7, 1927, showing that tlue
Bolivian Government, in order to protect
itself had to expel the Bolsheviks from that
country. The article is as follows:
La Paz, Bolivia, Sept. 6.-In the course of a
debate in the Bolivian Parliament to-day the
Foreign Minister, Senor Gutierrez, delivered a
strong attack on the Communist International,
which hcecliarged with fonenting and spreading
Communisai and revoit in South America.
The Minister read a number of documents
forwarded by the Bolivian Legation in Paris,
and alleged t0 have emanated from the Soviet
Embassy in the French capital. The documents,
which were signed by Bukharin, were in the
form of instructions to "Comrade Martinez,"
urging hin and other Communists in South
Amierica te organize a general Communist revol t.
The Minister announced at the saine time
that the police had flippe(l iii the bud an attempted Communist conspiracy in Bolivia and
hiad seuzed a quantuty of powverful explosives.
At the conclusion of the speech Parliament
passed a vote of confidence in the Government.
It is recalled that the rising of Indians in
Bolivia was attributed at the time to Coinmunist influences.
Now I corne nearer home. I have had the
opportunity of reading a document placed before the Senate of the UJnited States by
Senator Lodge on January 3rd, 1924, which
revealed a nation wide conspiracy, originating
and flnanced in Moscow, for the purpose cf
overthrowing the Goveraments of the United
States and Canada. It reads:
Imported revolution is knocking at the door
of the United Mine Workers of America and
of the American people. The seizure of this
union is being attempted as tbe flrst step ia
the realization of ai thoroughly organized prgram of the agencies andi forces behind the Communist International at Moscow for the ci)nquest of the American continent.
The overthrow and destruction of this Governiment, with the establishment cf an absolute
and arbitrary dictatorship and the elimiruation
of ail forms of popular voice in governmental
affairs, is being attempted on a more gigantic
scale, witlu more resolute purpose, and with
more crafty design, than at any time la the
history of tluis Nation.
The Communist régime at Moscow, bent on
world conquest, is promoting aad directing one
of the best organized and most far-reaching
campaigns in America than any country bas

ever been confronted with. The Communist
organization on the Amerucan continent is
composed of more tluan six thousand active
,leaders and lieutenants, and approximately
one million members adherents and sympathizers, scattered in every state and province
cf the United States and Canada and who are
activeîy or tacitîy prometing tue scheme to
import Bolshevism and Sovietism. to this side
of the Atlantic.
This campaign affects the people cf the
Dominion cf Canada as much as it does the
United States. The revolutionary agents cf
Moscow are working as actively and energetieally among the people of the one country as
they are among the people cf the other. Proof
cf this statement is found in the recent red
outbreak among the misguided miners cf Nova
Scotia, where armed revolution 'vas preached;
where an illegal strike occurred and the red
movement 'vas only broken by the vigorous and
forcîble action of John L. Lewis, president of
the Unjted Mine Workers cf America.
The menace cf Bolshevism ia America-the
United States and Canada-is net a figment cf
imagination or an invention of hysteria. It is
net a passing f ancy or a deceiving mirage.
'Nicolai Lenin and his group cf associates at
Mo-ccw are wvaging a definite contest for the
subjugation an<l seizuire cf the United States
and Canada. They would destroy the present
governoments, destroy the sovereignty and iadependence cf the people, and, la their place,
enthrone tlue idols and fallacies cf Bolshevism.
Millions cf dollars are being spent ln this
contest. Much the inoney is ccming fromn continental Europe and the remainder is being collected throughi organizations and committees
created for that purpose or by donations andi
contributions cf syuupathetic or well-intentioned
people la the United States.
Immediately before the start of the miners'
strike on April 1, 1922. the sum cf $1.11,000
wvas sent inte the United States by way cf
Canada, froin Moscow for the purpose cf enabling tlue Communist agents te participate in
the strike. Behind this move was the scheme
te overthrow the leadership cf the union and
then convert the strike into an "armed insurrection" against the Goverament cf the United
States.
The massacre cf the strike breakers at HlerIll., was engineered by these Cemmunist
r,
agents "boring f romn within" the miners' union.
Accorduug te their own statements, they were
euigaged for seven weeks beforehand iii their
preparation for a traguc occurrence cf this kinfi
at soine point in southera Illinois as a means
te "arousiag the workers to revelutionary action." Details cf this incident will be disclosed
un a subsequent article cf this series.
Ia the ceai flelds cf southwestern Penasylvania, where the strike started by orderly proccss, mine plants, tunnels, and power-transmissien lines were blown up, the homes cf miners
-were wrecked. and men were beaten or injured
by these Communist agents la an effort, under
the instructions cf Gregory Sinoviev, president
cf the Communist International, to arouse "the
revolutionary spirit of the workers and prepare them for the coming revolution la
America."
Ail cf these things show what
American employers wniuld have te tIpal and contend %vithif the Communist plans were to succeed and the preseut legitirnate Amnerican labor
movement were weakened or destroyed.

MAY 3, 1928
Three times in three years the Bolshevik
leaders at Moscow have attempted armed insurrection and revolution in the United States.
With the strategy of a field marshai Zinoviev sent the foiiowinq instructions from Moscow
to Commrunist agents in the United States a f ew
weeks before the start of the minera' strike on
April 1, 1922:
"The Centrai Executive Committee of the
Communist Party of America muet- direct its

strike of the minera of America.
Agitators and propagandists must ha sent to

It is necessar>' to arouse striking coal minera
to the point of armed insurrection. Let them
blow up and flood the shafts. Shower the strike
regions with proclamations and appeals. This
arouses the ravolutionar>' spirit of the workers
and prapares them for the coming revolution
in Amerîca."
The conspiracy which caused the loss of the
lives of twenty-two men at Herrin Ill., on June
21, 1922. . . . was a carefully planned affair,
schamed with ail of the dîabolîc crueit>' and disregard for law that characterizas the activities
of the Communist movement.

agent ini Ohio; E. R. Fay and R. P. Alcock in
Alberta; and with J. B. McLachlan, Alexander

Arrangements were made through McLachlan
and McLennan for Howat ta invade Nova Scotia

Ukranian dances and songs were given by a
large number of the children, and music was
alqo contributed by the Mandolin Orchestra
and the Young Pioneers' Mandolin Quartette.
During the a fternoon a number of thle May
Day syînpathisers met in a hall at 1108 St.
Lawrence Main where a concert and reception
was held.
This brings me back to the inquiry 1 have
made of the Government. My honourable
friend can see with what company the
Ukrainians are associating, and hie can see
there the confirmation of the truth brought
home to him. by gentlemen whom lie himself
holds in the highest possible esteem.
He
cannot ignore that amongst the Ukrainians a
pernicious propaganda is going on, and I
intend placing on the record a confirmation
of this fact hy another gentleman, himself a
Ukrainian. By implication the honourable
membler fromn Lanark (Hon. Mr. Huydon) said
th-at my speech maight be interpreted as lacking in charity towards the Ukrainians. I do
flot think I said anything t-hat could be so
perverted. If I did, it was not my intention
to do so. I have asked Parliarnient and the
Governmcnt to protect the Ukrainians against
cynical, paid propagandists. Oh, not people
wlio are over-zealous tlirough conviction;
flot at alI; 'but cynical organizers paid so
mucha a day in money that cornes frorn
Moscow. They get their reward when their
nefarious work is considered worth the money.
They must be useful. If they are flot tlicy
get no pay at ahi. Therefore, I arn siding witli
the people who are nothing but victims of
those propagandists. I would like to rend to
the Bouse a hetter fromn the Rector of St.
Michaeh's Church in Montreal, Father Gregorycliuk.
I was very much interested in your Motion
eoncerning Cornmunism in Canada. Being myself a Ukrainian and knowing conditions pretty
well aniong Ukrainians in Western and Eastern
Canada, rnay I draw to your attention, the
folhowing facts: about Communism, arnong
Ukrainians in Canada.
1. The number of Ukrainians in Canada is
about 250,000 to 300,000. Ahl these people corne
to Canada with good intentions to work for
their own and Canada's welfare.
2. The most dangerous thing for these people
is Cornrunistic Propaganda, which is spreading
very rapidhy, thog
ommunistie papers,
schools. and repesnatio.ns given in Comrnunistic Halls, under the naine of Ukrainian
Labor and Farmer Temple Association.
3. The centre of Cornmunismn for Western
Canada is Winnipeg, where a very powerfuh
organization is working to make Ukrainians
accept communistic doctrine. The saine thing
is done for Eastern Canada, the centre being
Toronto, where there are two Communistic
Temples, especially for Ukrainians, built at a
cost of about $125,000.00.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

4. 1 arn following the Cornrunistic movement
arnong Ukrainians very chosely, and may state
that the people are tauglit through the papers,
to liate the present systema of Government in
Canada. In the speeches delivered very often
in Comnurnistic Temples, they openly boast the
time will come when the present Government
will be overthrown by force and revolution
and the Proletariat wilh reign as in Russia. The
Communistic Scliools number about forty, with
2.000 children in attendanece. They are taught
Atheisrn, hatred of every religion, and love of
Lenin and bis Doctrine.
5. During representations and concerts, Canadian National Hymn is always ornitted and replaced by Internationale-the National Antliem
of Soviet Russia.
6. 1 may state that thîs Propaganda lias
gained already many adherents arnong Ukraimaýns in Western and Eastern Canada, and is
gaining new adherents every day. If tbey are
not opposed very soon this organization wihl be
a menace to Canadian Constitution.
7. It is my humble opinion that our Canadian Government should act and protect the
innocent people who are led into false doctrines
by agents of Moscow.
8. I ain saying this not as a priest but as a
Britishi subject, because I arn well acquainted
with the conditions obtaining among my people
in the East and West, and it is my opinion that
everybody irrespective of creed and race,
should act and suppress this pernicious propaganda.
1 trust that my humble opinion, as above,
wilh lie taken in the spirit in whichi it is
written.
A last word, honourable gentlemen.
A
request lias heen made hy a very respectable
element of thle population, that the Government shouhd deport those who teacli Comnmunismn to little chldren-to say nothing of
men like Spector, Tirn tBuck and others who
appeal to, people mentalhy able to defend
themselves. The children are not in that class.
The British Governrnent lis recognized the
danger to the extent of adopting special hegislation for the purpose of protecting tlie
children in England, alhlough there are
onhy tliree hundred cf them going to
Bohshevik sohools.
We have two thousand
such chuhdren 'iere, and they are practically
out of our reach. The priests know them, for 90
per cent cof the Ukrainians are not memnbers
of the Orthodok church, but Catholica. Men
wliose absolute integrity cannot be contested
have corne and asked the Government to
deport those teachers of Coxmnunisrn.
The
answer of the Government to a request of
that nature, so moderate and so rea-onable,
Ls given in the two Bis that we have before
us to-day. The Governrnent says, in effect:
"The Catholit Women's League of Canada
point to people who are poisoning the mincIs
and souls cf foreign children who corne here
knowing nothing of Canada and are thereby
made enemies of the nation instead of friends.
T hey want us to deport them, do they?
Very wehh, we shahl cast aside aIl our means

MAY 3, 1928
of deporting thern, lest we should inadvertently make use of those means." That is
the answer of the Government.
And the Government is endeavouring to justify it by saying that the legisiation now submitted is intended to relieve Englishmen of
a buniiliating discrimination. My honourable
friend knows very welI that the law was neyer
intended to make a distinction between treatment rneted -out to Englishmen and the treatment to other people. Why did nlot the honourable gentleman simply give a fair and cornplete explanation? When we can we do expel
objectionable people; when we cannot, we do
not. When a foreigner cornes here and abandons his nationalit;y to take Canadian citizensbip, why can we not expel him? Because he
bas no other country but Canada. We would
deport hini if we could, but we cannot, because
he bas f orsaken his own country and there is
no0 country to receive him? That is the only
reason. The Englishman or the Australian
can be deported, because be stili bas a country
to whîoh lie eau be sent.
But there is another point. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) reads the regulations of the Imniigration Department wbicb
debar from this country any persons holding
such ideas as those I have just exposed before
tbe House. If a man wlio is known to
have, or who adinits 'having, Bolshevist principles cornes before an Immigration Officer
at the frontier, as everyone knows, lie is
refused admittance. Is that flot tlie truth?
if lie is adrnitted, it is oady by error-0or
rather by fraud. Every man who appears
before a Canadian Immigration Officer is
obliged to answer wlietber or flot lie is tainted
witb Bolslievisrn, and if being taînted witli
Bolshevisrn, lie is admitted, it is because lie
lias lied. Therefore, according to my lionourable friend's argument, this would be tlie extraordinary. position: the man wlio says to the
Immigration Officer, "Yes, those are my
opinions--I arn a Bolslievist," is told,' "You
cannot enter this country," but the man wlio
is guilty of felony and treacliery, of lying
to the Immigration Officer wlien lie is asked
wbat opinions lie liolds, is perrnitted to enter
this country and is then sacred to the Government. The Government says, "If lie had told
the trutli we would have returned him imrnediately to lis own country, but lie lias told
a lie; therefore we must treat him very gently
and give him ail the privileges accorded to a
citizen of Canada. We muet have 'him judged
by the Court&" Does not the reseon which
necessitated the passage of this law exist today just as it did some years ago?
It is well kn-own that nothing is seized
apon more eagerly by the BoIghevise than

433

the pu'blicity of a drarnatie trial for expulsion
frorn a country. That is the best sort of
propaganda tbey can have, It enables thern
to pose as poor, lielpless victirne-they, the
men who are paid witb the blood-6oaked
money of the Soviets. Those are the people
wliom the Goverulmesit wants to protect.
Tliose are the people it is eager to treat as
the chi.ldren of the soil. I say that no more
unreasonable demand bas ever corne before
this House.
Tliere is one last feature to which I would
like to refes'. How is it that the Trades and
Labour Congreeg of Canada lias given assent
to these Bis? Everybody knows that the
labour unions are continually attacked and
continually on the defensive on account of
Bolshevists boring from within.
I have
quoted frorn a document of a legitimate labour
union, the United Mine Workers of America,
showing that they irnplored the protection of
their own Governrent in the United States
againgt tliose very men. Yet to-day we see
the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada
supporting this measure.
Will you allow me, honourable gentlemen,
to illustrate my view of tlie situation in this
countirv by a rerniniscence? It is a rather
curious one. When I was a young lawyer
I appreciated every one of the clients wbo
carne into my office. One day a ratie strange
looking man carne in. He was pale, thin,
sickly looking. I said to him: "My friend,
what is thle matter? Are you ill?"' "Oh, yes,
sir," lie said, "I have swallowed a lizard."'
"You have swallowed a lizard?" I said. "Yes,"
lie said, "I was drinking at a spring and I
swallowed a lizard, and. now it gnaws at me
and I cannot takre a meal unless I first give it
two hard-boiled eggs."
There is a lizard tliêt is gnawing ail the
tirne at the entrails of the legitîmate labour
unions, and they have been conipelled, as it
were. to compromise by supporting these two
Bills. Those are the two liard-boiled eggs
that tlie labour unions have fed to the
Bolshevists boring frorn within. The Cornrnunists say to the leaders of labour unions,
"For the time being we will stop our propaganda against you if you will support the
passage of these two Bilîls." Down go the
eggs, and the labour leaders gain respite for
the time being. But let tliem flot forget
tliat, they are feeding the lizard tbat will
continue to gnaw at their entrails.
And as far as the Governmen.t is concerned, i8 it flot in about tbe saine position?
The labour unions, urged by their Red wing,
sO to speak, say tu the Governinent: "'We
shaîl deal lightly with you, but'-yoe, there
is a "but"ý-"hut you will leaae pass thoe

want to. On the other aide of the line, if a
document such as I eited was brought to the
attention of the Government, deportations
would flot tarry. Why do you flot act?
Do you recolleet the miMions that we have
lost? Take only the case of the British
Empire Steel. I know it. The Boîshevists
acted as they did elsewhere-blowing up the
houses of the miners, burning, ransaeking the
mines, flooding themn with water. We paid
for that. Do we want the return of these
conditions? It ia for us to decide.
0f course we are relatively prosperous now,
and it is very difficu'lt for the red propaganda
ta be aggressive when timea are good, but the
fat cows will go, and the Jean cows must
corne, and in their wake the pack of Bolshevik
wolves will follow. Shalh we have pence when
prosperity goes? This is for you to say now.
If you do as they have donc in the States,
in England, in France, in Belgium, then we
shall have peace; but if you persistently close
youreyes, always fear even your shadow lest
you may suifer politicaïly, then when bard
times return, when work is acarce, whien
unemployment increases, and discontent also,
we will have a very rich red harvest from
what you are sowing to-day.

Sir Hienry has advised that his officers are

FERTILIZERS BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 72, an Act to amend the
Fertilîzers Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bull
was sent to the Committee on Agriculture
and was reported the day before yesterday
with a slight amendment to section 2. That
section reads as follows:
Section four of the sajd Act is further
ainended by inserting the following subsection
iînimediately after subsection seven thereof:"(8) If the applicant for a registration
number be non-resident in Canada, the application shahl be signed by a representative or
agent in Canada of the applicant as well as
by the applicant himself, and shahl contain an
undertaking by the agent or such representative
to be held responsible for due compliance with
the provisions of this .Act."
The Committee added alfter the word "applicant" the words "domicihed and resident in
Canada." This is to insure the permanency

of the agency.
from de Sahaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique), a

member of the Committee who happened to
he absent, bas suggested that thcre should
be a further addition to the clause to ensure
the maintenance of that agency. The honourable member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
bas the amendment.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I beg to inove that the following ho
added at the end of c]ause 2:
Unless sucb agency or a like agcncy be
miaioitainied registcred as above, the applicant
shail ease to have the right to imnport, seil,
or offer or liold for sale any fertilizer in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Would the hon-*
ourable gentleman explain the effeet of the
amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The clause bas
for its object the registration and the licensing
of any foreigner who desires to import
fertilizers into Canada,' in order that the
fertilizer may be controlled as to its real
value. The Committee bas added a proviso
that the agent of the foreigner should be
domiciled and resident in Canada. My bor4.
ourable friend no-w moves an amendment that
if the agent shall cease to do so the license
shall be cancelled. It is to make sure that
the Department will have someone who wil
be answerable for the quality of the fertilizer
thiat imay be imported.

LIQUORS BILL
READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND mioved the second
reading of Bill 192,' an Act respecting Interprovincial and International Trafflo in Intoxicating Liquors.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is not
the first time that I have risen in this Chamber to move legislation of this kind. I have
hiad perhaps some of my most strcnuous
hours during the last six years in dealing wit-h
this matter. This Bill provides that in any
Province where- there is in force an Act in
virtue of which it is unlawful te, seli or to
have in possession intoxicating liquors witiliout authority or permit of the Covernment
of the Province or of any Board, Commission,
or any other governmental Agency authorized
to issuîe or .grant such permit, it shaîl bc unlawful to import liquors otherwise than
ilhrough the governmental Agency, Board or
Comomission wvhich bas the control of the sale
of liquor in tie Province.
When I brought similar legislation to, this
Chamber before, it covercd, as far as ily
meinory carrics me. but the two Provinces of
Quebec and British Columbia.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Will the honourable gentlenian allow me?
I would draw the
attention of honourable gentlemen to Rule
17 of the Senate, which says:
If Senator4 have occasion. wliîen the Senate
s sittinig. to speak together, thîey go below the
Bai:ý othîerwise the Speaker stops the business

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend to my right (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
suggests that there may 'be a motion to nbolish
the Bar.
I was proceeding te state that when I had
brought similar legisiation to the attention
of the Senate, it was to cover mainly, if not
exclusively, two Provinces that had a monopoly of the -administration and sale of liqiior
tthroîigh a Commission.
The contention of
some of my honourable friends from British

Columbia at that time was that there was no
clear indication of the will of British Columbia
ta allow a complete monopoly to the Provincial authorities.
Since tiiet time the situation lias altered
considerably, and the example of Quebec
and British Columbia lies been followed by
I will nat name
severai1 other Provinces.
t-hem a.ll: I know tihat the Province in which
we sit ha&s adoptcd a Liquor Control Act, and
I do not know but that the Provinces of the
Middle Wcst have done likewise.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Hon. W. B. ROSS:

Yes.

And New Brunswick

also.

At the last InHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
terprovincial. Conference a wish was expressed
by the Prime Ministers of such, Province&-and
it was not opposed by the Prime Ministers from
the other Provinces-for sucli legislation as
would assure tliem of a complete monopoly
in the sale of liquor in their Provinces. Under
tihese conditions, backed. by tihe desire of the
Prime Ministers and Ministers who were at
the Interprovincial Conf erence, I move the
second rcading of ths Bull, which I hope will
be aocepted generally by ths Chamber as
being in accordance with the wish of the population of Canada at large. I need not go into
the details of the Bill. They are in practically
tihe same form as tihey were in the Bills which
failed of adoption three or four yeare ago
when the matter was taken up.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not risc to oppose
this Bill, but I would like ta, caîl the honourable gentleman's attention ta the fact that
thc somewhat strenuails corit-oversies that lie
had in this Hanse were mainly, I think, over
the cxport warehouses. There was sosnething
in tihe nature of a contcst, but not a very
bitter one, with regard ta a law in British
Columbia which allowcd private citizens to
iniport, based on the ground that there had
been somfe kind of pledge, given by thc provincial Government, that wlhen they got theïr

gentleman says, the whole situation lias
changed. A great many af tihe Provinces have
adopted government contraI af liquor, and
that being sa, I think probably it is dcsfrable
that this law shauld pass.
There is just anc matter I should like ta
cal1 ta my honourable friend's attention. It
lias ta do with the passage of liquor from

one Province to another. If the honourable
gentleman l-eft Montreal for Ottawa and
happencd to bring a flask of good whiskey
with him, when he came into Ontario he
would be importing; or if a man left Halifax
for Vancouver carrying a small quantity of
liquor, lie would be importing. I do flot know
how you are going to check that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
to check that.

There is no need

Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If he comes from. Halifax lic will have drunk

Not necessurily.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Temperate people won't do that.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: It might be wise to
put in some kind of an exception to permit
of a small quantity bemng carricd fromn one
Province *to ainother. This is flot a fanciful
thing. A woman who came liere from. Montreal, had a bottie of brandy, which she said
was for oooking purposes: it was taken from
lier by the autharities, and I do flot know
whetlher she escaped et fine or not. I do flot
know just how the honourable gentleman
can guard against that, but if some exception
were made, I think it would make the Act
more workable.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There should be
an exchange between wet Provinces.
Hon,. SMEATON WHITE: This last has
no reference ta beer, has it? It doe not say
so. It is oni-y inetoxicating liquors. I don't
think beer would come under this Act at ahl.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think that
under the Volstead Act beer is considered
alcoholie liquor, unJees it is under 2 per cent.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: I think the
interpretation liere of intoxicating liquors
wou-ld not apply to beer. I believe there is
an excliange of beer in tihe provinces both

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Honourable gentlemen, as I took some smüll part in the contraversy to which the honourable gentleman
referred, when 'legisiation somewhat similar to
this in cliaracter was before the House on
tbree previous occasions, I woul like to say
a word or two before this motion panes.
In the first place, as the honourable gentleman has very trudy said, conditions have
clianged. In the second place, as he wrongly
said, this legislation i.s flot the same as that
which was previously initroduccd, and wherein
it differs I will specify in a few moments.

Il-lu

SENATE

I may say this that ilegislation lias always
been originatod by the Attorney General of
the Province of Britishi Colutmbia and his
reason for asking for it was that he wisbed
to do away witli tlie export warehouses. He
wrote letters that we-re slanderoue, and almost
tragic, to his friends in office in Ottawa with
regard to the subjecet-imatter of this legisiation. He went so far as to suggest-I suppose
by way of carrying the majority of the Senate
with hitm at one time--that there was a fund
here which would be used for the purpose of
debaueching the members of this House so
that t.his legiàiation would be defeated. He
gave a state-nent to the press of Britishi
Cdlu.,mbia very shortly afterwards, in whieh
he suggeste-d that those members of this
House who voted against this Iegislatirn were
in effect, if flot actually, guilty of twc
murders that took place in soine kind of a
1
hi-jacking, or .rusn-running row. From this it
can lie seen that lie f oit very keenly and very
qtrongl.v on the subject, and lie always took
the grotund that lie wanted the legiglation iii
order to put the export wareliouses out of
business, and thlereby stop rusn-running and
bootlegging.
We took the ground at that time that lie
did flot need the llegislation in order to
attain the resuit whicli he professed to desire.
We showed; by the answe- from t.he different
dcpart.mentýý, and by the circular of the
Department of Customs, that the declired
policy was tiat no export bonded wareliouse
would be licensed unilýes by the consent of
the Aftornev-General of tihe province wherein
the wareliouse was eituated. We showed t.hat
at the very time lie was agitating for this
legislation, and doerying the ovils of the
export bonded warehouso, lie was, as a matter
of fact, giving bis consent to new licenses,
establisliing further bondod wareliouses, and
cons-enting to transfers and renewa]s of
licenses already in existence. I think we liad
as many as 26 consented to by thi6 saine party
in two or throo yoars
We showed that on
the very day that tlie letter expressing bis
fcars for thie political hon-sty and *mora]ity
of the niennibers of this bonou-raible body
icached Ottawa, lie-gave lis consent to the
isuneof more licenses for banded warehouses. Consequently, when lie pursued that
course of action we were very much inclined
te question lis sintcerity in saying that his
oblect 'n asking for this legislation was to
close up tliose warebouses.
The bonourable gentleman who leads tliis
Huse said that lis position was somewhat
inconsistont, and in order to pull the Attorney
Genera] out of the bole into which lie had

to the effeet tliat they had no legal right to
refuse those licenses, -notwitlisanding that they
bcd iilroatdv said that the v rould do so.
1 admit that the honourable leader, by obtaining that opinion, confused thbe issue to a
certain extent. However, we are indebted to
the present Minister of National Revenue for
tlearing up1that situation. bet-tuse 1 flnd that
at the last Provincial Conforenco the Attorney General of British Columbia again made
bis request, and on page 30 of the precis of
di.scussions in that confertee we find this:

In adîdition to that, notwithstanding the
opinion wbicli my honourable friend the
leader prodîîced so triumphantly on the last
occasion Mien this niatter was tip for discussion, flie Minister of National Revenue gave
an order of the Department. af tlie beg-inning
of tlie prescrit session, cancelling aIl the licenses, and giving, fbem until the lst of 'Marci,
I think it is, to get rid of their stock. This,
again, sliows the absolute inconsistency of the
Atforney General of the province of British
Columbia, and also of course. of the government liere, with regard f0 insisfing on putting
t hrough the legislation whieh they proposed.
Being of a charitable disposition, I have
rit-ver been ahle to fathom flic reason whv the
Attorney Genera! of Britisbh Columbia is asking for this legislation. M/e know wliat lie
told us, but under the circuîmstances we cao
liardly lie expeced to believe if. A comiparison of flic Bill before the House with Bill
209, w-bit-i was infroduced in 1925, will sliow
a very important difference. By the latter it
wvas possible for the Provincial Government
to play fast and loose. They liad provisions

and they could revive aIl the licenses the next
day, and of course give tliem, to tlieir political
friends.
That is aIl I wisli to. say in regard to the
Bill. I do not propose. tliat the Attorney
General of British Columbia should get away
witli tliis matter on a pions affirmation that
lie wanted to get rid of aIl of thue bodd
wareliouses; because those wlio oppose tliis
measure liave contended-and subsequent
events liave proven that tliey were riglit in so
doing-tist if lie had wanted at any time
within t.he hast ten yea.rs to do so, lie could
liave got rid of every one of those bonded
warehouees witlieut any legialation wliatsoeve<.
There is just another pliase of tliis Bill to
wliicli I wisli to caîl attention, and I propose
when tlie Bill is in Commîttee to. move an
amendment. It will be observed that clause
3 provides as follows:
3. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any
other Act or law, ne person shall import, send,
take or transport, or cause to be imported,
sent, taken or transported into any province
from or out of any place within or without
Canada, any- intoxicating liquor, etc.
I arn inclined to think tliat tliis Section
is unconstitutional. Section 121 of the B.
N. A. Act says:
"AIl articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from
and after the Union, be admitted free into each
of the other provinces."
Now, my honourable friend proposes by
this Bill to proliibit, we will say, tlie export
cf Ontario wines fromn Ontario into any other
province. We in British Columbia are ma.king
a wine that is very popular on the prairies
and for whicli we have a very large market.
It is tlie loganberry wine.
Hon. Mr.* CASGRAIN: Wliat is tlie alcohohie content?
Hon. Mn. BARNARD: It is an intoxicant
within tlie meaning of the Act. It lias just
as higli a percentage as the Ontario wine, and
rny lionourable friend pnobably knows, liaving
sampled it in a place net a hundred miles
fromn where lie is sitting, tliat it lias a very
decided kick to it.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Yes, about 15%.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: But I amn going to
argue that tliis House lias no juriediction or
no right ta pass a law prohibiting goods
manufactured in one province fromn entry
into another province. Therefone, wlien we
go into Committee on this Bill I will move to
strike out the wonds, "within or" in the 23rd
line of tliis clause, making the Bill effective
as far as gooda imported fromn eut of Canada
are concerned.

a province in the Dominion that lias flot a
law to the effect that liquor can be imported
into that province. If we are geing on the
presumption that those laws are ultra vires,
and this Bill is passed for the purpose of
legalizing them, that is another question:
Hon. Mr. LYNOR-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to draw attention to
the fact that a vast number of tourists corne
into Canada, travelling freiri one province to
another. It is said that some of those tourists
purchase liquor in one province and carry
it into another. Those people know nothing
about our law, and it certainly cannot he
the intention of the government to impose
thie penalties of this Act on persons who are
merely carrying a smail quantity of liquor
for their own constsmption. I imagine the
intention of this Bill is to prevent trade being
carricd on in opposition to th~e Government.
Now I propose to move in Committee, if the
Bill is constitutional, that we add to clause
3 this proviso:
Provided that this section shail flot include
any importations in less quantities than one
Imperial gallon by persons who have lawfully
purchased the saine in any province.
The suggesHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tion of my honourable friend would be welcorned by lis leader, who lias just suggested
that a citizen of Canada should flot be disturbed if lie carnies a small quantity of liquor
fromn one province to anotlier. But I do flot
know liow the suggestion will be welcomed
by tlie wet provinces. Tliey are self-contained, and very jealous of their own exclusive
jurisdiction. It would perliaps make the
law very difficuit of application, but I will
draw the attention of the Minister wlio lias
prepared this Bill, and of the Department
of Justice, to the question raised of tlie constitutionality of the Act, and we may take
it up wlien we go into Cornmittee.

1 arn sure that if my honaurable friends

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON:
It must
be remembered that in my suggestion there is
nothing involved as to the canstitutionality
of the Act. It is only to exempt persans irom
the Act who have lawfully purchased in one
province a small quantity of liquor ta carry

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Now I wauld suggest that if that law is intra vires af the
provinces, there is na necessity for this one.
Wbat is the abject? If a man cannat carry

fromn taking it ta the border?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

opinion as ta the value ai the palicy, because
if you apen the door only an inch yau may

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend allow me? Hie is aWaTe that a

successor nf the Grand Trunk, met in the
office nf the Minister of Railways on several
occasions, and the discussion lasted for some
weeks.
The conferen-ce was attended also
hy the representatives of the city of Toronto
in the Federal House. I made this proposition f0 the various parties: that ail the plans
submitted, togetiher with the plan inreluded in
the former agreement of 1913, sbould bo referred t0 an engineer whom the Minister of
Ra-ilways mighit namne, who would have
authority to look into aIl these plans and
propositions; he would have the co-operation
of the Engineer of the City of Toronto, the
Ohief Engineer of the Harbour Commission,
and the Chief Engineers of both railways; be
would proceed t0 Toronto, so as f0 be on the
grouind. and, after ho had fully investigated
the situation, would make a report, stating
definitciy what he proposed under the eircumstances as a solution.
It was fortunate for me, and I think it was
fortunate for the railways, the City of Toronto
and the Harbour Commissioners as well, that
we had in the employ of the Railways Depirtment then 'is Chief Engineer the presenit
Chief Engineer, Colonel Dubuc.
Colonel
Dulbuc isz ot onlv an eniinent engineer, who
did greaf war service, but is also a man of
great business a'hility. You cao readily understand that a man who possessed only the ongineering scientific skill could miake a mess
of that kind of job. He bad to deal with
four interested parties-I might say five, for
'he bad t0 deal also with the Government, because ,he Government had to supply the
Canýadian National's portion of the money.
Affer investigation Colonel Duhuc report cd
that he hid bis plans reýady. We called a
meeting thon in the Department of Raiiways
and Cana,s, and ail parties were represented.
They came to ai conclusion as f0 what plans
should be accepted.
They were the plans
of 1913, with certain modifications. The City
accepted dhe agreement, the Harbour Comnmission was pleased, hoth railways accepfed
it . and on behaif of the Government I accepfed if. A certain amount of money w-as
voted for the portion which the Canadi-an

how they finance thaf. Tbe City of Toronto

works, and the works are carried on really
by the Terminais Company. The two railway companies, the C.P.R. and the Canadian.
National, purchase the securifies of the Toronto Terminais Company at par; and the
Canadian National and the C.P.R. bave f0
have autbority to raise the money fer the
purchase of these securities. In 1924, affer
this agreement was made, if became necessary
f0 have legisiafion passed in order to give
authority f0 raise the cash f0 buy the securitics of fbe Toronto Terminais Company. The
amnount indicafed in fbe legislation of 1925,
following the agreement nf 1924, was for the
underfa.king of the Toront o Terminais Company, but business men can readily understand that once the work whicb properly came

to 1928 on the money invested in the stationi.
This extra amount, which is about $3,500,000,
is also included. Then, the work of the
Toronto Terminais Railway Company itseif,
I believe, will cost perhaps a million and a
haif more than lias been anticipated.
This Bill authorizes an increase froni

$7,000,000 to $10,500,000 in the amount of

dioubt it. If in years to corne there is an
arrangement made for the operation of these

or flot there would be a revenue, would
depend upon the value of their securities.
Up to the present time I cannot see how there

QUEBEC HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the scond
reading of Bill 214, an Act to, provide for a
loan Vo the Quebec Harbour Commissioners.
He said: Honiouraible gentlemen, when the
Quebec Harbour Board mnade application for
a vote of $10,000,000 in 1925, this amount was
to cover týhe first unit of the Wolfe's Cove
Terminals -as outlined fully in the estriate
presented at the time. That application was
supported by the Shipping Federation of

445

Canada, and by Sir Henry Thornton and Mr.
E. W. Beatty, Presidents of the Canadian
National Railways and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway respectively. The first unit consisted of aipproximateiy 4,M0 feet of quaywail, a grain elevator, grain galleries, sheds
and every other facility required Vo make a
flrst class terminal. On account of the vote
having been reduced Vo $5,000,000 a contract
was let by the Quebec Harbour Commissioners
covering the amounts of money voted, and the
work was started in October 1925. This contract called for the construction -of 2,666 feet
of quay-waIl and about 3,000,000 yards of
dredging.
In August 1925 tenders were called for this
work and seven of the la.rgest and best known
contracting finms in the Dominion put ini
tenders, the successful and lowe.st tenderers
being the Northern Construction Company
and General J. W. Stewart. This firm and
General Stewart are known the world over
as contractors, and the progress of this work
lias been very satisfactory and is being done
by people who understand their business
This contract wa-s let on the

As regards the following up of this work,

SENATE

The balance of the present vote, namely,
$2,840,000 is for additional improvements on
the Louise Docks, consisting of additional
grain handling facilities and some dredging;
the reconstruction of sheds and the sinking
of some cribs; $350,000 is to take care of
bonds sold to the publie by the Quebec Harbour Commission in 1898. $150,000 maturing
July lst, 1928, and $200,000 December lst,
1929.
Increased grain storage on the Louise Embankment is asked to enable the Commission
to take advantage of the new Il cent per
bushel rate from Port Arthur and Fort
William te Quebec.
Previous te the decision
of the Railway Board, which became effective
on September llth, 1927, a prohibitive paper
rate of 21 cents was quoted.
During the
course of the winter the Harbour Commissioners were obliged to refuse to accept grain
at the elevator owing to lack of storage
facilities.
The capacity of the grain elevator
at present operating is 2,000,000 bushels.
The
extension, to provide for the construction of
which an advance is requested, is strongly recommended by the grain interests.
The present book-keeping and accounting
system was introduer d under the Chairmanship of the late Sir William Price in 1912, by
Mr. J. Loonard Apedaile Chartered Accountant of Touche & Company of London, England, Nnw York and Montreal. Mr. Apedaile
is now the Financial Comptroller and Managing Director of Price Brothers & Company
Limited of Quebec.
The system adopted at
that time has not been changed in any particu!r; and the following outside audits have
taken place for many years past:-A monthly
audit by the firm of Auditors, Messrs. Morin,
Barry. Cote & Marceau of Quebec; besicles a
further audit every month by Mr. R. A.
Tibbitts, Inspecter of Harbour Commissions,
under authority of the Department of Marine
& Fisheries.
The audit of the officials of the
Department of Marine and Fisheries consists
of a thorough examination of the works conpleted and investigation of those in progress.
No monies, the advance of which is authorized
by votes of Parliament, are paid over until
these officials are satisfied that they are being
expended in a proper manner, and that orders
in council have been passed authorizing these
payments.
During the past two years further
audits have been made; one under the authoritv of the Auditor General in 1926. and the
other during the Summer of 1927 by the Audit
Board.
I have felt it my duty te explain the safeguards surrounding the expenditure of this
money, because I know questions are being
raised throughout the country concerning the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

control of these Harbour Boards. This work
is being done by the best of contractors, and
at prices far below those of most of the
contractors who tendered. The company is a
solid one, having their principal place of
business in Vancouver, and the work is being
done in a thorough and satisfactory manner.
The through rate which has been fixed by
the Railway Board for grain coming te Quebec
will do much te develop that port; and it is
my hope and expectation that when the summer season closes arrangements will be made
to facilitate the movement of our grain down
to Saint John and Halifax. Although I am
not an expert, I have always felt that the
amount of money spent on the Canadian
National Railways in order to procure easy
grades should secure to that railway the long
haul from Winnipeg to the seaboard. Conditions were absolutely prohibitive up to the
time when the Railway Board decided to put
into effect a rate which I suppose will be
satisfactory te the Canadian National, and
which will give it a chance te carry considerable freight from Winnipeg te Quebec,
and later in the season te Saint John and
Halifax, instead of exclusively to the head of
the Lakes, where it is often diverted in too
large quantities to the United States seahoard
It is true that when Winnipeg sends
grain to Quebec, or farther east, it is an
export proposition; but surely there must be
at Winnipeg an easy selection of the grain
that is absolutely destined te Europe.
The port of Quebec was put under Commissioners in 1912 or 1913.
If we had
countintud to adininlster it from the Publie
Works Department, we would simply have
voted a sum te that Department for expenditure. I think that the administration of the
port is in safe hands, and that it is being conducted on orthodox lines.
I may also add what I said three years ago:
liat a considerable portion of the ocean
traffic must perforce stop at Quebec.
We
have had hardly any steamers exceeding
6,000 tons coming to Montreal, and there
have been seasons when the water was somewhat low and even those vessels could net
corne up te that city.
With these remarks, I move the second
reading of the Bill.
In case some questions should be put to me
calling for an immnediate answer, I would ask
General Tremblay to come to the floor.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not rise te oppose
this Bill. All the information we have had
from the honourable gentleman on the other
side is satisfactory.
It seems that a very
careful audit is made of expenditures. The

MAY 4, 1928
public will be giad to have the honourable
gentlernan's assurance upon that.
But there are thrce harbour Bis here, and
I arn going ta have something to say about
Halifax Harbour when the Bill reiating ta it
cornes Up.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Unfortunateiy
rny honourable friend cannot increase the
arnount.
Hon. W. B. ROS& It would be very satisfactory, however, if we had a schedule of Vhe
tolls and charges on ships, and cargoes entering
and leaving the port of Quebec. For instance, 1 have heen told, and I do not suppose there is any dispute about it, that the
Harbour Cornrnissioners of Quebec ever have
paid interest upon these loans, and probably
never will. The sarne probably is truc of
sorne other harbours. But 1 arn told there is
a reason for that, narnely, that irnrigrants
who land at Quebcc and are distributed
throughout the country frorn there pay no
head charge. I amn told aiso that at Ellis
Island, New York, there is a head charge of
$5. It can easily be seen, if 100,000 imrnigrants a year carne into Québec, that at $5
per head they would produce a pretty handsanie revenue. It is useless, however, ta give
people rnoney and expeet theni ta pay interest
on it unless you aiso give thcrn power ta
collect toits or charges. Practicaliy, what
you have at Quebec is a national port: the
whoie country pays for it. I think it only
fair that a clear statement should be made in
that regard, in order ta show the task set for
the llaxbour Conirissioners. I do nlot know
whether therc is an expert charge or any
charge on grain going through that port.
I arn told that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it is the sarne rate as that charged in Montreal.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There must be avaitable a table of the rates and charges. I woutd
like to sec that. Further than that. I would
like the figures of the total amount of interest on the bonds outstanding, and the
yearly receipts at Quebcc. They cdlct sornething. 1 would thiiik that the Quebcc Gommissianers thernselves could malce such a
staternent, which would be very satisfactory
for the public to have. There may be such
a thing, but I have nlot happened ta sce it.
I would like ta get further information.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: As I was born
in the city of Quebec, I arn rather farnuliar
with the port there, and I rnay say that I
firmly believe that in the net very distant
future Quebec wiil be able ta take care of its
interest. As I said ini t-his House the other

447

day, cargo vessels will be drawing 35 feet
of water before long, anad it wiil be out of
the question for such boats ta go up te
Montreai without tremendous expense.
Besidks that, since the C.P.R. stearners of
14,000 tons have been piying between Canada
and Liverpool, the big passenger steamer>
have neyer gone beyond Quebec, and it is
found that a weckly service can be carried
on with three of thase large and expensive
steamers, whereas if they went ta Montreai
the cornpany would require four stearners.
This rnakes an enorrnous difference in cost. It
is the aid story of big ooean vesseis navigating
in restricted water, besides the delay tjhat rnust
be caused by fog, týhe dangers ta passengers,
and ail that. I rernember not long ago that
at sundown the steamers had ta lie at anchor
until dayiight, in order ta prateet their insurance. 1 do not know if that is going an
yet. Though the channel is rnagnificentiy
lightcd, and apparently it is easier ta go down
the river at night than in daytirnc, they cannlot safely navigate late in the fali, or if there
is a littie blizzard. The large C.P.R. steamers,
in order ta be able ta niake a weekiy service,
have to turn around at Quebec, and thus thcy
can maintain the service with three ships instead of four.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But that alone wouid
nat pay interest an those boaks.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: No, but speaking
about interest on bonds, I arn nat aware that
Halifax harbour ever paid any interest on
its bonds, or St. John cither.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
ing ta that.

They arc coin-

lion. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 think perhaps it
wiii be a close race with Quebec, but 1 think
Quebec will bc able ta pay interest on its
bonds in the near future, because the big
ships I have mentioned and aise the 25.000
ton ships wiil pay harbour dues. I rnay say
that the honourabie niember for Stadacona,
(Hon. L. C. Webster) had a 24,000-ton ail
tanker corne in ta Quebec recentty, but that
ship would find it very difficuit ta get up
ta Montreai.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Are they not deepening the channel froni Qucbec ta Montreat
ail the Lime.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, but unfortunately the channet beiow Montreai has
been lowered one foot on accounit of the
Chicago Drainage canal, aithough oniy si-,
inches on the lake&--I cannat explain why.

Sips are now Ioaded up to the very la.%t
inch, and they are flot 35-foot boats. They
have tried to get a 30 foot channel, but I
think in ordinary water the channel is only
26 feet.
Hon. W. B. RO(SS: ýI amrn ot complaining
about Quebec flot paying interest on its bonds.
They cannot pay unless they made charges
which would enable thern to pay; and they
could do that if the country did flot insist on
things being done for nothing. With regard to
Halifax, that port would lie in exactly the
same position, and either one of two things
wjll happen: either there will be no interest
paid on the bonds, or the harbour of Halifax
wiîll be sealed against the littie t.rade that it
now bas.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourahie

for elevation, 4/10t.hs of a cent Per bushel,

only as good as the weakest or smaillest port'on, the ne.ck of tjhe bottie, so to speak; and
it is incumbent upon this country to0 have
complete facilities for free movernent of the
world exports at our own expense.
The provision of those facilities is a matter
that is to be properly charged to the country
a.s a who]e, and not, to a particular part of the

sequent.ly I take the view that lias been puit
fo ward liv loti leaders, that in accepting
this assistance, Quebec becomnes a national
port. and it.s progress and developrnent liecorne a great benefit to ail parts~ of the
country.
Consequently I arn in favour of

improve the

facilities of those ports. and put ourselves un
the position of being able to take care of a-Il
Illat we have to export. We shall not lie free
from the charge of indifference, and we shai
not rid ourselves of thbe complaint fliat a good
deal of our valuable export goes to the United
States in the matter of grain, until we can
say that we are actually able to handîn ai
that we, have to export.
Then, liaving d.eclared rnyself favourable to
the expenditure on the national port, the next
question that arises. and that bas been touc hed

General Tremiblay, an engineer of repute and
distinction, a young man who, will prkbabl-y
grow up with this wark; and I arn very glad
ta be able ta support thia mieasure, as one
coxning from the very interior of the country,
as reanote as one may weÀI be from the place
where our exporta leave our counitry to iro
into conipetition with tihe rest of the world.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I thin-k it would be extremely interaý,ting if the honéou-rable leader of the governnment wou'ld furnish us with a few more fact9
in connection with thie proposed loan ta the
Harbour Comnmissioners of Quebec. I for one
would be very glad ta know the amount of
wheat and other grain that has been exported
fiom the port of Quebec. I think that about
a year or two ago, when this matter camne up
in this House, tihere was a ioan of five and a
haif millions of înoney to the port of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII: Five millions.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: On that occasion it
was shown that an infinitesimal amount of
grain had been exported from that port; that
the Harbour Commissionere of Quebec were
in arrears, even so long ago as that, to the
extent of same $8,000,000 for interest. Could
nat the hionourable gentleman furnish us
with information as ta how mucb more
public money is ta, be poured into this port
of Quebec? Are we ta assume naw that, if
granted $8,500,000, this will be the end of it?
Or is the honourable gentleman going ta make
a demand for another $80,000,000 or W4,00)0,000
of the people's money, for wbich. they are so,
heavily taxed? We have had this matter
before the people of Canada for the last 20
or 30 years.
1 remember that in the old- days, when the
Transcontinental railway was firat placed before
the people, the governinent enlarged upon -t'he
fact that that scheme would mnake a great port
at Quebee. But 8200,000,000 of the people's
nloney was expended on the transcontinental
railway, having in view the fact that this
railway was going ta carry goods down ta -the
port at Quebec, and t-hat that port was going
to be a great place for export trade.
What is the position 'to-day of the port of
Quebec in coinparison ta the port of Montreal?
How much grain is carried froin the port of
Quebec, and how much from. the port, of
Montreal? Any one who looke at the figures
is amazed,. Let me assure the honourable
leader of the Government that this is a dream
in which he is now ýindulging. about making
a great port at Quebec. The late Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, for whose memory 1 have great
respect, stated when he built the transcon-

tinental railway that he would have a freight
rate of six cents a bushel froin Armstrong to
Quebec. How many years ago was that? The
railroad was built at the expense of the people,
and was there ever a rate 0f six cents a bushel?
The lowest rate they ever put on, I think,
was 23 cents a bushel. Now, I understand the
honourable leader of the Govemmaent states
that he is going ta get il cents, and he is stil
going ta niake a port at Quebec.
Wit.h ail deference to the honourable gentleman, I think he is indulging in an idle dreain
After all the money that has been poured in
there, and the railways that have been huilt 1
cannet see that he has made a great success
of t.he port of Quebec as part of the Dominion,
and I doubt very much whether he will ever
do so.
I thindc tibe c'ountry is entitled ta, the
figures I have mentioned, and 1 believe they
will furnish us with a great deal of information.
Let us know the amount of grain that ia being
shipped into the port of Quebec, the amoi.mt
of money that has been spent on that port,
and the amount the govern.ment still expect
to spend hefore they can realize that dream
in which they have so long indulged, of
makîng Quebec the great port 0f the Dominion.
I think we are entitled ta these facts, and that

if we had flot appointed a commission in Quebec, but had advanced the money te the
Public Works Departmcnt to expend, thc
questions as to the administration, and tlhe
balance one side or the other. would flot arise.
We advanced, say, £25.000.00 to the port of
Halifax through the 'Publie Works Department, but nobody raises the question every
year as te how this moncy wvas spent, and as
to the return. we are getting. There are expenditures that can oiýy produce returfis wohen
tbey are completed.
W e are througb witb the expenditure for the
equipment of this port at Quebec. When
tbe amouint wbich is asked is expended there
is the assurance that we wvill have berths for
six large ocean steamers, plus two lake
freigitcrs. Besides, we will have the moving
of grain from W'innipeg to Quebec. Su far

*Hon. ,Mr. DANDURAND:- The hope of the

it lias apparently been necessary to ship via

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The revenues of

Hon. Mr. ROSS: They were 8678,000 in
1926; so they are still going up.
Hon. JOHN McOORMICK: I think we
should flot be toc, critical of the improvemente that are propoeed for a port like
Quebec, or a port like Vancouver, St. John,
Montreal or Halifax. One of the reasons wby
there was flot more grain sent over the Transcontinental to Quebec was tbat the rate was
about 21 cents. Now the Tate is il cents.
Quebec is an ocean port with any quantity
of wa'ter. The railway from Winnipeg to Quebec bias a grade t-hat is, I amn told, for the
distance, far better than any other grade in
North America.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Tbat is right.
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: One of the purposes for which that line was built was ta
enable us to ship the produets of this country
out by our own ports, and, sa far as possible,
to have goods corne into the country through
our own ports and over our own lines. There
seems to be no doubt as ta thbe good resuits
that will follow if the line from Winnipeg is
put into condition and facilities are provided
which are lacking now for the handling of grain
at Quebec. So favourable is the grade that
engines can haul freigbt on that line from
Winnipeg more easily than freight can be
hauled a similar distance anywhere else in
North America. Not only la that line of
great importance to Quebec, but it helps considerably in meeting the transportation requirements of the country and enabling us ta,
have our produce carried at a reasonable rate.
As a Maritime man I would like to see no
obstacle thrown in the way of this project,
whicb I think is quite feasible and would be
advantageous to carry out, and I trust that
the neoessary moneys will be voted to provide
facilities at Quebec for the handling of the
business. You have there an ocean port
where fia dredging is required. I do not wish
to make an extravagant statement, but I will
say that the Port of Quebec will compare
favourabIy with any. It is a splendid ocea
port. If you are ta have a larger quantity
of the produce from the central part af
Canada shipped over your own limes, Quebec
la the port ta, which it should be sent, because
of the saving in distance; and the distance ta
the maritime ports of Saint John and Halifax
is very littIe farther than Portland. I mention that because I expeet that in the near
future, flot only will you build up an im-

portant business at Quebec as an export point,
but with the taking over of the Saint John
Valley Railway, buiilt with a grade similar to
that of the Transcontinental, you will have
a uine extending from Winnipeg to Saint
John for the shipment of goods in the winter
time. If you extend the shipments down to
Saint John we shall be pleased indeed, and
you will be lessening the quantities of our
goods that are sent out througb foreign ports.
We have flot so many ports of our own t.hat
we should be too critical about any proposais
for theïr development.
So far as interest on the money is concerned, Montreal is the only port that will
earn interest, but I thînk that the money
invested in the Port of Quebec will be quite
safe if the affairs of that barbour are well
iinaged. But even if other ports than Montreal are flot in a position to pay the interest
on the money we should flot be too critical.

reason, I might say ta the honourable gentleman who was discussing the matter the
other day, that in the autumn, for the benefit
of the grain praducers, even American ships
are alawed ta bring cargoes of grain to
Canadian ports, to be held there in starage.
If that were nlot allowed there would be
millions more bushels of grain kept in the
elevators west of the great lakee. It is an
intricate question.
May I mention

the honourable gentlemen.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAH.AM: -if I do not
talk it out or do something af that kind.
There is this difference, as referred ta by my
honourable friend from Colchester (Hon. Mr.
Stanfleld): the Publie Works Department bas
not expended much maney on the Harbour
of Halifax. In years gane by, Halifax Harbeur wau really controlled by the aId Intercolonial Railway, and through the Intercoloni-al
Railway vote this harbour wae maintained
and improved. I think aIl will agree that,
while in its time that was perhaps a good
way, it was, not the best way for the development of the harbour at Halifax. Men an
the ground, men who are in continuous touch
with shipping, inward and outward, are in the
hest position ta know what is required in
order ta meet the conditions that exist. Some
years ago I suggested to saine representatives
from Halifax that 'they should have their
harbour placed under a Commission. It was
thought at that time by those gentlemen thatthis would not be the hast thing te do; and
one can readily understand tihat, because al
that was required in order ta get anything in
reason for Halifax was an item in the Intercolonial Railway vote.
Saint John was in the same position, and
between the C.P.R. and the C.N.R. and the
Public Works Department there was not wbat
miglit be called a concerted movement in one
direction for the improvement of the Saint
John Harbour. I believe the Commission
will be the best thing for Saint Johin Harbour.
Interest bas been mentioned. Just here I
want,to pay a compliment ta the management of the Montreal Harbour. The Mont-

real Harbour Board is prabably the only one
that pays interest reguiarly. That part, hawever, bas the advantage of a remarkable situation, and it bas been able ta wark up a tremendous trade, expert, as well as import. In
the old days I sat up many a night putting
tbrough votes of maney for Halifax Harbour
and the Intercolonial Railway, on which we
neyer got any interest whatever. The money
was expended at that time ta develop tbe
Harbour of Halifax, and ta improve the conditions under which Canada wauld do ber
trade. The same is truc of tbe Saint John

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHA'M: I would bardly

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Not at ail.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Intercolonial did some work in the Harbour in my
time, but it was nat extensive. I will not
argue, bowever, but will agree that the Public
Works Department did it. In any event, it
was the Government that voted the money,
and no return was expected except in benefits ta navigation and ta the trade of the
country. The question is niat one of whether
interest will be received an the expenditure
or nat, but whether it is a good thing ta do,
and whether the money given ta these Commissioners is properly expended. Every cent
you charge, either inward or outward, cames
out of somebady's pocket, and I arn not sure
that it is nat in the interest af the people
of Canada that we Bhould all bear this expense and get the benefit in ather ways. If
the Harbour oan pay, Bo much the better;
but it is no argument against the Halifax or
Saint John Harbours ta say that they cannot
pay the interest, and I arn flrmly convinced
that the proper way ta handie the affaira of
t.hose Harbours is througb Commissions.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Is it a fact that
the Harbour of Montreal pays its interest.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes. It is a
wonderful Harbour and, in addition ta the
expert of grain, an enormous business passes
through it from aIl quarters of the world.

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

second reading of Bill 216, an Act to provide
for a ]on to the Saint John Harbour Commissioners.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the members of this Chamber know that this Harbour
Commission was created last year upon the
recommendation of the Duncan Commission.
The Harbou-r of Saint John belonged to the
city of Saint John, and tihe harbour properties were trsnsferred to the Commission, the
total consideration for the transfer amounting
to 82,135,118.00, payable as folilows: an existing bond indebtedness of the city, amounting
ta $1,467,164.96, incu.rred in the developmenit
of the Harbour, to be taken over by the
Harbour Commissioners; the balance of
$367.953.04, to be paid to the city in Harbour
Cc-mmissioners' bonds. The bonded indebtedness taken over by the Commission and
the new bonds issued to the City in the above
consideration are to be guaranteed by His
Majesty both as to principal and interest.
Thc valuation of the property to be taken
over by the Commissioners was calculated as
follows: Value (if structurets-piers, wharves

entire prograirm of harbour improvements contemplated by the Commissioners, total8
$10,000,000 which was ta provide new works
to the north of the present wharves between
No. 7 pier and Navy Island, and contemplated
the oventual construction of two new piers
and an-3 quay wal.l, each 1,250 feet long,
providing additions! accommodation for ten
vessels.

The initial development proposed with the
loan n0w asked for will provide berthing space
for four ve.asels loading general cargo and twa
vessels loading grain, and includes the necessary dredging ta provide basins and a channel
of 30 feet at bow water, to be increased to ' 5

feet should it 'later be found necessary. There
will also be provided a neiw grain elevator,
with a capacity of 2,400,000 buebels, wîth grain
conveyor galieries connecting with two of the
new berths. T.he new shipping berths wiil be

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: 1 suppose iaformation as to the amount of grain that went

Hon. Mr. DANTEL: The amount ofgrain
that passes through Saint Johin varies from
year to year.

MAY 4, 1928
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But it la increasing?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It increases in some
years and decreases in others. I do not tbink
there bas been as much grain geing through
the port this year as there bias been in some
previeus years. Two or tbree years ago about
19,000,000 bushels were transported througb
that pert; this year I. tbink there bas been
net quite se mucb. It may ha that when
that tbing bappens that my henourable friend
froin Sydney (Hon. Mr. McCormnick) spoke
of, and wben the Transcontinental la used to
the extent that was intended w'ben it was
built, the amount of grain coming down to
the Maritime Provinces will be very mucb
increased. As a matter of fact, the grain that
comes to Saint John la brougbt there almost
entirely by the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and,
as I say, it varies frem. year to year-, according to the amount that la available and the
demand outside.
*',DURAND: Last autumn
Hon. Mr. DAN
w'ben I was on my way to Europe, I met
exporters wbo do a considerable trade witb
Canada, who inforined me that they were
located in Paris and Were buyîng for the
European and Mediterranean trade. I was
surprised to learn that they were buying grain
te be sbipped from the Georgian Bay ports
by rail to Saint John, and tbat tbey were
furnisbing tramp steamers te carry it. They
aise informed me that tbey bad ne fear
wbatever for the port of Saint John, provided
it had preper facilities and seme advantages
in railway freight rates. This seemed te me
te be a very bopeful indication of what can
be donc if we bestir ourselves a little. As
my rigbt bonourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) bas said, we must net say, "But the
freigbt is net there," but rather, "Let us provide the facîlities" and, if we de net ehatruet
the movement of grain te tbem, in due time
the ports ef Quebec, Saint John, and Halifax
will develop.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Wbat will happen when
the Hudsen Bay railway la built?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:

Don't werry.

I would like te
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
confirm what the henourable gentleman bas
said, and what was referred te by the hionourable gentleman freim Saint John (Hon. Mr.
Daniel), that the provision of tonnage and
of facilities is of tbe mest vital mement in
the development ef a port. The fact tihat
the C.P.R. ships more freigbt than the Canadian National froin the port of Saint John
1illustrates the point perfectly. The C.P R.

- %foc

bas its steamers coming to Saint John, and
the dates of sailing are fixed montbs ahead,
and their traffic people 'have to get their
proportion of the grain to Ioad their steamers
in a manner to make themn seaworthy. If
you get steamers comihg to«a port you will
develop that port.
I have had occasion to look into the question of the development of ports. No enterprise bas been undertaken at any of the ports
of Europe that has net brought develepment. Outstanding cases on the Continent
are Antwerp and Rotterdam, and in England
the New Quay at Liverpool. Liverpool fought
bard against the building of the Manchester
Ship Canal, but it was finally built, a.nd was
a splendid development and earned meney.
Nevertheless, Liverfpool, which increased- its
facilities for trade, developed to an even
greater extent than Manchester. Se I feel
that if the money that is spent in these ports
is spent with intelligence and vision and
economy we will be quite justified in passing these votes now and whatever others may
be neceary in the future.
Hon. Mr. STANF'IELD: While grain is
a very important item, and constitutes a great
part of the tonnage shipped, we must not
]ose sight of other goods. For insta~nce, we
export I don't know how many carloads of
automobiles to Australia. Several times this
winter when I was in Halifax I was surprised
at the number of carloads waiting there for
shipment by steamer. Furthermore, if we
can develop more tonnage apart from grain,
the railroads will have higher earnings.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time, and passed.
HALIFAX HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND READING POSTPONED
On the Order:
Second Reading Bill 217, an Act to provide
for a loan to the Halifax Harbour Commissioners.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I may say to the honourable gentleman that I propose to move
an amendment to this Bill. Perhaps hie would
let it go over until Monday night. The purpose of the amendment ha to carry out what
seems to be the stated intention of the Gevernment with regard to Halifax Harbour,
namely, that there shail be no increase in
the toîls and rates and charges. The Bill as

456

SENATE

it is leaves it open to the Commissioners to
fix tolls and charges. and they have power
to increase them. If that is fo be done, it
ought to be done by Parliameot.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I draw the
attention of my honourable friend to the
incompleteness of the motion of which he
gives notice. We have nothing to indicate
what the rates are to-day.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There are tolls and
rates and charges in the Harbour. For instance, the Canadian National Railway simply
absorbs those. A ship cornes alongside and
pays harbour dues. I do not want to go inoa
the details at present. There has been a
steady increase in shipping there, but if you
are going to change the whole law relatiug
ta the Harbour, you can very easily close
up the Harbour of Halifax, and it is one of
the few things about which the people of
Halifax are hopeful.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is the railway charge
on the aide, or where is it, at Halifax?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, it is part of the
freight. In other words, your port there is a
national port.
The Order was a]lowed to stand.
RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of Bill 220, an Act to ameod
the Railway Act.
He said: Away back in the year 1909 the
Railway Act was amended to provide for the
protection of level railway crossings. It contajned several provisions. One was that a fund
should be set aside, I think $200,000 a year
for five ycars. It gave power ta the Railway
Commîssioners, where they deemed it accessary, to have a crossing protected, in the way
of a viaduct or any other way; ta hear
evidence in the premises; and to apportion
the cost of the elimin-ation of this railway
crossing, or its protection, between the municipality, the railway, and this railway crossing
fund. But the most that was to be taken
from this fund was nlot to exceed 20 per cent,
and this 20 per cent must not exceed $5,000.
The balance was to be divided between the
municipality and the railway company.
A few years later an ameodment was made
by which this amount was increased fa
$15,000. There ivas a proviso that not more
than six crossiogs should be elîminated under
this Act in any one miinicipality.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: At one time.
Flon W. B. ROSS.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: At one time.
That was to prevent a large city making an
application to have six or a dozen crossings
clirninated, which might exhaust the entire
fund for that year. It was also pravided that
only one appropriation in any one year cou!d
be made for the elimination of any one crossing.
I might add that there was a definition -as
to what a crossing meant. I cannot give it
in technical terms, byut it included nat morethan four railway tracks, if I remember correctly, and it also provided ooly for steamn
railways. In this Bill that is changed to any
number of tracks, and steam is not specified;
it cao apply to a railway propelled by electricity.
In 1919 the Act was further amended, and
provision was made for a vote of M200000 a
year for a term of ten years. The amount to
be drawn from this fund was not ta exceed
40 per cent of the entire cost of the elimination of the crossing, and could run up ta
$25,000.
Now, this Bill makes a few changes. In the
first place, I have indicated one or two of
tlîem. There is accumulated, or will be a
sum unexpended of about 32,600,000, up ta
the present time, or to the end of next year.
Io the Act of 1909 fia provision was to be
made for a crossing that had came into existence affer the year 1909, the date of the
passage of the Act, it bemng implied that
any crossiogs made after the passing of that
Act would he made at the risk of the railway
companies or the municipalities.
This Bill
provides that the fund may be applied to
the elimination of a crossing that has been
created sioce 1909, provided the railway and
municipality have corne to an agreement and
understandiog.
The amount that cao be voted is reached in
this way. Forty per cent can be drawn from
this fund if the cost be not over $100.000; but
if the cost be over that, the entire ainount
that can be charged against this fund must flot
exceed $100,000.
The last clause of the Bill provides for
notice. Previouslv notice was made by postiog up notices in the stations; this Bill
provides that notice must be given in the
Canada Gazette.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD

READING

Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the third
readiog of the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill

REPORT

OF

SPEOIAL

COMMITTEED

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT presented the first,
report of the Special Commîttee appointed
to consider the possibilîty of enlarging the
Gaiheries of the Senate.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Committee whose report I have just presented
had several sittings, attended, I think, by
ahI the members, who gave very serious consideration to the matter. We had the advantage, first of ahI, of submitting the wh'ole
matter to Mr. John Pearson, the architect
of this building. He asked for two weeks
time in order to fulhy consider the matter
and make a plan, and report to the Committee. Mr. Peaison returned Iast week, and
we h*ad the opportunity of going over the
ground and consulting with him. The resuit of our deliberations is the report which
1 have just put in. I have asked the Clerk
of the Commîttee to place in my hands,
along with the report, the different plans
whieh were submnitted by Mr. Pearson. I
should add at once that these plans had
previously been discussed with the Deputy
Minister of Publie Works and the Architect
of the Public Works Department. Mr. Fuller.

457

These gentlemen: attended ahl our meetings,
and when Mr. Pearson finally submitted these
plans, both these gentlemen were present and
said that they had gone over the matter in
detail with Mr. Pearson and thoroughly
agreed with him. So you have in this recomnmendation and in the plans accompanyîng it,
a scheme whîch has met with the approval
of the architect of the building, Mr. Pearson,
and the expert authorities of the Public
Works Department.
I will put these plans on the Table, and
any honourable members of the House who
wish to look at themn will be able to do so.

HALIFAX HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 217, an Act to provide for a
boan to the Halifax Harbour Commissioniers.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, we might
carry the second reading of this Bill now, and
if the suggestion mnade by my 'honourable
friend (Hon. W. B. Ross) hast week is not
simply a pious wish, and if he is stihi inclined
to move an amendmnent to the Bill, he might
do so in Conimittee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, I could make my
remarks in justification of my amendment in
Cornmittee perhaps better than at present. I
have no objection to the second reading, provîded I have an opportunity to move my
amendment.
I have already indîcated what
fine it follows: it is an amendment to provide
that the Harbour Commissioners shaîl not increase the existing tolîs and charges9 in Halifax

SENATE
Harbour; that if that were done it would lie
done by Parliament, and done next year, when
everybody who was intereýsted could be heard.
It is immaterial to me whether I explain my
case now or do it in Committee.
The motion avas agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
FEDERAL

DISTRICT
BILL

COMMISSION

SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the Pecond
reading, of Bill 218, an Act to amend the
Federal District Commission Act, 1927.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
deals with the improvements that have been
going on, more or less irregularly, since the
îîîreptiuzî of the Ottaw a Improvement Cominyision, which dates back to 1899.
This
Commission has donc very good work in the
beautifying cf our capital, and it bas had
the unanimous approval cf Parliament from
timie to time. 1 recalled some time ago the
.tf
iet cf Mr. Joseph Chamberlain that
lcqis!ation becamne national and permanent
wben it had the sanction net only of the
Party that initiated it, but also of the Party
it.
h-.výine- opposed it, found it on the
Statute Book wben they came into power, and
continued and used it. The Ottawa Improvement Commiission bas obtained that gencral
endorsation. for- I find that, thougb created
undpr the Laurier Government in 1899, it wvas
continuied by the Borden Governiment under
ebapter 62 of tîme statutes of 1919, wben it
Nxas enacted that the g-rant ta the Commission sbhould bc $150,000 annually for ten vears.
Inî 1927 this sum was increased te $250,000
fer sixteen years.
Wenow ask Parliamient te do two things:
piox'i(e for a capital payment cf $3,000,000
te clothe the- CommissÏon with the necessary
authoiity te puircbîse sorne rostiy property
in tbe verv centre of tbe city, and to reduce
the amount, voted last year, of $250,000 for
sixteen years, te $200,000 for fifteen years.
Since one year bas slready clapsed, the
.appropriation, thus redurced, w'ould cever the
same peried.
The reason given for the capital expenditure
amoimnting te $3»00.000, is the pressing niecessitv of taking advantage of the oppertunity
te purchase the Ruîssell property, whicb was
ibout Ie bo pulled down and replaced by a
large-r and more permanent edifice. I believe
tbat this desire of the Federal Government
te secure that property in order te increase
the brcadt-h of Central or Confedleration Park,
which is about te be created at the very
Hon, W. B. ROSS.

hub cf tbe city, avili commend it.self te tbi8
Cbamber. I confess that when I came te
Ottawa for tbe first time-and that was, at
ail events, before 1886-I felt that the Fathers
cf Confederation had perbaps lacked foiresig.ht and courage in net buying the land
extending te Sparks street and below, in eider
te afford perspective and breadth te tbe land
suiiountling and faring the Parliament BuildI am net disposed te turc that remark
iîlgs.
jute a conldemnation, hecause wo were then
four struggling provinces with îsmall budgets,
and I realize that tbe Fatbers cf Confederatien did make a noble effort je constructing
tlic buildings that wcrc erected on the Hill.
Now cur Dominion is developing from the
Atlantic te tbe Pacifie, and we have a Capital
supported by that vast area avhicb comprises
nine provinces, and we must bave the courage
ta do the needful if we would net leave ourselves open te condemnation by the generatiens that are te tollow.
Tbe Borden Government f elt similarly disposed when, in 1913, it appoînted a Comnmission composed cf His Worsbip the Mayor
cf Ottawa, His Worsbip tbe Mayor of Hul.,
Sir Alexandre Lacoste, K.C., cf the city of
Montreal, the retired Chief Justice cf the
Court cf Appeal; Herbert S. HoIt, cf the
cîîy of Moctreal; Frank Darling, cf tbe city
cf Toronto and R. Home Smith, cf the city
of Toronto; giving tbem the following comimission:
Tlo takze ail necessary steps te draw up andt
perfect a comipreliensive schemne or plan loeking
te the future growth and developuient cf the
city cf Ottawa sud tîme city cf Hmîl and their
env'irons, andI particiilarly provicling for tlîe
location, lay ing ont sud beautification cf parks
andi connccting boulevards, the location snd
architectural character of publie buildings, and
adequiste and ciaplete arrangements for traffic
and transportation within tme area iii question.
I have net read tbe report that that Comnmission made, but I understand that it is
quite comprebonsive and covers in part tbe
imprevements tbat are now submitted for
your approval.
I mention that tbe Parliament Buildings
and the departmental buildings te the rigbt
and te the lef t could net be seen and admired
by anyone looking from Wellington street,
and that provision sbculd bave been made for
a larger aiea of ground and park in front cf
b.e buildings. Now with the purchase and
tearing down cf the property I have referred
te, it will be possible, I understand te obtain
a splendid view cf the whole of Parliament
Hill aIl the' way from Laurier Bridge. At this
time, wben the cost cf property bas net yet
ieacbtd abnormally bigb figures, it is desir-

MAY 7, 192845
able ta secure the requisite properties, and
the Governrnent should be ernpowered fromn
year ta year ta buy properties in the vicinity
of the Parliament Buildings, and down past
Sparks street, as occasion offered. I believe
it would be a fairly good venture ta buy a
large area in front of these buildings. The
property so purchased would be carried by
the rentals which they now earn, and which
would gradually increase. It is sirnply au
ides that I have, but I arn quite sure that
property extending over quite a large ares
can be bought on ternis which would produce a clear net interest of fire or six per
cent. I have a conviction that if the state
did that, the generation that would have
charge of affairs £ifty years hence wauld
think that the men of this day really hiad
some vision.
With these remarks, I move the second
reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MoMEAN'S: Honourable gent-lemen, I have listened ta the honouirable leader
of the Government, and I regret that hie has
Mlot gîven, us a littIe miore information in
regard ta thig subject. He mentioned a susn
of about $3,000,000, but 1 understand front
the debaie .which occurred in another place
that the amount was estirnated at 39,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The $9,000,000
oomprised the capitalization of the annual
grant of 8200,000 for 15 years.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.: Be that as it may,
this measure is going to cast thlis country an
immense sumn of ntoney, and though I arn
flot a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, I
ventture to 'predict that before thîs contemnplated expenditure is ended there will be a
debt placed on this country of no boss than
320.000,000; and 1 wan't to enter my protest,
humble though it niay be, againait this expenditure of public money -in the present state
of the country. We are to-day groaning under
a burden of taxation so, great that it has
paralyzed our industries and is driving our
people into otiher countriees. We have spent
many millions in inducing people ta corne ta
this country; we have huilt railroads in the
we4t. ah'most ta the door of every farm. According ta a staternent made in anoîther place,
the railroads have cost in the neighbourbood
of 32,500,000,000.
We have piied millions
upon millions of dollars in ocean. ports-Queber. Montreal, Halifax, St. John, Vancouver,
and Port Arthur.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hudson Bay.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:- Sa far there is no
port theTe, and the millions have flot been
poured into Hudson Bay so, far, but tbey
prdbably will be. Ail thooe vast surno of
rnoney have been expended in this country
for the purpose of attracting immigration.

I arn toid that sornething like $10,000,000 a

year has been spent on immigration, taking
into consideration, the amxounts spent by the
Dominion, the different provinces and the
various rajîroade.
We have advertised
throughout the world the advantages of thds
country---our great wealth in fisheries, forest,
mines, agricultural lands, electrical energy,
etc., ta, induce people to corne to this
country; but why is ail this immense wealth
poured out for that purpose when we
have not- been able ta retain the population
that we get?
I suibmit that the real reason, for this atate
of affair8 i.s the immense taxation that the
people of this country bear. Everything we
wear, everything tihat enters into the life of
the people, is taxed to such an extent that it
is a'lmost impossible for an ordinary man
or woman to make bath ends meet.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: That is protection.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No, I arn n-ot talking
about protection. Take the case of *a
manufacturer: suppose hie has a factory in
Toronto, and he manufactures a pair of boots
that cost him $5; hie has ta pay an incarne
tax to the Dominion and an incorne tax to
the city. He sells those boots ta a jobber,
and the job'ber hias to pay an incomne tax to
the Dominion and an incarne tax ta the city.
The jobber in tutu sel9q thern ta a retailer,
say in Winnlipeg, and in that city the retailer
pays an incarne tax ta the Dominion and
another ta the province. Therefore, on that
one pair of boots there are six taxes levied
by the country. It is the saine in regard ta
clothing and food. Na matter where people
go, what they require-fromn a. doctor, a
dentîst, or in the way of cl-othe&-the peaple,
froin infancy ta old age, rouet bear this
immrense burden of taxation,; and until that
burden is lightened we can neyer hope for
any great proSperity in this country.
The other day it was stated on the floot of
this House that between 32,000,000,000 and
$3,000,000,000 haïve been put away in the
savings batiks because the people were afraid
ta invest it in any industry or commercial
enterprise, on account of the great taxation.
I know of cases in which, where 'the capital
stock of loan companies has been held on the
other aide of the water, the rnaney has been

SENATE
withdrawn from this country, solely because
of that immense taxation.
We know that excessive taxation produces
excessive expenditure. If this expenditure is
continued as it has been going, the bu.rdens
wiil bp so great that the people of this country
will be reduced, like the Egyptians of old, to
making bricks without straw.
I could take myr honourable friend out
througha the provinc of Manitoba-and that
province is no exception-and I could show
him district alfter district where the munîcipa]ities cannot pay their debts, solely because
the farmers who owned the lands were obliged
to let them go at sales for taxes. Municipalities acquired ail those lands on account of
that huge taxation and the high cost of living
that bas placed the owners of property in
that position.
I do flot know very much about this proposition for the city of Ottawa; but I do
know tbat we are going to involve ourselves
in a large expenditure of money for what is
unnecessary at the present time. I would
like the honourable gentleman to informn this
House at whose request, and on what grounld,
tbis expenditure is being made. It was not
at t.he request of the people of the city of
Ottawa. If a vote wvere taken in the city I
venture to say it wouid be a.gainst this proposition. The honourable gentleman laughs;
but bas he inquired of the citizens? Has he
talked it over with the people who pay tbe
taxes in the city of Ottawa? Let him do that,
and he will find that there is a very different
opinion prevailing even in this city as regards
this proposed improvement.
The governiment goes into the business district, in the beart of this city, a.nd tears. down
immense buildings, for what purpose?
To
inakc a park there. Is il for recreation purpose-s? Is it to give people fresh air? Will
it be of any' benefit at A except, as the
honouraule gentleman savs, that it may afford
a view of these parliane nt buildings from the
bridge croseing the Rideau canal? Tbat is
the onlv reason I can ascertain for wbich the
honourable gentleman is going to incur this
enormnous expenditure. The other day I asked
the question about tearing (lQwn the Russell
House, and thec reply wvas that it would cost
$1.100,000; but 1 now understand that ail tbe
buildings clear do-%n f0 Laurier Avenue are
to be (Iemolislhed for the purpose of providin- a view of the parliament buildings. That
mîlglit be ail righit if the treasury of this
country were in such a condition that we could
afford to dIo it; but I sas' there must bc a
pause; thece must be somne retrencbment in
the expenditure of the public money if tbis
countr 'v, becausF.e the people are now bearing
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

a bîirden which it is almost impossible for
the") to bear.
IL niay be that the very
wealth 'v people can affiord to pay the incomie
fax wvithout feeling it, but the cost of securing the necessaries of life bears so heavily
upon the people that I pi utcet ggainst tlie
exf)en(liture of this nioney aI the present time.
The debt of the country is immense, and
il we take into) consideration the monev that
iliust be advanced to the Canadian National
Railwavs this vear it is not being decreased,
while the expenditures are inereasing. I understand that the eost of carrying on the
Goveromient will be $8.000.000 extra tbis year;
and ot. the sligýht-est attempt is beisig miade f0
decrease tbe co.-t. The Departments aie nîultipl.v ing.
If we compare the numi-aber of
rented buildings in Ottawa in 1914 with those
rentrd hy the flovernment to-day we find
soiehing like 13 or 14 buildings then. and
against 58 to-day,%.
Rentals now being paid
mn Jttawa ainount to between $700,000 and
$7.0.000 a vear.
There i:s no irnncdiate necessity that I eaui
find for starting on the expenditurc proposed
by Ibis Bill-no reason ut al]. Ottawa bas
been livre since 1867; it ýis a beautiful cify;
nature lia, placed it in sucb a position that
if, îîatural beautv is prohably flot equalled
hY anY place in Canada. probably flot anvhreiii Aimerica,
Yet the Governiient
bought a lot of property adjoining tbe I)ust
office. and from the debates 1 bave read I
understand tbat tbey are going to spend
$30,000 in pavinz fhe space oeccupied by tbe
buildings that bave been tomn dowvn. They
.4tart off with $3,000,000, and if the honouýrable
gentleman and I live long enough I think
hie wîlI adlmit to me, in years to conue. that
I was quite rîght wben I said Ihat $3.000.000
wvould avind up wifb about $20,000,000.
I
think they will flot get off even with that
a ni olin t.
I have notlîing more to say except that with
flie heavy taxation on the people at present
t he oidinarv man cannot afford to bave a
fainîly ut al. because on account of the cost
of living he is not able to inake both ends
îîîeet. W7itb tlîis hiige debt hanging over us,
I dlaim that it is a very poor time to start
ont on large expenditures like those proposed
in tbis Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlimien, the last speaker mentioned somne matters
fluat were entirelv irrevelevant to the niattrr
under discussion. H1e spoke of the two or
three billions that lie in the savings bank at
tlie mioment because the people were afraid
of taxation: but the bonoumable member for
Toronto (Hon. Sir Edwamd Kemp) told us

MAY 7, 1928
the other day that that was flot the reason at
aIl. Those gentlemen ought to tune their
fiddles so as to play the saine tune. The
other honourable gentleman said it was because they did flot have enough taxation that
ail this money was kept in the hank; that
there ivas no stability of tariff; that we should
have a higher protective tariff, and then this
money would caine out of the hank and build
up factories, and we would see tait chimney,belching smoke in the blue sky.
Hon.
Mr. SCHAFFNER:
Honourable
gentlemen, before the motion is put, the
protcst I want to enter is that I think the
Governinent, or the leader in this House.
should give us soine information before we
proceed any further with this Bill. I woutd
tike to know the power of the Federal District Commission, also who they are,' and if
they can buy a building for 81,125,000 without
the matter heing submitted to Partiament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is quite easy
to answer my honourable friend, ,because this
Bill is a reproduction of the Act which hie
himself voted for in 1919.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:

I beg pardon?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I say the Bill
which I have covers atl these matters. It
is an amendinent to the Act of 1927, and I
think my honourable friend wilt sec that thiý3
Act of 1927 reproduces word for word the
clauses of the Act of 1919. So that we have
uniform legistation governing that body.
There shall be a Commission to bie called
"the Federal District Commission," consisting
of ten members. of whom fine shall be appointe<t by the Governor in Councîl and shall
hotd office during pteasure and at least one of
whom shahl be a resident of the City of Hult.
One shait bie appointed by the Corporation of
the city of Ottawa. hereinafter referred to as
"the City" and. shall hold office for a period of
one year from the the date of his appointment.
or for sucli period nlot exceeding three years
as shaîl bie deternîined by by-law duly passed
by the City; Provided, hnwever, that if the
mayor or an alderman of the City is appointed
by the City to bie a commissioner hie shaîl cease
to hold office as commissioner when hie ceases
te hold office as mayor or alderman, and the
City shahl thereupon appoint a commissioner
for the unexpired termi.
4. (1) The Commission shall be a body corporate. and shalt have power to makS such bYlaws, emptoy sucb persons, and pay and defray
such expenses as are necessary to enable it to
carry into effect the purposes for which it is
constituted or any of the powers conferred on
it by this Act; but no by-laws so made shall
couie into force or effect untit approved by the
Governor in Council, and no alteration, modification or repeal of any such by-law sha1 have
any force or effect until approved by the
Governor in Councit.
(2) Any by-law of the Commission may impose penalties not exceeding fifty dollaré, recoverabte upon summary conviction, for the

461

infraction of its provisions, and may provîde for
the imprisonnment of offenders in defanît of

My honourable f riend wilt notice that in
the Bill which I presenit ùIlre is one clause to
be added, one subsection which was in the
Bill of 1921. and which had been dropped, and
which simply completes the Act. It is ta give
power to selI or tease any property which it
is not necessary to hold, and which is not
needed for parkes and so forth for tihe beautification of Ottawa.
It is the first section:
Subject to the approval of the Governor in
Counil-

The Commission shahl have the .right ta--saIt or lease any real property of the Comnnmission not being a portion of any public park
or square, street, avenue, drive or thoroughfare,
which is not required for the purposes of the

Hon.

Mr.

GRIESBACH:

May

I

ask

tion of the sumns that are placed at its credit

whetlier the statements the honourable gentleman refers to have been duly laid before
Parliament as required by the Act?

As honourable gentlemen will remember, in
1919 $150,000 was given the Commission for
ten years; in 1927 the amount was increased
to $250,000 for sixteen years; so that under the
Act they could dispose of the sums that I mention:
The Ministcr is liereby auithorized to pay ont
of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada

having deposited some of them myself.
I
would suppose that the law had been complied
with.
The Clerk at the Table could find out,
although I am pretty certain that the law has
been complied with.

imder this Act.

to the Commission the sumn of $250,000 a year

for a period not exeeeding sixteen years.
That is the Act of 1927. The amendment
makes a reduction to $200,000 for fifteen years.
Then the Commission lias borrowing power.
It can, if it needs a larger sum of money,
capitalize those annuities; but it is provided
that there shall be an interest and amortizing
fund. The time is limited for the issue of
debentures; principal and interest are to be a

Now I come to the ather question of my
honourable friend:
h'lie Commission shall fron time to tine
befora naking expenditres unider this Act,
suîlimit to the Minister detailed estimates of
the expeimlitures proposed to be made by it,
wlcli estimates shall be accompanied by such
ful information as is sufficient to enable the
Governor in ('ouncil to determinie as to the necessity or advisability of sueh proposed expenditures. or any portion thereof; and no
expendituîre shall lie matide by the Commission

the Covernor in Coumneil.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a statement of the expenditure of the year. I have
yet to learn that there bas ever been any
criticism of the work of the Commission, or
that there has ever been any complaint of
extravagance on their part. I think we have
generally heard commendation of their work.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is the cheapest
public Mork that bas ever been done.
Honi.Mr.

DANDURAND.

Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

I remember

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Is it not a fact that
the acquisition of the property west of the
Post Office, and of the property between
Sparks street and Laurier avenue, is not really
the work of the Commission, but rather the
proposal and the work of the Government?
My honourable
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend will find the answer in the terms of the
Act that I am reading.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The point I am trying to get at is this.
I make the statement,
and I have some authority for making it, that
the Commission does not hold ifself responsible for this expansion of parks in the city.
In fact, I understand the Commission desires
that it should not be held responsible at all.
We aie all very pleased with the work the
Commission has done in the past; but if my
information is correct, it desires the public
to understand that it is not responsible for the
acquisition of the Russell Hotel property and
olher properties.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I explain te
my lionourable friend?
The acquisition of
territory other than that covered by the
Russell hotel and the Russell theatre has not
yet been provided for in any way.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
it over.

Someone bas taken

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am saying that
what the Government bas donc so far in the
way of epropriating property to the south of
Sparks street bas regard only to the hotel and
the theatre.
Everbody who bas
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
read the discussions in another place knows
that the Prime Minister has very plainly indicated that the plan of the Government incuides the taking over of the property down
Elgin street from Sparks street to Laurier
avenue.

MAY 7, 1928
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think that is contemplated; but I want to point out that it is
nlot so for the present, at ail events. Nothing
has been done except to take over the Russell
theatre and the hotel property.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:' That is precisely
what I arn saying. I agree with my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 do not disagree
with rny honourable f riend's staitement; b>ut I
want to point out Vo ihim thaît the action of
the Government so far has only 'been with
regard to the 'hotel and the theatre. Noithing
has been done with regard to the property to
the soutth. When that is done, quite likely
it wiIl be done by the Governinent through
the Depnrtment of Publie Works. It may
be that the Federal Commissitn will be
responsible for looking after the square when
once it is coxnpleted; but there is no idea at
present of making.thie Commission responsible.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn very pleased
with my honourable frien *d's statement, because it is quite in accord with what 1 have
in mind, and with wVhat 1 'have been told is
correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was .proceeding to tell my honourable friend that, he
would find in the Act governing the Commission that the responsibility for its action
in purchasing real estate lies primarily with
the Government.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Exactly.
The GovernHon. Mr. DANDURÀND:
ment intende to maintain that right of supervision.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In fact, the Commission does not want Vo be charged with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Clause 13 says:
No real property shall be purchased or acquire(l by the Commission, except with the
previous consent of the Governorin Council;
and if the Commission is unable to agree with
the owner of the property which it is so authorized to purchase, as to the price to be paid
therefor, the Commission shall have the right
to acquire the same without the cousent of the
owner, and the provisions of the Railway Act,
1919, relating to the taking of lands by railway companies shall, mutatis mutandis, be applicable to the acquisition of such real property
by the Commission.
So 'the Government is not hiding behind
the Commission, but is making use of the
experience and knowledge of 'the Commission
and its study of the ground, and it con-fers
with the Commission and authorizes the purchase of property when it judges proper.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Commission is
noV buying the Russell House property?
Hon. Mr. CASGRMIN: The Governent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Government, after conferrig with the municipal
authorities, has decided that it, is important
Vo acquire that piece of property, and of
course it will transfer it to the Commission,
or the Commission will proceed by expropriatijon to secure that land. But ail this is
done in accordance wjth an understanding
between the Government and the authorities
of the city of Ottawa, and the purahase of
the Russell* house and the Russell tAheatre is
part of the scheme; and iV is largciy because
that schemne has been approved by the Commission and by the Govcrnment that the Government now comes Vo Parliament asking to
va-ry the grant from 8250,000 a year Vo $200,000, and to be allowed Vo furnish an initial
payment of $3,000,000 for the purchase of
those and other properties.
Now, my honourable friend from Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Sc'haffner) bas asked me who
are the members of the Commission. They
are: Hon. Thomas Ahearn, Chairman of the
Commission;
G. E. Fauquier; W E.
Matthews; Dr. Chevrier; A. E. Provost; the
Mayor of Ottawa; the Mayor of Hull, and
F. E. Bronson. I have named eight of the
gentlemen. I will furnigh the other two
names to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: 1 understand that
when the vote was increased lasV year from
$175,000 Vo $250,000 the Commission wus at
liberty Vo expend the money as they saw fit
up to that amount. Now they geV $200,000
and are also given $3,000,000, but they can
do nothing unless the Government approves.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They are limited to those sums.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Thcy do not geV
$200,000 a year and power to borrow $3,000,000. They are allowed to capitalize this annual grant of $200,000 for fifteen years, and
they have only the products of that capitalization to spend, and no more. They do noV
geV the annual grant and also 83,000,000.
The honourable
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
has just stated, if I understand him correctly,
that this Bill is Vo provide the Commission
a grant of $200,000 a year for fifteen years
Now, I would like to be clear whether or
not that $200,000 a year will not be charged
with the purchase price of properties like the
Russell hotel.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

No.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that will be taken out of the $3,000,00 we are
voting them.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
The Russell hotel
property will be paid for out of the $3,000j000?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Can my honourable
friend say whether it has been settled that
the Government or the former owners of the
hotel preperty will get the insurance that was
on the building?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: I could not say
I can obtain that information.
I do not
know who held the titie at the time of the
fire.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER:
Whoever it was
that owned it would get the insurance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That would be
the one wh.o carried the insurance.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: I 'have no desire to
take up the time of this House unnecessarily
in discussing this subject; but I think there
i-, the reuntry qnd in this chamber a misi
understanding that might well be straightened
out. 1 understand that the $3,000,000 is a
straigbt grant, given by Parliament, for the
pîîrpose of buying this property.
Hon. Mr.

DANDURAND:

And

other

Hon. G. G. FOSTER: And other prepertics. 1 have been told here that the $3,000,000 required for that purpose was obtained
by capitalizing the $200,000 for fift-een years;
but that view is flot correct; for the three
million is a direct grant.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I understand.

That is flot what

Hoin. G. G. FOSTER: It is not understood in the country in that way; but it is an
extra expenditure of three millions.
With regard to the suggestion by the leader
of the 'Goverrument that in the days gone by,
wben these grounds and buildings were .being
erected a.nd laid out, Parliament might weil
have secuired the land in front of these buildings. May I say that I arn quite certain I arn

and we sbould beware lest the
people of the country should get the idea
that wc are wastefully and extravagantly
spending their money for our own aggrandizement and to satisfy our own vanity and the
vanây of citizens of Ottawa. I yield to îao
man in admiration of the first Commission,
and the work ffbcy did in Ottawa. The building of Laurier road. as I believe the drive
along the canal is called, is e~tribute te the

cIlire to s,ýaYtbat tbecy were reûa.onaible, or juist.
With an bononrable meinher of tbis Hoiise
I went ont to a place that seemed to be a
long wvay fromn Parliament Hill. We travelled
for an heur, and we saw flower beds, roads,
ulrt.bridges, and everything cisc imaginable indeïr construction or centemplated. I
said te our conductor: 'How far are we froun
Parliamenit Hill now?" He s-aid: "We are M~
miles frem there." "Good heavens," I said,

boniourable gentlemien. Yen should go down
the dr-ivcway, go across tbe Rideau canal river,
sec there the great area of land that bas beeon
cleared and being prepared for vast expenditure. It is net rigbt.
I went down te the lake just this side of the
Experimental Farm. They told me they are
going te take down the bridge there. I asked,
"Why are you geing to take this bridge
down?" The answer wa.s, 'We want te make
the lake bigger." Make the lake higgerl 1
could net believe that anybody meant that.
Yet they are geing te RTemove that bridge.
"And then what are they geing te do?"'
"Build the bridge around the edge of the
lake."
What do the people of this country

465

MAY 7, 1M2

care whether the bridge is in one position or
the other or whether the lake is large or 8mall?
I say that is unnecessary expense. I do flot
sa 'v that the people of this country cannot
afford' to unýdertake whatever expense is necessary in order to, beautify Ottawa and make
it a credit to Canada. I have no quarrel as
to the purchase of these buildings close by,
pros ided that the price is fair and reasonable
and that the proiperty is desired for the
proper development of a necessary park systemn in the vicinity of the Parliament BuildinL,>-. But do flot transform the whole of
Ottaw~a into parks--do not spend the money
of the country for improvements extending for
ter, twelve or fifteen miles. Do not think for
one moment that people care-whether flower
beds are growing across the canal or not. That
is of littie consequence to them as compared
with the necessary expenditure of money for
the proper development of Canada. Let
Ottawa be made as beautiful as it reasonably
can be, by a wise, prudent and careful Commi-ýiGn, but do not try to make it appear that
the people of this country desire, or will tolerate, or will consider as proper business, the
development of Ottawa at the enormous expense we hear mentioned daily on the streets
of this city as sums to be expended for the
present or for to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. BELCOIURT: Honourable gentlemren, just one word. I find that I was mistaken in the statement 1 made a moment ago,
that the $200,000 instalment was part of the
$3.000.000. 1 find now that the 33.000,000 and
the $200,000 are separate. The sum of 83.000,000 is to be extpended on the Russell House
property and certain works. It is t0 be .paid
out of :the consolidated funds or to be raiseýd
by xvay of securities. I desire to make thaýt
correction.
Hon. Mr. WIILOUGHBY: The sum of
$3,000,000, I take it, is advanced by the Government direct for the purchase of land and
for other expenditures. The other sumn is a
vote to the Commission and is to continue.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
quit- correct.
lIon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Yes,

that

is

It must be so.

Couneil The $200 000 will be for maintenaince work. and whcn there i2, a margin lef t
it can be used for confinued improvement

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Thore are two
different sums for expenditure.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You have $200,000 for
fificen years for maintenance, as I un-derstand.
Hlon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. ROSS:

spot that I see in the case as presented eo
far is that we bave flot been given the
particulars or a view of the whole scheme. I
undenstand that it takes in Rockliffe Park
and embraces a conLsiderable area, extending
as; far as thcee and a baîIf miles from the

the carrying ont of the sciiere. There is
absolute truth in what niy hononrable friend
from Winnipeg (Hon, Mr. McMeans) says
about the excessive expenditure that is going
on. I have expressed m)y opinion in this House
mmoe than once about our expenditure, and I
do flot intcnd to state it over again. 'The cost

to subjeet, this property to taxation by the

Hon. Mr. B]'LCOTJ1T: But Loy honourable

the taking of the hotel and the theatre.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: That is rather bad, because it looks as if the scheme were going
forward piecemneal, with the idea, "We wil!
get this appropriation through this year, andi
two years from now wc ivili get another
passed."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
my honourable friend to inquire, how much
of the $3,000,000 to be expended on capital
account will be devoted to the purchase of
property.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No. I know there is in
the minds of the members of that Commission a seheme to beautify Ottawa as tho
capital of Canada. They are looking at tht'
miatter fromr that point of view, and they aro
taking a pretty large view-they are not at
ail cramped in their notions in tibat respect.
I do not complain. of that, but I would like
to know how far they intend going, regardIess of this particular grant. What are they
going to ask for in two years from now?
What will they ask for in five years from
now? What is the whole amount? If we
get the desired information and see that the
plans are justified, we can say: "AIl -right;
acquire the property that you say is necessary for the completion of your seheme as a
whole, and, having done that, let us be
economical and slow in the annual expenditurc." I cannot imagine that the present
scheme includes anything in the nature of a
big public work that bas to be rushed tu
completion witbin six months, for the sake
of economy. Sometimes it does not pay +o
take time: for instance, in putting up a large
building it is better to complete it as soon
as possible. But in dealing with a place like
Rockliffe Park, if you maintain the roads
you have a very fine place without any further
expenditure; and the same is true of the propert3' to the west of the city.
As I say, I do not desire to block the Bill
in any way, but I would like to have a full,
clear idea of 'what tbe whole thing means,
not only for the present, but also for the
future, and to be able to give an account
of my stewardship if I am asked why I voted
for this heavy expenditure.
Hon. Mr. G RIES BACH: Can the honcurable leader of the (overnment -)w answer
56109--30à

my question, as to whether or not the annual
report requirced by the Act bas actually been
printcd and laid before us? I do not remember having ever seen it. Who knows
about it? I have neyer even heard of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend must admit that I lay on the
Table many reports which he neyer looks at.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My next point
is, I would like to sec the report anyhow,
if it cxists.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can undertake
to let the honourable gentleman see it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My next question
is, what area does this Commission cover at
the moment? Docs it, for instance, extcnd
ovcr to Hull? And is it seriously proposed
to beautify Hull? I would like to know what
headway bas been made in beautifying HulI.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I would like to
have an answer to my question before the
honourable gentleman proceeds.
I am listening
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to my honourable friends, and I intend to,
providie honourable maembers of the Senate
with ail the information for which they are
ncow asking, but I will do that wben we go
into Committe'e.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: May I suggest,
with reference to that question of information,
that it would be of sonne value to have the
general plan of the present Commission compared with the admirable and very thorough
report and plan prepared by the Commission
whose names the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has given. I have not looked
at it for a year or two, but it was a remarkaible piece of planning, showing great vision,
and would have made of Ottawa a verybeautiful centre. Great attention was giveni
to its preparation by very able men, and it
is worth the while of anyone interested in
this question to look at the report and the
plan. It included, by the way, the utilization
of the land to the west of this present plot
and beyond the Supreme Court, with departmental buildings which were to be concentrated, and with access to them through
the town.
Just one thing -more. I happened to be in
Winnipeg lest autumn, and was mueha rtruck
with the really great beauty of the provincial
buildings there. and one of ths' officiaIs to whom
I have expressed my admiration of the building and the way it was maintained said:

MAY 7, 1928
reeiirities of the Commission, guaranteed as
hereiaafter provided, an amount or amounts
unct to exceed in the aggregate three million
dollars, or hpe may, with the approval of the
Governor in Couneil, pay to the Commission,
out of any unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, such sumn or sums, not
exceeding three million dollars as may be required for said purposes, or may make such
provision partly in one way and partly ia the
other.
That, to my mind, is quite clear. Theii it
continues:
The Commission may. for the purposes of this
section, create ani issue obligations, bonds,
debentures or other securities, herein called
securities. AIl negotiations for the sale or
cther disposition of the securities, shaîl be
carried on by the Minister.
Now, is it qulte clear that, should the Govcrnment decide to advance to the Commission
the sum of $3,000,000 foi' the purpase of
acquiring properties, the Commission may not,
with the approval of Parliament, issue bonds
for the purchase of other properties? I amn
flot sure that that is quite distinct and clear.
Section 10 says:
10. (1) No securities shall be issued by tlme
Commission for a periad extending beyond the
first day of July, one thousand nine'hundred
aîîd flfty.eight.
In othar words, any moneys that are ta be
raised by securities issued by the Commission
shal flot be borrowved for more than thirty
years, wbereas the grants given under sect:on
8 are to axtend only for a period of fifteen
years. 0f course it is quita clear in that section
that any moneys due for interest on accoua t
of the securities issued, are payable ýby the
Govarnment and are not taken out of the
$200,000 provided for in section 8.
My point is this. Does section 9 makp it
perfectly clear thiat the total sum of money
that may be advanced to, the Commission for
the puarchase of properties does flot exceed
S3,000,000?
There is one othar point I would like to
raise, for my own information. To xvhat extent

bas the Government actually committed itself
down to, the present time, in respect to propertics? There bias been a great deal of talk
;n the eity of Ottawa about this matter. We
know that the Russell House lias been purchased, and that ahl the property from the
Post Office as far as Elgin street hias been
purchased and the buildings have ahl been
remorvcd. In addition to the Russell Hotel
there were those properties on Canal street.
1 do not know whether those buildings
helonged ta tha Russell Hatel or not. There
wvere also Bate's warehouses andHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Bate's warehouse
and Birkett's warehause have been Gaverament properties ahl along.

473

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I did not know tînt.
I think the buse is ent.itled ta know the
actual extent ta which the Govarnment lias
already committed itself with respect to the
purchase of these praperties, and the amolint
involved. When we have that information wv,
shall know exactly to what extent the $3,000,000
may be used for the pitrehase of other
properties.
The motion wvas agreed ta, and the Bihl wis

MAY 8, 1928
to say that, the matter having been determined
by the Supreme Court of Canada, the point
must be taken to, ho settled for the time being,
and that there is no reason, therefore, on constitutionai grounds, why the legisiation should
flot bo passed.
Hon. Mr. REID- How does ho really interpret that decision?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ho is citing the
judgment of the Supreme Court in a stated
case, and in order to give greater information
to the Senate, ho gives the reasons of two of
the Justices who rendered the judgment.
Hon. Mr. REID: They reaily decided that
we bave power?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I understand at the
present timo there is a provision in the
Doherty Act which says that you cannot
itnport liquor into any Province where proMost of the Provinces have
hibition exista.
ceased now to be prohibition Provinces. The
iaw at present is that it is beyond the power of
the provincial legisiatures to make laws against
the importation froma one province to another.
It is qssumed that most of the provinces that
have their own liquor laws have passed iaws
of that kind; but owing to the provisions of
the Doherty Act it has beon hold that those
laws operate only in provinces whero there is
prohibition. I take it fromn what the hanourable gentleman has said that this Bill wili
make it prohibitory to take liquor from one
province to another. Am I correct in that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that the Bill we are considering onacts prohibition with the authority of His Mai esty
the King in that province.
I did not quite
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
understand that.
The Bill that
Hon. Mc. DAND*URAND:
we are passing now prohibits the movement
of liquor from one province to another as
betwcen individuais, but aiiows His Mai osty
the King, for the various provinces, to make
an exception.
Tt has
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
nothing to do with temperanco legisiation.
Hon. Mr. REID: If we have power to
prohibit the transportation of liquor from one
part of the Dominion to another, would not
this Parliament also have power to prohîbit
any other article of manufacture?
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: Il my honourable friend wiil notice, in the case which I
cited, the Supreme Court held that:
Part IV added to the Canada Temperance
Act by Chapter 8 of the Statutes of 1919, and
prohibiting the importation of intoxicating

liquor into those provinces where its sale for
beverage purposes is forbidden by provincial
law, is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament
under its general power "to make laws for the
peace, order and good government of Canada."
Having cited that, my answer should be
negative in regard to matters of generai trade.
Hon. Mr. RE'ID: The reason I asked that
was that I understood that the Privy Council
decided that the provinces had the right to
soit liquor in that particular province, and we
If they
had rights in regard to manufacture.
have an absolute right to decide what is to be
sold in that particular province, and then
decide that a certain article of production shall
not be sold in that province, I can quite understand how we could pass an Act prohibiting
the transport of goods of which they had
But
prohibitcd the sale in that province.
I think this Act goes a littie farther. In the
provinces of Aiberta, Manitoba and Ontario,
they have not prohibited the sale; any one can
go down the streets here and buy ail ho likes;
it is not prohibition at ail.
It is a reguHon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:
lation.
Hon. Mr. REID: And if the government
is seiiing it, or allowing it to *be sold, thon it
strikes me that we have not the power to
prohibit the transport of that particular article
into that province.
In other words, the.
decision referred to does not appiy to this parThe Supreme Court
ticular article at all.
decidod that we have the right to prohibit the
transportation into a province, and the provinces have the right to say whether liquor
shall ho seld or not; but if they have already
aiiowed it to ho soid, it strikes me that the
honourahie leader has not got the proper reply
from the Minister of Justice to his partîcular
question.
Hon. Mr. LYXCH.-STAUN-'TON: Honourabie gentlemen, we ought to consider this
clause defining "intoxicating liquo-,-." In the
province nf Ontario it is forbidden by law
to seli beer, or have it in one's possession for
sale. In the province of Quebec the sale of
beer or having it in one's possession for sale
is not forcbidden.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does that mean aie?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Therefore the words "intoxicatii'g liquor"
may not mean the same in Quebec as they
do in Ontario. It appears to me ini this way.
If this legisiation were in force a man might
take a dozen botties of beer in hi;s motor car
to HIdi, and so far as the provisions of this
statute are concerned he would nlot ho offending against the law; but if ho were to buy a
dozen botties of ail in Hull and bring. them

MAY 8, 1928
Take the case of a man coming up herc,
and the onus is on him; he cornes from Quehec, and has a srnall bottle of whiskey, and
somebody pulls hirn up before the magistrate
on the roadside and demands that he prove
his innocence. H1e mnust send to Quehec ta
get a man to prove it for him. Many men
are caught on these offences because they
knowv the onormous cost of bringing witnesses.
If I bcd a bottle of whiskey that I had
brought down from Sarnia, and somebody
piillncl me up in the streets of Ottawa, I would
toit hirn that I did flot huy it in Quohe,
but ho mnight say, "Well. I saw yeu over in
Hull vesterday." *I would reply t bat I did
not buy it je Hull, but bow arn I going to
prove it? I wouId have to send up to Sarnia
to bring a witness to prove that I hought
it frurn hirn there, then ho may have f orgotten
that I was in bis place; I may have heen a
stranger to hirn.
Honourable gentlemen, tlh'se littie persecuiting laws should be vcry carefully iooked
into, and I think this Senato should be
a.stute te ascertain whether or net there is
any real reasen for fining a transiont travellor,
a stranger who cornes through this country.
There are tees of thousands passing tbrough
Canada now, or an ordinary citizen may
ippon te bring a small quantity of intexic9îing liquor je bi-, satchel or pocket. This
legislation is a forrn of persecution, and the
reasoni 1 thiek it will ho of ne use is because,
ta 1uýe a large phrase. it xviii ho made an
englue of persecuition. I think, however, that
if we made an exception of a reasonable
quantity of liquor it could not hurt many
people; se I arn goieg te move an amiendment
when wve corne te se~ction 3.
I would like te

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I arn wondering if
the officiai wbo gave this opinion is the gentleman who gave us one on a previeus eccaêien, when we found one of the Ministers
of the Crown saying, in effect, that the
opinion did net make any difference, hoe was
going te do what hoe wanted te do; and ho
did it, directly contrary ýte the opinion. 0f

opinion was ceevenient, and possibly tbis one

i.s. 1 think we should have time te look et
the case in the Suprerne Court te which the
leader refers, but in glancing tbrougb it I find
that the decision. was given on a statcd case,
and as far as I have been ahIe te sc in the
very short tiine at nîy disposai, there is ini
Lecase stated ne mention that the goods
in question were the manufacture or produce
of aqaotber province. I do not profess for a
momnent te set up rny legai opinion against
that of the Judýges cf the Supremie Court, but,
1 would like te paoint eut te this House how
far their zeal in the causD of temperance is
lvading saine of the legislators of this country.
MY~, province of British Columbia is possibly,

Quebec, who aillow vou te import as far as

any liquor which is imported into British
Columbia otherwise than through the Provincial Liquor Commission bas te ho dcclared
iimediately and is liable te a tex equal te
the profit the Coýmmission would have mcdo
if it bad sold the liquor, plus 10 per cent.
The Liquor Commission, like aIl Govcrnrnent
institutions, xvas of the opinion that it wvas
inaking a very handsome profit. Like al
(iovernmient Institutions, it tbougbit it was
hendling its business pretty xvell, ced it
arbitrarily declared that it mcdo a profit of
34 per cent-c figure which, I rnay say, is
net reflected in the annual rotures of the
Commission, for if it bcd mcde se mucb
mioney the amounit of revenue which the
province derives weuld ho very much greater.
With the 10 per cent added, hy way of fine,

local Court of Appeal, ced the case wvent ne
further. Tbe Court ef Appeal, with one dissen.ting judge, decided that the law was intre
vires. The result is this, that if that iaw is
intra vires there is ne effect given at ail to
section 121 of the British North America Act.
There is ne reasen why we should net put
that saine tax or duty on Manitoba wheat,
on Queboc boots and shoes, or on any ether
product or manufacture of any oCher province.
That is where I say the zeai of sorne gond
people je the cause of temperance is leadinýg
the legislators of tbis country. I think it is

bai-e guesseti right ibis time, there slill remains the question wbether or net jr is expedient to pass legisiation of this kind witbout eonsidering vory fuiiy the effeer cf what
xxe are doing.

Heou. Mr. DAN-ýDURAND): Ho xviii find that
ibe Gevernments of Ontaneo, Qnebec, ]British
Columbia ami ai tbe ciber provinces bave
claimed tbat tbey were prcceedicg on tbe fines

-

MAY 8, 1928

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the honourable gentleman putting a question?
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: No; I am making
the stiatement that any province in which
there was prohibition had, by Act of the Parliament of Canada, received authority to prohibit the importation of liquor into the province. It seemns 'to me that it would le a very
simple matter to add to that Act la provision
to the effeot that any province selling liquor
under Governmcnt control should have the
,samne right. Then each province would pass
le.gislation such as it deemed wise. As the
present Bill is drawn it applies only to, the
'provinces where liquor is sold by Government
Commissions; it does not apply to the provinces Where prohibition is in force.
Hon. Mr. DAND1JRAND: I see the point.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Make the'law uniform. If you desired to give the provinces
the rigltý to prohibit tèhe 'importation of
liquor, or the carrying of liquor from one
province to another, ail you had to, do was
to amend the Act already in force so as to
make it apply to those provinces where liquor
is sold under Government control. I do not
sec the neoessity of this Bill at ahl. Bach
province could then run its own show.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I see no
harm -in this alternative. This is what has
been suggested by the Dominion-Provincial
Conference.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNýCH-.STAUNTON:
trouble is that there is a law in eacih province
and wve are making -another law, and a man
may be flned twice for the same offence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That may help
to saler him up.
lion. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, no;
it w.iIl knock him cold. It wilI not sober
hiîn at aIl. I-t makesl two laws for thc one
offence. 1 think that is unheard of in any
Iegiérlation. You neyer did it before.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It makes two
offences.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Perhaps the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) would
consent to a reduction in the duty.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: Question!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before the question is put, may I ask my honourable friend
whether le bas any knowledgc of what would
le the attitude of any province-say the
province of Ontario, for example-in which
there are a number of counties where the old
-Scott Act is stili in force, if the people of a

479

particular county asked the Provincial Government to forbid absolutely the importation
of liquor into the county, just as the Provincial Governmcnt, a" my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says, is asking the
Federal Government to prohibit importation
into the province? Does my honourable
friend th'inik that the Provincial Government
would heed such a request and pass legisiation
to that effect? I have serious doubts as to
the Provincial Government itself doing what
it seems to be asking this Parlliament to do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot answer
the question, because I have flot the Provincial Act before me. I rememýber that the
Scott Act or the Duncan Act, remained in
force in some of the counties of the Eastern
Townships until recent years. I cannot say
whether a person wvho lived in a district in
which the Scott Act was in force could import
or carry liquor into that district. My honourable friend from Aima (Hon. G. G. Foster)
signifies that the answer is in the negative.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is it not true that
any citizen living in a 'Scott Act county can
go into a county where liquor is sold, purchase
it legalJy there, and have it legally in lis
possession anywhere in the province? I think
suclh is the case. Therefore it seems to me
that it would not be within the jurisdiction or
power of the Provincial Government to
establieh an arbitrary boundary line and fine
a man if he crosaed it. I think the same
principle applies here. I am greatly interested in the point m-ade by the honourable
gentleman from Hamil-ton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton), because, if the matter is carried
to its logical conclusion, that is the resuît.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend from Aima seems to take a view contrary to that of my honouraible friend (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), claiming that in the district
where the Scott Act or the Duncan Act was
in force there could be no importation.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
think my honourable friend to my right (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) will find a difference between the two cases that he has cited. There
is a difference in motive, and there is also
a difference in result. The Scott Act county
voted Scott Act flot that it might get an
opportunity to sell liquor and make gain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or buy liquor.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It voted Scott Act and prohibition in order
to prevent the sale of any liquor within its
boundaries. The desire of the Provincial
Governments of Ontario and Quebec is the

Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND:
He has attempted ta persuade the Senate that as bietween Quebec and Ontario there is an
absolute unviolated rnonopoly; that Québec
protects itself thoroughly, and that Ontario
does hikewise.
The conclusion ta be drawn
frorn that argument is that, most of this legislation is useless. But against bis opinion 1
cite the Governrnents of those respective Provinces, who do flot think as my honourable
friend does.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: To make matters
perfectly clear, I first put a question ta rny
honourable friend. 1 asked him if hie knew of
any abuse at ail by way of importation from
one wet Province to another wet Province, and
hie said distinctly that hie did not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
had not inquired.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Did the
Provinces at the Conference cite any cases in
support of this extraordinary proposition?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANI:
Ail that I
reinember is the unýanimous expression of their
desire.
My honourable friend laid stress on another
argument, namely, that hie understood that a
Province having prohibition could ask that
that prohibition or total abstinence be
respected. If that is so, why should flot a
half-way measure be respected as well? Here
is a Province-Quebec, or Ontario, or British
Columbia-that decides ta invoke a certain
set of laws for the pence, order, and good
goveramen-t of thç Province. Why should mny
honourable friend say: "If -they proceed in a
certain way"-sgay total prohibîtion-"ýwe will
respect their wilI; but if they adopt another
system in order ta reach the samne chd, .we
will flot do @o." My honourable friend says
we should not interfere. I cannot aee the
logic of that argument.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think my honourable friend cornes very near
to bringing himseif under the Corrupt
Practices Act. He maises the quantity which
hie proposes to let in free with a view ta
gaining votes. How does the honourable
gentleman justify that? If he would get a
certain number of votes by putting the
amount at haif a gallon, and thinks hie
can get more votes by putiting it at a
gallon, is hie open to the temptation. of
raising his lirnit? I arn afraid of the effect
on rny honourahie friends opposite.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not
consulted my colleagues as ta this amendment, and therefore cannot accept it. If my
honourable friend submits it, I would ask
that the Senate express itself upon it, and
that the Chairman should ask those ini favour
ta risc, so that the Commons rnay know that
there is such a body of opinion in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is quite manifest
that if the amendment should carry, it will
wholly defeat the Bill.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 'Me honourable
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) deplores the inutility of the law,
and in that respect I entirely agree with him;
but Vo amend it in this respect seems to be
piling absurdity upon absurdity. As soon as
the hypothetical person arrives in another
Province with his half gallon of liquor he
cornes under te operation of the Iaw of that
Province, which says that it is an offence to
have the liquor because he has not bought it
in the Province in which he is.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: We cannot prevent that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, but we are
noV improving the Act.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: If the Bill is passed
with the exception proposed by the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lyncli-Stautnton), it wiIl override the Provincial law.
Hon. Mr. DAN-,DURAND: Then it is al
the more obnoxious.
I do
Hon. Mr. LYN_1CH-STAUNTON:
flot think the honourable gentleman bas considcred that carefully. The amendment
simply says that so far as hall a gallon is
concerned the Act is non-existent. There is
no enactrment whatever rcgarding a hall
gallon. Suppose we were to leave out anything in the Act, we would not be passing
legislation, but refraining from passing it. I
might ýexpress myself in anotiher way. Tis
amendment does not make it lawful Vo bring
liquor into a Province if it is unlawful under
the Provincial legfislation.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think the dilstiliction is clearly emphasized by the repeated demands of the Liquor Commission of
Qiiebec.

by the Quebec Government for the purpose
of replacing hard liquor by ligh.t wines. They
said: "That is the way in which we shal
fight intemperanice;" and they were rather
annoyed because the people said Vo the Commission: "You are making an extravagant
profit; you are adding 70 or 80 per cent to,
the cost of light wines.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Has not the Government got control of the Commission?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certainiv the Quebec Government bas control, and it passed
that control over Vo the Commi>-sion. But
according Vo, the views of many people, the
Commission has abused its power by taking

an extravagant profit, and they were adraid
that individuals would say: "You are charging too much; we can import, and we wil
do it:" If this law is passed the Liquor Commission of Quebec will be thoroughly satisfied, for that danger will be removed forever,
because a man does flot import one bottle
of Scotch fromn across the occan. I think the
dcmand of my honourable friend is a most
modest one. It will proteet tourists andi others
who traveýl here, as they do at home, with
a flask or a bottle of whiskey. against a certain class of people who have but one interest,
nameply to catch people in a botel and rifle
their bags to ascertain whether or not they
tire violating the law, so that tbey may inform against tbem and participate in the fine.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Blackmail!
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

It is nothing- else.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It has becu said that
the Federal Act wvill override a Provincial
Act. If one were caught with the quantity of
liquor mentioned in the amendmnent in his
possession, aud were brought belore the Provincial courts and tried, would there be no
power to punisb him for having thttt liqiior in
his possession?
Hon.
Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Yes,

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Then what protection
has one got?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Suppose
the honourable gentleman were brought up
and fined under the Provincial law. under this
Bill, as introduced, he would be liable to a
further fine of $200. There is no legislation
like it on the Statute Books of Canada. You
have twvo clear authorities; one under the
Provincial law, and one under the Dominion
law.

Hon. Mr. BELCOUJRT: Surely that is sa.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: Question!
The Hon. the OHAIRMAN: Where is it
proposed to place the amendment?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH1-STAUNTON: At the
end of the first stibsection of section 3:
That the provisions of this section shall fot
apply to importations of intoxicating liquor in
quantities of one-half gallon or lesa.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It should be "subsection V."
The proposed amendient of Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton was carried: yeas, 35; nays,
27.
Section 3 as amended was agreed to.
On section 4-burden of proof:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: That is
a very extraordinary section. I thought at
first that it meant that the onus was on the
prisoner. 1 do not think it does. What it
says is this:
4. The burden of proving the right to import
intoxicating liquor, or to cause intoxicating
liquor to be imported, or to send, take or transor
port intoxicating liquor, or ta cause intox:icating
transported into any
liquùor to be sent, taken
province shall be on the persan accused.
I arn very much rnystified as to what that
meaxis. Does it mean that if I arn taken
with a quantity of whiskey ini my possession
I have to prove that I have lawfully transported it, or that I have a right to import it?
I do not think the clause is well drawn. If
I arn the prisoner I arn not claiming the
right ta irnport; I arn standing there charged
with having imported. I say I did not imnport
it-and of course every prisoner denies the
charge-must they not thcn go on and prove
56109-31j

483

that I did import it, and then corne back
again and ask me, "Had you the right ta
imnport it?"
Does the honourable leader see my point?
A rnan is first charged with having in his
possession liquor that has been brought out of
another province. He denies it. Then has
not the Crown ta prove that hie did import
it, before they put hum on his defence?
That is the proper way under British law,
If it is sa, I arn quite satisfied with it. Then
if they prove that hce did impart it they will
say ta hum, "Now, you imported that liquor,
and it is estahlished ta the satisfaction of the
Court that you did; what right had you ta
do it?" If that is the meaning of the clause,
I think it hs good on principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
view.

That is my

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: My impression was that this section would put the
onus on the prisoner of proving that hie did
not bring it frorn the province of Queboc,
but as I read it now I think that what the
honourable leader says is correct-that it
makes that the prosecutor first prove that hesbrought it froin Quehec, and after hie has
proven that, the prisoner must prove that
hie had the right ta bring it fromn Quebec,
and that proof will clear hirn. If it is that
way, I will not oppose it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tion hs that hie irnported.

If the accusa-

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, this
section does not apply to that. The section
applies to the right ta import, not ta the
importation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But defendant
will say, "I had the right to irnport."1
Hon. Mr. LYNCHI-STAIJNTON: No; the
defendant says, "I did not import;" then you
have ta prove that hie did import.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I arn only
looking at the article as I see it; it is based
on the right ta imnport.
Hon. 'MT. LYNCH-STAffNTON: Then 1
take it that this, section does flot apply to the
'charge at ail until it hs proved thsat hie irn'ported. The section does not corne inta play
luatil it hs proved that hie imported.

On section 5--penalties for violation:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNT'ON: I suggest
to the honourable gentleman that an improvament of this section would be to strike
out the words:
0f not less than two hundred dollars
Stnike out thosa words, and'leava the magietrate a discretion; leava no minimum penalty
at ail; make it !read that he shall bave a
penalty for the first -offenca of not more than
$1,000 and in default of payment, an imprisonment for not more than six months. It
would than rend:
penalty for the first of!ence of not more thau
$],000, and in dafault of' payment to imprisonment for any termn not more than six months.
Then the magistrate can put it on to him
if he tbinks the ýoffence is real, or he can let
him down. By this section as it stands you
are going to make the magistrate fine him
$M0, though ha should -not fine hlm at alI if
there are extenuating circu.mstances. Let the
magistrate have the discration. I move an
amandment to that effect.
Hon. Mn. DANDURAND: I can well e
the renson why this clause is drafted as it is.
It is to act as a ýdeterrent, but if my honourable friend stnikes out the minimum penalty
on the flnst offance and leaves the right of the
magistrate to go up to $1,000, than the accused
party can wall feel that he may escape with
a lhigbt fine.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Oh, yes,
that is riglit.
lion. Mr. OCASGRAIN: It is quite enough.
lion. Mn. R'EID: The point 1 want Vo, raise
is this. 'Many people are travelling tbrough
Canada from Europe, England, and othar
places, and they are all undar the impression
that tbey can buy liquor in the severai provincas, but they do not understand this law.
Wa have -touriste going through this country

Hon. Mr. 'BELAND: They muet throw it

Hon. Mr. REID: Yes. Well, 1 do not thîn-k
that is fair at aIl. Than another thing is that
they may ha arrasted, though they do not
know the law, and in a case of that kind they
should have only a small fine, for they are not
bootleggers; but as thie Bill stands the magîstrate muât fine tham $200. A good many of
those touriste may not have $200, ithen they
wili have to go to jail, thera is no other way
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON.

of deali.ng with the offence. I think the fine
for the first -offence should flot exceed $200;
that would give the magistrate the pririlege
of imfposing a lasser fine on tourists, while the
$1,000 would reach the mnen who were m
porting illegal1y. These touriste are told that
they can buy liquor in any province, and
there is no trouble in getting any quantity
they wan.t. They might cross at Brockvllle,
Kingston, or Precott, and they might buy
perhaps four or five bottles-a littie more than
hailf a gallon-then thay would have to pay
$200 when they did nôt really understs.ud the
law. I do flot like to see those people detainad and fined, and at present the magie'trate bas, no power but to impose that $200,
whereas if they are really tourists he would
probably fine them $10, or something like thiat,
which would he probably a fair penalty when
-the touriste did flot understand the law. 1
would rather see the section arrangad so that
the magistrate .coulid impose a smaîl fine, and
work it up to a large fine that 'he eould impose on any one violating the law knowingly.

Hon. Mr. BEAUIRIEN: I Vhink this section carnies a alur asxd sting to the magitrate and in its wake it might ailso carry
great injustice to many people. Suppose a
person comes in wîth a shade over a haîf
gallon of liquor, and he is hrought before a
magistrate of common sense, who hau to
decide that the law has been vioiated; what
is the magistrate to, do?
He wouid say,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
"Drink the difference?"
Hon. Mr. BEAUJBIBN-: If we could insert
that good spirit in the amendinent there would
he no objection; but the magistrate is
obliged f0 fine flua man $200. My hionourabie friend knows very often, what happens
is not a sentence but an acquittai, so that
the iaw that is unreasonable and inhuman
defeats itself. The magistrate sitting there
knows that there is absolutely no wrong
intention, and in the face of a law drawn as
this one is, under whicli he must impose at
least $2M, lie would prdbabily say, "Not
guilty". So that the law is not a reasonabie
and practical one. Why flot deal in this
case as we do in other cases, and have confidence in our judiciary; and if the judge
lias t-o deal witli a bootlegger lie wiil impose
81,000, -but if lie lias to deal witli an innocent
tranaient lie wiil impose only a smail fine.
I have
Hon. Mr. LYNXCH-STAUNTON:
heard many judges lament that legislation of
ths kincr was ever passed ini Parliament, because it took aill discretion from. tlie judge,
and innumerable facts arise that we cannot
have in mind when we are passing laws of
this kind. We know tliat if was extreme
penalties of ths kind that first brouglit tlie
criminal law in Engiand into disrepute.
Judges aliowed men to escape wlio tliey knew

demurrers t0 indictments; because fhey knew
that a man wouid be sent to tlie gailows for
stealing a loaf of bread, or fransported for

ahi times, as far as I liave read the history
of jurisprudence, condemned ths ciass of
legisiation. Leave -the discretion wîth tlie
magistrate.
The Hon. tlie CHAIR>MAN: The amendment is to strike out tlie words in the fourth

ail the words in the fourth. lne down to

For the second offence there

Hon. Mr. REID: But the magistrate may
impose a penalty up to $1,000?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes.
Hon. Mr'. REID: That seems to me a
very severe penalty. Sorne magistrates might
impoýse a fine of $200, and ot-hers might impose
a fine of $10. If the clause is passed with
the words "one thousand dollars", the
magistrate may say: "The penalty provided
il $1,000; 1 will let you off with $200," or something like that. The accused will not be able
to pay the fine. 1 think we should flot have
any amount there at alI, but should allow the
penalty to be whatever amount the magistrats
wishes to impose.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There must be a
limit.

duty.
If he does not do so, he is fined or
imprisoned.
Now, why do we want this
section?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
Customs Act at hand, but I should suppose
that this is a repetition of a clause in the
Customs Act.
However, I have not examined it.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: We have to, check that.
I cannot understand why you have a penalty
wit.h respect to, liquor taken from one province to another, and applying to any quantity
over haîf a gallon. In the case of a man who
illegally brings liquor in from abroad, are
these penalties greater or less than the Customs penalties?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Customs Act
does not prohibit the entry.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No, but it is necessary
to psy duty, and, mind yeu, if it is an illegal
importationHon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I do not understand how my honourable friend thinks that
there is a conflict or duplication.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: If you have this provision
in the Customs Act, why do you want it
here?
Hon. Mr. BELCOIIRT: I am asking my
honourable friend wvhere he secs the confiict.
I cannot sc it.
lion. Mr. ROSS: I say one penalty is
placed on top of the other if under the Customs Act, for illegal entry, you have a fine
of $1,000, and under thîs Act you impose another $1,000.
There is a penalty of $2,000.
That is a mere question of addition.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But those penalties
are under different laws.
Hon. Mr. ROSS:- I know that. Then you
could have eight or ten laws, with a penalty
of $1,000 under each.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: I do not know
that we could have eight or ten, but it seems
to me we can have two, and they are flot in
conflict at ail.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: There is no limit, once
you admit that it is fair legislation to have
two fines of that kind. Then why not three
or four?
Hon. Mr. BEjCýOURT: No. Because two
ý,vould be proper. it does not follow that three
or four would be.

On section 6---prosecution in place where
liquor imported:
1 desire to point
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
eut to the honourable leader of the Government something in clause 6. 1 do so for the
purpose of obtaining information rather than
offering opposition in any way. Section 6
reads:
A prosecution for any offence under this Act
may be brought and carried on, and a conviction had, in the city, town or place to or into
which any intoxicating liquor is uniawfully imiported, sent, taken or transported, or in the
place wVhere the accused resides, but no prosecution shahl be brought in any province
against a person not within or residing in such
province without the written approval of the
Attorney General of such proviuce.
When you corne to section 7 you find
praictically a contradiction of that:
A prosecution for any offence under this Act
may be brought and carried on and a conviction had in the city, town or other place
fromn which any intoxicating liquor is unlawful]y imported, sent, taken or transported, as
aforesaid.
There is a saving clause in section 6, but
none in section 7. 1 was going to. suggest
that section 6 be amended by adding after
the word "transported" in the f ourth line the
words:
or in an city, town or other place from. which
any intoxicating liquor is unlawfully imported,
sent, taken or transported, as aforesaid.
That would incorporate section 7 in section
6, with the saving clause at the end of six

the offence has begun. There should be no

Hon. Mr. McMEANýS: 1 would cal the
honourable gentlernan's attention to the first
fcew words of section 6:
A prosecution for any offence under this Act.
Hon. Mr, BEIQIJE: The whole tbing should
be in, one section. 1 think it is a mistake to
bave tbe matter covered in two different
sections.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It does not seem
to me tbat tbere is any contradiction at ahl.
Section 6 provîdes that th e prosecution may
be had in the place to whicb the liquor is
sent, but if the party who bas sent it does
not happen to reside in tbe province, then
the consent of the Attorney General is
required. That is not in contradiction witb
section 7, which provides that the prosecution
rnay take place wbere tbe liquor is brougbt.
Hon. Mr,. MeMEANS: But one bas a saving clause requiring the written approval of
the Attorney General, and the other bas not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes; that is required if the accused does not happen Vo
reside in tbe province. That is what section
6 means, and that is what it says.

Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
1 bave anotber objection, which is involved
with tbis one. Section 6 is an old friend of
mine. I remember a prolonged contest took
place in the Senate when it sat in the Museum
Building, over a clause in another Act whicb.

I thougbt at first that this section was a copy
cf the other.
I see it is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. ROSS: I suspected tbat. I had

clause was very familiar to me.

SENATE

Under this Bill as it now reads, that Montreal man not being a resident of British
Columbia, you could not bring a prosecution
against him without the consent of the Attorney General of British Columbia; but the
amendment that I have always wanted-and
I had it carried one time-is that no prosecution should be brought without the consent
of the Attorney General of the province in
which the accused resides-in this instance,
the Attorney General of Quebec. If a man
is taken from Montreal out to British Columbia, tried there and discharged, how is he to
get home? I remember someone saying, "Let
him walk home." But that is not fair legislation. Therefore I would like to see this
amended so as to require the consent of the
Attorney General in the province in which
the accused resides.
That is one feature. Now, with regard to
section 7, I think it ought to be amalgamated
in some way with section 6. If this were
done, and the change made which I have suggested, with regard to the consent of the
Attorney General, I would agree to this
amendment; but I never agree to any section
that would take a man out of his native
province on a charge of that kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will suspend
those two clauses. My view of it, without
looking at the clauses, would be that if liquor
were imported into British Columbia, say, in
violation of this Act, and the exporter did
not live in British Columbia, he could only
be sued in British Columbia with the consent
of the Attorney General of his Province.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No. If it were that
way I would have no objection. But it is
not the Attorney General of his own Province,
but of the other Province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, I sec. I
should think it would need the authorization
of the Attorney General where he resides.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or happens to be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But i can quite
realize the value of clause 7 under my interpretation, because there you prosecute at the
place where the-exporter is supposed to live.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It is evidently not
intended that a man shall be deprived. of the
right to be tried in his own jurisdiction. Unless, of course, he is in the Province where
the infraction was committed.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Where the offence

is laid.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Where the offence
is committed. Suppose that I, belonging as
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

I do to the IProvince -of Quebec, infringe that
law in this Province, by reason of the fact
that I am in this Province I can be sued before the tribunals of this Province; but if I
cross over to the Province of Quebec I cannot be removed from my home jurisdiction
without permission of the Attorney General.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ince?

Of what Prov-

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Of the Province
from which the importation is made.
What I want to put to my honourable friend
is this. I think this is a wise provision, but
it is only made in the case of importation.
When you deal with the exportation end of
the transaction you have no such provision.
Surely the offence is the same whîether you
consider it from the importation or exportation point of view; and if it is wise and just
and fair to protect the importer, and to practically arrange that he may be judged in his
own community unless he happens to be outside of his own Province and within the Province where the act was committed, why should
there not be the same safeguard for the man
who commits an infraction from the exportation end?
Hon. Mr. REID: Take the case of a tourist
coming from the Province of Quebec and going to Niagara Falls and crossing over to his
home in the United States. Upon coming
into Ontario he might have a little in
excess of the half gallon. He would be arrested, I suppose. Would he be kept in the
Province until the Attorney General was communicated with?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tried where he was.

He would be

Hon. Mr. REID: Suppose a man is travelling from Quebec with his family, and comes
to Cornwall, and a constable there arrests
him; that man might say: "I have two bottles,
but I am entitled to that, the rest of it belongs to this friend of mine." Is he to be
held there until they write to the Attorney

General?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, no. He
can be tried there because he is there.
Hon. Mr. REID:
Acaording to this
measure, as I interpret it, a man living in
the United States, and who happens to be
travelling through this country cannot be
sued without the consent of the Attorney
General.

place where the accused resides, but no prosecution shaîl be brought in any Province

needed.
Hon. Mr. REID: I sec. What the hionourable gentleman says is that hie could be

application to thé Attorney General of
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, because

I would ask that sections 6 and 7 stand.
Sections 6 and 7 stand.

Hon, W. B. ROSS: What is the object of
this section? le there nlot an abundance of
legislation without this, both Dominion and
Provincial, to deal with a situation of this
kind? I do not know that it is going to
make the situation any worse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is simply a
consequence of the Act. There are prohibitions and penalties, and a.mongst the penalties are the confiscation and destruction of
the parapliernalia and the goods.
Section 8 was agreed to.
Section 9 was agreed to.

HALIFAX HARBOUR LOAN BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 217, an
Act to provide for a loan to the Halifax
Harbour Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
Sections 1 to 6, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 7-repayment of boan:
Hon. W, B. ROSS: I have no objection
to section 7 as it stands, but I have a proviso
to move by way of amendment.
It really is
not in conflict with the mind of the Government, as I read it, from ivhat lias taken place
in the other House.
At the time of Confederation some of the
men wbo were very hope-ful of its effect propliesied that under it Halifax would become
the Liverpool of America.
Unfortunately
that prophecy lias not been realized. The
ports of entry in the Province were increased,
and provincial vessels that used to go to
Halifax went to those ports. Things geïadually got worse, and shipping in and out of
Halifax begnn to decrease.
Passing over
the bad times we come down to the time,
about 1914 or 1915, wlien n&w terminals were
built i that city. I remember very well at
that time asking Mr. Gutelius, the manager of
the railway, the object of extending the railway fromn the nortli end of the city to the
south end. I pointed out to him that I did
nlot quite see the sense of sueli a large expenditure there, unless there was a reason behind
it. He said lie had a great sclieme behind it.
That sclieme embraced wliat is now included
among the hopes for the future of the city of
Quebec, namely the carrying of freiglit by the
Transcontinental to Quebec, and from there
to Halifax. For some reason or otlier tLat
sclieme felI down, the terminais at Halifax
were almost idle, and tlie prospects whicli
for a time were so briglit seemed to pass away.
Uinder tlie new rates those prospects may
revive, and tlie trade tlit Mr. Gutelius was
figuring on wlien lie was responsible for tlie
extension of -the terminais in Halifax may, in
a measure come about.
If it does, part of
the prophecy as to Halifax becoming a Liverpool may be realized.
Following the building of the terminais a
grain eleviator was built.; I assume that it i8
modemn and up to date; but for a time tliese
terminal facilîties seemed to be an injuxy to
Halifax rather than a benefit. Then certain
things liappened, notably the change in the
legislation witli regard to the British preference, and goods entitled to the British preference now have to be entered in a Can-

SENATE
adian port, and in the winter time that has
certainly been a great stimulus to the trade
of the city of Halifax.
A second thing that influences the situation
and prospects at Halifax is that it is a very
accessible harbour, easy to get in and out
of at almost all seasons of the year, with only
occasionally a fog. Another favourable feature at Halifax is the very low harbour
charges.
Under the influence of those three factors
there has been growing up quite a little trade
into Halifax. Ships leaving European ports
on the way to St. John, Portland, Boston or
New York have been coming into the port of
Halifax in greater numbers every year. I
know one shipping man who said he went te
Montreal four years ago to look after his
business in Halifax, and he took one clerk
with him, but this year he took four clerks;
his business had increased four-fold in four
years.
The tonnage entering and leaving the city of
Halifax for 1927 was greater than the tonnage
entering and leaving the port of Montreal. Of
course, we must not draw wrong conclusions
from that fact, because a 10,000-ton steamer
might go in and run up the figures, though
she carried very little freight; but the
ships are coming in larger numbers on their
way to American ports, and on their return
from those ports.
Besides that, we have
a line of steamers from Nova Scotia te Newfoundland via Halifax, and to New York and
return, and I understand there is another line
contemplating a service from New York to
Halifax and some other points, perhaps around
to Montreal. This change in the situation
at Halifax harbour is really a most hopeful
sign, and in addition to the business effect,
it has a psychological effect upon the city,
for the people are hopeful that this business
will increase, and they are very anxious that
nothing should be done to prevent the trade
continuing as it is, or expanding. I do not
know anything at present about which the
merchants of Halifax are more anxious than
they are as to what effect the harbour conmission may have upon ships and cargoes
that enter and leave that harbour.
Before leaving this part of the subject I
might state that the charges on shipping going into Halifax will be found very moderate.
There is a charge for pilotage; a ship of 600
tons pays $21.60 going in; ships above 600
tons pay 60 cents for every 100 tons above
the 600. A 1,000-ton ship would pay $24 going in and $24 coming out, therefore the
pilotage would cost $48. It is a mere matter
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

of computation to find what a 20,000-ton ship
would pay. Then there is a hospital charge
of $5 twice a year, so that a ship would pay
$10 a year, and would not be charged anything further. Then there are the harbour
master's fees, and that charge is $7 for every
ship over 1,000 ton rate. There are a number
of smaller charges for little vessels that I need
not mention. The harbour master's fee is
called harbour dues in some literature. There
are two kinds of dockage at Halifax-side
dockage and top dockage, which would be
charged against the hull in one case, and in
the other, against the cargo, for landing it.
That charge is absorbed in the freight rate.
say from Liverpool to Montreal, via Halifax,
and the freight rate is worked out by the
railways. What the people are frightened of
is the disturbance of present arrangements.
The Harbour Commission is going to have
turned over to it $13,000,000 worth of property, and as I understand the matter, for a
short time there will be no charge for interest,
the fear is that when the time comes for them
to pay interest on that $13,000,000, and when
they have to keep up repairs on that property,
these costs may be thrown upon the ships
that enter
that harbour.
Besides the
$13,000,000 property that will be turned over
te the Commission, they are getting this loan
of $500,000, and it is contemplated they are
to get another $3,000,000, so it is very difficult to say to what extent this Harbour Commission may go in future. What is desired
is that this state of things which during the
last few years has brought about an increased
trade through Halifax should remain as it is.
I have examined very closely and carefully
the speeches made in another place, and I
find Minister after Minister of the Crown,
particularly the Minister of Militia who comes
from Nova Scotia, declaring that there is no
intention that the tolls and charges on ships
and their cargoes in the eity of Halifax shall
be increased beyond what they are at present.
I do not know whether it is quite regular to
read what they had to say on the point, or
whether it would be very instructive, but honourable gentlemen will find on Hansard pages
2530 to 2546, the allusions to this subject.
The Minister of National Defence, a member
from Nova Scotia, says: "You need net be
frightened about that; we have no intention
whatever of increasing those rates." Another
minister says, with regard to the transfer of
the $13.000.000 of property, that that is not
to become a charge, and not to affect the
tolls and charges on ships and cargoes entering Halifax.

The fact that those ships caîl there may the interests of the port of Halifax, he states

date-when a delegation of worthy citizens
of Saint John, New Brunswick, petitioned the
Minister for similar treatment. The Minister
said ta thema at that time that he was unable
ta make any such distinction between the
port of Saint John and the other ports of the
country, either on the Atlantic or the Pacifie.
The procedure which goveros the fixing of
the tolls and rates at the variaus ports under
Harbour Commissions is this. The Harbour
Commissioners prepare a scale of rates
covering slips, according ta their tonnage
and the freight which they carry, and submit
it te the Minister of Marine and Fisheries,
who studies it with the help cf experts, and,
if they approve, it is submitted to. the Governor in Council. When adopted by the
Gove'rnor in Council that scale becomes
effective in that port.
I draw the attention of my honourable
friend ta the numerous safeguards which surround the fixing cf the rates. Halifax bas a
Commission, composed of citizens of Halifax
who are bent upon promoting the interests
of the Harbour, and also of thc city of
Halifax and the Province of Nova Scotia; andi
ail the conditions that my bonourable friend
bas laid before us as existing to-day, and representing hopes for the development of the
port in the future, are familiar ta these gentlemen and must be uppermost in their minds
when they do anything that may increase
or diminish the potentialities of the port. A
further safegýuard and protection is afforded
by the action of the Governor in Council. A
representative cf the Province of Nova Scotia
sits on the Council. The Government bas
a well known policy-and I am sure it is
the policy of ahl Governments--of extending
the trade of the country and the prosperity
of thc nation. Halifax must be specially
taken cane of. I say specially, hecause it is
the furtlermost port on the Atlantic, and is
the premier feeder of aur Canadian National
Railway system. It is tbrough Hlalifax and
Saint John and aur St. Lawrence ports that
Canada makes its contact with the outside
world. Our exports are cansiderable,' and we
must ail make an effort ta direct thema
through Canadian channels. If we do that
for the greater advantage of the countrýr
those experts will reach the ports on the
Atlantic and on the St. Lawrence. Likewise,
we are ail interested in obtaining return
freigbt, and wlatever cames from Europe is
wvelcomed at our ports. My honourable friend
bas given as one of the reasons why the port
of ilalifax has seemed ta enjoy a larger
patronage during the past few years, the fact
lion. Mr. DANDURAND.

tbat our legisiation offered the importers an
incentive ta use Canadian ports in order ta
enjoy the bonefit of the preference. All this
is indicative of a policy, which I eall the
national policy of Canada; and there can
le no danger, therefore, in allowing the
general policy governing ail aur ports ta
continue regularly without bringing in an
element which would unhinge the wbale
systern and create friction througbout the
country. My banaurable friend cao well
realize that if anyone were to rise in this
CharnIer ta add ta this amendment in order
ta include the port of Saint John, and that
if somneane else were ta ask ta include another part, sudh action would he readily
seized upon in the ather Huse. Perhaps
those ports that have fairly bigh rates wauld
flot be in sa, much hurry ta ask for a permanency of the rates if they felt that under
this amendment some ather parts lad much
Iawer rates.
Having said that, I hope my honourable
friend will flot insist upon bis amendment, and
will a'ccept the affirmations of good will which
le bas found an the lips of tbe Ministers in

I desire ta add ta this statement bearing on
tbe amendment, the fact that rates-wbich
must be fair rates--are flot the principal
element in the develapment of a part. But le.
fore touching an that point I should like ta say
that tbe rates in the future wiIl be or should
be governed at every port by what thec barbaur Boa rds at such ports may deemn the trade
will carry witbaut injury ta their development. My honourable -friend bas said that le
fears that in years ta corne the $13,0O0,000
whicb have been advanced ta Halifax, and
whicl stand againat that part, may be repre.-ented by debentures, thc interest an whinh

part. AIl I cao say 'ta my banourable friend
is tbat tbat charge or load should neyer be in
the way of the prosperity of the port. Thiere
are other parts ta which large surns of rnoncy
have been advanced, and it devolves upon thc
Federal Goveroment, after equipping and
manning aur parts, ta see 'tlat we do not

years. TIc matter of tIc compensation ta be
Teceived fromn those parts should always be
governed by tbe principle tbat the parts must
operate as feeders for aur railways, and for the
creatian of commerce.
I was saying that rates were flot exclusivcly
or mainly a factor in the development of a
part. 1 recognize that there are situations

MAY 8, 1928
auch as tihat nientioned hy my bonourable
friend, of tramp ships and othera stopping at
Halifax on their way to and from American
ports, and I realize that nothing must be donc
to prevent the development of that trade. As
a port is being nursed and devëlopcd, special
care should be taken to watch over its development; but speaking generaily, and without
any reference to speciai conditions, I realize
that there are parts, where no dues are col'lected, which' have not prospered, and that
there are other ports with heavy dues that
have been prosperous, and that have developed
a considerable trade. Many factors enter into
the succes of a port. T-here must be, first, the
machinery for the handling of freight, and, as
we 'have seen by the legislation which has
been passing through this Ohamnber during
this Session, the policy of the Oovernment has
been quite liberal towards the proper development and cfficiency of the ports. I believe
that wc al realize what an important part the
ports play in the life of-the nation, and I amn
sure that my honourabie firiend will rest content with that expression of good-wiii by both
branches of Parliament.

so." The member for Pictou then said: "I
arn sorry I cannot take my honourabie friend's
word for that. He will nat aiways be i hia
present poaition," and the Minister said: "My
honourable friend can take my word for what
has happened in the past, namely, that fia
commission in Canada has yet paid the bis."
Again, in another part, on page 2530 of
Hansard, in anawer ta the sanie rnember, the
Minister says: "I beg my honourabie friend's
pardon. There is no suggestion in this bill
that there shahl he any increase in the port
charges." Then he repeats that, saying:
"What I arn arguing la that there is na suggestion in this bill at ail about increasing
the charges."
Now, if the Governrnent is sincere abaut
this, that there la ta be fia increase in the
port charges at Halifax, let us know it in
this Bill. This arnendment wiil give us that.
I think that my honourabie friend wili da
a great public service if he accepts this
amendment. Ccrtainly it wiil be reccived
with a great deal of favour i that province
of Nova Scatia.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Well, honourable gentlemen, I arn sorry to disappoint rny honourable friend. The fact that other places might
ask for the provision proposed in this arnendment is nlot a complete answer. The situation
at Halifax is cntirely different froni that of
St. John, Qucbec or Montreal. Those three
ports -have a naturai trade. In the St. Lawrence there is certain trade that Quebec is
bound to have, and it wiii stand certain
charges. The sanie thing is more true of
Montreal, and is also true of the port of
St. John; but this trade at Halifax ia buit
up almost altogether frorn passing ships, and
in order to conserve it I think it is absoiuteiy
necessary to assure those ships that corne
there that there will be fia increase in those
charges.
.Taking the honourable gentleman on his
own ternis, there daca not seem to be any
reason why he should not give us thia concession as ta the port of Halifax. In the
other House, when it was pointed out by the
rnember for Pictou that ini order to provide
for itercst charges there wouid necessarily
have to be an increase ini the toila and charges
ini Halifax harbour, the Minister of Militia,
the nienber. of the Governrnent for Nova
Scotia, answered: "Nobody has asked that

the meniber froni Pictou: "I do not care what
the Minister may suggest; they are going ta

There are niovements which sometimes appeal ta popular fancy, and I can understand
that men wouid feel that there la something ta

I think that if we made a speci-al class, and
gave a special position ta Halifax, we would
encourage a great disturbing element, and,
as was very pcoperly said by the leader on
this side. it would lead ta demands of tbe
sarne kind being made by otbers.
Tbe bonourable member bias given 1 as a
reason for bis amendment, tbat navigation
companies must be reassured--tbat rates will
not be changed. Well, that applies ta other
ports as wtell. Take Montreal, or the ports
on the Pacific; they would be obliged ta
ask the same tbing. Tbey are making efforts
ta induce the strong navigation companies ta
establish a system of trading into tbeir ports;
and if an arnendment of that kind were acccpted it would very probably induce coinpanies of that kind ta ask for the saina protection as would have been given ta Halifax.
Foc that reason I tbink the proposed amendment would flot be proper legisiation, beeause
it would create a disturbing elernent.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do flot want ta repeat, but I wish ta remind the bonourable

between Hlalifax and, those other ports; that
Halifax depends solely upon getting tbiýs trade,
wbile those other ports mentioned have a

simply -asking tbat this commission shall flot
increase the toils beyond what tbey are at

MAY 8, 1928
Hon. Mr. MoCORýMICK: If the Government had a system of plans for ail the ports,
we would possibly be endangering the whole
Bill if we inisigted on this amendiment. AIthough I arn a maritime man, and a Nova
&cotian,-I would not, like to do injustice to
any other port. This money has been expended in Halifax for the advantage of the
trade and commerce of the whole country,
not merely for the city of Halifax. Wýith the
city of St. John it la an entirely different
matter, as that city owns the port there, and
they have expended about $2,000,000 for improvements, sa that they are obl'iged, in order
to pay the interest on that'investment, to
charge for those improvements. If we permitted that amendment to go through we
wouýld be giving the port of Halifax an unîair
advantage. over St. Jothn, and I do flot think
we should endanger the whole Bill by doing
that. 1 do flot think it would 'be fair to
do it.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if there is any provision, in the practice of the Department, for
interested parties to be heard on questions
such as that of changing rates. 'That is, a
board of harbour commissioners makes a proposaI for a change in rates, and that gocs before the Minister and the Governor in Council
in order to become effective.
Is it the practice for the merchant and
shipping companies and merchants interested
te be heard by the Minister before such
change is made, or could those changes go
through simply 'by the har4bour commýissioners
represcnting to the Government what they
proposed. and go into effect without the
shippîng people knowing about it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer can
only be a surmise, because 1 have flot put
that question; but I will do so, and inform
myseîf. I would say, however, 'that the harbour commissioners at Halifax would think
very seriously and deeply, and conditions
wouid have to alter very materially, -before
the Commission itself, which is charged wtth
the responsibiity for the port, woul corne
to the Government aind ask to have an increase.
Surely tihat Commission, composed
of three good men, I amn toild, would discuss
the situation with the, principal shippers and
importera, and with the Board of Trade. I
cannot imagine that a question vital to the
Port -of Halifax would be treated in a surreptitious manner or that application would
be made at the Council for increased rates
wîthout the men interested in Halifax being
informed in the matter. Besides there is in
the Council a representative of Halifax, who

would have to bear the responsibility before
the people of Hlifax and of -the whole province. I cannot èonceive of any harm -being
done in this respect. I can conceive of the
Harbour Commission working towards the
betterinent of the situation in Halifax to the
disadvantage of other ports, and the Government resisting such a demand in order te
hold the scales even between different ports.
I cannot imagine mandators -acting against
their mandate. I have neyer seen it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 want ta remind the
honourable gentleman of something I said
hefore the flouse rose. The charges are at
present absox4,ed into the general freight
tariff. Take the Canadian National Railways:
they own the terminals, and in fixing their
rates they absorb all these charges for
wharfa.ge. This amenciment is neot disturhing
that arrangement.
You still have that in
your own hands. Thie objection that 1 have
te the Bill as it stands at present is that that
arrangement, which practically nationalizes
the Port of Halifax, is at once te be disturbcd, and you do net know thaýt these
Clommissioners will make the same allowance
that is now made by the Canadian National
Railways for terminals. Why disturb it?
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: But nobody suggests that the present situation be disturbed.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: But that is what you are

accrues to the Port of Halifax from the fact
that there are working arrangements between
the Canadian National Railways and the Port
authorities? Does he not see how much more

Hon. Mr. ROSS: With regard te Parliament not being able to deal with that complicated situation in Halifax I would point
out that you are dealing right here in the
city of Ottawa with a complication as great,
or greater. The Commission that you have

difficulty in Parliament dealing with a complicated situation than there is in any ether

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand the purport of the amendment, but it seems to me
that the honourable member, if he will allow
me to say se, would place a good deal of
responsibility upon us. Here is a Bill whereby the Government recommends the voting
of half a million dollars to help the Port of
Halifax and improve the terminal facilities
there. Now, if the legislation of the Government is disturbed, the Government may very
properly say, when the Bill goes back to the
Commons, "Drop the Bill."
Hon. Mr. ROSS:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Therefore the Port of
Halifax would suffer in net having the improved facilities.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I do not mind at all that
statement of what the Government would do
about it. They will do, of course, as they
see fit about the matter. That phase would
not move me at all. If they cannot make
good their expressed intentions and goodwill towards the port, of course they have
to withdraw their grant, that is all.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: I would like to say
a word or two before this matter gets too high
in the air. It appears to me that if it continues a little while longer it will be taking
on the character of a national problem almost
greater than the question of the St. Lawrence
Waterways. Now, I do net look at it as
being of such a serious character from the
standpoint of the whole country, and it
appears to me that this is the right place
te deal with it. It is the peculiar function of
the Senate to look after the interests of the
provinces. The people of the city of Halifax
are not the only people who are interested in
the port of Halifax. There are very important interests throughout the province.

has pointed out, it is not a link in any great
national chain; it does not affect Vancouver
or any other province than Nova Scotia; it
is simply a domestic matter. The people
want it, and so far as I have heard the argument up to this moment, there has been no
good reason given why they should not be
granted their request.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable gentlemen,
I could understand and in some measure
appreciate the attitude of my honourable
friend who moved this amendment if he were
thinking and speaking for the province of
Nova Scotia alone. But this is more than
a local question; it is a national question
that has been given consideration for the
last few years particularly, and for many
years to a certain extent. It was not long
ago that the people of the Maritime provinces, uniting more than they ever did before,
made certain representations to the Government with regard to what was required in
those provinces. As a result of that unity
on the part of the people the Government
appointed what was known as the Duncan
Commission.
That Commission examined
very carefully into all matters relating to the
Maritime provinces, and, amongst other
things, it reported in favour of Harbour Commissions for the ports of Saint John and Halifax. In response to the Report the Government have brought in legislation for the control of both those ports.
I can understand my honourable friend in
a way not being able-and possibly it would
not be quite fair-to compare the situation
of Halifax or Saint John with that of the
larger port of Montreal, or even Vancouver
or Quebec, but we can make a comparison
between the ports in the Maritime provinces.
A few days ago we passed here a Bill organizing and establishing a Harbour Board
for the city of Saint John in language almost
identical witlh that used in the Bill we are
discussing to-night for the creation of a Harbour Board for the port of Halifax. Not a
word was said with regard to taking anything
away from the responsibility of the Harbour
Board of Saint John, but to-night we have
an amendment offered to the effect that some
special provision should be made for the port
of Halifax. I say this is a national question,
not a local one, and as a representative of the
province of New Brunswick I fear that if
any particular favours are handed out to the
port of Halifax-if this amendment is adopted
and incorporated in the law and regulations
with regard to that port-a feeling of rivalry
between Halifax and Saint John, a feeling
that has been dead for the last two or three

years, may be revived. I feel, not only as a
citizen and a representative in this Parliament of the Province of New Brunswick,
but as a representative of national life, that
we should forget these local issues.
The
Government are trying to develop along
broad national lines, not one port in competition with another, but all the ports ai
Canada; and we are equipping and financing
many ports, because we feel that their development means a great deal to the trade
of this country. I feel that a very great
mistake would be made if this amendment
were carried giving the port of Halifax this
particular privilege over the other ports of
the Dominion of Canada. I cannot support
the amendment, and I regret very much that
my honourable friend feels that lie must
press it at the present time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
It seems to me
that the peculiar position of Halifax in relation to a very large part of its trade has been
overlooked. Trans-Atlantie steamers having
termini not only in Europe but in the United
States and engaging in the transit trade have
been in a gradually increasing degree making
Halifax a port of call. For many years none
of them did it; they began it tentatively, and
they are continuing to carry it on. A trade
like that, where it is a question of landing
some passengers or a few thousand tons of
freight from a steamer which -carries many
hundred passengers and many thousand tons
of freight, could very easily disappear, and it
is that which makes the question of charges
of cal;l all-important. Take whatever boats
you will that are engaged in that trade, and
you will find that what their managers take
into account is the pilotage at this particular
port. the port charges, the price at which they
can get bunker coal, or if slie happens to be
an oil burner, the question of whether there
is a supply of oil and its cost.
If this amendment should carry, I hope no
disastrous consequences will follow. If it
should not, I think there is no question of
making a distinction that would benefit or
hurt any other port, because that tonnage
cannot go to Saint John. That part of the
traýde going up the St. Lawrence might call at

some day it wilil have.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is a twin brother of the Immigration Bil
which. we diqcussed last week. I say a twin
brother advisedly, because the two pieces of
legisiation involved were passed on one and
the same day in 1919, and for the same reason.
They were a resuit of the strike that took
place in the city of Winnipeg.
Now, I intend to give as concisely as possible the state of the criminal law up to the
amendment of 1919, and the effeet of the
amendment of that year. The criminal law
up to 1919 provided for the repression of seditien, seslitious libel, seditious words, and unlawful meetings. The enactments concerning
sedition are to be found in sections 87, M3>
132, 135, and 136 of the Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will my honourable friend let me jnterrupt him. for a moment? I arn sure he does not want to misjnform the House as to these amendments to
the Criminal Code being passed at the same
time as the amendments to the Immigration
Act. The amendments to the Immigration
Act were passed by the House of Commons ort
May 12, 1919, and were amended on June 6,
and received the Royal, Assent on June 6,
The amendinents to the Criminal Code were
passed on July 19, 1919, or nearly a month
and a half afterwards.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will admit they were the resuit of the
same circurnstaflces.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not at ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIiAND: That was my
recol-lection. I stand corrected by xny hornourable friend, as he was in the Cabinet at that
time and was f ollowing that legisiatioýn.
I said that up to 1919 the Criminal Code
defined gedition. That is to say, it contained
provisions, the objeet of which was the punishment of seditious offences. There were three
or four clauses which covered that matter.
Section 133, which before the revision of
the statute was section 132, says:
Seditious words are words expressive of a
sediticus intention.
A seditious libel is a libel expressive oi a,
seditious intention.

amendment, if -earried, would be to perpetuate
this situation?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No. Parliamient could
change it next Session. A good constitutional
lawyer like my honourable friend ought to
know that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUR.T: If any attempt
were mnade next year to amend the law, the
people of Halifax would say: "You gave us
that grant, and we have built works on the
condition that the rates would not be increased."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, nol Not at al!
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They would set
that up.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: They hrave no right te
set it up. I made a statement to guard
against that very thing. This prevents the
(2Commiagioners, raising the existing rates, but
there is nothing that can tie the banda of
Parliament. More than that, I made the
statement that I was not rnoving the amendment with a view of creating a situation so
that it could be said: "Oh, you did so and

admit frankly that Parliantent can do as it

that Act. Those exceptions are to be found
in the Bill which is now before us. They were
repealed in the Act of 1919, and now it is
sought to reinstate them in the criminal law.
The section which I have read was followed
by this clause:
No one shall be deemed to have a seditious
intention only because he intends in good
faith,"(a) to show that His Majesty has been
misled or mistaken in his measures; or,
"(b) to point out errors or defects in the
government or constitution of the United Kingdom, or of any part of it, or of Canada or any
province thereof. or in either House of Parliament of the United Kingdom or of Canada,
or in any legislature, or in the administration
of justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects
to attempt to procure, by lawful means, the
alteration of any matter in the state; or,
"(c) to point out, in order to their removal,
matters which are producing or have a tendency
to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjeets."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What section is
that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was 133 up to
1919.
By the legislation of 1919 it was
dropped, and now it is sought to reinstate it.
My honourable friend will see it on the second
page of the Bill which I am now discussing.
Now, I have said that up to 1919, and even
up to this day, "seditions intention" has not
been defined 'by Parliament. An effort was
made in Great Britain to define it, but after
considerable discussion Parliament decided to
allow it to remain under the Common Law.
In 1890 and 1891, when we discussed the
codification of our criminal law, the matter
was taken up by the Canadian Commissioners,
and the definition that had been atempted
in the British Parliament was submitted to
the House; but, as in England, the House of
Commons, after a prolonged debate, decided
te retain the common law definition of
seditious intention, and to leave to the judge
and jury the decision as to what was an overt
act. The other day I quoted from Crankshaw. In his fifth edition, page 143, he cites
Sir James Stephen on this matter as follows:
TI tracing with his usual clearness and ability,
the history of this most interesting branch of
the law, the late Sir James F. Stephen says
that there are "two different views of the relation between rulers and their subjects. If the
ruler is regarded as the superior of the subject,
as being by the nature of his position presumably wise and good-the rightful ruler and
guide of the whole population,-it must
sarily follow that it is wrong to censureneceshim
openly, that, if he is mistaken, his mistakes
should be pointed out with the utnimost respect,
and, that whether mistaken or not, no censure
should be cast upon him likely or designed
te diminish his authority. If, on the other
hand, the ruler is regarded as the agent or servantHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

-in our democracy the ruler is Parliament-and the subject as the wise and good master
who is obliged to delegate his power to the soealled ruler because, being a multitude, he
canaot use it himself it is obvious that this
sentiment must be reversed. Every member of
the publie who censures the ruler for the time
beimg exercises in his own person the right
which belongs to the whole of which he forms
part, He is finding fault with his servant. If
others think differently, they can take the other
side of the dispute, and the utmost that can
bappen is that the servant will be dismissed and
another put in his place, or perhaps that the
arrangements of the houseold will be modified.
Te those wbo hold this view fully, and carry it
out to all its consequences, there can be no such
offence as sedition. There nay indeed be
breaches of the peace, whic mnay destroy or
endanger life, limb or property, and there may
be incitements to such offences, but no imagmiable censure of the government, short of censure
which bas an immediate tendency to produce
such a breach of the peace, ought to be regarded as criminal."
I mention that opinion of Stephen's simply
to indicate the two interpretations that can
be given as to what is called sedition in
words, more than in action. I stated that if
we retained sedition, not as defined, but as
expressed by our criminal law, we would have
all the same safeguards against the attempt
to curb the expressions of condemnation of
the Parliamentary system, or the actions of
the hasty, and those safeguards against an
undue repression of free criticism were in that
Act which was recalled in 1919, but which is
now found in the Bill before us, in an effort
to reinstate them. Under this clause, 133-A,
there is this:
133a. No one shall be deemed to have a sed:tious intention only becaise he intends in good
faith,(a) to show that His MNajesty has been misled
or mistaken in his measures; or,
(b) to point out errors or defects in the
government or constitution of the United Kingdom. or of any part of it, or of Canada or any
pravince thereof, or in either House of Parlianent of the United Kingdom or of Canada, or
un any legislature, or in the administration of
Justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects to
attempt to procure, by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in the state; or,
(c) to point out, in order to their removal,
matters which are producing or have a tendency
to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.
Now, the section which I have just read
was repealed; it was a safeguard against undue
repression of free speech, and was replaced by
section 98.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: When was it repealed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In 1919 and it
was replaced by section 98, which in its turn,

his opinion as to the effect of this clause:
Any dictionary will show that "force" bas
a very wide meaning, covering "influence",
"ýpressure"~, and the like. If the statute meant
"physical force" it would not go on to
enumerate "violence" and "physical injury".
A court would bie quite justifled in interpreting the word in its natural or dictionary sense.
As for the word "terrorism" Borne light eau
bie thrown upon the ifiterpretation of it, by
that given it in the Winnipeg case of Rex v.
Russell. There Judge M1etcalfe says:
"To walk around about, for instance, to a
place where people are employed in large
numbers, and to 'boo', gentlemen of the jury,
as much terroir may be inspired through that
as by two or three flghting chaps coming along
with bludgeons. Take it fromn me, in strikes
you eau incite terroir without hitting a man
over the head. You can incite terroir of
starvation; you can incite terroir of thirst.
Io not that quite as effective as inciting by
bodily violence? Your stomach will bring you
quicker than a crack on the head sometimes.
If it is possible that picketing can bie done in
this country, then the lawful method of picketing is s0 ineffective that it is a reasonable
inference that in a strike of this ciass, unlawful
means would be intended to bie applied. Some-

502

times it has a deterring effect upon people's
minds by exposing them to have their motions
watched, and to encounter blaclk looks."
The use of these words leaves the door wide
open for the prosecution of every trade union
in Canada. If "force" is intended to mean
"physical force" it should be so stated. The
pressure or influence exerted by trade unions
is the exercise of "force". That can be interpreted to come within the above section. Read
the following extract from Judge Metcalfe's
charge to the jury in the Russell case:
Mr. O'Donoghue continues with this extract
from Judge Metcalfe's charge to the jury in
the Russell case, one of the Winnipeg cases:
"Mr. Russell gave us his idea of a sympathetic strike.
H1e said, 'When a dispute
originates between an employer and his
employees, and wien the labour organizations
sec that organization being beat, they corne to
their assistance by calling a strike to force
their enployers to bring force to bear upon the
original disputants to make settlement.' That
is Russell's definition given in the box. . . . .
Force, force, force."
Now, section 2 of the Bill says-and as 1
proceed I desire to reiterate that I am giving the point of view of the Labour Unions as
expressed by their Congress:
(2) Any property, real or personal, belonging or suspected to belong to an unlawful
association, or held or suspected to be held by
any person for or on behalf thereof may,
without warrant, be seized or taken possession
of by any person thereunto authorized by the
Comniîssioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and may thereupon be forfeited to His
Majesty.
There is here a seizure which can ibe made
without warrant on mere suspicion, and it
entails forfeiture.
Now, Lord Camden is
cited as to the meaning of a seizure without
warrant.
This is Lord Camden's opinion.
He asks:
Where is the written law that gives any
magistrate such a power? I can safely answer
there is none, and therefore it is too much for
-us withouît authority to pronounce a practice
legal which would be subversive of all the
conforts of society.
If suspicion at large
should be a ground of search, especially in the
case of libels (Le. scditious publications), whose
home would be safe?
Section 4 I have not read, but will read
now:
In any prosecution under this section, if it be
proved that the person charged has
(a) attended meetings of an unlawful association; or
(b) spoken publicly in advocacy of an unlawful association; or
(c) distributed literature of an unlawful
association by circulation through the Post
Office mails of Canada, or otherwise,
it shall be presumed, in the absence of proof
to the contrary, that he is a member of such
unlawful association.
It is represented by the labour associations
that under Mr. Justice Metcalfe's interpretaHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

tion a trades union advising or engaging in a
strike might be held to be an unlawful association, and the accused might be an innocent
person attending one of the meetings not as a
participant, but simply as a curious onlooker.
Subsection 5 says:
Any owiner, lessee, agent or superintendent
of any building, room, prenises or place, who
knowingly permits therein any meeting of an
unlawful association or any subsidiary associatien or branch or committee thereof, or any
assemblage of persons who teach, advocate, advise or defend the use, without authority of
the law, of force, violence or physical injury
to person or property, or threats of such inju y, shall be guilty of an offence under this
section and shall be liable to a fine of not more
than five thousand dollars or to imprisonment
for not more than five years, or to both fine and
imprisonment.
Labour organizations find that with this
clause it becomes more and more difficult
for them to rent buildings because of that
threat which is hanging over the lessors, of
entry and seizure simply on suspicion.
Subsections 8, 9 and 10 apply to persons
who print, import, sell or distribute books,
newspapers, etc. These clauses are very broad
and general, and anyone who may happen to
have in his possession, or to sell, a book or
newspaper containing in some corner an expression of opinion which can be held to fall
under these clauses, would be liable to imprisonment up to twenty years.
Such are the fears expressed by the labour
associations, and the reasons why they have
asked that this legislation be repealed. They
claim that under it they can be threatened in
many ways. They claim also that under
the old Act, whidh provided for the punishment of sedition, there was ample protection
for society. They ask that, as these exceptional clauses by their broad terms apply to
men who may have had no guilty intentions,
the safeguards which were contained in the
old Act and are now included in the second
clause of this Bill should be reinstated in the
Criminal Code. Honourable gentlemen will
notice that such safeguards do not exist at
present, and they are most important. They
followed the clause which referred to felonious
or seditious intention. It will be understood
that with such a broad expression as "seditious intention" it is necessary to protect free
speech and criticism on the part of His
Majesty's Loyal Opposition. For this reason
section 133A should to my mind, be reinstated:
No one shall be deemed to have a seditious
intention only beca.use he intends in good faith,1
(a) to show that His Majesty has been misled
or mistaken in his measures.

MAY 8, 1928
We ail know that His Majesty means the
King in Couneil; that is, the executive responsible to Parliarnent-a Committee of
Parliament.
(b) to point out errors or defects in the
of the United -ing~overnment or constitutionor of Canada or any
aom, or of any part of it,
prvnce thereof, or in either House of Parliamrent of the United Kingdoma or of Canada,
or in any legisiature, or in the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure, by lawful means,
the alteration of any matter in the state; or,
(c) to point out, in order to their rernoval,
matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and illmwill between different classes of His Majesty's
subjeûts.
With these explanations, honourable gentlemen, I lay the Bill befoire you. As I bave
said, its purpose is to offset exceptional legislation arising out of the excitement of the
events of 1919. Peace now reigns in Canada.
The disturbance was but a passing phase. The
spirit of our people was not curbed by the
legisiation we no-w seek to repeal. Our people,
as I have said, are animnated by a sincere respect of the law, but the legisIation of 1919
has created a spirit of criticismi and recrimination among a large portion of our population, who now ask that it be repealed.
My honourable friend from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) inquired the other day
whether there was any reason why we should
protect people who were described as assassions, etc., and whether the labour organizations were jumping to the conclusion. that
they were aimed at by such opprébrious termes.
In answer to my honoura-ble .friend I would
point out that such accusations, if brought
against him or against myself, would not
frigliten us much, because we oould easily
defend ourselves, but labour men are strong
only in association. The strong arrn of the
law can reach the labour man and sometimes
deaI summarily with him, whereas iny honouraible friend from Hamilton and myseîf

clem ent feel that they must protect themselves by joint action. It is by joint action
that they bave succeeded inii mproving thieir
conditions in the industrial and economic
world. It is tbrough associations in trades
unions that they have succeeded. in protecting themselves against undue exploitation,
and it is on the same principle of self-protection in the exercise of what they deem. to
be their rights that they are jealous of any
legislation which might faîl more heavily upon
them than upon men who stand higher in the
sociail scale.

o

That is what I desired to say ini support of
this measure, which would mean a closing out
of the passing events of 1919 and the restoration of norinalcy in our penal legisiation.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY : May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? What eall
has 'been miade upon the Goverument by the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada in the
last few years?
Han. Mr. DANDURAND : 1 can answer rny
honourable friend. 'Every year the representatives of the Trades and Labour Congreas

and t'hey lay before tihe members of the
Cabinet their claims. ilt wa% not my good
fortune to be present at the conference held
during ýthis Session, but I was present last
year, and I see by -a stateinent of the Minister
of Justice that the Congress made the saine
demand again this year. Inu making it last
year, I remember, they took advantage of my
presence to say: "For the first time in recent
years we see present a representative of tha
Senate, and we wonder if his heart will not
meit, and the heartB of his colleagues, and if
they 'will not render us justice."
Hlon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Did they
meit you?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I remember the
incident quite well because of that personal
appeal to myseif as representing the Senate on
that occasion.
The representatives from the Congress are
received with ceremony, and each of the delegates from the largest 'branches of their Congresa arises and expîsins a resolution or twvo.
There are a considerable number of resolutions, oovering ail the matters that they have
at beart. According to tihe Minister of Justice,
they have corne every year asking for the removal of this legisiation from the Statuts
Book, and to my personal knowledge they did
s0 last year.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I know that this
legisiation undoubtedily originated at a time of
more or less panic and excitement. It was very
necessary at that tirne, I think. T-hose who
live in the West know týhat many of the persons
who instigated the proceedings in Winnipeg
wanted to overthrow organized government.
This legisiation was doubtless introduced for
the purpose of Tepressing such persons and
coping properly with any continuance or renewai of an effort of that kind. I was not
aware that organized labour, who have neyer
been persecuted, as I take it, under this legislation had in the last few years beau re-

504

newing annually their representations for its
repeal. I have no warrant to speak on behalf
of organized labour at all, but I do know that
there are other things which the Government
is attempting to deail with at this Session and
which to them. are dearer than the repeal of
this legislation.
I do not know whether any representations
have been made by the labour organization in
the province of Quebec not allied with the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada. I
refer to the Catholic Federation, whose proper
name I do not remember. It has a numerous
membership.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At this meeting
of which I speak there were representatives
from the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Asking what?
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: They were there
jointly with the others.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: As I say, I am
not criticizing the act of the Government
particulady, but I have grave doubts whether
the stable, sane labour movement of Canada
attach any special importance to the repeal of
this legislation at the present time. There is
outside organized labour an element which
is a constant menace, not only to organized
labour, but sometimes also to established
society. Many in tha-t element are sworn
enemies of organized labour and do whatever
they can to defeat its ends. I can quite understand that that particular element is
anxious for the repeal of any legislation that
may curb its activities.
If, however, the honourable leader of the
Government in this House says that the repeal of this legislation is one of the requesto
made by organized labour, I have nothing
further to say.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows Mr. Tom Moore?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Oh, yes.

strongly in favour of the repeal of the legislation.

Hon. Mr. MoLENNAN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if I am right in having
understood him to say that organized labour
as.represented by the Trades Unions 'of Canada accepted the definition of "unlawful associations" as given in section 98, namely:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

(1) Any Association, organization, society or
corporation. whose professed pirpose or one of
whose purposes is to bring about any governmental, industrial or economie change within
Canada, by use of force, violence or physical
injury to person or property..
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I am reading from
section 98. Do the Trades Unions of Canada,
speaking officially to the 'Government of Canada, accept that as a definition of their purposes and aims?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With reference
to that section they complain that the word
"force" does not necessarily mean physical
force, but may mean pressure, because the section goes on to refer to "violence". The word
"force' as interpreted in the dictionary would
not necessarily be Jimited to physical force. I
may inform my honourable frienid that |persons who opposed the repeal of this legislation
before that expression of opinion as .to the
meaning of the word "force" have said: "Well,
if that is the 'legal interpretation, or the possible legal interpretation, we would be ready
'to consider amendments to correct a construction which we had not in view." It is
simply to indicate on that very point what is
an "unlawful association." You must look at
the words which describe and define "unlawfui association." They say that under the
terms of this Ant any association advocating
a strike or a general strike or a sympathetic
strike could be made te fall under the termis
of this clause.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does not
the honourable gentleman know that there is
a rule of law, called ejusdem generis, observed
in every court, that words of the same kind,
coming together as these do, receive the same
interpretation. When words of that kind
appear in legislation you constantly find that
where it is intended to give them a particular
or a different interpretation it is so stated.
All courts follow that rule.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend understands fairly well that I have
tried to put before this Chamber the point
of view of the labour associations that have
come to us with their fears. I am not expressing my own fears of the Act, because
I wouild not be disposed to accept all the
various interpretations which Mr. O'Donoghue
bas put upon the Act; but the sentiments
thrown out by the labour organizations are
given expression in their resolutions.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
honourable Leader of the Government re-

MAY 8, 1M2
ferred to the remarks which I made the
other day, and seemed *to insist on giving
them the turn that I charged that labour
unions would corne withmn these laws.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. The
honourable gentleman proceeded by way of a
question. He said to me: Does the honourable gentleman desire us to believe that the
labour organizations are disposed to put
themselves under the ternis of this resolution
which speaks of assassination and so forth?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
What I
said was this: That people who wanted to
offend against this law tried to clothe themselves in the uniform of the labour organizations; that in my opinion the labour organizations had no fear of heing brought; within
this law; that it was only those who happened to be in labour organizations, and
who wanted by force and violence to bring
about their ends, who were trying to drag
in their connection with labour organizations
and make those organizations bear a burden
which they are not entitled to bear. The
labour organizations in Canada are coinposed of a lot of law abiding people' and
I do net think that we should be influenced
by the arguments of men who want to get
this Iaw repeailed se that they may offend,
as they did in Winnipeg, by saying it is aimed
at labour organizations. It neyer ivas aimed
at them. The law of this country has always been particularly solicitous about the
protection of labour orgs.nizations. My protest was against people who were pretending,
when they knew better, that labour was in
danger under the present state of the law.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend presented his arguiment differently, but
I have no doubt that was what was in his
mind.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, a few words on this subject may be
fitting at this time. I want first'to cali the
attention of my hionourable friend the Leader
of the House to the flact that it has been
oommonly stated, and the statement has been
bandied about for the last five or six years,
that the two pieces of legislation which we
have been considering, as embodied ini the
Criminal Code and in section 41 of the Immigration Act were the result of Parliament's
action during a panic, and Vhat such action
was taken hastily and without consideration,
and that therefore th-ose provisions should now
be rescinded. That statement is true only a
far as one speciflo amendment to section 41

505

of the Immnigration Act is concerned. I will
take just a minute to impress that fact upon
the House.
The Winnipeg strike, which lias been referred.te, and which I do not intend to discuse
in detail, began, as I remeniber it, on May 15,
1919. Wben I turn to the House of Commons; Hansard of May lst, of tat year, page
1956, I find that an honourable member of
that House moved:
That Messrs. Guthrie, Tweedie, Melntosh,
Allan, *Thomson (Qu'Appelle), Boys, Douglas
(Cape Breton South), Jacobs, Murphy, Ross,
Archambault and Copp, be appointed a special
committee to consider and report upon the law
relating to sedition and seditious propaganda,
and on any changes in the law which may be
considered necessary to meet the existing conditions, and that the said Committee have
power te oit while the House is in session.
Mr. Speaker then proceeded to say:
This motion can only be entertained by
unanimous consent. Is it the pleasure of the
Hlouse to adopt the motion?
Thereu-pon, I find, the motion was agreed to
without further debate. Therefore it is true,
as shown by the record, that two weeks before
Parliament knew there was to be any disturbance in the city of Winnipeg the House
of Conimons appointed a special Committee
to inquire into that subject and to report
upon the changes in tjhe law that were considered necessary.
I want to clear up that
peint, because I ama sure -ny honourable friend
and his Governsnent, and the supporters of
that Governient, do nat desire to commuxucate an improper opinion to the public at large
upon so important a subject. There is the
record of what was done by the unanimous
consent of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Will my honourable
friend read the motion again, please?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON (reading):
-to consider and report upon the law relating
te sedition and seditious propaganda, and on
any changes in the law which may be considered necessary to meet the existing conditions, and that the said Comniittee have power
to ait while the House is in session.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: What conditions?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Can my honourable friend tell me if the Commitee reported,
and if so, on what date?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have net looked
that up. All I wanted to do was te make it
clear that this legislation was not passed after
the Winnipeg strike occurred, or as a result
of panic ini the country. That impression is
quite incorrect, although I know it is generally
understood to be the fact.
Now, honourable gentlemen, my honourable friend the Leader of the Government

SENATE

506

bas made a very excellent and strenuous plea
on behaîf of labour onganizations in Canada,
and bas quoted a resolution that was rubmitted to Parliament in 1920, and a very able
report upon that subject made by a gentleman leanned in the law. As the liead of one
labour organization in Canada, with 8,000
members in this country, 1 arn preparcd to
say that neyer during the last eight years
when this more or less controversial question
bas been discussed, have I seen a paper, or
one member of the 8,000 wlior I have the'
honour to represent, that thouglit it wortli
wbile to mention the question. Therefore, I
do not agree that there is general unrest
among the members of the bona fide trade
unions who respect and fulfil the contracts
into which they have entered with employers.
A very large number of those men, probably
the majority, own property and have an interest in the State and the interests of the
State. They are not concerned about or
afraid of the provisions of section 98 of the
Cnirninal Code.
So. far as the other piece of legislation
which the Leader of the Governent will
submit following this is concerned, they are
sornewhat interested. They are interested
for the basic and fundarnental reason that by
its provisions certain Britishi subjects rnay be
denied the right to trial by jury-a basic and
fundarnental riglit which Britishi subjects
have enjoyed for many centuries past, and
one which they truly prize. When the Leader
of the Governrnent was discussing that Bill
the other day, what did lie say? He said
that one of the neasons why the Governent
asked for the nepeal of section 41 of the
Immigration Act wvas that the provisions of
the Crirninal Code wcne ample to meet al
eeregncies.
My position is this. The day may corne
when the Canadian Panhiament can safely repeal section 98 of the Crirninal Code; but,
in view of aIl that we know, in view of what
the honounable gentleman frorn Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) laid befone this House
a few weeks ago with nefenence to Coinmunistic propaganda in Canada, I sulimit that
the tirne lias not yet arrived. In a jocular
rnood I arn inclined to suggest to rny honourable friend that the saine delegation tbat annually meets this Government has on each
occasion demanded other things than this
repeal-things in whicli lie, apparently, is
not nearly s0 mucli interested nor so anxious
ta bring into effect. I think lie will agnee
Bon. Mn. ROBERTSON.

that that saine delegation has asked year
after year for the abolition of the Senate,
and, during the last year or two, for certain
very substantial arnendrnents te, its powers.
They did, and
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I gave thern the reasons why it could nlot be
done.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I mention that
in order that the House rnay realize that rny
honourable friend is sympathetic towards one
of their requests, but nlot towards ail.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He is trying to
do something for tliem.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For reasons wýhich
I will be glad to give the House, when the
other Bill cornes up for discussion, iI arn prepared ta go along with my honourable friend
in saying that section 43 of the Immigration
Act is no longer useful, and that its repeal
would tend to ind'ustrial peace; 'but in view
of what we know, in view of the Cornmunistic
propaganda that is going on, and in view cf
what I ithink is true-namely, that there lias
been sornewhat of a revival and increase ini
that propaganda in Canada during the past
two or three years-I ask why this legisiation,
which i.s a reai protection against infractions of
the law that menit discipline, legislation which
bas neyer injured any honest citizen, lie he
workman or otherwise, should lie rernoved from
the Statue Book? I think Parliament would
be well advised to continue it at ]east until
ail semblance of Cornrunistic activities in
Canada shall have passed; tiben, wlien that
elernent of labour lias subsided and submitted
to law and order, and bas stated its intention
of doing so, the tirne may bave arrived when
section 98 of the Criminail Code should lie repealed.
I want ta ýmake this clear. T-here are in
Canada 200,000 men, in labour organizations
that I could narne, who are in exactly the saine
position as the 8,000 men whom I have the
lionuur to represent, and who do not care a
whit about this bit of legisiation. It is nlot
loing tiern any harrn, and tbey are not afraid
)f it. I do say, however, that many of those
saine rnen feel that section 41 of the Immigration Act is discrirninatory against British
subjects; and, even thougli I think it oan be
readily shown that it is not, I believe it serves
no good purpose. Therefore I will support
the continuance of section 98 of the Criminal
Code so long as certain elements, wbo caîl
thernselves labour men, continue to, make it
necessary to protect society against eventualities, and until such tirne as those people can
co-operate with the honest labour unions of
Canada, Whoýse members are citizens finst, and

MAY 8, 1928
who attempt to defend their own interests only
after they have performed their duties to the
State. Then we will ail be of the same fraine
of mimd, and probebly Parliament need have
no fear of repealing -the section now under
consideration. Until that time, however, that
element at 'which the legielation is directed wil
continue to be responsible for maintaining this
law on the Statute Book. .

IMMIGRATION BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINO-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed the adjourned deïbate
on the motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for
the second reading of Bill 187, an Act to
amenîd the Immigration Act.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, I regret to have to imupose myself
upon the House twice in one day, but 1 will
endeavour ta be as brief as possible in the
discussion of this Bill.
1 wish firat to make clear the fact that
Section 41 of the Immigration Act which is
now under discussion wag only in a small part
enacted at a time when it might be said
that the minds of Parliament and the people

507

were disturbed, and therefore that it mîght
The Imbe regarded as hasty lcgislation.
migration Act itscîf in 1919 underwent a very
general revision. It wae introduced into Parliament and got it-s first reading on April 7,
1919, and received its third reading in the
House of Commons on May 12, 1919, three
days before Parliament knew -anything of any
disturbance in Winnipeg.
The revision of that Act was very general.
The honourable gentleman who fa.t'hercd the
Bill, piloted it through the House of Cýommons
succssfully, nýow sits in this Chamber. At
that time the following sections were revised
and given third reading, as I said, on May 12,
1919: Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 22, 27, 28, 29,
33, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 58.
In order that we may have the record clear,
may I reail Section 41 as it was passed on
that date, three days before Parliament knew
of any disturbance anywhere.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not passcd separately from, the Immigration Act?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. No, I arn coming to that. There was an amendment with
which I shahl deal. Section 41 as passed on
May 12 by the House of Commons, having
been discussed. ini Committee some two
weeks prior ta that time, reads as follows:
41. Whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen advocates in Canada the overthrow
by force or violence of the government of
Great Britain or Canada, or other British
dominion, colony, possession or dependency, or
the overthrow by force or violence of constituted law and authority, or the assassination of
any official of the Government of Great Britain
or Canada or other British dominion, colony,
possession or dependency, or of any foreigu
teaches the ungovernment, or advocates or or shall by word
lawful destruction of property,
or act create or attempt to create riot or publie
diborder in Canada, or shail by common repute
belong ta or be suspected of belonging to any
secret society or organization which extorts
money from, or in any way attempts to control
any resident of Canada by f orce or threat of
bodily harm, or by blackmail, or who is a
member of or affiliated with any organization
entertaîning or teaching disbelief in or opporition to organized government; such person for
the purposes of this Act shaîl be considered as
belonging to the prohibited or undesirable
classes, and shaîl be hiable to deportation, and
it shaîl be the duty of any officer becoming
cognizant thereof, and the duty of the clerk,
secretary or other officiai of any municipality
in Canada wherein such person niay be, to
forthwîth send a written complaint thereof ta
the Minister giving full particulars.
That is Section 41 as it was introduoed in
the House of Parliament on April 7, 1919,
five weeks before trouble was known o! anywhere, and it was given a third reading in the
other House three days before the Winnipeg
incident broke out. Therefore I would again

508

SENATE

point out to the House that the general report, circulated now for eight years, to the
effect that this legislation was rushed through
Parliament in fifteen minutes, as I heard
some one say, is absolutely wide of the
truth.
Now, those amendments to the Act, with
all those clauses, came over to the Senate,
and, they were considered carefully, and were
passed in the form that I have read, Section
41. If I remember correctly, they were passed
on June 4, and given a third reading here.
However, on June 6 the late Sir James Lougheed, leader of the Government in this
House, introduced an amendment to Section
41, of which I will give the House details in
a moment. But I want first to deal with
the reasons why these amendments were introduced; there were two, and I will read
them shortly. But I want to preface the
reading by giving the reasons why they were
introduced. One was that of May 19. The
honourable the leader of the Opposition in
this House, who now graces the chair of Mr.
Speaker, inquired of the Government as to
what was going on in Winnipeg, and whether
or not Federal authorities were taking any
cognizance of the difficulty, or leaving it all
to the provinces. Those are not his words,
but that, in brief, is what he said. A few
days after that, on May 21, the same honourable gentleman in the discharge of his
duties as leader of the Opposition in this
House, made similar but more minute inquiries, and on the last occasion, May 26,
directed his inquiry particularly to the Postmaster-General concerning the delay, and
interruption of transportation and delivery of
the Royal Mail. Then, on June 5, the honourable member for De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain), on the Orders of the Day,
made a rather pointed speech calling attention to the Government to the reports that
were current at that time about a sympathetic
strike in Winnipeg and its probably farreaching effects, and read into the record the
fact that he had in his possession at that
time a protest from 26 labour organizations
urging that something be done to protect
bona fide labour organizations from being
compelled or brought into a sympathetic
strike maelstrom.
That was one of the reasons why the Governinent of the day did consider the necessity of advisability of strengthening the law
as far as possible to meet what was a real
emergency at that time; but it was not because of any voluntary act or desire of the
Government of that day to be arbitrary, or
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

to hit somebody with a club. It was because
His Majesty's Loyal Opposition was demanding action, day after day, in this House and
in the other House as well. If honourable
gentlemen will look at the record they will
find what was going on.
The other cause was that a report had
come to the Government that at midnight
on a certain date, May 17, a number of men
had gathered themselves together on the
banks of the Red river in Winnipeg, and by
solemn proclamation declared the existence
of a Soviet Government in western Canada.
Naturally it was never possible to prove
absolutely the details or the truth of that
report, but the very fact that immediately
following that, certain gentlemen in Winnipeg
were functioning as ministers of the Soviet
Government and requiring citizens to have
permits to purchase a bottle of milk-not a
gallon of liquor, but milk-or a loaf of bread.
or to send a telegram. As Minister of Labour
I say to you now, as I said before, that there
are photostatic copies on record of those permits without which those articles could not
be procured or telegrams transmitted. So
that I think the corroborative evidence justified the Government of that day in issuing
such a proclamation as I have referred to.
Therefore on June 6, 1919, the then leader of
the Government in this House introduced an
amendment to section 41 of the Immigration
Act. I will just read it. The first amendment was after the words "attempt to create
riot or public disorder in Canada," insert
these words: "or who without lawful authority assumes any powers of government in
Canada or any part thereof."
Now, that was inserted obviously because
of this information which the Government
at that time had, that already there were
men who were guilty of declaring by their
proclamation the establishment of another
government in this country. I leave it to the
judgment of the House whether under those
conditions such an amendment was justified.
The other amendment, that was added to
the end of section 41, reads as follows:
Provided that this section shall not apply
to any person who is a British subject either
by reason of birth in Canada or by reason of
naturalization in Canada, and proof that any
person belonged to or was within the description of any of the prohibited or undesirable
classes within the meaning o! this section at
any time since the fourth day of May, 1910,
shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed
to establish prima facie that he still belongs
to such prohibited or undesirable class cr
classes.
Those were the amendments that were proposed by the leader of the Government in
this House on June 6, 1919, and those amend-

MAY 8, 1928
ments passed both Houses that day, and were
passed that day because it had already been
arranged that the Deputy Governor was to
corne down on the evening of June 6 to give
Royal Assent to a substantial number of Bils.
1 think honourable gentlemen wilI appreciate the fact that 1 had some knowledge of
what occurred at that time, and I therefore
make this explanation for the purpose, and in
the hope, of making it absolutely clear as to
the how.and the why of what then occurred.
Passing -over the incidents that followed, I
make ne reference except ithis, that in tfhe bona,
fide railroad organizatione of ail sor'ts in the
Éunning trades, express and telegrapli service
and track service, nurnL>ring more than 100,000 men, V1hey through their representatives
first offered their services in the capacity of
go-betweens in Winnipeg, and flnally reached
a place where they had agreements, with which
I had some cennection, whereby the eimployers
who were said to be responsible for the origin
of the strike signed an agreement with me
pledging themselves to adopt and to grant
the sanie consideration. in the matter of collective bargaining with their men in the shops
in Winnipeg, as the railroads had had in
existence for a substantial number of years.
1 called in the representatives of those 100,000
railroad men and asked, "Is that a fair statement of the principle of collective bargaining
as applied to ail your men in Canada?" They
said, "It is", and gave me a letter to that
effect, which is on record and was published
ini the press at the time.
The executive
officers of the three railroads in Winnipeg
then had the saine document submitted to
them, and we asked them, "le that a fair
statement of the princile and method of
collective bargiaining las practised between
you and your eznployees in ail your shep
trades here in Winnipeg, as well as in ail ether
classes of service?"
They said, "It is," and
signed a document ta ithat effect, which is on
record.
New, there were 4,000 odd so-called ghop
employees on strike.
They blazoned te the
world that they went on strike in support of
the principle of collective bargaining, which
they claimed was denied certain metal trade
shops in the city of Winnipeg. After reaching thst stage where it was proven conclusively that the method which has been
acceptable ta these 4,000 men in their dealinga
with their own employers wau now again
openly offered through a Government agency
ta the men who were an etrike, what happened? 'me representatives ofithose variaus
railroad organizations, in the capacity of
mediatars, called a meeting of the strike cernmittee, and they were "turned down"-to use

509

a phrase that is common in railroad parlance.
Then and there it became apparent beyond
peradventure that contention for the principle
of collective bargaining was not the real cause
of the continuation of that strike.
It becarne necessary in the interest cf public
service and social order ta take cognizanoe of
the serious situation then existing. -Steps had
te be taken by the Federal Government.
What steps did they take?
'Ihey did not
read the Riot Act and disperse processions or
gatherings of people, although people gathered
by thousands and passed Tesolutions cf the
most flagrant inflnmmatory character, entirely
illegal and absolutely wrong. No, we did flot
do that, but we called into session the strike
committee and endeavoured te reason with
them, aud when it was found utterly impossible -te make any progress it became evident
that some meve had te, bemrade in the initerest
cf order, tlhe carrying on of Govenrment and
the functioning of society. Therefore it became a d-uty, unpleasant though it was, te take
into custody the men who were mest directly
responsible fer the situation, in order te, bring
it to a head; and within seven heurs of the
time when -they were taken into custedy a
representative of the Federal Oovernment in
Winnipeg announced te -the world that net
a single one of those men should be deported
froru Canada unless and until 'lhe had had a
fair trial by a jury cf hie peer& . -Se this
amendnient to the Immigration Act.that was
passed on June 6 was neyer used, because it
was unnecesary, and because in my humble
epinion-and I had to assume seme of the
responsibility at the time, be4ng 1,500 miles
away fraru the seat of Goverument-in my
humble opinion the people cf Canada would
net have apqpreved of any British subjeet
being deDied the right of trial by jury, notwithstanding any law that rnight have been
hurrîedly passed.
A monith later, after due deliberation, Parliament pasqed the amendruent te the
Criminal Code, which have been discusseld tonight. -Ever since that was done, in my
humble -judgment, section 41 of the Immigratien Act has ne longer beau neoessary or desiqable, but it has been used for the lust six
years by the henourable gentlemen supportiug the Gevernment, and by the Government
supporters eilsewhere, for purposes cf poilitical
propaganda, though they therneelves were
origiually mare responsible than wee the Gevernmenit of the day for the legielation ever
having been introduced inta Parliament and
passed. Se in 19M0, the necessity for it, in zny
opinion and in the opinion ef the Government of that day, having ceased ta, exist, I
had the honour of introducing inta this Heue

SENATE
Bill X2 for the repeal, not of section 41 in
its entirety, but of the amendments that were
hurriedly passed on June 6, 1919. We discussed the matter at Iength here. The House
was divided in opinion. The second reading
was carried by a majority of one. I remember
tiuite clearly that there were 22 members who
voted in favour of the repeal of certain portions of section 41, and the 22 consisted of 11
Liberals and 1,1 Conservatives. So it was not
a party -division. But in Committee the Bill
did not survive.
Nothing happened in 1921. The question
was not raised. There was no agitation at
that time, so far as we knew, except that apparently some time in 1920 this learned gentleman had issued an opinion, of which my
honourable friend the leader of the Government was giving us the benefit to-night, unfortunately omitting to tell us that it was
eight years old.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And not a correct opinion.
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTSON: Well, I am not
arguing that point. In the dying days of 1921
the people of Canada saw fit to put a new
Government into power, and it has been there
most of the time since. I think the present is
the sixth occasion on which it has brought
down these two amending Bills, indicating
that the legislation was passed in days of
panic, when Parliament was not sensible or
responsible, and that it ought to be repealed.
Year after year, as soon as this House has
dlenied that repeal, it has been heralded
abroad to the people that a Tory Senate or
the Tory majority in this House, has been
responsible for the continuance of this dire
injustice perpetrated so despicably upon the
poor citizens, particularly the labouring men,
of Canada. I think the time has come when
We ought to wake up and refuse to sllow the
labouring man to be made the pawn in the
game. I think that, in view of the facts as
they are now, and in view of what we have
done to-night in maintaining on the Statute
Book adequate and reasonable protection for
society against radical Communism, we can
well afford to discontinue section 41 of the
Immigration Act, because it has never been
used since it was passed, it serves no useful
purpose, and has for -the past eight years been
used simply for political propaganda.
Now I desire to refer to one other point. It
has been argued elsewhere, and a year ago my
honourable friend the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made use of the
contention here, that the lagislation was discriminatory in character. He asserted, if I
remember correctly, that the law discriminated
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

against a British subject in favour of men from
a foreign country; and I have noted from the
record that during the last week or so a
Minister of the Crown, stating that he was
an immigrant, drew a similar comparison
beween himself and a citizen, say, of Poland.
He pointed out, I think, that the citizen from
Poland or any other country outside the
British Empire could become naturallized in
Canada at the expiration of five years' residence in this country. By the way, prior to
the amendiment of the Immigration Act in
1919 the period was three years. The Minister
to whom I refer said that the foreigner who
had resided five years in Canada could apply
for naturalization, and if the application was
granted that man became a Canadian citizen
and could' not be deported to any country, because he had no country other than Canada;
but that if a person happened to be born in
England, as this Minister was, or in Scotland,
as another Minister was, though he resided
here for fifty years, he could be deported, with
impunity, at the whim of an officer of the
Immigration Department. That is not true.
No officer of the Immigration Department can
deport anybody. The case must be examined
first by a commission of officers of the Immigration Department, and after a thorough investigation all they can do is to make a recommendation to the Minister. But I have not
noticed this Government being particularly
conspicuous in their dasire to shoulder responsibility for anything, and therefore the story
goes abroad, and it is believed by people who
do not know the law and have no occasion or
opportunity to know it, that people may be
railroaded out of the country at the whims
and dictates of some petty officer of the Department of Immigration. Nothing is farther
from the truth. I think that a little program of education along these lines ought
to be inaugurated by somebody in this country
for the purpose of having the people understand our laws as they are, and the importance
and necessity of a knowledge of them.
What are the facts? It is said, when that
comparison is made, that the gentleman from
Poland who has been naturalized must be
tried. How? Under the provisions of the
Criminal Code. If it is proven that he was
openly endeavouring by violence or force to
overthrow government, or assassinate a sovereign, or a prime minister, or an official of
the Government, he is liable to a rather severe
penalty, the maiximum being twenty years in
penitentiary. That is the fate that must befall
the Polander if he has been naturalized in
Canada. If he has not been naturalized he
can, of course, be deported. What about the
English-born man? He says: "'I demand the

MAY 8, 1928
right of trial by a jury of my peers. I protest
against being railroaded out of the countrydeported at the whim of an Immigration
oficer." It bias been made clear, 1 think, that
it is a misconception to think that he can be
deait with in that way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourabie friend must not forget that by virtue of
section 22 there may be constituted a Board of
Inquiry consisting of one officer.
Hon. Mr. RiOBERTSON:
recomimend to the Minister.

But it must

Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
appeal.

If t-here is an

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, there is.
What happens to the English-man or the
Scotchmnan who finds himself charged with
sedition, or with an attempt to overthrow
government by violence, or to assassinate a
sovereign, a prime minister, or any officiai?
He la in this position, that the authorities may
say to him: "We are sorry that you have
gotten into this mess. Because you are -a
British gubi ect, born in England, we will give
you the opportunity of going back home. You
cannot, stay here any longer, because we must
keep'our house in good order." I agree with
the gentlemen who have said that there was
discrimination, but I absolutely disagree that
that discrimination was against British subjects, the British-born; it wag absolutely in
their faveur. But for six years they have
howled and said, "We do not want it." Therefore I arn willing to let them. have their way,
because I do not think it makes a bit of
difference to Canada or Canadians.
For all those remsons, without going into
further details, 1 arn prepared to support
this Bill. First, I think that it was always
wrong te deprive a British subI ect. of a trial
by jury. That is a right that belongs to
British subjeetz wherever the Union Jack flues
throughout the world, and it ought to be preserved. Second, the legislation as passed in
1919 was neyer enforced. Third, after the
amendnent to the Crîminal Code, section 98,
was inserted into the law on July 7, 1919,
section 41 of the Immnigration Act became
wholly unnecesgary. Fourth, it has been more
or less the cause of unrest, dissention, dissatisfaction and, bickerings, and, worst of ail,
the suibi elt of political propaganda for six
years. For these reasong I think it is no
longer necessary te continue this piece of
legislation on the Statute Book, and I intend
to support the Government's Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I amn not
going to make a speech, but I want to draw

511

attention to the fact that this legislation
originatcd not in 1919, but in 1910 or perhaps
earlier. It certainly was legislation brought
in by the Liberal Government. Section 41
of the Immigration Act, chapter 27 of the
Statu tes of 1910, is as follows:
Whenever any person other than a Canadian citizenThat covers the Englishman and everybody eiscadvocates in Canada the overthrow by force
or violenceWe did not learn. until ten years afterw-ards
what "force" meantby force or violence of the government of Great

Britain or Canada, or other British Dominion,
colony, possession or dependency, or the overthrow by force or violence of constituted law
and authority. or the assassination of any
officiai of the Government of Great Britain or
Canada, or other British dominion, colony, possession or dependency, or of any foreign government, or shall by word or act create or attempt to create riot or public disorder in Canada, or shaîl by common repute belong to or be
suspected of beloinging to any secret society or
organization which extorts money from, or in
any way attempts to control, any resident of
Canada by force or threat of bodily harm, or
by blackmail; sncb persan for the purposes of
this Act shall be considered and classed as an
undesirable immigrant, and it shaîl be the duty
of any officer becoming cognizant thereof, sud
the duty of the clerk, secretary or other officiai
of any municipality in Canada wherein sucb person may be, to forthwith send a written coinplaint thereof to the Minister or Superintendent of Immigration, giving f ull particulars.
Then the Act goes on to provide for an
invegtigation by a Board of Inquiry, and for
the deportation from the country of an undesirable immigrant. The honourable gentleman fromn Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has
shown where a couple of unimportant clauses
were added.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Unimportant?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I did not
mean te say unimportant; where a couple of
short clauses were addcd, is what I meant
to say.
Hon. MT. DANDURAND:

Short shrift.

Hon. Mr. LYNCM-STAUNTON:
This
Immigration Act was the law of Caada for
ten ycars before we heard of any of those
troubles. It was 'brought in an>d passed by
the Liheral Government. There is ne change
at ail in it, I th-ink, as far as those amendments afféet anybody, because a Oanadian
citizen is a person who la domiciled in this
country. But a man may be a British subi ect,
and not a Canadian citizen, and at any time
duning the past 28 years hie could have been

SENATE
railroaded out of this country if he offended
against this Act. I wish to point out further:
That the Governor in Council may at any
time order any such person found by a Board
of Inquiry or an examining officer to belong to
any of the undesirable classes referred to in
section 41 of this Act to leave Canada within
the specified period.
I think this is slight corroborative evidence
that the honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) is correct when he says
that this legislation was not passed by a
panicky Conservative Government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
does tha·t make?

What difference

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen,
I think it is my duty to explain the vote
which I propose to give on this measure. I
will do so in a very few minutes, mainly by
roading a short -correspondence that I had
with Mr. Thomas Moore, President of the
Trades and Labour Congress. In January
last I reccived, as no doubt other honourable
members of this House did, the memorandum
ta which the Leader of the Government has
referred. It was accompanied by a letter dated
January 11, 1928, addressed to me, and reading
as follows:
For your information I have pleasure in forwarding copy of the memorandum on legislation etc., submitted to the Dominion Government on Monday, January 9th. by the Trades
and Labour Congress of Canada.
Your support towards securing the enactment
of the measures referred ta will be greatly
appreciated.
On the 17th of January I answered that
letter in this way:
Dear Sir:
I read with a good deal of interest your
Memorandum on legislation etc., submitted ta
the Dominion Government on January 9th, by
the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada, and
specially, the part having reference ta the reform of the Senate.
As an old member of the Senate, I think the
menimbers of that Chamber would be interested
in having from you a list of the Bills passed
by the House of Commons, say within the last
ten years. which were rejected by the Senate
with your criticisms of the action of the Senate
in each case. Also a list of the Bills thus rejected after having been passed three times by
the House of Commons.
If you will take the trouble of making your
criticisms, I will sec that they are placed in
the Senate Hansard with the answer which I
may deem advisable ta make.
In reply I received a letter dated January
19th, as follows:
I appreciate very much the interest you have
taken in the memorandum on legislation submitted to the Government recently by the
Trades and Labor Congress of Canada.
Regarding your suggestion as ta Senate Reform: I think you will realize that it is the
principle in which we are most deeply inHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

terested. So long as there is absolute veto by
the Senate there is a violation of the principle
of truly democratic government. This is particularly emphasized by the action of the Senate
in rejecting so many times the amendments ta
the Immigration Act and the Criminal Code
which have passed the House of Commons under
different Governments and after the people
of Canada have had the opportunity. at general
elections, of expressing their opinion on the
saine.
As to the list which you ask for: I feel sure
that with your length of service in the Senate
that you are as fully acquainted as I could possibly be with the number of measures which
have passed the House of Commons and been
rejected by the Senate.
I have no desire to have my criticisms of
such action entered on the Hansard records
especially when comment could be added which
I would have no opportunity of answering.
Whilst thanking you for the kindly spirit
which no doubt prompted your offer I moest
respectfully decline the same, being of the
epinion that it would serve no useful purpose at
this time.
And again on the 24th of January I answered
as follows:
I have your letter of the 19th instant.
Apparently the Fathers of Confederation
were of opinion that the principle of truly
democratic government would permit the Constitution of the Senate as it was adopted and
wlich was intended to guarantee the rights of
Minorities.
As ta the amendments to the immigration
Act and to the Criminal Code as passed by the
House of Commons to which you refer, as they
were repealing amongst others, the following
provision of the Criminal Code "any Association.
organization, society or corporation, whose professed purpose or one off whose purposes is to bring
any government, industrial or economic
change within Canada, by use of force, violence
or physical injury, ta person or property, or
by threats of such injury, or which teaches,
advocates, advises or defends the use of force,
violence, terrorism, or physical injury to person or property, or threats of such injury, in
order ta accomplish such change, or for any
other purpose, or which shall by anv means prosecute or pursue such purpose or professed purpose, or shall so teach, advocate, advise or defend, shall be an unlawful association", the
action of the Senate in rejecting the Bills as
passed by the House of Commons was, I believe,
in accord with public opinion in the Country.

sbout

I might rest here, and permit this correspondence to explain the vote which I intend
to cast, and the vote which I gave on the
previous measure; but I desire to add that
anybody who bas followed events in Russia
can have no doubt that the Government there,
which has been in existence now for some ten
years, depends entirely upon its propaganda
in foreign countries. We alil know that Italy
was on the eve of Communism; that France
also was on the eve of Communism and that
England was very much threatened at one
time. I do not believe that we are very
seriously threatened here, but I think it is our
duty to protect that class of people to which

MAY 8, 1928
the honourable member from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien.) referred the other day.
The propaganda here ie addressed to a dlais
of persona who are entitled to protection-are
uneducated foreignere, mainly chiddrexi-and I
thin-k it je a serious menace to tbem. and that
they are entitled. to protection on our part.
I think that to repeal at thie time the provision
referred to in the Bill would 'be to encourage
that propaganda, and for my part I ar n ft
disposed to do that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Doee mny
honourable friend think that the propaganda
he refere to, and the danger that he ant.::
pates, would be Iessene-' uu a greater extent
by deporting n~ man and allowing him. to
ta--- on hie work eleewhere, or by deahing
with bîm under the Criminal Code as it
stands now, with this clause is eliminated from
the Immigration Act, and giving him. whatever time the courts decide ie proper to think
over hie past action?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
honourable gentleman ohject to hima being
deported if he je convicted?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

No.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I repeat that I think
the repeal of these provisions would encourage
the propaganda, and I eay further, that it je
the duty of the local Governments as wel
as of the Federal Government, to put a stop
to this propaganda, and, if necessary, to act
jointly, and to deport these people who are
teaching the doctrines which have heen referred to by the honourable gentleman frorn
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honoura-ble
gentlemen, at this late hour and at this stage
of the discuesion I have no intention of offering more than a few brief observations. I
think we have heard alI that anybody in this
Ilouse can contribute to the discussion, and
that it may be fairly said that as there is
a division of opinion as to what is the beet
thing to do with this Bill, we must therefore
look outside of the House for further information as to how the Act has worked in the
paet, and as to the necessity for passing or
rejecting the Bill. I propose to move, therefore, that the Bill be referred to a Special
Committee which would cail before it witnesees--offlcers of the Department of Justice,
the Department of Labour, and the Departnment of Immigration-who would be able
to testify as to the working of the Act. Theý?
can tell us wbether the Act bas been useful
or nlot.
56100--m

513

It is observable that there are two argumente growing out of the fact that no action
has ever been taken under the Act. There
are those who argue that because no prosecutions have ever been made this amending
Bill sbould be passed; and there are others
wbo take an entirely different view, and argue
the very opposite. There are many members, I think, on this aide of the House, and
perbape on the other aide, who are etrongly
of the opinion that the existence of tbe law
as it is bas been a very powerful deterrent
to those wbo might have misbehaved. AIl
this information can be got from such witnesses as may be called by the Committee,
and wheu -«-e C--umittee makes its report
the members of th> :!ouse will be able to
approach the question in euch a way as to do
what is best in the intereet of the country.
Therefore I intend to moveHon. Mr. BELCOURT: I intend to epeak

my honourable friend if he would not defer

IMMIGRATION BILL
SECOND

READING-REFERRED
COMMITTEE

TO

SPECIAL

The Srenate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion for the second reading
of Bill 187, an Act to amend the Immigration Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, a point of order was raised last
evening on the procedure followed by the
honourable gentleman from Edmonton
Mr. GrieSbach). It was based upon the(Hon.
contention that a motion to submit a Bill to a
standing or Special Committee before the Bill
received its Eecond reading was irregular. I
confess that I have had no opportunîty to
study the question. It was my privilege to
be Speaker of this Chamber for some time,
and 1 remember that this matter came under
my observation. I have a vague recollection
that it is ptrmissible to commit a Bill before
the second reading, but it is done only under
special conditions and for reasons duly give'I
in the motion. Generally we have proceeded
otherwise. This is a public Bill, and usually
xvhe i the second reading is passed the principle is adopted. That I recognize. But we
have very often passed the second reading
of a Bill on the understanding that we werc
passing it only in order to send the Bill to
Committee for special study, and were not
bound by the principle, but had the right,
either on the report from the Committee or
on the third reading, to discuss the principle
and deal with it according to our judgment
Unless His Honour the Speaker has a firm
opinion against this procedure, my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Grie8bach) will perhaps, in accordance with the tradition of this
Chamber, allow the second reading of the
56109-3mi

515

Bill without the Senate being committed tc
the principle of it, and we may then follow
his suggestion to send it to a Special Cammittee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honoumable gentlemen, I think that the second reading implies
that we adopt the principle of the Bill. We
have in certain circumstances acted otherwise,
but I think that has been' by unanimous consent of the Senate. By unanimous consent
a Bill may be referred to a Committee without the principle having been accepted. I
think it would be faulty procedure to dispense with the consideration of the principle
and send the Bill tei Committee without the
unanimous tonsent of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had not gone
as far as my honoumable friend, who says
that unanimity is necessary, but I have no
objection to standing by that suggestion.
bon. Mr. BEIQUE: Poesibly the Bill can
be referred to commiittee by consent of the
majority of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have no
objection to the adoption of the suggestion
put forward by the honourable leader of the
Government, that the Bill be given second
reading on the undemstanding that the principle
is not agmced te.
On the ether hand, I
think it is well womth while to discuss the
point whether or not the Bill may properly be
committed befome the second reading.
A
Bill which is down for second reading may
contain contentious matters upon which it is
desimable to secure information. It seems to
me an incredible thing that befome the second
reading honourable membems cannot secure,
by means of a Special or Standing Committee,
information upon which they may base their
decision as to whether or not they will accept
the principle of a Bill. As a matter of actual
fact, this very situation is pmovided for, and
I think it is worth while reading to the bouse
some information that I have on the subject.
In May's Pamliamentary Practice, at page 357,
it is stated :
It is also competent to a member who desires
to place on record any special reasons for not
agreeing to the second reading of a bill, to
inove, as an amendoient to the question, a resolution declaratory of sorne principle adverse to,
or- differing from the principles, policy or provisions of the bill; or expressing opinions as
to any circumstances connected with its introduction or prosecution; or otherwise oppoftd to
its progress; or seeking- further information in
relation to the bill by commnittees, commissioners, the production of papers or other cvidence, or, in the Lords, the opinion of the jusges.
In introducing my amendment I expressed
the hope that the Committee would secure in-

16

SENATE

lormation from representatives of the Departments of Justice, Labour and Immigration.
What 1 said in introducing my amendment is
on ail fours wit-h what I arn reading here.
Then at page 359, dealing with this question, May says:
It miust be borne inii d, however, that the
resointion, if agreed to, does not arrest the
progress of the bill, the second reading of Nvhieh
inay ha rnoved on another occasion.
Consequently I may assert that any set of
precedents or any rutes of procedure should
ho props to support and not chains to hind. To
lay it down as a mile of this House that a
Bill may flot be committed before the second
re4ding would be in my judgment to estahlish
an unsound principle, which would tend to
hold up publie business, and cause lengthy
discussions about matters of no very great
I submait that my amendment is
importance.
in order, but I defer to the wishes of my honourable friend and will agree to the second
reading of the Bill, with the understanding
that no one is bound hy the principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
my honourable friend's move did flot do violence to my own vie'w as to what was proper.
I would ask His Hon-our the Speaker wbether
he has an opinion to exprese on this matter.
The Hon. the SPEAKEFR: Honourable gentlemen, last nigbt, when the bonouraible junior
Sonator for Edmionton moved his amendment,
I pointed out that I thought the hetter procedure was to adopt the motion for the second
reading of the Bill before referring it to a
But I know that on a
Special -Committee.
former occasion this flouse has followed the
procedure that the honourable gentleman desires to have adopted i11 the present instance.
Unfortunately I have not been able to find and
cannot give, the reference to the occasion when
it occurred. I had noticed in May the reference that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Grieshach) bas cited just now. I find also that
Bourinot in dealing witb the matter says:
Any nienihor mnay propose as an amendment
a resolution declaratory of soîne principle
adverse to, or differing frorn. the princip]es,
policy or provisions of the bill, or expressing
opinions as to any circunistaoc',-s connected witb
its introduction or prosecution or otherwise
opposed to its progress, or seecking fnrther
informiation in r elation to the bill hy cornmnittees, comimissioners, the production of papers
or other evidence, or the opinion of judges.
There hiis heen action of that kind taken
at different times. This does not actually
say that in that case the Bill should be meferred to, a Committee, but I think it is
douhtful if the House would like to have it

the Speaker can say that the procedume is out
of order.
11.n. '%Ir. GIIIESBACH.

Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, the support whicb I intend to give to
this Bill is besed on reasons which may be
summarized in this way. The legislation which
this Bill seeks, to mepeal is unnecessary, arbitrary, and contmary to naturai freedom and
the proper administration of law and justice.
I say it is unnecessary because the sections
of the Criminal Code which have been repeatedly quoted and sections 3 and 40 of the
every possible
Act provide
Immigration
remedy which section 41, now in question,
contains. Ahl the difficulties wbich arose during the war could bave been adequately and
properly settled by means of the provisions of
the Criminal Code which were in force at
that time and are still in force, or hy means
of the provisions of the Immigration Act as
I have convinced myseîf
it then existed.
without difficulty that section 41 is a mere
duplication of legishation which existed at
the time that this section was passed, and
even in 1910, at the time of the passing of the
original legislation referred to hy my honourable friend froma Hamilton (Mr. LynchStaunton). At no time, to my mmnd, has section 41 heen of any meal service in the administration of law or required in the interests
of puhlic policy in Canada. I do not know
wbat was the purpose which prompted the
enact'ment of that section in 1919, unless it was
to create a counter-Ourment to the feeling
which was manifest at the time, of lawlessness and of Socialisma gone mad. I think myself that was tbe motive which. inspired the
enactmnent of 1919, whatever may be said with
regard to 1910.
I do not intend to trouble the flouse by
reading over section 87 and sections 130 to
136 of the Criminal Code, or sections 3 and
40> of the Immigration Act. I invite honourable gentlemen to read those provisions again
with care and attention. When they compare
themn with section 41, which we are now proposilîg to repeat, they will find that, with one
exception, there is nothing in section 41 which
is flot contained in those other sections.
Nor do I think that I should take up much
of the time of honourable gentlemen in discussing the repeal of section 41 were it not
for this une exception, whicha I desire to
point out, and which is the main reason
prompting me to support the Bill. In section
41 there is a provision by which a man may

It migit flot be amies if I were to indicate
briefiy what have been the accomplishaients
or rather the failures of Socîalism ever since
the time of Plato. Almost to the beginning of
the twentieth century Socialisni had acouaiplished little or nething beyond what I have
referred to as Trade Unionism. Plato himself
was purely a Utopian. Rie was a critie and
philosopher, but he neyer suggested any means
by which bis philosophy or hie policy might
be put inte execution. Se it was with every
one of theai, right down to the end of the
nineteenth century, at all events down to

to put into execution the doctrine of Plato,
or any ether of the Socialiste who folk>wed
hlm.
As a matter of fact it was only after
the French Revolution that an attempt of
some sort was made to impose the doctrines
of Socialism. We may remember one of
them in the middle of the nineteenth century,
Babeuf, who probably was the first man to
invo-ke or counsel force. His teaching was
not im.propetly deflcrïbed a:s being merely:
"Yearnings for equal division of unequal
He preached that doctrine, but
earnings."
he neyer indiicated how he was going to accomplish it; therefore hie neyer put into
practice methods which could be condemned.
After hiai we had Saint-Simon, Fourier,
Cabet. Robert Owen and others. Now. what
were they? They ivere mnerely Utopians. They
had ne scheme, ne measures te suggest, and
did not attempt to have their ideas enforced.

When 1 say there was no sc'heme I should
qualîfy that, for one cf them advised and
urged that the most demnocratie Socialism.
which he was advocating and adopting as hie
text and program was that the state should
be the "ban-ker of the poor." But those were
mereiy highfalutin statements, without any
kind of indication as to how the ideas could
be brought into execution.
Karl Marx himself was nothing but a philosopher, a critic; hie had nothing substantiai
lRe contented himself with

writing. Hie was a very able and prolific
writer, but nVver at any time did hie suggest
the means for carrying eut this equal division
of preperty among the people of the earth.
Proud'hon, who was one of the stormy petrels
of the Revolution cf 1848, had a more violent
doctrine-"2Property is theft;" but nothing
camne of that except the vapeurings cf a wild
man.
Now, other forms cf Socialisai-Syndicalisai and Bolehevisin-offer eeal dangers to
the state against which Society muet* be
pretected. But I am not exceedingly alarmed,
I must say I am net very mnuch alarmed, over
the doctrines of either Syndicalist or Bolshevist, because, like the ordinary Socialist,
thev are seeking semething which is utterly
and ahsolutely unattainable. The laws cf
nature, which cannot be evaded or beaten, and
which are going te survive as long as this
world lasts, stand in the way of equality cf
intelligence, equality of effort, equality of will,
energy and activity, and equality cf attainment. If we ever got te the stage when
Secialism had suicceeded in aikng threugheut the world an equal division of all the property in the world, that very instant would be
coeident with the instant when the penduluai
weuld start te swing the ether way.
I. appeal te honourable gentlemen of exthe

think such equality can ever cerne, but assuming that it did, it would last just one
instant cf reason, and ne longer. Men would
start again te accumulate individually aIl they
could. They would net exert their intelligence
and efforts te maintain collective ownership,
but wouid immediately endeavour te obtain
eomething for themselves te increase their own
individual possessions. Collectivisa.inl that
sense is an utter impossibility. The Bolshevik revolutien reached the height cf violpnce,

abridged the right of assembly and free speech;
the abolition of organized government; yet it
bas failed. Syndicalisrn bas for its purpose
the ownership and control by industrial organization of the means of production and distribution, thus making the workingman bis
own employer and securing for himself the
entire produet of bis labour. Its principal
means is General Strike and Sabotage. 1t'
differs from mere Socialism because of its uncompromising denunciation of the requirements of state and every f orm. of organization.
It bias accomplished nothing-has met witb
nothing but failure-notably in the Port of
London strike in 1912.
Now, if we bear in mind that tbe Communists, Bolsbevists, and Syndicalists are
bound to continue to fail, that conviction
sbould, to a considerable extent, allay our fears
and our panic. I repeat tbat if tbese violent
Soeialists break tbe law, if they endeavour to
impose their views by means of violence, then
tbe state may well combat them with their
own weapons. 1 quite believe the time may
arise, but I do flot tbink it bas yet arisen in
Canada, wben it would be necessary to oppose
violence to the wild, silly talk in which some
of the people engage, even in Canada. In
tbe meantime, I do flot think it is going to
belp the State or society in any way to enaet
these very drastie, Draconian laws. 0f course,
we know what Russia aimed at, and wbat
Russia ba5 done in pursuance of that aim
bas shown how utterly futile tbe aim was.
Bolshevism. in Russia to-day is far less dangerous, far less drastic, tban it was last year,
or even three or four years ago. 'Nothing is
more ridiculous to me tban the idea of a
Soviet World League under the hegemony of
Russia.
Bolshevism is merely a teniporary
aberration. It cannot break doîwn modern
civilization.
It bas flot made and cannot
make any real progress in Canada.
My bonourable friend from. Lanark (Hon.
Mr. Haydon) the other day used a phrase that
I intend to copy.
H1e attempted to show, and
I tbink he showed brillîantly, that Bolshevism,
like al] other violent forms of Socialism is
flattening out. Tbe very violence and fury
whîch the Russians imported into their aim,
and into the means wbich. tbey adopted for
carrying out th-at aim, are the source of its
complete failure.
The airn it.self contains
the source and cause and reason of its own destruction.
Is there anybody witb a sane head
on his shoulders who thinks the situation
brought about by Russia cao st? It is only
a question of time tiI! tbere, as in otber cases

order to impose eitber social doctrines or

secution will have the effect of rendering impossible tbe very tbing it is intended to accomplisb. Russia to-day is already sick and
tired of tbe doctrine that was adopted a few
years ago. Was anything more absurd, more
silly, or more stupid ever suggested than that
the Soviets could establisb tbeir dominion all
over the world? It is so preposterously absurd
that I cannot understand wby anybody should

After Al we have imitated the

to government operation now, and can sec no
reason why I should ever be converted to that
principle.
Now, just a word or two more and I arn
finigbed.
We heard during the discussion,
especially during the speech of my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Bcaubien), some statements which. I arn sure
bo did flot make without what seemed to
bim to be sufficient authority. Before making fhem, he must bave been in possession of
considerable information. Âmong other tbings,
be said that there are in this country to-day
40 scbools in wbich the doctrines of Bolshevism are openly taught, and he defled
the Leader of the Government f0 say that
that was not so. I wonder that it bas flot
occurred to my honourable friend, and to
others wbo bave come by the knowledge of
things of that kind, to denounce sucb cases
to the proper authorities; 1 wonder that
they do not diseharge what is to me a clear
duty of citizenship, and go to the proper
authorities with this information. If tbat were

MAY 9, 1928
done the law could be set in motion and
those teachers could be tried, and if found
guilty, they could be deported. Ail these
dangers will be met in proportion to the enlightenment resulting frrn study, from education, out of a proper observation of obligations
to society and the state.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: It has been donc
officially. It has been brought to the knowledge of the Government, and I have given
my authority. If my honourable friend wants
me te repeat it, I may say that notice has
been given to themn by Father Casgrain.
Furthermore, my honourable fricnd might
have found in my speech an extract from a
newspaper published in the West by the
Ukrainians, in which they themselves admit
havîng 40 schools in which Bolshevisrn is
taught. If that is not evidence, I do not
know what is. I have asked my honourable
friend to inquire from the Mounted Police.
I am ready ta stand by their answer. The
Government is informed from day to day,
and they have known of these things for a
great many months.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend mean the Government at Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Well, my 'honourable friend has gone ta the wrong place.
My honourable friend surely knows that if
he wants these teachers prosecuted, aIl he has
got ta do is to go to the Attorney General of
the Province whcre the sehools are.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Oh, no.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. BELCOUTRT:
friend knows as welI as I do Vhat the administration of justice is in the hands of the
Provinces. Furthermore, this is a matter of
education, and is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Provinces. This Parliament
or this Government has nothing ta do with
criminal procedure or practice.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable fricnd allow me? I brought before this
House the petition of a very respectable
association, asking for the deportation of
Bolshevilc teachers. The setting ini motion
of the very clause which the Government now
wants ta eradicate frem the Immigration law
belongs ta the Federal Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: 0f course, on that
subjeet my honourable friend and myscîf
would not agree, because I am absolutely
opposed ta secret deportation. To exile a
man without giving him a chance ai defcnding himself is revolting ta every principle

of law and justice that I know. To me it
is an utterly and completely unacceptable
proposition, and the legislation passed in 1919
ta me was always wrong.
Another thing that is common in thîs Canada af ours, and perhaps it is so elsewhere as
well, is that gentlemen-I am not speaking
af course of merntbers of Parliament--that
gentlemen engaged in the industrial and commercial lufe af the commnunity readily and
persistentiy shirk their duty in these matters.
Take the example of trying ta hand this thing
over, passing the buck, so ta speak, ta the
Dominion Government, which can do nothing, instad of going ta the people who can
prosecute. Aiter ali, the men who are xnainly
interested in such a matter as this are the
capitalists, the men wha have the greatest
stake ta proteet. But do you find these men
taking up this matter? Do they nlot all shirk
their duty with regard ta it? They spend
their time at home before their firesides,
smoking their pipes and criticizing often moet
severely those who are trying ta remedy the
situation.
Do they ever offer any constructive ideas or tender their sdrvioes or cooperation? No. They are tao busily engaged
i amassing money ta think that they are the
ones prin *cipally interested and under obligation ta move, and that Vhey are the ones
to suifer most.

work that is stili ahead of us, we will flot be
able to take quite so, much time hetween
sittings; but I think that by taking shorter
week-end adjournments and attending seriously ta our work. we wili be able ta deal
with ail the legisiation that is to, corne before
us, and stili finish ahead of the Commons.
THE DIVORCE BILL (ONTARIO)
Hon. *Mr. MeMEANS: With the permis-sion of the Senate, 1 should like to cati the
attention of the Leader of the Governmont ta
a state of affairs which I think is very unsatisfactory. A year ago we passed the
Ontario Divorce Bill through this flouse and
sent it to the flouse of Commons. It was
stated at tha, time that it was too lata for
that flouse to deal with the Bitl, and that it
must be introduced at an earlier stage of the
next Session. At almost the first sitting of
this flouse this Session the Bill was again
passed, and *sent over ta tbie Commons; but I
arn told that owing ta some arrangement that
has been made, the Government will not allow
it ta be discussed.
I think it is unfair ta the members of this
flouse and ta the people of the country that
a measure of such vital importance should be
held up, and that the members of the other
flouse should be prohibited from expressing
an opinion upon it. If a vote were taken
on the Bill, it would be very easily disposed
of.
There bis been a great deal of talk about
what this flouse is going ta, do if legistation
of that character is treated in such a way in
the other flouse. It bas been suggested that
when the time for prorogation cornes we
should say that there are 25 or 30 divorce
petitians before the Comrnittee that have a
right ta be beard, and that we can in that
way bring attention ta the state of affairs that
exists. I cati the attention of the Leader of
the Government ta this condition, because I
think-and 1 arn sure that 1 have the endorsation of the majority of the members of this
Housýe-that something should be donc by
this body in order ta ensure proper consideration of such important legisiation initiated in
this flouse.
flan. Mr. DANDURAND:
flonouruble
gentlemen, it was my duty to d-raw the
attention of the Goverinent ta. the desire
of the Senate that public legistation initiated
in this Chamber shouid receive consideration
in the other flouse. 1 was answered that tihe
new regulations 'left very lititie tirne for the
discussion of private Bis and publie Bills
initiated by private members. I stated that
the Senate had twice passed a Bill ta which

523

t.hey thouglit t.he flouse of Commons should
give consideration, and I was informed that
it could only be deait with in its turn. I
believe that public legistation in the bands
of private members can only be reached a~fter
the private Bilts have been disposed of. Some
time was allotted yesterday ta the consideration of private Bills in the ather flouse, and
I hope that flouse wili be able ta arrange its
agenda in sucb a way as to dispose not only
of private tegisiation, but of public legisiation
that has been initiated in this Chamber.
flan. Mr. BELCOURT: flonourable gentlemen, I suppose that ordinarily it would not
be proper for me or for any other rnerber
of this flouse ta discuss the procedure in
an other place; but I 'thir1 k we are justified in
this instance in speaking about it, because it
immediately and directly conceros legisiation
initiated in the Senate. My honaurable friend
who bas complained (flan. Mr. MeMeans)I arn not saying without reason-wiil remember
that I have a rather seriaus complaint of that
kind myseif, a complaint which I share with
eivery memaber of this flouse. On three occasions this flouse unenimously passed a Bill
whicha 1 have been introducing for the last
six or seven Seissions, but which bas not yet
become law. I would not, however, for one
moment think of blaming the Government
because the Bill hais not passed this ycar,
even tbrough it reached the flouse of Cammons a long time ega, becaiise 1 agree with
my Leader that the Goveroment is nat in
any sense responsible. The situation is simply
the inevitabie consequence of the new rules
and regulations adopted by the flouse of
Cornmons; but I would suggest that that
flouse be invited ta revise its miles so that
public Bis initiated in the Senate rnay
receive consideration.
flan. Mr. REID: Honourabie gentlemen, I,
do not agree witb the Leader of the Government that it is not the fault of the Government that the Bill referred ta by the honourable gentleman frorn Winnipeg (flan. Mr.
McMeans) bas not bpen brougbt forward.
Many times I have seen the rules of the flouse
of Commons suspended in order ta take a
vote on a Bill. We knaw that if the Government were ta mave the suspension of certain
mules, tbe Bill could be taken up to-imarraw
and passed or voted down.

FEDERAL DISTRICT CO}MMISSION BITL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Sonate went into Committee on Bill 218, an
Act to amend The Federal District Commission Act, 1927.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, during the
discussion of the second rea.ding of this Bill
I was asked quite a number of questions, and
I stated that 1 thought I would be able to
answer them. to the satisfaction of the members of the Senate when we came to Committee.
I have gone through the debate on the
second reading, and I have prepared answers
to ail the questions that were put. 1 was
asked if the $3.000.000, and the advanice cd
$200000 to run as annuities for fifteen years
would complete the program in view by the
<3overnment and the Commission. My answer
is in the affirmative. That is ail that is projected for the present. I may be asked what
is meant by the expression, for the present.
Well, as far as the Goveroment has examined
the situation it is not disposed to go further.
That does not mean that Parliament and the
Governmenýt bind themselves never to present
any extension of the present program.
The Prime Minister was asked what was
covored by that program,andwhat the 53,000,000 would produce. I bring his answer to the
Senate:
The acquisition of the Rusol house block,
property. leasps, et cotera. and the construction
of the park, incbuding the ren.odelling of the
intersection of Sparks snd Elgin stroots, an
ontlay of $1,600,000 will ho requirod. To comnplete the Remic rapids bridge, $423.200 will ho
requirod. For new driveways and parks. that
is the enlarging of some of the aroas alroady
For the widening snd
planncd. $144,400.
improv~ing of existing (lriveways an(l parka.
$116.600-a total program for titis year of
$2.281.200. That is the total capital expenditture.
The bill suggests either that that
amnunt ,.hould be met ininediateiy aud directly
Hon. Mir. REID.

ont of the consolidated revenue, or that secuiritics for that amouint should be issued in the
niaine of the commission, the interest and
principal of which would be gu;eranteod by the
Mlinister of Finance. In addition, it is estb
matod that during future years. expenditures
on new driveways and parks wvil be $600.000,
and the remodelling of the oxisting driveways
wiîll arnount to $130,000, or a total of $730.000;
this togetiier withi the outlay iii 1928 makoes a
total outtlay of $3.011,200. 1 think that gives
niy hon. friends the particulars they asked for.
That covers the.particulars of the work, and
the expenditure of the $3,000.000 asked of
Parliament.
I was asked by the honourable gentleman
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) for the
filing of the report of the Federal District
Commission for the fiscal year 1927; 1 think it
was9 in conjunction with a question whether
those reports had been tabled year by year.
My answer is that it bas been tabled, but as
there are two Chambers to Parliament I am
not sure that those reports have been deposited
at the same time in-both Chambers. However
I now lay on the table of this buse the last

report of the Commission for 1927, in case it
is not.to, be found in the records of the Senate.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

I asked for a

printed report.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not been
handed a printed statement. I got a type-

written statement.

Probably it was in that

form. that it was brought to Parliament.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBA-CH: I think it is o!
sufficient importance to be printed, hecause
we cannot discuss this question year after
vear without having the figures defnitely bcfore us, and available for ail parties. It i8
much more worth printinig than many other
reports that are printed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That suggestion
will have to ho referred to the Joint Com-

mittee of Parliament. The honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) asked
if the property west otf the post office and hotween Sparks street sud Laurier avenue wcre
bought by the Commission, or rather by #.he
Government. The answer is that propcrty
west of the post office to Elgin street and
Sparks street has been expropriated by the
Goveroment, but expropriation proceedings
have not been completed. As to the property
bctween Sparks street and Laurier avenue,
the Russell Hou:-e block is being- purchased
hv the Commission. Dey's Arena rink prop-

erty. which is on Laurier avenue near the
bridge. wa.s purchased by the Commission.
Property on the west side of the canal, fromn
Sparks to Laurier, excluding IJey's rink, has
becn Government property for years under
the head of Canal Rrserve. In 1926 and 19J27

MAY 10, 1928

Parliarnent appropriated $100,000, which was
paid to the Commission for the purpose of
making a park of the Canal Reserve. The
plan of the Federal District Commission contemplates the widenjng of Elgin from Sparks
to Laurier avenue. Beyond the Russell Block
it is anticipated that the wridening will be
undertaken by the city.
In answer to a question of the honourable
gentleman from St. John <Hon. Mir. Daniel),
I may qay that the Act provides an annuity
of $20000 for the period of fifteen years. It
also autiiorizes the Government to appropriate
a capital suni of $3,000,000, to be paid from
the Consolidated Revenue Fund or raised on
Government-guaranteed secuirities of the Commission, the interest and sînking fund charges
on any securities issued being provided for by
the Government.
The Prime Minister stated in another place
that at least the immediate requirements would
ha provided to the Commission out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund. As to the balance
of the 83,000,000 it would be in the discretien
of the Minister of Finance whether it should
be provided for by payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or by the disposai
of guaranteed bonds.
The honourabie gentleman from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) put the question: Doas
section 9 of the Bill make it perfectly clear
that the total sum. of money that may be
advanced to the Commission for purchase of
properties does not exceed 33,000,000? The
aner
is that the 83,000,000 referred to ini the
Act is the maximum sum which may be provided either by cash payments out the Consolid'ated Revenue Fund or by the issue of
Securities.
For exampla,. if the $3,000,000
were paid to the Commission out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the Commission
would have no power to issue securities.
The honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) conterned himself with
the purehase of the New Edinburgh property,
but before doing se he put a question concerning the acquisition of property and the construction of the Park on the canal bank.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: You have already
given that answer.
Then, in anHon. Mr. DANDrURAND:
swer to the remarks of the honoureble gentleman conoerning the removal of the Bureau
of Statistics to the New Edinburgh building,
I bring to him. the statement csf the Minister of Trade and Commerce, under whese
jurisdiction the Census Bureau*is. This is te
statement that hle has prepared:
The Bureau of Statistics cornes under the
departrnent whieh I have the honour te a<lrinister, and one of the resons why the building

525

bas not been erected on Wellington street, as
provided for Borne years ago, was the problern
of finding suitable' quarters for the Bureau,
which is the first building that is to bie
demolished. I was consulted by the Minister
of Public Worke. I say frankly that I was
nlot particularly in favour of purchasing the
New Edinburgh milîs. The Bureau of Statisties
requires 41,000 f eet of space te house it properly. There was no such amount of space
available except in the new bui]ding which was
being erected on WeUlingten street, which space
we could nlot secure for less than $1.25 per
foot per annurn. So we were facing an annual
expenditure of over $47,000 te bouse the Bureau
in rented property. I was of the impression
that the New Edinburgh miii property was an
old property. It is over twenty years old, but
a building of good brick and concrete construction, and when 1 saw the buildings, as a
manufacturer knowing something about miii
property and buildings, I was utterly ourprised
at the value of this property. T!.ose buildings
Do-day, giving the saine amount of floor space,
at modern construction prices. including the
head office, whicb is a very fine building, could
nlot bie replaced for less Lhan $350,000 or
$400,000.
The property at haîf a million
dollars is extremely cheap when you take into
consideration the fact that it comprises the
whole bank of the river right down to tie
residence of the late Sir ,John A. Macdonald,
"Earnscliffe."' There is one building on the
15roperty which contains over 50,000 feet of
floor space; I think it is 600 feet long and 60
or 70 f eet wide. This building. with a reasonable arnount of alteration, would provide at
least temporary housing for the Bureau of
Statistics for a f ew years, until probably at
Borne future date a more central location can
be provided for the bureau.
I say quite frankly that in the flrst instance
1 was epposed to putting Lh<e Bureau of
Statistics in this property because of its location, but if we were te go ahead with the
buildings which were to be erected on Wellington street-I had te witbdraw rny objections,
and I may say that they were easily withdrawn
when this property was offered te the goverument at the price it was. 1 rnay say that the
price asked for that property m as flot $500,000,
but $750,000, and there was a very considerable
amnount of negotiating done before it was
secured for $500,000.
I have obtained a mimber of copies of the
small plan, which indicates the improvemente
te be made in front of the East Block and
across Sparks street along Elgin street te
Laurier avenue; but as this little plan did net
show me exactly the lay of the ground, because I do not live in Ottawa, I asked that a
large plan be prepai ed which would indicate
the properties as they are to-day.
With that
and the smaîl plan, which is in -the hands of
most of the senators, they will understand the
improvernents that are to be made.
There
wil be the opening of the streat as fair as
Laurier bridge, and practicaily the public
buildings i that area will remain.
Those
buildings are shown on the plan which is on
the table.

gize to my bonourable friend if 1 did flot
obtain the information on that point, but I
did happen to state that the Government
does net intend te go beyond the advances
lhat are made under this Bill. The amount
is quite large, and it will take some years te
work eut the present plan. When it has
been brought te a cempletion, two, three or
four vears hence, perhaps my honourable
friend will give us his views as te the future
devclopmont. and if he dees I shaîl be glad
te bring tbeiî tu the attention of the Government.
Honi. Mr. GRIESBACII: I was uinder the
impression that I had asked the honeurable
leader of the Coverement ever what area or
district this Commission cxtended its activilies; whether, for instance, its jurisdiction
extcnded across the river, wbat it wvas doing
on the other side, and whether its program
included the beautiiying of Hull.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 did make
(nquirv on that peint, but have net yet had

the tbird reading. If there is a plan covering
Al the wvork. which is rather extensive, I shaîl

Hon. W. .13. WILLOUGHBY: In dealing
with the appropriations for the work of the
Commission for this year, including the
capital expenditure of $3,000,000, the honourable leader of the Govern-ment, in answer to
the honourable senator fromn Sydney (Hon.
Mr. McLennan), intimated that "Sufficient
unto the day 's the evil thereof." We have
herd from many sources that it is the wish
of the Premier. in any event-and I take it
to be the Premier's intention to carry it out
if he remains in office long enough-to ex-.
propriate ail the land from the Russell block
down to Cartier Square. We have just been
told by the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), 1 understand, that the City will
undertake the widening of Elgin street from
Sparks street to Laurier avenue. There is
in that area a very large amount of extremely
valuable and costly property. I am not going
to criticize the proposai, or deal with it at
present, but in the commencement of a career
of large expenditures it is, I think, a wise
thing to understand what will be the ultimate
reoult. Are we to be called upon next year,
or in sueceeding years, to pass a vote for the
purpose of expropriating some other property
down towards Laurier avenue, and carrying
out other sehemes?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, that is not
the intention of the Govern-ment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is some
satisfaction at least.

527

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Just one further
point. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has very frankly and, 1 think,
satisfactorily answered the questions that I
propounded the other day, but the thought
occurs to one, now that it is made clear that
the whole 83,000,000 referred to in this Bill as
capital expenditure ig to be used this yearHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not aIl this
year.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Well; 33,011,000,
my honourable friend said.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This year and next.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It may run into
1929.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Of course the
fiscal year runs into 1929. 1 am just wonderink why it was necessary or desirable to bring
down this proposai te expend, 83,000,000 in
t'he form of a Bull, instead of putting the
amount in the estiinates and disposing of
the matter in that way.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I think that either I
or some other member asked a question about
the relations between the Dominion Government and the City. Just what obligations are
we going to assume towards the City with
respect to these improvements? I understood
the honourable member from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) to say that there is a sum
paid for water supply, under a contract of
some sort between the Government and the
City. I would like to see that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUTiT: What I said, or
meant to say, was that there is an agreement
between the Department of Public Works and
the City of Ottawa covering the matters to
whieh my honourable friend refers-flre protection, water supply, etc. Those have been
covered by agreemnent for a very long time.
The agreement has been modifled from time
to time in various ways. It provides also
for the maintenance of certain bridges in
different parts of the city. My honourable
friend would flnd in that agreement, I think,
ail the in-formation for which he has asked,
and possibly something more.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Is there any danger of
additional expenditure being forced on the
Government? I arn speaking now of indirect
expenditure. Suppose you erect a new building. What happens with regard to the frontage? Do youi pay for haîf of that portion of
the street which is in front, or do you pay
anything at ahl?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not sure.
I cannot answer that.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROSS: This plan as outlined
covers a pretty wide territory, and I would
like a little more information on that, if it
is available.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would suggest
that my honourable friend ask for the production of that agreement, which will show
whether those things are provided for or
not. It may be quite proper to ask that the
agreement be modified as may be necessary
by reason of these expropriations.
I may answer
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend further by giving the
views of the Government concerning its relations with the City of Ottawa. Thé Government is doing generously its part towards
the proper development of the Capital. On
the other hand, the City, as a municipality,
bas a right to affirm that it exempts from
taxation considerable government property.
The value of Dominion government property
in Ottawa exempt from municipal taxation
has been %38,413,025 in recent years. The
present tax rate of the city is 31.70 mills.
That is the annual rate that would be paid
to the city on government property were it
taxed like other property.
All that Ottawa receives in lieu of taxation
is an annual grant of $100,000. In 1924, in
a memorandum submitted by the City of
Ottawa, it was contended that the Government should pay annually the following
amounts: a grant of say, $100,000 towards
the maintenance of a fire brigade and of
$40,000 towards the maintenance of the police
department; towards pavements, street and
sewer maintenance, $50,000; towards street
lighting, $5,000. These amounts total $195,000,
and if the Government were in the same
position in respect of its properties as the
owners of other property in the city, these,
it is alleged, would be the grants we should
have to consider making, to some extent at
least, to the éity. In addition to the $100,000
in lieu of taxation, we pay some $40,000 for
a water supply, and that is all the city gets.
The extra amount being given by the Government to the city for improvement and park
purposes may be regarded as not in excess
of an equivalent.
If the project now before us is approved,
the City Board of Control and the Federal
District Commission will control the character
of the buildings fronting on the new Confederation Park along Elgin street, in order
to give the central portion of the city proper
relief and dignity, so that such improvements
as are effected on that section may be reflected in other parts of the city.
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. REID: I do not know whether
the agreement to which the honourable gentleman refers bas all been explained. I suppose
that it will be necessary now to have another
agreement, and in this connection I would
like to ask the honourable gentleman a question. The amount of taxation that the City
will lose on all these properties that are taken
over will be a considerable sum, and I assume
there bas been no agreement with regard to
that. If there bas been such an agreement, I
would like to know. What arrangement is
to be made with the City with respect to the
taxation 'that the City was receiving on the
Russell House and the other properties?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
that any special agreement bas been made
recently. I have in my hand a memorandum
regarding the agreement of 1925. Chapter 21
of the Statutes of 1925 authorized the Minister
of Public Works to extend for a period of
five years from July 1, 1925, the provisions of
the agreement between His Majesty the King
and the Corporation of the City of Ottawa,
dated March 13, 1920, and provided that the
Government should pay to the Corporation
the sum of $100,000 annually for a period of
five years from July 1, 1925, fhe said payments to be in full satisfaction and discharge
of a1 claims and demands on the Government
by and on the part of the corporation, except
as otherwise provided in the agreement.
The exceptions are as follows:
(1) The Government wil:l pay the corporation for water supplied in all buildings or
properties now, or hereafter owned by the
Government in the City of Ottawa, including
Rideau Hall and the Central Experimental
Farm, at the rate of 13c. per thousand gallons,
up to two hundred million, and 10c. per
thousand gallons for water used in any year
in excess of this amount. In the case of water
supplied buildings and other properties leased
by the Government, this shall be subject to
the general water rates established by the
corporation. The total payments to the City
of Ottawa by the Department of Public
Works for water supplied during the calender
year 1927, was $45,220.69.
(2) The Government pay annually a sum
equal to 10 per cent of the cost of water
meters installed by the corporation.
(3) In consideration of the annual grant to
the City and the Improvement Commission,
the amount paid annually to the corporation
shall be in full payment in respect of water
supplied for street sprinkling, fire protection
and parks and driveways.
(4) The Government shaHl maintain and
keep in repair pavements and walks of:

529

MAY 10, 1928
(a) Bridge over the Rideau Canal known
as Connaught Place.
(b) Laurier Avenue Bridge over the Rideau
Canal.
(c) Bridges over the Chaudiere slides.
(5) The Government. shall maintain and
replace when necemary certain sidewalks and
pavements addoining government properties
and shaHl be subject to local improvement
rates imposed by the corporation ini the sarne
way as other property owners.
If I fiud that an agreement has been made
lately on account off the rearrangement and
the present expropriations, I will lay it before
the House.
Hon. Mr. REID: I arn not raising any
objection at aIl, but I desired to know
whether it would flot be necessary to make
another agreement. Prior to the agreement
off 1925, I think, the Governrnent paid
$100,000.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: That was the
renewal of a five-yeaT agreement that had
extended from 1920 to 1925.
Hon. Mr. REID- The previous agreement
provided fer the payment- of $100,000. Under
the agreement of 1925 the City, I think, was
given another $100,000 in payment for water
supply, etc., that we had free before. When
the Goverument was paying the first S100,000
ail the salaries of civil servants were exempt
from taxation by the City of Ottawa. That
exemption was affterwards withdrawn, and the
civil servants are all paying civie taxes on
income.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn not sure
whether I heard the honourable gentleman
correctly, but I got the impression that there
was to be a widening of Elgin strcet from
Sparks street to Laurier avenue.
Except for the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
public buildings in that area, everything will
bc turned into a park.
Hon. Mr. REID: What about the Roxborough Apartments?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I arn not objecting
to the beautification of the city. but I would
like to ask if the *Government is making
any stipulation that the city should provide
a source off decent water for the city. This
matter was brought up two or three years
ago in the Senate, and at that time honourable gentlemen expressed themscives very
clearly on the subject.
Another matter that I think ought to be
deait with is the poiscming of the air of the
city with the sulphite fumes that we get
56109--34

every few days. I arn told that it is a very
simple matter to put an apparatus ini the
chimneys that 'will do away with that vile
smell. I think that the Government, in
spending these vast amounts of money, running into several million dollars, should compel the city to do the right thing in these
matters. Evidently nothing wiil be donc
without compulsion, and I think the Government *should withhold the money until it
is done.
Hon. Mr. REID:

That is in Hull.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend is quite right. The smell off sulphite
which permeates the atmosphere is noticeable
all over the city off Ottawa, espeeially when
the wind blows from the north. I do not
know whether it affects other people in the
same way that it affects me, but at times
it bas made me positively ill. I also think
my honourable friend is perfectly right in
stating that the difficulty can be very easily
overeome; tl believe there are ways off consuming the smoke; but off course nothing
will be done without compulsion. It is all
the result off a forrn off egotism with which
the world is very much troubled-nobody
will do anything that means any expense to
him, no matter how many others may be
incon.venienced. I do not know whether the
city off Ottawa has any control off tbe matter,
but I think the Goverument might compel
the plants to consume these gases.
I will draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the attention of the Government to the possibility off cxerting some little pressure on the
municipal authorities.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: How would it do to
put a proviso in the Bill that they should
flot get any money until those nuisances
are abated?
Hon. 'Mr. GORDON: I. like almost everyone else, arn pleased to see the capital made
worthy off the cou.ntry, and I appreciate very
well that it can be done only by making large
expenditures. On the other hand, I believe
that a mistake bas been made in one respect.
1 think that before agreeing to make thîs
large eopenditure the Government should
have ;taken advantoge of the opportunity to
make this a Federal District, eimilar to the
District of Columbhia. This would have been
the proper 'time te, do it. EverybodY knoffl
that the members for this coxstituency are
bothered go much about patronage mnatteTS
that they have not time to attend to their
proper duties. I think the sooner we com-

SENATE

mence to realize that this locality should be
divorced altogether from such influences, the
better it wiIl be for ail concerned.
As I say, 1 think a mistake has been macle
in flot faking action to make this a Federal
District. A man would be simple indeed. if
he concluded that this was going fa be the
end of the expenditure. If the Government
are to make ail these improvements, and there
are more fo, follow, I think fhey shoulýd get a
quid pro quo, and that steps shýuld be taken
very early f0 create a Pederal District. If it
were not for the fact that I believe tbis f0 be
a worthy work, I wouid feel disposed to oppose
the Bill very strenuously upon the grounds I
have mentîoned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend wouid perhaps be iii advised in so, doing,
beeause there are obstacles in, the way of
reaching a decision now. Parliamentarians on
both sides may, hy expressing their views,
streng-then the hands of the Government. I
may ftell honourabie gentlemen that the Prime
Minister has expressed a disposition similar
f0 their own, and he ham allowed us to hope
that when the census is taken in '1931, and a
redistribution of constituencies takes place
consequent upon that census, the time will be
at hand to discuss the creation of a Federal
District. At that time there will be a redistribution of the memnbers to be elected by the
Province of Ontario, which is entitled to a certain number of representatives, based on the
representation of Quebec. Probably it would
be a good thing if the Senate, before 1931,
were to pass a resolution along these lines.
Personally, I would pledge my vote to any
such resolution.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: I would just point
ouf f0 my honourable frian-d that when that
fime comnes, the Government in power will be
besieged by aIl their influential friends who
rnay be opposed to the creation of a Federal
District, and that after the money has Éeen
spent the opposition wiII lie more strenunus
than if would ba now. For thaf reason I fhink
it woulid have heen easier to have accom1plished the end in view before these large
siims of money ware promised.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I liappened to
represent Ottawa in the Government of Canada for twelve years at a time when patronage
was enough fa, kilI a hialf a dozen men of
tihis day. Why it did naf kilI me I have
nevier been able ta explan to myWef satisfaotorily. A Federal Commission woýuld have
been a godsend. to me. I have thought for
many years past that a Federal District
should be established, but I want teo point
Hon.

Mr. GORDON.

ouf 'that if can-not be done quite as easily and
simply as my honouraible friand seems fa
tihink. A proper Faderai District could not
be creatad without faking in a portion of
Quabec, and thaf would offer a greaf many
diffloulties, for instance, with regard to the
laws governing proparty and civil riglits, and
municipal laxis, which in the two Provinces
do not agree. There are many tihings that
wouild have to ba adjusted, and which w'ould
roquire much time and caraful considaration.
Furtbermore, thare would be the difficulty of
the franchise. I doubt very mudh whether
the peqple of the capital and the surrounding
country wou'ld bie quite willing 'ta forego their
right, ta, vote. I think the establishment of a
Faderai District would have to be predicated
upon the people refaining their franchiýa. If
is true that we have an example in Washington of the people agreejng to lase their
fede-ral vote.
Han. Mr. MeLENNAN: If was that, way
in fthc beginning.
Anyone wlho came fa
Washington knaw that lie would be disfranchised.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If was a volunfary
sacrifice, made befora sattling down in Washington; but hera you would have f0, take away
the riglit to vote from probably "0,000 or
250,000 people who might noýt 'be willing fa
be shorn in that way.
I have given this matter very deep consideration, partly f or the reason that I have
mentioned, and ýpartly because I balieve tihat
the asfab'lishment of a Federal District is tihe
basf way fa make tihe capital worthy of fthe
rest of the country. This question has bean
mixch talked about, but 1 have neyer yet
heard of any solution that would be satisfactory ta the majority of the people, and I
fhink that the improvemants now contemplated are vary far off, if they have to waif
until fhese difficulfies are adjustad. The
,acquisition of the Rusell theatre and the
Russell House block could not possibly have
takan place for a great many years if fthe
solution of these difficulties had been a
n.acessary preliminary.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: But fthc argument of
my honourable friend sfrangtbens my argument, does if not? H1e says that a numnber
of people hare will lie opiposad fa 'baing disfranchised.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I said they have
been opposed.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Therefore tihe time
to deal with people of that opinion is before

Hon, W. B. ROSS: I would like Vo suggest
Vo the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that possibly it would
help the situation if, with regard Vo the

Vo do that with the Civil Service, but it would

of the creation of a, real Federal District, and

gentleman who has Vo vote for it
'honourwble
will vote for it with a wry face, because at
the next election photographs of the buildings
that are being acquired and destroyed ia this
city for the purpose of carryîng out this
scheme will be shown throughout the country,
and in many constituencies the people wil
have borne in upon them the fact that they
themselves have been agitating for buildings
half as big and half as good as those that
have been destroyed here. 'Phere la a feeling

If this movement la Vo become a popular one, I suggest Vo the honourable gentleman frocri Ottawa that it would
be in the interests of the citizens and property owners of the city to take a leed in the
discussion of the formation of a Federal District. This is onily the beginnhig of the expenditure; there will be further expenditures;
and if the members of Parliament are Vo vote
those sums, their constituencies will expect
themi Vo satisfy themselves that a large and
comiprehiensive plan la being carried out free

capital is being bult that wîll be a creit to
the whole country. They wili neyer be satisfied while you have a municipal organization,
a federal organization, a.nd a very strongly
entrenched political organization, and I submit vhat it is in the interests of the citizens
and property owners here Vo corne to a conclusion as to whether they are prepared to
forego their franchise for the purpose of
securing the backing of the country, or whether
they propose to eat their cake and have it.
I venture Vo predict that within two or three
years this scheme wiIl sag at both ends and
give way in the *middle, unless the people of
the country can be assu-red that the Government controls the expenditure and is carrying
out a comprehiensive scheme leading to the
final conclusion of a national capital free
from local interference. Possibly next year
some of us will put the matter in concretd
formi before this House; meantime those who
vote for this measure will do so, as I say,
with a wry face. It is an unpopular measure,
and I do flot like it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is no more
unpopular than was the one foT the creation
of the Ottawa Improvement Commission in
1899. No onc knows that better than I do,
because I had a great deal Vo do with it. The
opinions that we have just heard expressed
were frequently expressed at that time, and
yet I think that to-day .everybody miust
admit that the work done by the Ottawa
Improvement Commission has been very well
done, and that it has gone far to beautify the
city. Every member of this House must feel
a pridc in what has been done. The objections were then just as strong and as loud as
they are to-day, possibly more so, and the
answer Vo those criticisms is just what anyone
can see around the city. My honourable
friend evidently took the impression from my
remarks a moment ago that the citizens of
Ottawa are opposed Vo a Federal Commission.
I think the mai ority of the people of Ottawa
would be willing to have such a Commission;
but I do flot think iVwould be right or proper,
or consistent with public policy, to ask those
people Vo accept $250,000 and forego their
votes.
Hion. Mr. GORDON: I think it would.
Hon. 'Mr. BELCOURT: That is my hionourable friend's opinion.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I thought you asked
for opinions.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I don't Vhink
it is right. So far as the Civil Service la
concerned, that is a different proposition.. I
think the idea might be seriously entertained

SENATE
in regard to thern, but in regard to the citizens,
they will always want to, exercise their franchise. Aft-er ail, we mnust rerneîber that that
i6 a duty to the state. We cannot look upon
that as rnerely a favour or a pleasure granted
to citizens. There is a duty implied in casting one's vote, and why should we deprive
people, by thie Bill, of the privilege and duty
of exercising their franchise?
In these matters a solution might be found
whichi would be satisfactory, but 1 do nlot
think it is right to say that the citizens oi
Ottawa, whorn I have represented in Parliament for thirty years, want to eat their cake
and have it ton, to use the words of my hionourable friend. I do not think that is fair
to the citizens of Ottawa at ail. They have
done a great deal in the way of helpîng to
improve the City. In every street you wil
find beautiful trees, and in front or around
the premises of every srnall house or cottage
you wili find a ittie bit of lawn. That is a very
special feature of this city, and it proves what
I say, that the citizens of Ottawa have ia this
and rnany other sTespects made a great deal
of individual sacrifice in order to make the
City what it is.
Nobody can deny that Ottawa is a beautifut
City. Nobody can deny that it is a city that
is well-kept, notwithstanding that a temporary
fence lias ýbeen put up fer a few days; but I
venture to say that no city can be found in
Canada that is better kept, that is cleaner,
or that looks cicaner, than the city of Ottawa.
Hou. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Includiag winter
streets and sidewaiks?
Hon. Mr. BELCýOURT: Well, there were
unsusual conditions last winter, but I agrep
with my honourable friend if hie means that
the city of Ottawa can do something better
than it did last winter, in regard to their
strects. I arn one of tJaose Who have made
protest against the condition nf the stre4es.
My boys smashed my motor car on t.wo occasions during the winter, because of the conditi-on of those roads. Such occurrences bring
home ,to one tbe need of improvement, but
the ýcity of lOtta-va will correct those evils,
and you wiii neyer see the streets again iii.

I think the Ottawa people are entitied to be
spoken of in a littie more generous way than
in the l.angiiage used by my honourabie friend.
I do flot tbink they are the kind ni people who
want te, eat their cake and have it ton.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I said last year,
and 1 want. te, repeat, that the terni "Federal

we should either have a Federal District or
not, one or the other. 1 think that the nid

for that.
The explanation given by the leader of the
Government in connection with the purchase
ni the property on Rideau street, two miles
fromn here, is flot clear to me. I did hear
that the purchase of that property was in
order to extend tbe driveway; I do flot know
if there is anything in that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Tbe purpose is to

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER That is onre ni the
purporses nf purchasing that property, is it?
Mr. BELCýOURT: Yes.

to Ottawa 1 have dbserved a condition which
does not exist in any city ni Canada. I will
go further than thiat, and say that it does not
exist in any town or srnall village; that is,
the miserable, the disgracefui sigbýt which. cen

it hm. been stated, and the public know, that
the whole general scheme was to make a
pa-rk downtowards the soutb, and include the
ground on Laurier avenue Vhat the Government owns at present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend forgeýts that the opportunity of devel.oping this present plan was seized because
the Rlussell property was on the market, a-nd
because there was a tbreat of a valuable
,building going up; so that with the present
e3qpenditure the Federal1 Commission can
deve4-op a very nice part of the eity, and
increase the ipark area dow'n to, the Laurier
bridge, and thus create an im:pression of
beauty on thou.sands of people who daily
reach 4he city. That is where they arrive,
and that is what they will see. There is thc
Cartier Park further on, past the City Hall1;
and ail this wil form a general area that will
give the impdreasion of a large park. There
will be buildings remaining in the centre, but
thoyse buildings are flot of a mean character.
Yeu have the City Ha'PI, and you have the
bospitals or schools furtiher on. There will
be a certain dignity added. to that part of
Ottawa. The reason for the plan was the
necessity of making a prompt decision as to
the Rusell property. The rest has followed.
Hon. Mr. MoLENNAN: I have no criticismn
to offer at the moment with regard to the purchase of the Russell House property. That is
apparently excellent busins. As to the fears
of my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt), we know that, alter ail, the
Government bas power to expropriate for the
benefit of the Commission.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURI: We aIl know what
that means.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Furthermore, it
would have been better had the matter been
put flot only here, but elsewhere, as it has
been put by our leader, who is skilful in the
art of putting things pleasantly, and, said
nothinýg about the plan extending down to
Laurier avenue and Elgin street.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to ask
the honourable senator from Ottawa whether
he knows how municipal taxation is arranged
in the District of Columbia. If there were a
Federal Disrict bere, would the inliabitants
be free from municipal' taxation?
Lion. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: They would pay
the equivalent.
Hon. Mfr. MeLELLAN.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is a long time
since I looked up the provisions which govemn
the District of Columibia, but my recollection
ii that the District of Columbia is
administered by three Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Two are elected by
the people and one is named by the Goverument, and they do the whole work.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They arrange the
taxation?
Hon. Mr. BEJiCOURT: I think the whole
expenditure is Federal expenditure but those
three Commissioners administer the fund which
is furnished- by the Federal GovernmenIt for
the purposes of tihat District.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The people are not
free from taxation?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They have not the
franchise, but as bas be.en pointed out by my
honourable frîend from Sydney (Hon. Mr.
MeLennan), at that time the District of
Columnbia was created Washington amounted
to little or nothing, and The people were
willing to make the sacrifice. The people who
have gone there to Jive make the sacrifice in
going there. That is different from the taking
away of a right which bas been exercised from
time immemorial by the people of the district
of Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 thought that
the bonourable leader of the Government gave
me a very definite answer when, in view of
the announcement attributed to the Prime
Minister, I asked whether it was contemplated,
that the Government would ultimately acquire
aIl the property down to Laurier avenue. It
was very important to me in deýaling with this
aspect of the matter, to kn.ow if that were the
case. I do not want to criticize what has
been done, and I am not going to discuss it,
but I uýnderstood from the bonourable gentleman's answer that there was ndthing in
contemplation by the Goveroment, for the
present or for the future, other than the
expenditure of $3,0O0,0O0. If, en the other
baud, this is but the initial step, as would
appear from the answer given to the honourable gentleman from Sydney (Hon. Mr.
MoLennan), and if it is to be followed by
further expenditures next year and in ensuing
years, for the acquisition of all that additional
property, then the soheme assumes an entirely
different aspect. I do nlot desire to prevent
your bargaining power, or your saying that
you are going to do this, that or the other
thing, but thbere are many who are flot willing
that the present expenclitures should pass

MAY 10, 1928
without criticism, under the special circumstances that the bonourable gentleman has Bat
out or that t>he Govarnment ehould ernbark
on the acquisition of ail that territory between
Sparks street and Laurier avenue at any price,
or at an expenditure running, a it would run,
into millions of dollars.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may have led
my honourable friend into error when, on moving the second reading of the Bill, I stated M~y
own view of the situation. I said that personally I sghould think the Government ought
to pick up any property available within a
certain area, that ail the buildings thus acquired would be sure to give a net. return of
five or six per cent in rentals, and that in
years to come-whether in a quarter of a
century or later-our chîldren or -our grandchîldren would find that the Government held
property which was costing nothing to the
country, because it was paying property, and
which would be available whenever it was
considered necessary to provide for the expansion of our Parliament Buildings. That
was simply a suggestion that I threw out. I
was not speaking for either the Prime Minister
or the Government.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is not
the explanation the honourable gentleman
gave to me. I ar n ot saying this by way of
carping critici.sm. Perhaps that was an answer
to remarks made by others. I thought the
answer given to me was a categorical one,
binding the honourable gentleman as a representative and member of the Government.
We have another illustration of what is, I
think the haphazard method that is followed.
There is now in course of erection a very
fine ten-story office building not far from the
Metropolitan Building on Wellington street.
The new structure wiil be a highly creditable
one, I have no doubt, but if it is the desire
of the Government to beautify Parliament
Hill and aIl the approaches to it, and to, have
in the vicinity as many open spaces as possible and no very high buildings, I think we
should bave something to say about the erction of that particular building. Parliament
might very well take to itself the right to
prevent the erection of any building which
would ultimately detract from its appearance
of Parliament Hill and its approaches. There
are many stories about what is going to
happen regarding the tenancy of the new
building, but I amn not going to tittie-tattle
on that. In any event the erection of a high
office building such as this, so close to our
Parliament Buildings, is decîdedly a very
great detriment architecturally and from the
landscape point of view, and when you have

5

a scheme of betterment and beautification.
1 do flot think that office buildings of that
character, or any.other high buildings, should
be erected on Wellington street, opposite any
of the Parliament Buildings.. They are an
obstruction to the view.
The honourable leader said that he would
favour the expropriation of property on Metcalfe street. That would take away the
Rideau Club, with ail the comforts 80 dear
to members of this House. What would you
do about the O'Connor street corner? There
you will find a tail office building which is
utilitarian, not handsome, and which will
certain4y detract from. the whole picture of
Parliament Hill and its approaches.
Honourable
Hon. GEORGE GORDON:
gentlemen, I *arn in complete accord with
the statement of the honourable member from
Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) that the
term "Federal District Commission" is a misnomer. Heretofore. the Commission has been
known as the Ottawa Improrvement Commission, and we are very thankful to the men
who were members at various times for the
good work whîch they did. Before proceeding with what I desire to say, I woruld refer
incidentally to the remarks of the honourable
member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) regarding the residents of Ottawa doing so
much in beautifying their homes and lawns.
We ail know that what he states is a fact, and
we appreciate it very much. But we know
also that there is not a city, town or ha-mlet
in Canada whose people would flot llterally
give their eye teeth to have the Government
mnake expenditures for the beautifying of their
locality.
The Commission is known as the Federal
District Commission. What is its scope? We
have here in Ottawa a beautiful city. Hull
is another fine city, and there is a very
beautiful river flowmng between the two places.
It appears to me that a Federai Commission
should include in its first expenditure some

of the area of M~I.
against Hull? What bas Hull done to warrant
treatment of this kind, I would like to know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It bas been very
hospitable.
.Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is flot very
eager for a Federal Commission.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: There is a water
frontage in Hull, just as there is here, and
f or the life of me I cannot understand why,
if the Commission is really a Federal body,
it should flot include Hull in some of its expenditures. It is now proposed to spend
$3,000,000, and I think that the water frontage

536

SENATE

of Huit shouid be used as a basis for part
of that expenditure. That city should be
beautified under the proposed plan. I contend
further that Hull and Ottawa, although separate municipalities, are as a matter of fact
one community. Is Hull being discriminated
against just because it is in the province of
Quebec?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 must point
out to my honourable friend that the Federal
Commission, so-.called, must be governed in
its action by the capital piaced at its disposal.
Hon. Mvr. GORDON: I arn in favour of
haif of the amount being used to beautify
Huil, or the water frontage there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that the Commission will investigate, for a
future time, the possibilities of beautifying
Huit. I do flot know how far the plans are
advanced, but the money that is at the disposai of the Commission does not exceed
the amount required for the plans which are
before my honourabie friend.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then there is really
under contemplation a further expenditure,
to be made on the other side of the river?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Not that I
know of.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, in closing this important debate may I
be allowed to make this suggestion? As
we have heard a great deal about the intention to create a Federal District here, the
honourable leader of the Government should,
at the opening of next Session, move for the
appointment of a Committee composed of
ahl the young men of this -House to study
the question, which is a very complex one,
and endcavour, in consultation with the Government, to suggest a solution. I think important work could be done by the Senate
next Session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a very
valuable suggestion, which we should act
upon at next Session.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-period for payment of annual
grants extended:
The Hon. thc CHAIRMAN: Shahl section

ourselves to a fiftecn-year program, involving the expenditure of so much money every
year. If we fix a period of five years there
wili be ample time to see whether this scheme
is going to be a success, and after the expiration of the five years it can be carried on
by other legislation. The period of fifteen
ycars is too long. 1 have already exprcssed
the opinion that the expenditure provided
for by this Bihl is unwarranted at the present
time. Why shouhd we pass legisiation declaring what we are going to do flftecn years
from now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then my honourable friend should, with bowcd head, confess
his past errors.
Hon. Mr., MeMEANS:
How?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman in 1919 voted for $150,000 a
year for t-en ycars.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Wherc?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In this very
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do not remember
it. I was nlot here at that time.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIIAND:
Yes, my honourable friend was here in 1919.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
I do not think
I was here when the vote was taken.
Hon. Mr DANDURAND: The reason for
the fifteen-year period is that the sumn provided is ailocated chiefly to maintenance.
When the fifteen years are over, very likely
-very surely-my honourable friend and I
wvill be here to ask for a vote for another
fifteen years.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I sincerely hope
so, but I still maintain that there is no
necessity of binding yourself for fifteen years
when it is sufficient to bind yourself for five
years, or from year to year, for that matter.
We cannot get any information. Ahl that we
are toid is purely surmise. I think the
honoura-ble gentleman made the statement
the other day that it is going to cost about
$750,000 a year to maintain these parks. That
may be right or it may be wrong. Ahl these
plans are extremely expensive. When the
five years have expired we shahl know how
we stand. Only the other day it was stated
in another place that this littie piece of
property down here, which you can jump
acroas<, ýs going to be paved, the buildings
having been torm down, and the paving is
going to cost $30,000. That is running wild
in the expenditure of public money. I can

see no reason why the word "flfteen" shouli

ta be authorized from year to year.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Yes, but I did not

Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would move
that we replace section 5 by the following:

Hon, W. B. PL>OSS: There would be no
damages against Vhem if the man was arrested

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What I mean
to say is that this legisIation is directed to
men who would inake a business of carrying
liquor from one province inito another. I
would say that the main application of this
legisiation would, le between two neighbouring provinces. If there was a systematic
assault on the law of Ontario *by some exporters from Montreal, they would understand thaît the Attorney General of Ontario
would say: "Me will prosecite that party,
and we wiil iprosecute hiim in Toronto, and
not in Montreal, where he could lie proseouted under tii Act." So I do not see that
there is any very great danger of this law
being abused.
As the Deputy Minister of Justice well
states, it is an advantage given the accused
over the general Criminal law. «Under that
Iaw a summons could go from one part of
the country to the other. In this instance the

General says so in writing; so that the accused

events, over a&K
others accused under the
genera'l Criminal law.
Hon*Mr. BEAUBIEN: I asked the honourable gentleman yesterday to explain why
there should lie a distinction between sections 6 and 7 in dealing with the offender.
Under section 6 the jurisdiction for the
offence is governed by two things, either the
presence of the accused or hie residence in the
province into wbich the importation is made.'
If a person imports into the province of
Ontario from Qu-ebec he may be prosecuted

539

on two grounds; because he is present in that
province, or because he resides there. Outaide
of those two conditions the authorization of
the Attorney f3eneral must lie obtained in
advance. Arn I right?
Hon. Mr. DANDUERANiD: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Well, if that is the
case for an offence when a man importa, why
should' that same precaution flot apply in the
cae of a man who offende because he exporta?
I cannot for the life of me see the difference
belween the guilt of one who importa and the
guilt of the person who exporta. It is ail the
game offence, either at one end or at the other.
Why sbould an importer to the exclusion
of the exporter be protected hy the assurance
that lie can onl1y be prosecuted in one province if he was present there or resided there?
Why does that distinction exist in the law?
I thinik we are losing sight of the fact that
this is not at ail a criminal offence. We are
creating an offence here in order to protect
the business of liquor control either in one
province or the other. It seems to me that
in that case it is only just and fair to ask
that the same precaution taken by this Bill
to proteet the mani who, infringes its provisions at the importation end should be extended aiso to the man that infringes from
the exportation end cf it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That applies only to,
section 6.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I compare section
6 to section 7.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-8TAUJNTON: It eeems
to me -that section 6 makes provision that a
prosecu-tion may take place in the area into
which the liquor is imported, and it may take
place against one who lives in another provi ,nce for sending it into that prov!ince. Suppose
I find a barrel bf whiskey in Ottawa that has
been sent from the province of Quebec by
John Smith, who resides there; I amn going
to prosecute him who resides and is presently
in the province of Quebec. But where arn I
going to prosecute bim? The venue lies only
in the place from whdch the liquor is sent.
Where wus it sent from? Where was hie
place of residence when it started on that
journey? Was it not the railway station in
wbieh is was deposited? Or was it the warebouse from which it -was taken out? It may
have been taken out of a warehouse in
Quebec by that mnan, and sent up anxd kept
ini Montreal for a month, and then re-sbipped
from Monitreal. Where would I lay that
venue? It seems to me a most extraordinary
provision.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is a question whether
the crime is committed in a certain province
or at the houndary between two province&.
Suppose that liquor is invoiced from Montreal
ta Toronto: the crime is committed by invoicing and sending the liquor.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Not until

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is a question,
but, anyway, why should we discuss it at the
moment? We are now discussing anothe r
point. Section 6 deals with the commission
of an offence defined in section 3. The question is whether the party who has committed
the offence may be prosecuted under the
Criminal Code in the place where hie resides,
or in some other place ini Canada. He can
be arrested at another place.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes, but not judged
there. He certainly can be prosccuted only
where the crime has been committed.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am speaking of the
common law. Under the common law hie
would be tried at the place where hie is

No;
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

No;
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: After it has crossed

in the province of Ontario, in the case that*
I suggested. Now, would it be fair that a
man living in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia
should be brought to the province of Ontario
instead-of heing tried ini his own province?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: He should
be tried in the province of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUTE: He should be brought
up fromn New Brunswick to Ontario?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not think so.
At any rate, section 8 is worded so as ta
provide that the accused shall not be brought
from his own place of residence without the
authority of the Attorney General of hie
province. He will be tried in the province
in which hie la domidiled, unless it la otherwlse

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does the honourable gentleman think that the consent of
the Attorney General applies to section 7 as

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Let us dispose first of
section 6. Then, on section 7, as ta the
argument of the honourable member from,
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), the hionourable leader of the Government will be

affo'rded in section 6 is not afforded also in

if a man is resident in Quebec and is accused
in Ontario of the crime of importing liquor

SECOND READING

Hon. M*r. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, with the
heave of the House, I will move the second
reading of this Bill. I have a few necessary
references to explain the Bill, and with the
idea of sending it to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, without the Senate
binding itself te whatever principhe there may
be in the, Bill.
As a matter of facot t.here is no principle in
the Bihl. The Naturalization Act of 1914 contains the principle, and the present amendment has simnply for its objet the altering
of proceclure. It did not take me long ta find
the fine of cheavage between those who stand
for the old procedure and those who favour
the new. This present Act seeks mershy to
eliminate the proceduTe before the judges
which terminates with a certificats whioh must
be sent to the Secreta¶'y of Stats, who has
full discretion to accept or rejeet; so that
the matter is as to what virtue there may be
in ths procedure of the aId Act, and what
resons there may be for altering that
procedure.
If the honourable gentleman will allow me,
I will run through a very short statement
explaining the history of this legielation.
The Naturalization Act, as it stands, is ths
resuit of deliberations of Imperial Conferences
of the ysars 1902, .1907 and. 1911. Prier to its
enactmnent naturalization was local throughout
the United Kingdom. and the Dominions.
These Naturalisation Acta purported to make
persons -naturalized thersunder British éubjects within the respective territories of the
United Kingdoen, Dominions and Colonies.
Persona so naturalized, wouhd, therefore, have
British nationality in the territory of naturalization, but they could nlot be regarded as
British nationaïs if they stepped beyond the
confines of such territory.
The esential
feature of the present legishation is that an
a-lien, naturalized in the United Xingdom, in
any of the Dominions or in India, is recagnized
as a British subjeet throughout Hia Majestya
Dominions.

543

It shouhd be pointsd out that this legislation
is in effeet a treaty or convention betwesn ths
United Kingdom and the various Dominions,
and there can be no doubt that it should be
observed with even greatei, sacredness than
that which surrounds an international treaty.
It conders a most highly-prized privilège in that
it grants to the holder the rights of assistance by British consuls throughout the worhd.
For these resns it is necessary that the
Naturalization Act in Canada should be most
carefully administered. A certificats should
not be issued to anyane, or ta any cla.ss of
persons, where the holder, or any memýber of
a chass, is hiable to annoy or in any way be
a charge uapon the United Kingdom or any
Dominion.
The underlying features of this hegisiation
are embodied in principles laid down at the
Imperial Conference of 1911. Thsy are as
follows:
1. Imperial nationality shauld be worldwide and uniform.
2. The Naturalisation Act shouhd be se
framed as ta enable each sehf-governing Dominion.to adopt it.
3. The Mother Country finds it neoessary
to maintain five years as a qualifying period.
This is a safeguard to the Dominions as wslh
as to us, but five years anywhers in the Empire should be as good as five ysars in the
United Kingdom.
4. The grant of nationality is in every case
discretionary and this discretion should be
exercieed by those responsible in the Dominion in which the applicant has spent the
haqt twelve moanths.
I say the hast twehve months because under
the Canadian Act one need not be more than
twehve months in the Dominion, provided he
establishes that he has been four years in
some other .part of the Empire.
The principle involved in this Bill is No. 4.
The grant of nationality is in every case discretionar y, and this discretion shouhd. be exercised by thoe" responsible in the ares in
which the applicant has spent the hast twehve
months; that is, in the Dominion or in Great
Brîtain. It is essential, therefore, that the
authority which grants naturalisation should
have full discretion in doing so. This appears
to be fuhly given by Section 4 (3) of the Act
as it stands. I refer te the Act that we passed
in 1914, which is on the Statuts Book. It is
as folhows:
The grant of a certîficate of naturahization te
any such ahien shail be in the absolute diacretion of the Secretary of State of Canada, and
he may, wjth or without assiging any reasan,
give or withhold the certificats as he thiks
most conducive ta the public goed, and no
appeal shall lie from his decision.

544

SENATE

This legislation was enacted in the UnitF d
Kingdom in 1914 and was subsequently
adopted in Australia, Soutli Africa and Newfoundland.
The absolute discretion is, however, limited
liy later clauses of the Act. Sections 22, 23,
24, 25, 26 and 27, whicli are printed witli the
Bill, provide that an applicant shall appear
before a .iudge for the purpose of being exarnined regarding bis qualifications for naturalization. Section 27, as you will sec, prov'ides t.hat the Minister mnay thercupon, in
bis a'bsolutc discretion, issue a certificate of
naturalization. This has been construcd f0
mnean that where a judgc reports fliat the
applicant is fit and qualificd, the Sccretary
of State may, in bis discretion, issue the certificite, whicli means that hie is not bound to
follow the finding of the court where the
report is favourable, but if it is unfavourable, lie bas no discretion and must refuse f0
issue the certificate. In other words, the discretion of the Minister is flot complete, and
one of the main purposes of this Bill is te
confer compîcte discretion upon him. There
is no such limitation els&alicre.

of naturalization, is one for the Government.

been against the applicant, the Minister was
unable to intervene and exercise bis discretion. In other cases .iudgcs have refused
naturalization because the applicants could
neither read nor write eitlier of the officiai
languages. Ia the opinion of flie Riglit
lionouralile Charles Dolicrty, former Minister of Justice, an applicant for naturalization should not be required to read or write.
It sliould only lie necessary for him to make
himsclf uaderstood in one of the official
languages.
While I sliould not lie considered to be
criticising the judiciary, I must, nevertlieless, state that in a very great number of
cases the Departmeat of flic Secretary of

I think it most important that we should

so I have not followed the procedure. Honourable members of the Senate have inquired
whether information with regard to procedure
could flot be had; therefore it has heen agreed
with the honourable gentleman who le-ads on
the other side (Hon. W. B. Ros) that, without
prejudging the question, we should pase the

Bill to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, which will ait to-morrow morning, in
order to obtain an intimate knowledge of the

Hon. Mr. HAYDON moved that the Bill be

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, the Bill has already been given
second reading; but I presume I am in order
in saying that I am a little doubtful of the
regularity of giving second reading to a Bill
so important as the present measure evidentty
is, before it has even appeared on the Order
Paper. I would like to have this reservation
made, that if frorn the scrutiny of the Bill it
should appear to the Committee that it in-

volves a principle that ought to have been
considered in the House, it will be permissible to consider it when the Bill is reported
from Committee.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: The purpose is simply
the incorporation of the company.

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I do not intend to move the third
reading of this Bill now, but would ask that
this Order be discharged and be placed on
the Orders of the Day for to-morrow. For
the' information of honourable members, so
that they may ponder over the situation and
form an opinion as to what our action should
be when the Bill comes up for third reading,
I may say that I have in my hand telegrams from the Governments of the various
Provinces interested in this legislation, advancing various arguments against the adoption of the amendment made by this House
to allow the carrying of half a gallon of

liquor from one Province to another. Most
of these arguments bear on the difficulties

which would be encountered by the Provinces in the application of their own laws if
the amendment were to remain in the Bill.

The motion was agreed to, and the Order
was discharged.

He said: Honourable gentlemen will remember that in the Session of 1925, Parliament passed an Act disposing of certain canteen funds that had accumulated during
the war. These funds were divided into ten
parts, and were distributed among the
Provinces according to population, one share
going to the Yukon Territory. That legislation receîved the unanimous approval. of the
two branches of Parl-iament.

CHAUMBER
REPO1%T

OF

SPECIAL COMMLTTEF-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved concurrence
in the first report of the Special Committee
appointed to consider the possibility of enlarging the Galleries of the Senate.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, when this
report was submitted to the House I mode
a few observations, which it is perhaps unnecessary for me to repeat to-night. I think
it would be well, however, for me to read
the report once more. It is to be found at
page 352 of the Minutes:
The Special Committee appointed to consider
the possibility of enlarging the galleries of the
Senate. beg leave to niake their first Report, as
follows:1. Your Committee recommend the addition
of four galleries on the east and west sides of
the Chamber, to provide accommodation for
between 200 and 230 extra guests at official
functions.
2. According to plans and estimate subnitted
by Mr. John Pearson, and concurred in by the
Chief Architect of the Departnent of Publie
o
W rks, the cost of construction of the eight
galleries would be between one hundred and
one hundred and ten thousand dollars.
3. Your Conimittee is informeid by the Cliief
Architect that if construction is conmenced immediately after prorogation, the additional space
would b availahle for the Opening of the next
Session.
4. Tie Conmittee submit herewith for the
information of the Senate. the plans prepared
by MUr. Pearson. It will be noted from these
plans that the proposed work will not involve
any stvtructural change in the building.
All which is respectfully submitted.
In addition to what I said the other day,
I might mention that Mr. Pearson, who evidently gave the matter very serions thought
eonisideration, was quite enthusiastic
and
about the effect which the making of these
galleries on both sides would have in beautifying the Senate Chanber. In his opinion
the change would add very greatly to the
artistie features of our House; and ho added
-what I think will be considered a matter
for congratulation-that they would add not
oniy beauty but comfort. One of the points
ho mentioned particularly was that those
galleries would remedy the draught on the
east side of the Chamber, of which honourable
gentlemen opposite frequently complain.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: That is why we
would be glad to change to the other side.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The reason is
not sufficient.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We hope you will
get a good airing before you come over to
this side.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Are there to be four
galleries on each side, or two?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Four. The recommendation reads as follows: "Four galleries
on the east and west sides of the Chamber."
Mr. Pearson also added that the acoustics of
the Chamber would be improved, and that the
ventilation or atnosphere of the Chamber
would be bettered by these changes.
I do not know that I can add anything te
what I said the other day and to what I have
just said, but if honourable gentlemen would
like to ask any questions about the work
of the Committee, and its recommendations.
I hiold myself at their disposal.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: What did you say the
other day as to the estimated expenditure?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Between $100,000

and $110,000.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, ever since I came into this
Chamber I have reflected with very great
sorrow on the fact that no ee insisted that
the architects should give us a replica of the
old Senate Chamber. I have passed through
quite a number of capitals, and have seen
many parliament buildings, but I do net know
that I have ever saw any Chamber conptraible wvith thle Senate of Canada as we had
it bfore the fire. Honourable gentlemen can
tierefore imagine my feelings-shall I say ny
indignation?--at finding our old Chamber reIt may have certain

qualities, architecturally speaking, and I confess that I am not competent to cros swords
with experts on the architectural value of this
Chamber; but I told Mir. Pearson that ho
would have to wait for all those who had
known the other Chamber to close their eyes
before ho would be permitted to hear an unbiased judgment as to the value of this
Chamber.
The outstanding reason which the report
seems to present for transforming these cold
walls into galleries, and giving us a chance
to feel that we breathe more freely, is that
the seating capacity will be increased for
official functions. I confess that I am not
interested to any extent in that reason given
by the Committee; for me it stands very far
in the background.
Ve have net the opinion of the associate
architect, Mr. Marchand, but I am glad to
find that the principal architect of the building recognizes that the carrying out of the
Committee's suggestion would increase the

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemîen, thougli I do flot expect it will do any

expenditure of another $150,000 for the purpose of changing this Chainher. I have no

in the country as more unjustifiable than the
expenditure of the money we have voted for
the City of Ottawa. There are only two occasions, rather than one-the Opening and
the Closing of Parliarn"nt-when we need
more roorn than we have at present.
With regard to the improvernent in the
acoustic properties of the building, I should
not be inclined to take the opinion of anyone
wbo bas had anything to do with the planning
of either the Bouse of Cornons or this
Chamber, because they seem to have been
built without any attention at ahl to acoustic
properties.
The Chamber is not, on the
wvhole, uncornfortable, and I think it will do
us vcry wil for some years to corne.
I think the wisest thing to do with this report is to allow it to stand for a week in
order to sec what the opinions of honourable
miembers, aré. For the present 1 feel very
strongly that the expenditure is unjustiflaible
in the present state of the finances of the
country.

Hon. J. W. DANIEL: I would like to ask
the honourable memrber from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt), would it not be possible to
get sornething which would really show what
the Chamber would look like after this change
had been completed.
There are two or three
architectural drawings on the Table, but they
are not sucb as would give the ordinary person, not uscd to consulting architectural drawings, a good idea of the result of the change.
I could not tell what it would be.
There are
what are called profiles and one thing and another of that kind, but they do not give me
the slightest idea of what appearance the
Chamber will have if the proposed change is
carried out.
Witb reference to the rernarks of honourable gentlemen on the question whether the
seherne is advisable or not, 1 arn of opinion
that it is. To me this Chamber, when I first
saw it, was a great disappointment indced.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think that gives
a fair idea of what the changes will be, but
one bas to draw on one's own imagination.

1 had been accustorned to the old Chamber,
which pleascd the eye and was cornfortable to
sit in, and much easier to hear in than this
one is. It is not exactly correct, I think, to
say that the changes are for only one day in
the vear.
The fact is that there are more
occasions, though not very rnany, it is truc,
when public receptions are held in this
Chamber.
There are the Opening and the
Closing of Parliarnent and allied functions, and
ns this is the place where such functions have
always been held, and held now and will be
hqeld in the future, I tbink the Chamber should
be at least satisfying to those who use it
ordinarily and who would expeet to use it on
sncb occasions. I rather differ from my honourable friend who objects to the expenditure

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand
frorn these plans and frorn what Mr. Pearson

feet deep, allowing of three rows of seats, and
they would accommodate between 200 and 220

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think
that those pillars would protrude so much
that people could not see the Governor General. It is possible that the Governor General migbt not be visible to the people sitting in the fourth gallery, but I should think
that the other tbree galleries would afford a
clear view.
Hon Mr. GILLIS: Would not the proposed pillars extend out from. the galleries?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; as I understand it, there would be no change made in
that sculptured wood. You would *bave the

altered in any way.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The galleries would

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There was nothing definite said as to who would do the
work. I believe it was practically understood that Mr. Pearson would not do it, but
that it would be done by the Public Works
Department. I think my honourable friends
from Aima (Hon. G. G. Foeter) and Inkerman (Hon. Smeaton Wlhite) will agree with

gest to my honourable friend (Han. Mr. Belcourt,) that he should have further consideration of this report postponed to next week,
so that honourable members of the Senate
xnay ponder over the situation. I would
simply ask t¶hem to turn over in their minds
this consideration, when mention is made of
the large amount spend for the Parliament
Buildings. A f ew years ago we were ail carried away by the persistency of one of our
colleagues, who urged that a certain large
expenditure should be incurred in order to
complete the Buildings. I confess that to me
at the time it seemed that the expenditure
might bave been postponed. Nevertheless wýe
adopted the honourable gentleman's view. 1
refer to the late Senator Bradbury and to
bis suggestion that the carillon or chimes
should be placed. upon the tower of Parliament. Yet we were wondering how we would
bring about an equilibrium in our finances.
But the bonourable gentleman had a vision
of chimes in the tower as the crowning feature of the whole edifice. Their installation
was the result of the action of the Senate,
and since the lst of July we have been proud
to tbink that such an idea emanated from
tbîs Chamber. Honourable gentlemen may
be surprised next week when I inform. themn
of the amount of the expenditure undertaken
by us at that lime, when we were flot as
assured as we are to-day that we were entering upon an era of prosperity. I repeat that
this building must be completed, and I thinc
it essential, if possible, to improve tbis Chamber. It is one of the two Chambers of Parliament, and is visited by the publie in large
numbers. I confess that in years past I used
to f eel proud wben I saw men from the large
capitals of Europe looking at our Chamber,
and beard them saying "«This is the most
beautiful Chamber I have ever seen."

Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND. Yes. I want if
possible te regain that sense of pride in the

The Hon. bbe SPEAKER: The hmnourable
gentleman re.îlly bas ne righb, as I think ho
iinderslands. te speak on Ibis qtuestion. If Ibis
were a motion hoe would have a righit te reply:
but as ir sonîy an inquiry, if any' hcneurable
gentlemaîn objecîs, thtat ends the discussion.

MAY 14, 192853
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I do object, formally.
I do this with ail respect to my honourable
friend. I would remind honourable gentlemen
that last week we listened to a very exhaustive
and able statement from the honourable gentleman from Grenville, extending over two houes
or more. I believe that this matter has been
deait with by this -Chamber somewhat leniently
in the past; but when an inquiry is made, 1
cannot see just why it should be allowed to
develop into a debate extending over severni
days.
Hon. Mr. REID: I niay say f0 the honourable gentleman that I have spoken only once
before on this matter. This is a very important
subject. When I wished to reply, His Honour
the Speaker did mention that if would flot be,
in order for me f0 do s0; but it has been the
custom in the House of Commons to give a
member an opportunity to wind up the debate.
There are only a few more points that I wish
to explain. I do not wish to trespass upon the
time of the Sonate if honourable gentlemen
feel thaf I should not do s0. Therefore, if that
is the feeling, I have nothing more to say.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, this is not an ordinary inquiry. This
bas been a debate.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I do flot think the point
of order is debatable.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I myseif have
troubled this House on three different occasions
on this question. This is perhaps one of the
most momentous matters that we could
possibly consider, and why we should not hear
an ex-Minister of Railways and CanaIs, if he
has any new information, is beyond me. Does
this House refuse f0 hear what he has got ta
say?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I insisf upon the point
of order.
The discussion wa.s concluded.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some eight days
ago I was asked if the Senafe could not avoid
sitting in the affernoon to-morrow, and sit in
the evening instead. Personally I have no
objection to meeting the reque9t. If we were
f0 meet fo-morrow afternoon, I am afraid that
we would not have a quorum. For that reason
I move:
That when the Senate adjourns this evening,
it do stand adjourned until to-morrow evening
at 8 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until fo-morrow at
8 p.M.

ADMISSION 0F WOMEN TO SENATE
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. McMEANS inquired of the Government:

If, in view of the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada, it is their intention
ta take any steps, looking ta the admission of
women to the Senate of Canada, and, if sa,
what course of procedure do they intend to
follow?
The Minister
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of Justice stated that the Goverament would
co;nsîder the advisabilify of presenting a
resolution tending f0 the amendment of the
Constitution so as f0 give women the right
ta be appointed ta the Upper Chamnber. That
is, so far, the only information which I can
impart ta my honourable friend.
. I might add that a reasonable time should
be allowed the parties interested, representing the better haîf of Canada, the women, to
decide whether, through some association or
individually, t.hey would not petition the
Privy Council for leave fa appeal from that
decision.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: May I further inquire of the honourable gentleman whefher
it would nof require an amendment to the
British North America Acf? And was not the
opinion of the Provincial Prime Ministers,
who assembled here adverse to any change in
the British North America Acf?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND. I can only say
that the situation will be duly considered
before the Govtrnment decides upon the
policy ta be formulated.

IMPORTATION 0F INTOXICATING
LIQUORS BILL
RECONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On the Order:
Tijird reading of Bill 192. an Act respecting
Jniterl)rovincial andl International Traffic in
Li toxicating Liquors, as amiended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I move thýat this Bill be flot now
read a third time, but be recommitted to
Comrnittee of the Whole for the purpose of
reconsidering the amendment made in Cornmitte-- to clause 3, permitting the carrnage of
one haif-gallon of intoxicating liquor from. one
province to another.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I move that
this Bill be considered in Committee now.
Hon.
Mr.
STANFIELD:
Honourable
gentlemen. is this procedure strictly in order?
As I understand, the ýamendment was made in
Committee and was concurred in by the
Senate. I arn not opposing the present
motion, but I would like to know whether or
not it is in order to refer this bill back to
Committee for the purpose of reconsidering
the amnendment.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
This is the
procedure wvhich i's generally fulluwed under
the rules of the House of Commons. I arn
convinced that it can be followed in this
Chamber, although the amendment of a
Bill reportel from committee bas generally
been proceeded with on the order for
the third reading. I might have moved in
accordance with the usual procedure, but alI
that could have taken place would have been
perbaps a division of the flouse on the
ameodment. As a matter of fact, aIl amendments made in Committee can be tested in
the House, either on the report fromn Committee or at the third reading. and honuurable members can then officially register their
votes pro or con. I could have moved that
the amendment in question be struck, out, and
then an amendment could have been moved
to my motion; but it seemed to me that
honourable
members
would bave more
faeility in discussing the whole matter in
Committee than on the motion for third
reading.
However, I arn in the hands of
the Senate as to the procedure.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I should think, myseîf,
witbout havi'ng considered the matter particularly, that sending it back to Committee
would be the preferable way of dealing with
it, because that allows more latitude. If you
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

deal with it in the way which the bonourable
gentleman mentioned hast, you are tied down
to vote yea or nay uipon that haîf-gallon
allowance that wvas inserted. If the Bill is
sent back to Committee you can disciiss
whether to adhere to that or wbether to eut
it down. Tastes may difler. I sbouhd think
that, on the whole, that would be the better
way.
Hon. Mr. BELAND:
Honourable gentlemen, this is the procedure which is fohlowed
in the Hlouse of Commons.
On the third
reading of a measure, if a member takes
exception to an amnendment that bas been
carried in Committee, he makes a motion, in
amendment to the motion for third reading,
that the Bill be siot now read a third time,
but be sent back to Committee of the Whole
House witb instructions to strike out the
particular amnendment *that lias prevîously
been adopted. The flouse decîdes upon the
motion and tbe amnendment. What is now
proposed is quite different. The honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) moves to
send the Bill back to Committee for reconsideration in a general manner. As a matter
of fact, wvhen a Bill is recommitted to Cornmittee of the Whole, any member, on any
clause wvhatsoever, can move an amendment,
wbich mnay bc considcrcd and carried or rejected. Therv is the diffierence between the
two methods of procedure.
I do not know
which bas obtained in this bonourable body,
but it scems to mie that it would be more
regular to move that the Bill be referred to
Committee of the Whole flouse with instructions fromn the flouse to strike out the amendment to wbich tbe bonourable gentleman
takes excepticn.
However, I bave no objection if the Senate desire to reconsider the
wbole Bill.

I think the course
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
proposed by the honourable leader is the only
course that we can follow. The Bill is up for

amendment made to a particular section. I
think hie is following the only course that is
possible und?r the circumstances.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, 1 think the motion
is the right one.
I only brought
*Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:

the honourable gentleman has heard me say
that 1 am not opposing it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then, the hionourable gentleman moves that the Bill be not

Committee of the whole House.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
went into Committee of the whole on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt in the Chair.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Is it proposed
to go over the whole Bill?
No. HonourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able gentlemen wiIl remember that we added
a clause to section 3 by amendment. Section
3 reads as follows:
(1) Notwithistanding the provisions of any
other Act or law, no person shaîl import, send,
take or transport, or cause to be imported, sent,
taken or transported into any province from. or
out of any place within or without Canada, any
intoxicating liquor, except such as has been purehased by or on behaif of, and which is consigned to Ris Majesty or the Executive Governnient of the province into which it is being imported, sent, taken or transported, or any board,
commission. offlcer or other governmental agency
which,' by the law of the province, is vested with
the right of selling intoxicating*liquor.
The amendment which was proposed and
carried reads as follows:
Provided that the provisions of this Section
shail not apply to importations of intoxicating
liquors in quantities of baif a gallon or less.
To be in order, I believe that I should
move that this amendment be reconsidered,
and that if that is carrîed we may then either
reject it or fùrther amend it.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
or a vote.

On a motion

Yes. Now, I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
draw the attention of the Senate to the fact
that the amendment not only allows the transportation of. liquor from. one province to
another, but the importation. Consequently
it would permit a group of people to import
from outside of Canada into any province
as many half gallons as they would be entitled
to, according to the importance of the group
who would do the importing. So that I think
the amendment itself goes beyond the intention of the movrer, who thought only of the
transfer or the carrying of a small quantity
of liquor from one province into another.
Now, as to the policy itself, I may say that
the opinions of the various governinents that
are interested are unanimously against the
amendmeut. I will first read, or repeat the
opinion of the Honourable Mr. Price, the
Attorney General of Ontario. The Deputy
Minister of Justice had sent a telegram to al
those Governments, notifying them of the
amendment, and asking their opinion upon
it as far as the legislation was made in
favour of those provinces. Attorney General
Price says:
Toronto, Ont., 11.

W Stuart Edwards,
Deputy Minister of Justice,
Ottawa, Ont.

Auiswering. your wire even date concerning
bill proliibiting importing intoxicating liquor
into government control provinces. Amendment
in Senate would strike at very basis of law
enforcement in any province if any quantity
of liquor were allowed to be taken from one
province to other. Consider amendment ultra
vires as it would infringe on the right of the
province to regulate the sale and disposition of
liquor within its borders,
William H. Price,
Attorney General.
There was another despatch, received from
the Honourable Sir Henry Drayton, who is
Chairman of the Ontario Liquor Commission,
whicb reads as follows:
Toronto, Ont Il.
Hon W D Euler,
M1inister Department of 'National Revenue,
Ottawa, Ont
Newapaper reports indicate modifications to
proposed provisions as to importation of liquor
absolutely necessary that each province should
have eoinplete control of liquors for use in that
province. This board permits the importation
through itself of liquors required but not
stocked by the board. No exceptions should
be madp if Government control is to properly

when consigned to the Government Liquor Commission of the province into which the liquor

MAY 15, 1928
double penalty ta anc wha was found in pos-~
session of liquar which had not been bought
in that province.
0f course the Attorneys General of the
variaus provinces fear that this legislation
would to a certain cxtent nullify, or create
the impression that it nullifies, the provincial
legisiation, and precedes it, sa that ane having
liquor in his possession which he ciaimcd to
have purchased in another province wauld
flot be amenable ta the provincial law. I do
flot know what is the value of that argument,
or if there is any virtue in it, but under thae
circumstanccs I would ask that we recansider
this section witýh a view ta dismissing or re-,
taining it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I do not risc ta appose the motion made
by the honourable leader of the Goverument,
but siniply ta point out that ail this difficulty
arises framn thc fact that the Federal Government kceps on divesting itself of authority ta
legislate in matters of interprovincial trade
When prohibition came into the different
provinces they asked the Govcrnment of Canada ta give them the right ta cnact legislatian prohi'biting the importation of liquor into
those provinces. That right was granted, and
under that authority fromn the Federal Govcrnment they passed laws making it unlawful
ta import liquor into any province whcre
there was -prohibition. I understand that that
is the law to-day, so that if a province has
prohibition it can cnact any laws it deenis
wisc ta prohibit the importation of liquor
inta that province.
Naw, the provinces have changcd their
opinion, an the question of prohibition, and
they have passed laws regulating the sale of
liquor by Gavernment contraI; cohsequently
the Act which enablcd thema ta pass laws prohibiting importation of liquor is nugatary.
Ail this difficulty would have been avaided
if the Federai Governmcxit had remained in
contrai of legisiation rcgarding interprovincial
trade, and in regard ta this question of importation froni anc province ta another. I cannot sec why an Act of this kind shouidb
brought before the Federal Parliaýment at ail.
If the Government of Canada says ta the

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But you draw a
distinction -between Provinces. This does not
apply ta a Province where there is prohibition, but it docs apply to a Province whcre
there is Government control. I think the argument is of greater force on that account.
If you are gaing to give the Provinces the
exclusive right of importing liquor, why not
give it ta them? Why say that anc Province
shalh be bound and that another shall not?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think the Leader on
the other side of the House (Hon. Mr,. Dandurand) has made good his dlaim that this
amendnent is wider than la necessary in
order ta accomplish the purpose of the honourable gentleman who moved it. I think
the mover had in mind certain cases, and ta
get clear of general statements I will take
particular cases. If a man leaves Montreal

it ail before he cornes into the Province of
Ontario. That being so, what is he to do
with it when he gets into Ontario? Is he to
throwv it out of the window, and go out and
buy another pint if he needs if? 1 think
that what was in the mind of the mover of
the amendment was the case of a bona fide
traveller carrying, as he put if, half a gallon.
Personally, I think haif a gallon is an unnecessarily large quantity: that a pint should
be suficient.
The amendment, as worded,
would probably give people residing in a Province chance f0 order liquor frorn outside. It
should not he impossible to fraine a clause
fo enable a bona fide fraveller from one Province f0 another, or one passing through a
Province, f0 carry with hirn a pint or a half
a pint of alcohol. I think the arnendment as
if now stands might be repealed, but I would
suggest to the honourable gentleman that he
could improve the Bill by providing for such
cases as the one I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that I
have tried rny best to devise some kind of
ameodment to meet the case which my honourable friend has just described, but so far 1
have flot succeeded. I met a miember of the
Senate to-day who had discussed that very
situation with the Chairman of the Quebec
Liquor Commission. who said that common
senso should j>revail among the officers charged
with thec sulpervision of the movement of
tuurists and travellers, and that he would
neyer counitenance any procedure which would
lx' udious and xvhich would affect the good
reputatiun of the Province in the eyes of the
travelling public. From the discussion which
we have had. I arn of the opinion that perhaps we could have the various Provinces
adopt regulations which would relieve peuple
having a small quantity of alcohol in their
possession from the tyranny of over-zealous
officials. I leave it f0 any honourable rnember of the Senate to suggest a formula which
will not lend itself to considerable abuse on
the part of people who will try f0 carry on
a trade for profit alung the border. If is my
conviction that this discussion will do good,
however, and that if ive do *not. insist iîpon
the amndment. the variuus Provinces will
svee to it that thoir officiaIs act humanely and
wjfh sorne consideration for the public that
travel from une side of the border f0 the
uther.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I arn rather inclined
tu think that rnay bu the solution, and that
the difficuliy may be overcome if the honourable gentleman, or the Goverunent that he
represenf s, will take steps to see that some
regulafion of that kind is made. W'hen I

lived in the Northwest a prohibition law was
in force, and I remember being on the train
une day when the Mounted Police carne in
and examined the hand baggage. A very srnall
flask, containing about two ounces of brandy
was found in fthe bag of an old lady, and she
was taken off the train and was fined. I
mentioned a sirnilar case the other day that
occurred here.
I think the difficulfv can
be met if the Provincial Governrnents will
give instructions that bona, fide travellers,
carrying alcohol in quantities of not more
than a pint, shaîl be allowed f0 pass. If we
could get an assurance that an attempt would
be made to secure a regulation of that kind,
I think we might very well drop the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: How can we get the
assurance that my honourable friend speaks
of? Who is going to take the initiative with
the Provinces, and bring them f0 terms, as
if were, as to the quantity that may be
transporfed from one Province f0 another?

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I suggcsf that
there is une wav in which you could get that
assurance, namely. by passing the law as
it is, and putting in a pruviso that it shaîl
nof be effective as to this clause until such
time as the Government of any Province
passes reasonable regulations, to be approved
by fthe Minister of Justice. I f hink if could
be worked ouf verv readily. I have nu opinions
on this Bill; if is not rny habit f0 carry liquor
on the trains, and I do not want f0 regulate
the habits of other peuple; on the other hand,
I do nut wvant to see the bootleggers allowed
fo transport liquor.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
Would if not be
better where they have Commissions f0 pay
the Provinces the compliment of believing
that thoso Commissions are adrninistered by
reasonable and intelligent peuple, falling back,
on the old principlo of de minimus non curaf

pathectie cases of the two ounce or four once

Willoughby) would be practicable. I think if

as to the treatment that should be accorded
travellers or touriste crossing the line from
one wet Province to another. They are men
of intelligence, and will realize that the practice of the dietective who opens the satchel
of an aid lady and laye an information against
hier because he finds a small glass of cognac,
f or the possession of which, she is fined, is
repellant to the sense of justice and humanity
of the members of this Chamber; and I arn
convinced that aur views will be heard in
proper quarters, and that instructions will be
given sO that further injustices of this kind
wili not be perpetrated.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
The suggestion
made by the honouraible Leader of the House
bas a great deal to cammend it; it is full of
common sense and humanity. He hopes that
instructions will go down. from the Prime
Ministers of the different Provinces to the
officiaIs, so that any man who may happen
to be in possession of a sinei quantity of
intoxicating liquor while passing froin one
Province to another will nlot be molested.
But what is the honourable gentleman's suggestion? He suggests, first of aU, that we
make a cast iron law which magistrates, if
they have a conscience, will be forced ta
apply; and at the saine turne lie expresses
the piaus hope that the law will be disregarded by the very officers appointed to carry
it out. If we say that common sense should
be exercised by the officers selected to enforce
the Iaw at the boundary of each Province,
why should nlot we exercise the samne common
sense when we make the law?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a very
wide statement.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
The' lonourable
gentleman says that na liquor at ail shall be
imported, transported, or sent froin one Province ta another, and at the samne time, with
a very engaging sinile, lie says: But we trust
that the Prime Ministers of thie different
Provinces will issue instructions ta the officers charged with maintaining the law ta use
common. sense and ta abstain from tyranny,
and ta allow a man with intoxicating liquors
ta corne into a Province without impediment.
Surely, what is common sense for the officer
or for the magistrate is common sense for us.
If a man should be allowed ta carry a bottle
of whiskey from one wet Province ta another
without being molested, surely we cani state
that in the law. Do I understand the honourable gentleman ta say that we cannot
draft a section ta caver that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is very diflicult to find a formula.

I cannot agree
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
with my honouraoble friend. It may ha that
the amendment goe a littie too far; but if
it does, I think it should be said that it
repeats the exact ternis of the section iteaif.
The honourable member for Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. -Lynch-Staunton> took the exact tarins
of the section ta draft the exception.
Hon. Mr. DANDURÀND: I draw attention ta the fact that the word "importation"
as used in thie amendînençt, covers i.mportatien froin abroad, and from. one Province ta
another. In the view of the draftsnian. of
the Bill there is importation froi outside
the country, and frain anc Province ta another, and in the amendment the word "importation" covers bath.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is it possible that
the amendment goes further than the honourable gentleman who drew it intended? Perhaps it may be coneeived that a man would
import froin one province ta another, or frein
Europe, at the rate of haîf a gallon at a
time. Naw I leave it ta the common sense of
honourable members of this Chamber whether
that is possible ar not. And let us not lose
siglit of this fact, that the Bill was presented
ta this House for the purpose of stopping
hootlegging. It wa8 laid down in the first
-place: "We do nat wsnt -ta stop personaI
importation in smaîl quantities, the carrying
of liquor by traveliers. No; we are aiming
at the man who makes a business of importing
in large quantities." That is the way the
matter was preented te this House. Then
the honourable gentleman froin Hamilton
(Han. Mr. Lyncli-Staunton) said: "Very well,
let us pass the Bill with thig modification.
We suggest that it shauld not apply ta the
half-gallon or less that may be carried by
the traveller." That was the whole suggestion.
May I caîl attention ta this fact? This is
enabling legislation. In the first place, protection is afforded ta the different Liquor
Commissions created by provincial law.
Secondly, this enabling legisiatian covers ail
importations except in haîf-gallon quantities.
Those are the only exceptions in the Federal
legislation which we are now contemplating.
Besides, the importation of the haîf-gallon
might stili be prevented by provincial legislation. We have no authority ta interfere
in any way at ahl with the operatian of the
provincial law. I do not know ta what extent it is permiseible for a man who buys
a bottie of whisky in this provinice ta carry
it into the province of Quebec, in view of
the provincial law which says it is illegal ta
have in your possession in the province of
Quebec, or ta transport into that province,

the idea is ridiculous. I do not see wy we
sho'uld waste the time of this Cham-ber in
discussing what to my mind, the mind of a

proposition, and that is to give control to the
Goirernments of the provinces, who are merely
acting in pursuance of the demand made by
their own people that the Goirern'ment should
control the sale of liquor. The Provincial
Governments consider tiht in order to elleet
that control they should have the right to

Hon. Mr. BELAND: Everybody is willing to reconsider.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN. Now, honourable gentlemen, I am not going to plead

who in good faith goes across the line with

Will the Government accept this amendment instead?

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: 1 would like to

this amendment, whether it means taking or

other province in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEAUTBIEN: No.
It means only
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
where there is Government Control of liquor.
Hon. Mr. MaoARTHUJR: That is what
I have been trying to find out for two or

a wet province and a dry province?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The honourable

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend allow me? This is simpily a
clause which prevents subsection 1 of section

leader of the Goverroment (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) this evening read some representatiens that had been made by the Premiers and
the Attorneys General of different provinces.
H1e mentioned ail the provinces. I think, except Nova Scotia and Prince Edwvard Island.
ln the first place, have any representations of
any kind been made by Nova Scotia and
Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These telegramns
which I read were probably answers to telegramns sent, and I should infer that telegrams
were not sent to -Nova Scotia or Prince Edwvard Island beceause they were considered
unnecessary tînder the provisions of ibis Bill.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: What I want to
make, clear is that the wording of clause 3
putes Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia
into the samne category exactly.
Honi. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, no.
H-on. Mr. MacARTHTjR: The other provinces have what is called Government Control.
The provinces of Nova Scotia and
Prince Edward Island have a Commission,
and "Commission" is namcd in this clause.
The Goveroment really control the sale, but
they are known as prohibition provinces. The
honourable meniber from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) gaid that it applied to the
taking of liquor fromn one wet province to
atnother, and did net apply as between a wet
and a dry province. I do not know what is
the status of Prince Edward Island and Nova
Sentia, or under whrtt category they come.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They do not come
under this provision; they are flot included.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: It does net say
SO.
Thev have a Government Commission.
The difference is that in Nova Scotia and
Prince Edward Island liquor cannot be ohtained except on a dootor's prescription, and
there is a label on the hottle, whcreas in the
other provinces you get it through public sale.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I may explain
te my honourable frieýnd that hy the addition
of one word the proposer of the amencdment
bas done away with the objection which my
honourable friend makes. The amendment
now reads:
The provisions of this section shall net apply

"The said provinces" means the provinces

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable geutlimen, I have a word I would like te Say on
this amendment of the honourable gentleman
frein Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), especially ie view of the fact that I voted in
faxvoîr of the amendment that bas now been
repeaird. Since the discussion in the lieuse
last week there have developed two resens
why I thjnk this House is justified in altering
its attitude towards this motion. One is, thet
since the Bill was jînder consideration practically ah! the provincial goveroments, thîrough
their Attorneys General or PremiersHon. Mr. LAIRD: I rise te a point of order.
Are we voting on this or are we speaking on
it? Yen asked for the yeas te be counted,
and you have net asked for the nays. Where
are we at?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: As I understand it, the honourable gentleman fromn
Welhand (Hon. 'Mr. Robertson) asked te
speak further on the motion before the Chair,
and I undcrstood that be had the unanimous
consent of the lieuse te do se.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I might say te
my honouirable friend from Heginia (Hon. Mr.
Laird) that 1 did net understand it was bY
consent of the lieuse that we discussed it
further, hecause the amencdment of my honourable friend from Montarvi!le (Hon. Mr.
'Beaubien) had flot been discussed hy the
House before the motion was put, and theref ore, I thought it was perfecthy proper that
there should be some discussion. There might
be other honourable gentlemen who desired
te say something.
For two, resens I think the Huse is justified in reconsidering this -decision of a, f ew
days ago. One is that the Attorneys General
and Premiers of different provinces have, generally speaking, made it known clearhy that
they thînk we ought net te put in the amend-

MAY 15, 1928
ment. One of the particular duties of this
Senate is to give recognition to requests of
provinces, particularly if there is a difference
of opinion, and protect minorities, and so on.
Here we find the provinces unanimous. They
are responsible for the administration of this
law, and for the complaints that may arise
under it.
In addition to that, I think that the amendment now proposed, if passed, would not be
effective in certain provinces, at least where
it has already been declared that the provincial law governs, and t-hat the province has a
right to forbid the importation. If in the
course of its administration it is found that
,abuses are imposed on the people, travellers
or others, then it seems to me that this House
might well take some recognition of it, in the
public interest, and in the interest of interprovincial trade.
But under existing circumstances I do feel
that the House should accept the Bull as it
now stands, having repealed the section as
passed the other day, and await resuits of
the operation of the law embodied in this
Bill, and not further interfere. Much as I
sympathize with the amendment of iny
honourable friend from Montarville, I am
afraid it wifl lead to some objection on the
part of the provincial governments, and I for
one would flot lik e to see this bouse put
itself on record as airbitrarily passing any
legisiation in which practically ail the provinces are directly concerned, and which they
are saying they do flot favour
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Might I ask the
honourable leader of the Government if there
is not a law at present in force by whieh the
carrying of liquor from one province to
another is prohibited?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Surely.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am speaking about
the Act respecting express companies and
common carriers.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAÎN: The Doherty Act.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: No, it prohibits
any common carrier fromn carrying liquor from
one province to another.
bon. Mr. DANDURAND: They ean only
do so under the provincial law.
bon. Mr. DANIEL: bonourable gentlemen,
it appears to me that the honourable Senator
from Hamilton (bon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton),
who brought in this amendment, did so for
one purpose only, that is, to proteet tourists
and bona, fide travellers from being annoyed

by the opening and examination of their baggage and luggage to sec whether they h.ad in
their possession a boutle or some small quantity of alcoholic liquor.
For instance, a traveller starting from Vancouver may, and probably would, have a flask
in his bag. He c omes through aIl those
various provinces, and I suppose under this
law he is hiable to be fined $20 by each province into which lie goes with that little
flask of liquor, though it is carried innocently,
and not for the purpose of bootlegging or
disobeying any law, but for lis own convenience as an ordinary traveller, perhaps in
many cases as a inedicine.
I think it would have been better if those
Prime Ministers of the various provinces had
been a little fuller in their communications,
and stated that there was no necessity for this
law, because they did not intend to carry it
out in such a way as to trouble people whom
our amendment is supposed to proteot. They
might have given some intimation of that
kind.
I think, with the honourable gentleman who
moved this amendment, that prcobably financial regulations under provincial laws would
be the best way to settle this matter; and I
think the best method of causing the various
provincial authorities to assume that attitude,
and make those regulations, is to put into this
Bill now such an amendment as will cause
themn to think it would be to thei.r advantage
to do that very thing. That is why I propose to support the amendment introduced
by the honourable Senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
The proposed amendment of the bonourable Mr. Beaubien was negatived: yeas 14;
nays, 26.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Honourable gentlemen, 1 have another amendment which may
appeal more to my own colleagues, inasmuch
as it reduces the quantity of liquor to 26
ounces, and also specifies that such liquors
will be carried by a bona, fide traveller for lis
persona] use, and some other provisions whieh
I will read to you in a moment, which I think
will meet the objection raised a few minutes
ago by the honourable gentlemen fromn Prince
Edward Island (Hon. Mr. MacArthur). I
t'hink his objection was well taken in some
regards, but bis suggestion was too broad, because some of the provinces have no law for
control of intoxicating liquors.
Now I would propose to add, after subsection 1 of sect.ion 3:
1-A. The preceding section shaîl not apply to
intoxicating liquors in quantities of not more
than 26 oncies when such quantities are carried
by a bona fide traveller for his personal use,

DEPARTMENT 0F PENSIONS AND
NATIONAL HEALTH BILL
CONSIDEBED IN COMMITTEE AND REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 205, an
Act respecting tin Department of Pensions
and National Health.
Hon. Mr. Copp in tbe Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would ask
Mr. Scammell to come to the floor.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-Department:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I rather regret
that this important Bill is being deait with at
sn Late an hour and wvith s50 smiall an attendance in the Rouse.
I tbink the Bill monits
closer attention on tlie part of the I-buse, and
suiggesýt that; probably inany members wbo are
not heme would like to lie here.
I make tbis
obs~erv ation in case the Leader of the Governm"-nt '.bould think it wortliy of consideration.
In connection with this section, I wisb ta
make a f ew remarks.
Wben the Board of
Pension Commissioners began to fonction,
it was universally agreed that the mnatter of
the assistance and support of citizens of this
country wlio liad participated in its defence
during the Great War sliould be dissociated
from everytbing political, and it was therefore decided that an independent tribunal, to
lie called tlic Board of Pension Commissioners,
should lie set up witli full authority to administer the law, independent of departmental
mterference.
It scems to mie that section
3 of tbis Bill departs from that well establisbed
and sound principle, and bnings the Board of
Pension Commissioners within tbe amliit of
departmnental control.
While that centrol
ma.v neyer lie exercised, tbere is nevertlieless
opportunity for it; and I suggest tbat before
this section passes the principie that I have
ment ioned sliould lie very carefully weighed,
because it may well lie tbat xve are opening a
door whieh xvill lead to abuses sucb as have
exisied in the country ta tbe souîth of uis since
the Civ il War. and which will confer lienefits
mn mndeserving instances while denying it in
othfrs. I strongly objeet te the Board of

MAY là, 1928
Pension Coýmmissioners being subjected to
departmental control, I care Dot under wha.t
Government it may be and I would therefore
respectfully ask the Leader of the Government if hie would not agree to, let this section
stand over for further consideration, perhaps
to-morrow, when we have a fuller attendance
in the Bouse.
Bon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: I think my hionourable friend is labouring under a misapprehension. There is nothing changed in the
law. There is a change in title of the Department, but ne change in the powers or attributes of the varions branches in charge of the
Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment.
Bon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then why change
the law?
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: Simply in oider
to amalgamate two iiepartments that were
working Beparately under the saine hea.
Under the present law, who is Minister of
Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment? Dr. Kingl
Who is Minister of Healtb? Dr. Kingi Who
will be the Minister in charge of the administration cf the amalgamated Department? Dr.
Kingi Bis powers are net increased in the
administration of the Department of Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment; as a matter of fact,
they are somewhat diminished, as my hionourable friend will find as we proeeed from
one section to another. From now till the
lst cf May cf next year, it will be the duty
cf the Minister and of the Governor in Council te reorganize the Department according
te the classification which already has been
followed; but after that date ail that service
will corne under the sway cf the Civil Service
Commission, and as a censequence the powers
of the Minister will be diminished. Se this
Bill is simply for the purpose cf passing over
the central te the Civil Service Commission,
within a certain time, after the Minister decides as te the number cf officiais that are
needed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In view cf the
absence cf somes cf those who are more
directly interested in soldier and pension
matters, I would ask that this clause stand
until to-morrow.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
this evening I consulted the honourable gentleman from Edmonton <Hon. Mr. Grîesbach)
and asked him if hie had read this Bill. He
informed me that hie had. read it from A te Z,
and had found nothing te complain cf in it.
I read it myself; and as 1 had started by
reading the debate in the Bouse cf Commons,
which ended nowhere, I was fooled înto believing that it was a moat intricate Bill, and

so 1 sent for help. Then, upon reading it
quietly, I found that there was nothing in
i*t except the amalgamation of the two Departnients. We wîil flot take the third reading
this evening, however, and I think that between now and 3 o'clock to-morrow my hionourable friend wjll find that hie is under a
misapprehension.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 was quite unaware that the honourable gentleman had
constilted with the honourable from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach). Bis absence was one
of the reasons for my suggestion. On the
understanding that the Bill will flot be read
the third time until to-morrow, and accepting
the assurance of my honouraible friend that
the honourable gentleman from Edmonton
has no objection to it, I arn content to let
the clause pass.
We will net
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
talte the third reading this evening.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 to 12 inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 13-title of Minister altesed:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Subsection 2 of
section 13 reads:
Whenever in any Act of the Parliament of
Canada, or ini any regulations or orders made
thereunder, the Department of Health, the
Deputy Minister of Health, the Department of
Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, or the Deputy
Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishement is
incntioned or referred to, there shall in each
and every case be substituted therefor the
Departrnent of Pensions and National Hea]th
and the Deputy Minister of Pensions and
NÇational Health respectively.
May I inquire of my honourable friend as
to the nianner in which it is intended that
the jurisdiction of the Deputy Minister shall
supersede that of the Board of Pension Commissioners?
In no respect
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
whatever.
That would
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
surely indicate it.
No. This is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
simply the effect of the situation as it is.
There are two Acts. one referring to the
Deputy Minister of Health, and one to the
Deputy Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment; henceforth they will be represented
by the Deputy of the amalgamiated Department.
Blon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Does my hionourable friend give the assurance that the
Board of Pension Commissioners will c~ontinue to operate as an independent unit, and

will flot be interfered with, in matters that
coine under the jurisdiction of the Board, by

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

that no change is contemplated in the situation of the Pension Board as it bas funetionud up to this date.

LANDS BILL

FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 199, an Act to amend the Dominion
Lands Act.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, I think it would be wise, by
agreement, to Jet this matter stand until tomorrow. It is a matter of considerable importance, and 1 do not think we ought to
deal hastiiy with it, in the absence of several
honourable gentlemen who are interested in
it, espeeiallv bonourable miembers from Western Canada.
I would ask my bonourabie
friend to let this matter stand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my bonourable friend wiil talze note of the information
1 bave, he may afterwards renew bis request.
This Bill was postponed for a week or more,
at the request of bonourable inembers of the
Senate, in order to aseertain the attitude of
the four Western Provinces, the only provines interestcd, on tbis question of aliowing
bomesteaders to obtain a second bomestead.
Honourable gentlemen will remember that
that %vas tbe reason for postponing the Bill.

PUBLIC A0COUN1TS AND THE SENATE
MOTION

Hon. J. J. HUGHES moved:
That in the opinion of this House, Rule 78
of the Senate should be amended by providing
for the appointment of a Standing Committee
on Public Accounts.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, some weeks
ago this House discussed the long adjournments that take place at the beginning of the
Sessions, the somewhat long adjournments
over the week-ends, and the particularly long
adjournment that took place at the beginning
of the present Session. The general impression seemed to be that the Senate should
take a more active and sustained part in
the work of the sessions, and be a greater
factor in the parliamentary life of the nation.
It was pointed out that there was nothing to

569

prevent us from doing this if we wished, because our powers were equal to those of
Commons in every particular save one,
namely, that we cannot originate money bis.
The opinion of the Senate that is pretty
generally held in the country is, that it is
a place of repose for worn-out politicians who
need a restHon. Mr. GORDON:. Who said that?
Hion. Mr. HUGHES: Some people and
some newspapers.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You should nlot
repeat it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: .- and for wealthy
men who have served their country and their
party, and who wish to do a littie light legislative work on the side, but who do nlot wish
to, or cannot undertake the more onerous
work done by the Commons. This opinion
is not well informed or just, because the
Senate does much useful work. But it could
do more, and it therefore rests with ourselves
whether this opinion will be wholly or partially
removed, or allowed to deepen and grow, with
perhaps undesirable resuits.
A large part, or perhaps the best part, of
parliamentary work is now done by Committees and Commissions, and I think this tendcncy is increasing. Some writers say this is
a'natural and proper development of democracy and should be encouraged. This thought
brings me to the subject matter of the Resolution I have on the order paper. Our powers
being equal to those of the Commons, and
it being our duty to revise and supervise the
legislative work of the Comnions, why is it
not equally our duty to supervise the administrative work of the other branch of
Parliament?
In 1919 this House established a Committee
on Finance, which I am told had two or
tbree sittings, but no more. If I understand
the thîng aright, the special work of this
Committee was to examine and supervise the
Supply Bill, and to suggest methods for
raising the revenue. The Supply Bill is prepared by the Government of the day, goes
through the Commone after being examined
by the Committee of the whole House, and
cornes to the Senate so late in the Session
that it is very difflcult, if nlot impossible, to
give it any thorough or intelligent examination; and in my opinion, you had better not
touch the thing you cannot do properly.
With regard to suggesting methods of taxation it might be different, but since a Tariff
Board has been appointed, and with the
opportunities the other House bas for criticism
and suggestion, it is doubtful whether a Com-

SENATE
mittee of titis House could lielp much. 0f
course, suggestions sliould be always in order,
and no Governmenf sbould be above taking
suggestions from Members of Parliament or
respectable citizens anywhere. There is, however, a Committee which I think titis House
is particularly well adapted to take charge of,
namcly, the Public Accounts Committee. Such
a Commiftee would be cliarged with the investigation of past expenditures, and could
therefore begin its work wben Parliament
meets. The Public Accounts are tabled thlen,
the Auditor General's report is ready, and
there is nothing to delay proceedings; and
from whaf 1 have scen of them, Committees
of tbis Bouse are very business-Iike bodies.
The lawvers on them do not wrangle over
rules of evidence, procedure and other immaterial things; flicy get right down f0 work,
and are in a word, fact-finding, not fau'ltflnding bodies. Titis is wliy 1 say that this
Bouse is pcculiarly weil adapted to, have a
Public Accounts Cornrittce.
Another fhing fliat miglif be mcntioned is
this. The work of flic two Houses is flot well
apportioned; flic Public Accounts Commiftee
of the other House lias nof met for two or
tliree years: If may lie fliat tliey bave too
muci to do over fliere, while we are flot
overworked. Then wliy not make a better
division? Moreover, for obvious reasons, the
country miglit bave more confidence in the
findioigs of a Committec of this Bouse thýan
in the findings of a Comnmiftcc reporting te
tite ut ber Chamber. If a Commiftce of this
Bouse would do ifs work propcrly and report
unanimously, flic country would soon corne
to have as mucli respect for ifs findings as
if nom, lias for the report of a Royal Commission, or even for flic decision of a liencli
of Judgcs, and fliat would be very desirable.
A Public Accounts Commiftee *could state
exactly wliat fhe public dcbt amounts f0, and
tlius set tlic public mind at rest on fliat point.
Durine flic pasf winfer there wvas consideralile

MAY 16, 1928
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Now that the
honourable gentleman has put his motion
before the House, 1 suggest that hie withdraw the motion, and allow the Senate to
ponder over it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable gentlemen, I will be very glad to comply with the
wish of the honourable leader. I did nlot
know wbetber my motion would be put . I
mentioned it merely as a suggestion, with the
desire of getting the opinion of the House,
and acting accordingly next Session. If the
Finance Committee *has the gamne power as
a Public Accounts Committee would have,
that would be satisfactory. I was nlot quite
sure of that, and hence I brougbt the matter
before the Senate. There would be no object
at ail in having two committees with similar
powers. I t.hink the Finance Committee lias
only nine members, and whether that number
is large enougb may be a question.
My objeet is attained, having brought this
subject to the attention of the HouEte. If
the Comrnittee already bas power, ail it may
need is somne new blood, or an increase in
the number of members. That will meet the
cobject that I had in view.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would say to the hionourable gentleman that I think the Finance
Committee bas the samne powers as the other
Standing Committees, that is, power to send
for persnns and papers; and if he got the
Public Accounts before that Committee, it
would have just as wide powers as the one
that bie proposed. The only other suggestion
I would make to the honourable member
would lx that next year hie should see that
hie gets a place on this Finance Committee,
and sees that the Committee functions instead of lyin'g dormant.
The motion was withdrawn.

SENATE
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL
REVENUE BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 291, an Act to amend the Department
of National Revenue Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, with the
leave of the House I will now move the
second reading of this Bill. It has been suggested to me that we send the Bill to the
Banking and Commerce Committee, in order
to hear the officials who have the special
charge of administering this Act, and I am
quite willing that this should be done.
The amendment to the Department of
National Revenue Act, embodied in this Bill,
has for its object the withdrawing from the
Civil Service Commission of the appointment
of certain employees, called appraisers and
investigators. It mentions also all officers in
the Customs-Excise Preventive Service: they
are already excepted from the jurisdiction
of the Civil Service Commission and are
appointed by the Minister himself, yet they
aire included in this Bill because it provides
special machinery for the appointment of the
three classes mentioned.
The reason for this change is contained in
many official documents. As honourable gentlemen know, a Royal Commission on Custoins and Excise was appointed and did considerable work towards the betterment of the
collection of Customs and Excise dues and
the more efficient application of the Act. In
their report, at page 8, the Royal Commissioners state:
Our inquiry has shown that the present
system of appointment of appraisers or other
officers requiring expert or technical knowledge
is unsatisfactory, and we are convinced that
where expert and technical knowledge is
required, the examination of the applicants for
positions shouuld be conducted by those who are
specially qualified to act in the premises.
We are of opinion that ail appointments to
the office of appraiser at the differeat ports of
the Dominion should be made by the Minister
after examination of the applicants by the
Board of Appraisers.
We quite recognize that this method of
appointment would conflict with the system
now in vogue under the Civil Service Act, but
notwithstanding this we are of opinion that
this metbod should be adopted.
We suggest that the Board of Dominion
Appraisers when constituted should supersede
the present Board of Customs in all matters
and duties relating to appraisal.
At page 10 the Commission, speaking of
the Preventive Service, says:
In connection with the future appointmnent
of members of the* Preventive Service, we
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

would reeommend that all applicants should be
examined and reported upon by the chief
regional officers in the respective districts as
to their special qualifications, and that the
Minister should have the right of appointment
froin those so reported as eligible.
As to the investigation officers it also declares:
The recommendations we have made in
respect of appointnents to the Preventive
Service should apply also to the nethod of
appointment in this branch.
The Parliamentary Committee which sat
in 1926 gave great attention to the representations of the Commercial Protective
Associaýtion, composed of most of the large
wholesale houses of Canada. The Association
made this recommendation:
That the board be given power to retain
such appraisers as they deem conpetent and
qualified and to appoint, with the Minister's
approval, and notwithstanding the provisions of
the Civil Service Act. such further appraisers
as may be required froin time to time.
In dealing with important merchandise and
in ensuring that the full duties provided for
in the law are collected, it is above all things
essential that there should be an efficient
system of appraisal by competent appraisers.
The appraisal system is the very heart of
the whole system of the collection of customs
revenue, and if the appraisal system is not
sound there is bound to be inefficiency and
failure to detect frauds.
The Canadian appraisal system is lamentably
weak. At many ports there are not a suficient number of capable and efficient appraisers
to give that prompt service which is so essential
to the conduet of business. At the smaller
ports men are acting as appraisers in addition
to performing other duties-men who have not
had the training to fit thein for their duties
as appraisers, and at ail ports the rate of pay
is so inaclequate that trained experts cannot
be prevailed upon to enter the service.
The Parlianentary Committee which investigated this matter in 1926 reported as
follows:
First, the inethods of appraisal are exceedingly careless and fail to safeguafd the interests
of the importer, or the revenues cf the country
froin being defrauded by undervaluation, and,
secondly., persons appointed as appraisers are
in many instances untrained in the branch to
wbich they are appointed.
In these recommendations, coming from the
public that is most interested in the proper
collection of customs and the proper appraising of goods, the wholesale people of Canada,
from the Parliamentary Oommittee of the
other Chamber which sat on this matter, and
from the Royal Commission which investigated
it thoroughly, all agree that the appointment
of appraisers should be left to the Minister,
who would have examinations made by the
Board of Appraisers, composed of the high
officials of the Department. With this end
in view, the Bill to amend the Department of

MAY 21, 1928
National Revenue Act is before us, and the
Minister has deemed it proper to submit the
followinýg procedure:
"(4) The Minister may, after such examinatioîî as he may prescribe. select and nominate
suitable persons for appointment by the Civil
Service Commission, tW positions appertaining
to any of the following classes of offiers-(a) Customs appraisers-of all classes whether serving at the various ports and places
of entry or as Dominion appraisers;
(b) Ahl officers in the Customs-Excise preventive service;Already excluded from. the control of the
Civil Service Commission.
(e) All officers assigned to duty as investigator-s of values and claims for drawbaek.
If such appointment is not made hy the
Commission within fifteen days f rom tIse date
of notice te it of sîich selection and nomination,
the Governor in Couneil may, on the recoinmendation of the Minister appoint during
pleasure any such officer.
The officers so appointed by the Commission
or by the Governor in Council, as the case
may bie, shaîl bie paid such salaries or remuneration in aceordance with civil service regulations as mnay be determined by the Commission or the Governor in Council respectively.
and the Minister ma'y appoint the times and
manner in ivhich the saine shaîl be paid.
The question has been put: if the Minister
assumes the right to select and nominate
suitable persons, why should hie have the
Why
Civil Service Commission intervene?
ehould hie not cut loose froin thse Civil Service
Commission completely and make the apThe Minister has feit
pointment directly?
that after hie has taken ail thse necessary precautions in having the Board of Examiners
pýass upon the various candidates from among
whom a chcsice might be made by him, thse
naine of the person selected, or, if several
positions are open at the saine time, the
naines of the persions selected for the various
positions, should ho sent over to tise Civil Service Commission, who would be given fifteen
days in which to examine into the selections
and at thse expiration of that period would
make .any suggestion that they deemed proper.
Thse Commission may ask for information as
to thse inquiry made by the Board cf Examiners; may itsedi inquire as to -the qualifications of the parties offered; may have, ini its
own records, notes concerning some of thern;
and in any event the Civil Service Commission will have a right te investigate, te
consider thse naine of the party or parties
offered, and make any objection, if it deems
useful te do so. Thse Minister will receive
that report, and if tisere are a-ny objections
lie will inquire into themn and finally deoide
as te the selection to be su'bmitted tVo the
Governor in ýCouncil.

573

This is the .machinery whieh is contained
in the Bill. Considerable improvement has
already been made in the service, an'd new
blood will be introduced into it through this
Bill, if it is adopted by Parliament, and the
responsibility will lie with the head of the
department.
I arn quite sure that this is no very great
inroad into the work, duties or privileges of
the Civil Service Commission. In this braných
of Government there are some 5,500 employees,
and the Minister states that this amendment
will have the effect of withdrawing a maximum
of 250 persons fromn the authority of the
That does not
Civil Service Commission.
mean that there will be 250 vacancies to be
filled, as these positions are already held by
some pensons; but under this Bill the Minister
may have a free hand in changing the positions
of those varions employees, retaining the men
who are efficient; and in course of time some
vacancies will be created which will 4i fil-led
by virtue of the po'sýers granted him by this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. REID: May I ask the honourable
Minister what. other classes wih1 still remain
under the Civil Service Commission. As I
understand it, this Bill prfttically takes the
whole of the Customs and Inland Revenue
from that Commission.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot be more
precise in my answer for the moment, but
when we go into Committee 1 will ask Mr.
Breadner to bring me the -information. I have
the statement of the Minister that this is
taking out of the Commission's authority a
maximum of 250 employees out of 5,500.
Hon. Mr. REID: But it strikes me that it
takes out the whole of the outside service. 0f
course, preventive officers are put in-any position that may be named in the outside service:
they can be allocated to do any duty.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There are a few
appraisers who are absolute-dy techoical.
Hon. Mr. REID: I do not mean appraisers.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
means appraisers.

But the Bill only

Hon. Mr. REID: No; appriisers, preventive
officers, and ail other officers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, the t.hree
classes are:
(a) Customs appraisers of all classes whether serving at the varions ports and places
of entry or as Dominion appraisers;
(b) AIl officers in the Customs-Excise preventive service;
(e) Ail officers assigned to duty as investigators of values and claims for drawback.

574

SENATE

Hon. Mr. REID: 0f course, the preventivo
offi.cers, the spe-cial officers, were taken out last
year.
This Bili cloes flot refei to special
officers; it means that aIl preventive officers
are taken out of the control of the Coninis.sioni. I agree that it is important to get
the very best nien foi' the spccial work of
appraisers, as of course it is for any office;
but vou cannot vcîy weIl tik(, somfe of tlîem
frorn the service, though the Mister should
have power to appoint the specia1 appraisers.
I just want. to understand whit this Bill really
mrea-ns; I amn not. conîplaining, but rather
seeking for information.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I
do not Gare to discuss this Bill now. 1 think
we wili be in a much botter position to discussý
it after wxe have the officers of the Departnient before us~, and get their reasons for what
would no doubt, bc regarded by the publie as
ain inro*d on the Civil Service Act. I think
Parliament would bc called upon by a great
manv people to give a verv clear and sufficient
answer, if we pssd this Bill niaking an inr-oa.l
on the C-ivil Service Act.
If I righrly understand the Bill, I think I
couid already give asent to that part of it
rclating to the cas~e of appraiscrs and men
requiring something more than general knowledge or liierary knowiedge. They would be of
no value in appraising an invoiee of goods, or
anything of that kind; you requi-re men who
have been in business for that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Retjred morchants.

Hon. WV.B. ROSS: Yes, mon of that sort;
aîîd 1 tbink if wouid be satisfactory to have
the officers of the Dopartment before us, and
hear their reasons in detail for the changes
they want f0 make in the Civil Service Acf.
When the Bill comos back from Commitfee,
if there is anx' reason why ive shouid make
aniendrnonts, tboy couid be made then.

members of the Government attended one or
more Sittings.
The President of the Reichstag and some
of the leading members of that Chamber and
many of the Parliamentarian leaders of the
33 nations were present with other delegates

During the Genersil Debate I brouglit before the Asernb1y the question of Parliamentary Government as it f&inctions nowadays
and insisted upon the necessity of a thorough
examýination of its present conditions, its
shortoomings and faures, as well as the necessity for its improvement, and that this
grave su-bIect should be especially dealt with
by a Com.mission sippointed for the purpose
of being reported on fuly at the next Conferenoe. It was iinanimously decided tha.t it

575

woul be one of the principal questions for
discussion and action at the now 9)pproaching
Conference, at Berlin, in August next, and the
subject accordingly bas been placed on the
Agenda.
SIn the meantime the Bureau of lhe Union
bas printed and circqalated the opinions of
some of the great Parliaimentarians of Europe
on the subject.
They are Mr.' Harold J.
Laski, profeleor of Economic Sciences of the
Faculty of London Uuniversity; Mr. Chaoles
Borgeaud, prof essor at the University of
Geneva; M. F. Larnaude, honorary dean of
the Faculty of Law at Paris; Gaetano Moeca,
Senator, of the Kingdom. of Italy, professor
at the University of Romne, and Mr. M. J.
Bonn, professor at the Commercial Iinstitute
of Berlin.
I shared with the President of "La Chambre
des Députés" and a few other delegates the
honour of presiding at two Sittings of the
General Assembly.
During the Conference
it was a repeated source of gratification to
me, as President of the Canadian Group, Vo
hear from most of the delegates who had
attended the Conference of 1925, held, as you
no doubt remember, partly in Washington
and partly in Ottawa, that they were still
under the vivid impressions which they had
ca-rried away frosu their visît Vo Canada, of
what they then saw and of the very enjoyable and profitable trip it had afforded them.

The membership of the Group has recently

members.
1 wish to draw speciail attention to the
publications of the Union. A volume condistaining thé reports, recommendations,
eussions and resolutions submitted to and
adopted. by every Annual G encrai Conference
is puîblished shortly after cacha Conference

availaible for each national1 group. The members of the Canadian Group, at their last
Annual Meeting, were unanimously of opinion
that an effort should be made te have these

MAY 21, 1928
II
"The XXIVth Inter-Parliamentary Conference, taking note of the fact that under Article
6. chapter 2, of the Hague Convention of 1912,
the contracting powers undertook to adopt
measures for the suppression of the manufacture, trade in, and use of prepared opium
within the territories subject to their jurisdiction, recommends for the consideration of
the Groups of the Union to urge the Governments concerned to set a definite term not to
exceed fifteen years, within which the manufacture, trade in and use of prepared opium
within their respective territories and possessions be finally and completely suppressed.
III
"Considering that the two Conferences held
at Geneva from November 1924 to February
1925 resulted in the conclusion of a series of
international agreements concerning the gradual limitation of the abusive use of opium and
of other dangerous drugs, and making for the
establishment of effective control and supervision of the use of such drugs,
-and seeing that opinions differ as to the
value of those agreements,
the Conference recommends that the Groups
who regard the agreements as an important
step forward the achievement of the ends in
view urge their respective parliaments and
governments to see that the Geneva agreements
are ratified by their country without delay,
and asks the Groupe who are unable to share
this opinion to make every effort to induce their
states to endeavour to revise those agreements
at the first possible opportunity in accordance
with the principles enumerated in Resolution
I.
"In the meantime those Groupe are asked to
make every effort to induce their etates to exercise a strict control on the manufacture and
export of narcotices, in view of the fact thit
it is practically impossible to supervise the
traffic.

IV
"The Conference recommends that the Groups
shall examine the possibility of obtaining the
adoption by legislative and administrative mceasures of the prohibition of the production and
distribution of heroine.

V
"Whereas the great dangers above-mentioned
created by the abuse of drugs of addition may
compromise the reconstruction in the social
and economic field which is recognized as necessary, after the world war, in next to all
countries,
the Inter-Parliamentary Bureau is requested
to transmit these resolutions to all the Groups
of the Union and to all the Governments and
Parliaments of the world."
(b) A system of customs agreement between
the countries of Europe.
A system of customs agreement between the
European countries was then put in the form
of a resolution, but as the tariff is part- of
the political program in Canada, it does not
seem advisable that this group should consider
this resolution.
(c) The abolition of passport visas:
"The Conference reiterates the recommendation of the Stockholin Conference in 1921 and
the Berne-Geneva Conference in 1924 in favour

577

of the abolition of passport visas, without prejudice to any measure which may be considered
necessary for the security of the State."
(d) Reduction of Armaments:
"Resolution:
The XXIVth Inter-Parliamentary Conference
Recalling the fact that the States
Signatories of the Peace Treaties of 1919-20
and of the Covenant of the League of Nations,
unanimously recognized that the maintenance
of peace requires "the reduction of national
armaments to the lowest point consistent with
national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations";
. Seeing that by virtue of the aforementioned
peace treaties, the armaments of certain States
have been reduced and limited "in order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations;"
Seeing that this preparation for a Convention of general limitation has, thanks to the
sustained efforts of the Preparatory Disarmament Committee of the League of Nations, resulted, in spite of numerous reservations, in
unanimously accepted drafts in favour of the
limitation of armaments for land and air, but
has not succeeded in reconciling the various
points of view expressed in the matter of naval
armaments;
Seeing that these failures have caused great
disappointment to those who, suffering from the
effects of the present economic disorder, count
on seeing their hopes realized 'by means of the
reduction of the burden of military organization;
Expresses the wish that the governments,
basing themselves on the lofty principles of the
Covenant of the League of Nations, employ with
energy every means in their power to favour an
appeal to arbitration in case of contest between
States, to ensure security for each State, facilitate the general reduction of armaments and
hasten the common work necessary for the
achievement of this threefold result;
The Conference asks the Groups of the Union
to work for this end within their respective
Parliaments and with their Governments, with
aIl the energy which the situation demande, and
invites them to organize active popular propaganda in order that public opinion may express
itself imperiously in favour of the reduction
of armaments and the reign of justice between
the nations."
(e) Codification of International Law:
A:"In view of the importance and urgency
of a progressive codification of International
Law,
considering that by such codification the
flagrant injustices and numerous uncertainties
which characterize International Law in its
present state would be eliminated and that a
stable and generally accepted basis would then
be created for the solution of international disputes in the supreme interest of peace,
in view of the recommendation made to the
Couîncil of the League of Nations by the Committee of Experts for the Progressive Codification of International Law, to-the effect that the
codification of a firet series of subject-matters
which, in the opinion of the experts and according to the declarations of a considerable
number of Governments, are to be regarded as
ready for such a codification, -should be- taken
in hand,
the XXIVth Inter-Parliamentary Conference
warmly supports the recommendation, - and
records the wish that a firet Conference on
Public International Law be summoned as soon

56109-37
BEVsED EDION

578

SENATE

as possible and that all States, whether members or not of the League, be invited to participate in it, with a view to giving practical
and tangible effect to the highly important
work of the Committee of Experts.
B. In view of the very satisfactory progress
made in the work pursued up till now by the
Committee of Experts of the League of Nations,
the Conference recommends that the Conmittee of Experts, functioning as a Permanent
Committee, as is the case with other bodies
within the League, shall be invited to pursue
and push forward its studies with a view to
preparing fresh preliminary draft conventions
on other chapters of Public International Law
the codification of which appears desirable and
feasible.
It insists on the importance of a thorough and
conscientious preparation of the work of the
Conferences on Public International Law, and
recommends in particular that the present and
future work of the Committee also embrace
the question of the unification of certain principles of International Penal Law, and be carefully studied in every quarter concerning itself
with the development of International Law,
and that it be, if necessary, co-ordinated with
the work of other competent institutions, and
especially with that of the Pan-American
Union.
C. The Conference recalls the Resolution
voted by the XXIIIrd Conference held at
Washington and Ottawa in 1925 recommending
the drafting of 'a general synthetic plan of
Codification of Public International Law,
and requests the Committee for Juridical
Questions of the Union to submit the draft of
such a plan to the next Inter-Parliamentary
Conference.
The draft shall regard war solely as a crime
against International Law, (with the exception,
however, of the right of legitimate defence
which justifies a resort to arms), and must
consequently inelude, in addition to positive
Law, rules intended to secure the Law of Peace
(Friendly arrangements, mediation, conciliation. arbitration, resort to international jurisdiction), as well as rules relating to the ultimate execution of decisions reached.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt laid stress upon the
importance of the Canadian Group joining the
others in giving serious consideration to the
above mentioned matters. He pointed out that
these resolutions were printed in a volume
which could be available and distributed.
Necessary steps will be taken by the Secretary,
in order to secure copies for the members of
the Canadian Group.
The Union is closely allied to the League of
Nations with which it works in co-operation.
All the independent countries in the world
which have joined the League of Nations belong
to the Union.
The United States has also formed a very
imposing group, which has been very active and
has exercised great influence in the Union. It
received the delegates at Washington in 1925.
Mr. Belcourt recalled that the Convention of
1925 had, as previously arranged, sat partly
in Washington and Ottawa. A very enjoyable
and profitable trip was then made through parts
of Quebec and Ontario. The delegates were
delighted with the way in which they had been
received in Canada.
Mr. Belcourt read part of the circular for
1928, which invited the different Groups to
consider resolutions respecting the control of
foreign polities, the manufacture of arms and
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

war munitions by private parties, the establishment of commissions for the prevention of
conflicts between the nationals of the same
country and the prohibition of the noxious drug
traffic.
He also explained that our statutes contain
provisions against this trafflic, and that, although this Group was in full sympathy with
the three first mentioned resolutions and ecould
record its approval, te did not sec the necessity of making a thorough study thereof and
drafting reports. He however dilated on the
question of the reduction of armaments and the
codification of international law, reading
copious excerpts from the annual report of the
24th Conference.
On motion of the Hon. Mr. MeMeans, seconded by Mr. McQuarrie, it was resolved that
this Group is in full sympathy with the resolutions respecting the reduction of armaments
and will on all occasions give them its most
hearty support.
The codification of international laws gave
rise

to

some

debate,

most

of

the

members

present realizing the importance of publishing
a code containing the principles and rules of
practice of the international law.
On motion of Senator Beaubien, seconded
by Senator Hughes, it was resolved that the
Canadian Group desires to place itself on
record as giving its full approval to the projeet of entrusting a committee of scholarly
gentlemen with the task of codifying the principles of international law which now govern
the relations between the different countries
of the world.
The Chairmnan reminded the meeting that the
next Conference of the Union will be held at
Berlin, Germany, and expressed the hope that
Canada would then be adequately represented.
The members present were of the opinion that
this country should not neglect this opportunity of taking rank with the other Groups
which are playing an important part in the
different activities of the League of Nations.
The elections of the Board for the year 1928
then took place and gave the following result:

sure that Berlin is going to do itis very beat
to properly receive and entertain those whcr
attend the Conference, as a very greatineasure of satisfaction was ghown when Berlin wais seleeted as the place of meeting. The
meeting to select oui, delega.tes will be held
on Thursday or Friday, if possible, and not
later than early next week. I think by that
time we shail be in possession of information
and details of interest to thoe who may con.template going over.

I should hâve said that the Union holds
meetings several times in the year; that its
Committees or Commissions ait practically

Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN:

fortune to attend one of these Conferences,

Canadian National Railways, to the Minister
of Railways and Canals, setting forth the data
requested by the honourable Leader on the
other side (Hon. W. B. Ross) as to earnings
of branch lines. It reads:

Washington in 1926, Mr. Thomas Johnson,
of the Irish Free State, proposed that in case
of Great Britain becoming involved in war
the other nations agree to regard the British
Dominions as neutral territory and not attack
Sir 'Robert Horne saild that would

be a very convenient arrangement for Great
Britain, as it would leave them that much
less territory to protect, but he could not
"imagine any belligerent state which happened
to be in hostility with Great Britain at the
time agreeing to a plan by which their course
of action and their power of injury te the
country with which they were fighting should
"I wish to telil the Conference

quite definitely," he continued, ",that Great
Britain does net ask for this concession; nor
do I know of any other part -of His Majesty's
Dominion that would ask for this eleemosynary aid in the event of a conflict breaking
He added that any dominion of the
out."
empire -was free to assist Great Britain or
not as it may choose, in case of a war, but
that that would not free them from liability to
attack on the part of any enemy who would
choose that method.
Thus quietly, but effectively he punctured
any idea that a Dominion could stay out of
an Empire war by mere choice.

Dear Mr. Dunning:
In reference to yours of the 23rd ultimo and
further to mine of April 25th, in connection
with information as to earnings and expenditures on the new branch -lines constructed under authority of Parliament 1924-25.
The earnings for the nineteen branch lines
in question, covering a total of 565.7 miles as
reflected by the station earnings were $3,829,010. If the saine operating ratio for the Canadian National Railways (less Eastern Lines)
for the year 1927, namely 83.6% is applied
to these earnings, there would be net earnings
for the year 1927 of $627,957.00.
The total cost of construction of these
Branches, to December 31st, 1927 was $14,760,172.27, of which $1,343,123.68 was expended
during the year 1927 and it is safe to assume
that one-half of this amount would not be
bearing interest. Therefore interest would be
paid in 1927 on $14,088,610.43, w-hich if taken
at 5% would create a fixed charge of $704,430.52. On the above basis the net earnings
would be within $76,473.00 of paying the fixed
charges.
This method of testing these branches is the
same as given to the Senate last year, at which
time it was explained that the Railway does
not keep its books in such a way as to definitely
reflect the net earnings of branch lines, but that
this method in a general way will indicate if
they were carrying themselves.
Yours faithfully,
Sgd. H. W. Thornton.
President.

:STATISTICS OF PENITENTIARIES
INQUIRY

On the notice of inquiry:
By Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. How many criminals are there in the
penitentiaries of Canada.
2. How many men and how many women?
3. How many Canadian born?
4. What are the nationalities of these criminals?
5. What is the number for each language?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Stand.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is this inquiry
to stand until the Session is over?
It is a
very simple inquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am kind to
the honourable gentleman.
I might ask him
to transform his inquiry into a motion for a
return: then he would get the return next
Session.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But I need not
accept the honourable gentleman's suggestion.
This is a free House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Meanwhile the
honourable gentleman marks time.
The inquiry stands.
FÛREIGN VESSELS IN CANADIAN
CANALS
-

NQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to foreign vessels others than those of the
UnDited States of America using Canadian canals
ewi±heat paying tolls or contributing to their
nuWintenance, and that lie will ask the Governiment to place on the Table of the Senate a list
of such vessels, if any, plying from Montreal
to Buffijlo. or from Port Arthur or Fort William to Buffalo or vice-versa, giving first the
naines of each vesse].
2. Their tonnage.
3. The number and nationality of the crews.
4. Under what flag they are sailing.
5. What amount, if any, each vessel has paid
to the revenue of Canada.
6. When eaeh vessel has entered for the first
time the Lachine Canal last year.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

7. When each vessel has passed for the last
time, last year out of the Lachine Canal?
8. What amount of ship stores did each vessel have entering Canada, and what amount
of ship stores did it have leaving Canada.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it may be
within the recollection of some honourable
members of this house that I spoke the other
day about foreign ships using our canals free,
and making use also of our other improvemonts in navigation, our ports, etc.
Exception was taken to my remarks by M.
Ludvig Aubert, the Royal Consul General in
Montreal for the Kingdom of Norway.
He
stated that he felt very much aggrieved at the
stand I was taking with reference to Norwegian ships.
I told him that 1 was extremely sorry to hurt his feelings, and was
quite willing to do anything within reason
to give him satisfaction.
I may say that Mr.
Aubert is a very estimable gentleman.
He is
the dean of the consular corps in Montreal,
which means that be is the Consul who has
been in Montreal the longest.
He is very
popular, very well liked, in our city.
He told
me then that I had made some incorrect
statements.
That changed the whole aspect
of the matter.
He was taking exception to
what I had stated in a rather long speech; so
I said: "Mr. Aubert, if you will give me your
statement in writing, I promise to read it
verbatim to the Senate, and the Senate can
judge whether I have been incorrect or not."
Before dealing with that, I wish to say that
I have here an official list of Norwegian and
Danish boats which were engaged in trade on
the Great Lakes in the season of 1927, and
which carried grain cargoes internationally,
chiefly between Buffalo and Montreal.
The
statement gives the names of each steamer, the
number of trips, and the capacity. There are
fifteen of these steamers. The names are
mostly unpronounceable.
One steamer alone,
called the Haux, made sixteen trips.
With
the permission of the Senate I will place the
list on Hansard and leave honourable Senators
to try to pronounce the names.

MAY "2, 1928
Here is the letter received fromt the Royal
Norwcgian Consul General, Montreal, dated
May 4, 1928:
Dear Sii:In 1926, as weIi as this year, you have made
certain statements in the Senate regarding the
Norwegian Shipping on the Great Lakes. I beg
to refer you to the Debates of the Senate,
Tuesday, June Sth, 1926 (no. 24) and the
debates of the Senate, Wednesday, April 25th,
1928 (no. 24).
When I happensd to meet you on Saturday,
April 28th, you brought up the question of the
Norwegian shipping and the Norwegian coinpetition with the Canadian Shipping on the
Great Lakes, and I took the liberty to mention
to you that your staternents in the Senate
regarding the Norwegian Shipping wers incorrect. In reply yon stated that, if you liad
made incorrect statements, yon would be glad
to be furnighed with sucb material, as would
enable you to correct those statements, which
were not conforming to eitin coditions. I
promised you to do this and wil in the following mention the points, which 1 consider the
most important ones.
1. -lou have stated (see the Debates of the
Senate for April 25tb, 1928, page 367) that
Norwegian. ships are coming out this summer
"to do a coasting trade" in Canada.
Well, there I admit I should not have used
the word "coasting". I should have said Wo
engage in lake and river trade. Coasting
means that the vessels would go from one
Canadien port to another. That was flot
what I intended to convey, and the text of
my speech shows that very clearly.
Allow me to say that this statement of yours
in contrary to f act. The Norwegian ships in
Canada are not allôwed by Canadian Iaw te
engage in coastwise trade, and they are obeying he Canadian laws in that as well as other
re8pects. Moreover, if you are at all familiar
with the clearing maethods flsed by the Canadiait
Customs stations, yon will know that it is
practically an impossibility for any foreîgn ship
to engage ln coastwise trade in Canada withont
the knowledge and control of the Customes
authorities. Your statement, theref ors, auto,.
matically implies (1 dare -say unintsntionally on
your part) a charge against the Canadian
Custôms anthorities for neglecting to prevent
Norwegian shipping fro4n bireakitig the Canadian laws. Even if you wonld neot correct yonr
statement ont of love for the Norwegian
shippihig I arn convinced that you wonld do
s0 to cear the Canadian Ct1ome authoritieâ
of any suspicion o! helsgect in the mnattetý
In connection herewith 1 would like to uote
the following from a letter, whieh I have
recsivsd fromn a Norwegian shipping agent
1esiding in Montreal:
"I dare say that -the Noiwegian Ships havé
not as yet, and I do flot expect them tW trt
to évade the présent Iaws, miles and regutrade, and
i the
l4tiens thought;lake advisable to as agent, 1 have
always
it
co-ôpsrate witb
Ali authorities in xeeiing that &il fomialitieb
are coinplied with by the shiprnastsrs, officers
and mnen.
TbI e Norwegians are not brsakihg any coaàting laWs in Canada. It bais been stated. that
by ùsing Buffalo as a transhipping point that
the Canadian coastwise law could be evaded.

583

but this bas not been of any interest whatsoever ta the Norýwegian ships. The shipa I
aperate arc mostly interestsd in loading in
ports Aucb a Duluth, Chicago or Milwaukee as
f ar as grain is concerned, and only wben my
frienda have had special cargoes for which they
needed tonnage have I accepted cargos ont
of Buffalo.
WIherever the grain loaded in
Buffalo originates, I do nlot know, and neyer
will know, nntil the grain is loaded.
The western fariners did flot huild a
2,000,000 bushel elevator in Buffalo to store
United States grain.
In closing the business for the ships, saine is
dons throngb brokers in American ports sncb
as Duluth. Chicago or in some cases Buffalo
and New York. Very little grain is booked
in Montreal and other Canadian ports for the
Norwegian ships.
It ssems that the représentatives for the
largeist grain honses in the world, people who
have been in business in Montreal for many
ysars, are thoroughly pleased. with the way
business have been transacted and handled for
Norwegian ships. At least, I have neyer had
any complainte te the contrary in the years I
have been ini business."
2. In 1926 (ses the Debates of the Senate,
Jnne 8th. 1926, page 79you stated that the
forei n ships are fres from regulations. I do
notknow wbers you have obtained this information1 will show this honourable House ini a
minute.
-bnt if you bad approached me in the matter
the
it
iefore Yon Able ta givenp in the Senate, I would
have be.n brongt
you
correct information. I think I arn saf e in stating that the
Norwegian regulations concsrning the seawortbmnes o!hips are at least as severe as the
régulations of any other country. For yonr
information I beg to enclose herswith a copy
of "Norwegian Regulations concerning ths
Seaworthiness o! Ships", published in 1920 by
The Inspector-General of Shipping and Navigation, at Oslo, Norway..
There are nurnerous
other regnlations rsgarding Norwegian Shipping, and if you desire mors information than
thiis, 1 arn quite willing ta let you have it.
ý3.In 1929 yoi statsd (ses the Dsbates of
the Senate, Jnne 8th, 1926, page 178, first
colnmn) that Norwegkan ohips are plying in
trade bers "without hnying anything in this
Conntry." You aie stateid thât foréign vessels
do not empIoy any Canadian seainen. Yen
state furthermors that these ships do not pay
A cent o! Wagée ta Canédian labour.
1 wiIl flot answer that myseif, but will leave
It ta the Dominion Marine Association.
In this connection allow me ta quots wbat
the pteviously mentioned Norwsgian ehipping
agent says in this respect:-*
"It is alsa ta be remembered that lait season
1as agsnt for 8 Nprwegiau lakte traderq, shifted
aànt 1Mflmen in Montréal ana other &lnadian
porte atid paid ont in wages alons About $35,500.
whilch monsy were drawn by the shipmnasters ta
pay their crewé."
Whether those crèw8 were ail Canadian or
not, I would like to know.
"lun addition thsre were employed 8 lak-é
pilots, or so called sailingma@ters, who receivsd

584

SENATE

wages to the amount of $13,915. It is to be
noted that I pay the sailingniasters the highest
going wages in the trade. I have also paid
$4,414 in pilotage in River St. Lawrence during
1925."
Well, who would pay them? Woulid they
expect us to pay the pilotage dues for those
ships?
"The Harbour Commissioners of Montreal
received $20,556 for unloading of vessels in the
Grain Trade. Towing and wrecking companies
received $11,921. and I paid repair bills to the
anount of $15,290."
Who was going to pay them if he did not?
"It is of course natural that the ships engaged in the Trade on the Great Lakes buy
their fuel at the most convenient and economical
points. $56,157 was spent last year on bunkers,
of which approximately 55% in Canada. It is
to be noted that my company never received
the refund of duty for coal imported into Canada, even though it is custonary to get this duty
refunded by ships engaged in trade between
Canadian and foreign (US.) ports.
I paid for my ships also $8,795 in stevedoring
in the port of Montreal, and I know that there
are spent money in numerous ways by the
crews, offBeers, masters, etc., which are beneficial to the country. Personally I am employing 3 men--all war veterans-who are also
making a living out of the Norwegian ships
trading the lakes."
Well, some families have got as many veterans as that, and are making no boast about
it.
"In regard to supply for the ships:-When
the articles condemning Norwegian shipping in
Canadian waters started, it was stated that
the ships did not buy anything in Canada, or
not any more than wiat was absolutely necessary. The latter statement is partly correct.
as it is poor policy on any shipowners part not
to buy stores where they are the cheapest. However, the stores as barrelled beef, pork, etc., etc.,
are to-day the most expensive meals served on
board the ships vio have' opportunity to replenish their stores with fresh goods in the
line of beef, vegetables, eggs, milk, etc., etc.Tinned goods of all descriptions are of the most
expensive subsistance given ships crews. With
other words it is lack of knowledge if the ships
do not buy sufficient stores in Montreal for the
round voyages in the lake trade."
You will notice, honourablle gentlemen, it
*S "lake trade" again.
"My office paid $16,278 in ships stores during
1925."
Why is it always 1925? What about 1926
and 1927?
4. On April 25th, 1928, you stated as follows:"They
(the foreign vessels) pay their men
about 1/4th of the wages that ours receive, and
they are careful not to pay them during the
voyage, but only when they return to Norway".
Also this statement is absolutely incorrect.
There is a difference between Canadian wages
and Norwegian wages, but your statement
grossly exaggerates this difference.
But he does not say what the difference is.
This House and especially the ex-Minister of
non. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) might also be
interested in knowing that.
With regard to the Norwegian sailors' right
to receive their wages, the law respecting seamen of February 16th, 1923, stipulates that the
master shall be entitled te retain, until the
seaman leaves the service, 1/3 of such wages

as the seainan himself may draw; the amount
retained must not at any time exceed half a
month's wages. Of course, any ship's master,
whio would try te retain a sailor's wages until
the ship's return to Norway, would not be able
to obtain a crew at all. In addition to this, lie
would be compelled by the Consular Authorities to comply with the law. I know of no
case in which any Norwegian ship's master bas
tried to violate the law in this respect.
There are other statements made by you regarding the Norwegian shipping, which are not
correct, but I consider that the above-mentioned
points are the most important ones.
The Norwegian shipping in Canada is carried out according to Treaty and Law, and so
far I am not aware of the Norwegian ships
having abused the hospitality, which the Canadian Goverrnment has extended to the ships of
my country, on the saine footing as that of
ships of other countries. I also believe that on
the whole the Canadian grain trade and other
Canadian export and import business are well
served by the Norwegian freight steamers. 1

cannot but regret that you have, without proper previous inquiries, made several incorrect'

statements regarding my country's shipping
trade, statements tending to create an animosity against our ships, whieh would not be well
founded.
I beg te say that I accept your offer to correct your statements to the Senate. and I shall
appreciate it if you would do so before parliament closes.
Yours truly,
Ludvig Aubert,
Consul-General of Norway.

Now, honourable gentlemen, the question is
raised-and I will not attempt to discuss it
to-day-whether our canals are open and free
to everybody. This country seems to be free
in everything. In every other country foreigners must have a passport, but here they do not
need even a card of identification. They can
come in and go out as though they owned the
country. In 1903 when we abolished tolls on
the canals, we gave the United States the
privilege of using our canals without paying
tolls, because at that tirne we were using their
canal at Sault Ste-Marie, and some of us were
guileless enough to think that in return we
would have the right to use any American
canal. But we soon found that was not the
case. When some parties went down to Whitehall they were told: "Oh, no, the Erie Canal
belengs to the State of New York." So you
never see a Canadian boat on the Erie Canal.
We ought to be more particular, and ought to
know what we are getting. It will be a nice
question for the Senate to take up next Session,
whether we are obliged to give free canals to
all the ships of the world. We pay tolls on
the Panama Canal, and on the Suez Canal,

MAY 22, 1928
and on the 'Manchester Canal there are tolls
for British vessels, and tolle which are heavier
for foreign vessels.
Now I have only a page to read of a statement from the Dominion Marine Association.
It is as follows:
To the Right Honourable The Premier
and the Members of the King's
Privy Council for Canada.
Owners of Canadian vessels trading on the
Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River submit
that in the trade of these inland waters of Canada they are subjected most unfairly to competition of foreign vessels from overseas which
bear none of the burdens borne by Canadian
ships and pay no share of the cost of construetion and upkeep of inland channels and ports
and of the Dominion Canals.
Ships, principally from Scandinavian ports,
joined recently by some from Germany, Denmark and other countries, come up through the
Dominion Canals and engage in the carriage of
bulk freight internationally, or across the line,
between the United States and Canada, leaving
these waters for ocean service before the close
of navigation. They enjoy the free use of the
canals and river channels. They are not subject to the Canadian laws and regulations as
to qualification or number of officers and crew.
That is what I am reproached for having
said.
They pay no annual inspection fee to Canada
for hull or boiler or machinery. They pay
nothing through ship or owner by way of taxation and add nothing to Canadian revenues.
It seems to me that is what they are complaining of.
They reduce their own overhead by all the
year round service, and at the same time they
pay about one-third of the Canadian wage
schedule and thus work serious damage to
Canadian labour as well as to the shipping industry.

Well, I stand corrected as to wages. I said
one-quarter; I should have said one-third.
lowever, honourable gentlemen, you will
admit that one-third is a big reduction, and
remember, honourable gentlemen, that not I,
but the Dominion Marine Association, is
responsible for this statement.
The Dominion Marine Association submits
that these foreign ships should not be permitted
to enjoy all the advantages of Canada's inland
waters with none of the burdens or disadvantages incident upon 'Canada's own shipping,
and that primarily the imposition of Canal
Tolls upon vessels not flying the flags of Great
Britain, the United States or Canada, could be
arranged. so as to exact a fair contribution towards the revenues of. the Dominion and the
expense of maintaining canals, channels, ports
and aids to navigation, and:at the same time
afford a reasonable measure of protection to
Canadian inland shipping upon which this
foreign service is now being dumped.
To answer that the canals were built for
Canadians and not exclusively for Canadian
vessel owners and -that the proper procedure
now is to impose upon these foreign ships all
the burdens and taxation borne by Canadian
vessels and their owners does not meet the

585

case. For one thing it is not apparent at
present how the foreign and the domestic service can be put on a parity in the matters mentioned or how the present Dominion taxes upon
income can be applied; and for another, there
is no assurance that this alternative procedure
will be promptly adopted.
The Canals were not made free to the world
with a view to the present conditions. Tolls
weré removed because in 1903 Canadian ship
owners backed by the leading commercial organizations of the country asked for relief from
this burden and because they presented the
argument that they were then enjoying free
passage through the United States Canals at
Sault Ste. Marie. It may be true that those
Canals are free to all ships but as they are inaccessible to ships of any size except through the
Dominion Canals their freedom from tolls establishes no precedent for action in Canada.
The Manchester ship Canal distinguishes in
its ftariff of tolls, between local, coasting and
foreign traffic, and while the traffic rather than
the fiag may be looked to, the result is to the
advantage of the local shipping.
.Yet the Great Lakes are in a peculiar position differing from that of other waters entered by canal. They carry an immense inland
trade of their own. They are owned exclusively
by the two bordering countries, while by far
the greater part of the St. Lawrence is owned
exclusively by Canada, and it is submitted that
Canadian shipping which is being developed on
these waters, and the owners of these shipt
who bave been taxed to improve these waters
and to build and upkeep the canals, should be
protected against the inroad of the unburdened, untaxed foreign competition complained
of, and that in no other effective way can this
protection be given at present than by the imposition of a toll on the canals.
The Association refers also to the petition
now in process of being signed by inland
mariners, of which a copy is attached, and which
will be presented to the Goyernment in due
course when signed.
Dominion Marine Association.
I thank this honourable House for the
patience with which they have listened to me,
but I think this is a question that should
interest us next session. I really believe this
House would be well advised if they took up
this matter.
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, I do not desire to enter into a
discussion of the subject matter which the
honourable member has just submitted to the
House; but some two or three weeks ago I
received a communication on a matter of
public interest that affects the question that
my honourable friend has been discussing today, and therefore I propose to take a moment
to mention it.
My honourable friend referred to what is
stated in the document to be a fact, that the
rate of compensation paid to men employed
in the merchant marine of foreign countries,
that has been operating in our great lakes and
inland waterways is about one-third of that
paid by Canadian steamship companies and
ship owners to Canadian sailors, as I assume.

586

SENATE

That is a startling comparison when we
consider, at the same time, that the rates
paid by our Canadian shipping men are very
substantially below those paid by United
States ship owners. This question is of some
interest in connection with another subject
that is now engaging the attention of the
Senate, namely, the inquiry into the St. Lawrance watarway matter, because of the serious
discrepancy that exists in the cost of operating
ships, and the laws which govarn the manning
of them.
My information is that ships of United
States register which are operating on the
Great Lakes are required to man their ships
by threc shifts of men, working eight hours
each, but that rule doas not apply on Canadian vessaIs. In addition to having the
three-shift crewv instead of two-shift,' making
a différence of approximately a third ini the
cost of oparation in favour of the Canadian
steamers, so far as labour is concerned , the
following sacms to be a comparative list of

The list of oe officer and one amiployaa ie
each of thosa classes would aggragate, on a
Ca-nadian ship, $1,278.66 par month, and on
the same sized Amarican slip, for the same
service and the same number of men, the cost
would be $2,165 par month.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

In addition to that, as has been already
pointed out, the American crew is one-third
larger than the Canadian crew because of the
three-shift, arraingement. Therefore, if it be
truc, as my hustourable friend has read, that
ships of foreign register-that is, apart from
the United States and Canada-come into
Our inland waters and operate at a labour cost
of one-third our' present labour cost, what
must the situation be? Because the prasent

Canadian labour cost would approximately.
be only 60 per cent of the standard paid by

American vessais operating in competition in
the same water.
My correspondent, who comas from the city
of Montreal and is a mariner, says:
By referring to the circular you will notice
that the U.S.A. vessai owners operating in
competition -with the Canadian vessel owners
are paying niuch higlier wages, and in this
coinpetition the U .S.A. have everything against
theni.
For instance, the U.S.A. owners flying the

Amiericaii flag have the foi]owing disadvantages:
(1) They purchase their vessels ie the U.S.A.
at about double the cost of those purchasad in

Great Britain;
(2) The-, have got to employ U.S.A. citizens;
(3) On ai] vessais of 3,000 tons anti over they
have, according to the U.S.A. laws. to amploy
thrcc crews, whilc the Canadians have only two
erews;
(4) The U.S.A. owners feed their crews niuch
better than the Canadian owners;
I am not prepared to say whethcr that is
50 or flot.
-and yet je spite of that, the U.S.A. owners
pav their engineers and other officers ajbout
double what the Canadian owaers ara paying.
1 have shown the figures. My correspondent

emaous why there ha.s ibeen a substantial
exodus of Canadian citizenis Vo the Unite-d
States; that this -is but ane indication of the
advantagcs that are to ba f ound for Canadian
citizens who have access to, that country for
employment 'opportunities.
Whan we arc considering the St. Lawrence
waterway deepening, and the saving in cost
of transportation of frcight, I think wa must,
et the same timae, give some hccd to the
question of e-qualizing compensation for men

ciation to Borne extent, but I believe they,
and the ship-builing intereste in Canada, have
stili a grievance.
I remesuber that some years ago a coinplaint was raised -in Parliament as to foreign
vessels coming in and doing .practically our
coasting trade, beoeuse they carried grain
from Port Arthur to Montreal, and freight
frorn Buffalo to Moatresil or. Port Arthur.
For Borne years, however, it was difficult to
remove that griervance, because a great many
of ouïr Canadilan vessels were absent from the
inland waters for a number of years on
account of the war, and we were glad to get
any vessels that woul help to carry our
grain from. the West. One grievance at that
tîme was t-hat British vessels were allowed to
do coasting trade ini Canada. But that was
flot the lonly grievance, for foreign vesselg
could run into a British 'port and register as
of London, England, or of St. Johns, Newfoundland, and they had the saie right to
do ooastmng trade as a vessel 'built in England. That was remedied by an Order in
Council or an Act defining a British vessel
as one bulit in a British country. That
restriction bam since applied, and has reierved
a certain amount of competition, and helped
the marine organization a great deal.
The cojuplaint thut has been 'brought before us to-day is a very serious one. 1 live
on -the St. Lawrence and I see those foreign
vessels going up regularly, partLicu-larly at the
time of year wben tbey can hardly get cargoes
from Montreal to other ports, and they
sEriously interfere with the trafflc which our
own Ca.nadian vessels and United States
vessels have a right to carry. We have such
a short season for iland navigation that
when those foreign vesseld oome in and take
a great deai of the trnfflc, the Canadian and
American vessetis have to raise their rates and
this at the time wben the great traffic is
coming through f rom Port Arthur a>nd Fort
William, in -the spring and fali.
I think that sornething sbould be done.to
help our marine mn in relation to that
foreign coxnpetition. I 'believe the Government would bie well advised to consider
putting on a rate of tolà on inland trafflo
between Port Arthur and Montrea;l, applicable to any vessel other than Canadian,
United States, or British. 1 think that would
help out a great deal. 0f couree, those engaged in the shepuilding industry are coinplaining ail the turne, and in a way their

built and owned 'by United States citizens;
but our vessel owners say tha~t the only
vessels constructed and owned in Canada doing any coasting trade, are those built by the
Canadian Govermient Merchant Marine,
which were built during the war. I cannot
.very weIl see how we can avoid givi.ng the
shipbuilders the protection they ask, because
I tinderstand that a vessel buit in any
British counitry bas the right to coast or do
marine work in Canada or any other British
country. Our sbipbiuilders bave ta face the
fact that British vessels are mu>h cheaper
than those constructed, bere.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

25 per cent.

Hon. Mr. REID: 25 per cent or whatever it is, but if a British vessel cornes
over bere it bais just thbe saine rights, as far
as traffic is concerned, as a vessel buit in
Canada. However, there is this advantage
over foreign vessels, that in tbe case of a
vessel huilt in a British country, owned by
Canadians, manned by Canadian crews, that
hier supplies are all bought i Canada, and
under our laws the sailors have a right to a
fair wage.
I have been told by saine marine men, who
are very sore at the position of matters, that
those foreign vessels do flot spend a dollar ini
this country other than for fuel and a very
srnall quantity of supplies. The wages and
practically aIl receipts are sent sway, so0that
there is practically no advantage gained by
this country froin their operation. I arn iniforrned that the method ie for a foreign
vessel to bring supplies enough froin bier own
country, store thein in Montreal in bond, and
take themn out from turne to tirne, but leave
very little rnoney in Canada; yet such vesselsm
bave the right, under our laws, ta trade here,
and pay lower wages than our Canadian shippers pay, though tbey can bie huilt cheaper
in some foreîgn countries than in England..
Under those circuinstances what chance hasf
one of our merchant vessels to live in this
country?
We have talked about having our Canadian
vessels put under the Railway Commission
or some other body that would fix the rates.
But how can you fix the rates? You may
figure on sa mahxy million bushels of grain
coming from tbe Northwest, but how muoh
of it is going to bie carried by these foreign
vessels you do not know. Therefore it would
bie rnuch better if we could have this traffie
carried by our own Canadian vessels, aud

man on board the vessel would bie a Canadian citizen, the money paid for his services
would be left in Canada, and ail the supplies
would lie bought in this country.
I think this is a very important question.
1 must admit that it would have been hard
to impose restrictions a f ew years ago, when
on accounit of the war vessels were so short
in this country, but I think that the turne
bas arrived when we should sec to it-and
it would be only fair-that so far as the inland traffie betwvcen Montreal and Port Arthur
or Fort William is concerned, it should be
carried only by Canadian and American
vessels, having equal rights in the use of our
canaIs and waterways between Montreal and
the head of the Lakes. That wouid be at
ieast some protection. I do not know the
quanWity. but there must be some millions
of hushels carried in tramp steamers. I do
not think it is unreasonable to make some
regulation to prevent tramp steamers from
taking traffie away frorn vessels wvhich, thougli
but in England, are owned in Canada, s0
that these Canadian vessels may not have
to carry frcight at a ioss. It has been stated
in Ibis House, and I have read in the ncwspapers, that grain ivas carried last year between Port Arthur and Montreal for five
cents a hushel. The average during the year
wvas about fOl cents. I tbink that if you could
eliminate these foreign vessels the grain could
he carried at least as cheaply, and in my
opinion the cost would be iess. I cannot see
why any country sbould abject, nor why we
should be a party to letting other vessels
corne in and do our inland work. Foreign
vessels are flot permitted to do the coastwise
trade of the United States.
Our Canadian merchant marine is not as
large to-day as it was a number of years aga.
We received our first blow when the laws
ivere interpreted as perrnittîng American
vessels to carry grain fromn Port Artbur or
some other Canadian port to an American
part, and there unlaad, and the same grain

merchant marine. 1 would like ta sec, if it
were possible, a law providing that what I
may caîl aur coastwise traffic should be carried
in vessels built in Canada, but I do nat see
how we can expeet ta have such a iaw at
present, or so long as it is understood lietwecn Great Britain and her colonies that
vessels bujît in Great Britain have the sarne
riglit as ourselves ta carry an this traffic.
There is anather littie complaint toa-and
ail these smaii complaints tend ta create a

and that is that if anc of aur vessels gaes
aground and is taken inta one of the Ami'rican
ports for rer.airs the rate af duty on the
repairs is 40 ta 50 per cent, whereas if an
Anierican vessel, having been wrecked, cames
into a Canadian part, the rate of duty is 25
per cent. A number of accidents accur during the ycar, and while the canais and rivers
are used freely by bath countries, and supplies, etc., are brougbt in free, it is anly fair
that the same rate of duty shauid be charged
and the saine treatinent given in anc country as in the other. We should take up with
the United States the question of aur rate
of 25 per cent, ta sec if they could not agree
ta the same rate on repairs in United States
ports; or, if tbey prefer the other alternative,
we sbould have the saine rate of duty an
repairs as they have.
Remember, there are seasons when saIne of
the vessels do nat make much money. If a
vessel has a wreck or meets with a mishap,
wbilc it may be insured, the owners are not
insured against the loss of tirne, and aithaugli
the vessel is restored ta its proper condition,
the Ioss of timc means the loss of all profits
during the year.
I rose mely ta state n few of the grievances of thc marine men, and I would suggest
ta the honourable leader here that. during the
recoes, when they have time, the Goverament
shoUlid take up this questian and perbaps by
Ord-erin Council provide tha't canal tolîs shai
be ebargcd on ves-sels, other than Arnerican
and Canadian, engaged in inland traffle. That
should lie donc as soon as possible, in order
that, it may help during the pre-sent season.
I do not think for anc minute that advantagc
would lie taken of it ta increase the rates;
in fact I think the effeet would be to reduce
thc ra(tes. However, the Governinent could
prateet the people con.cerned. The people of
the Northwest know the rates that are paid
naw, and thcy should not pay mare during
this seasan than they did last sesxson. If any
,xssistaroce is given in the way I have suggested,
thec Governinent could easily control the situation so nas ta prevent urfair advant.age being
taken. I would suggest tbat when this routter
is takýen up consideratian should bie given also
ta the question whethcr wrccked Canadian
vessels in United States ports should not lie
treated in the same way as Unitcd States
vessels are treated in aur ports.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 321, an Act ta arnend
the Incarne War Tax Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the object
of this Bill is ta restore an enactment which
was dropped from the Statutes in the revision of 1927. Under the Act as it stood,
an information or complaint could be laid
against anyone infringing the Incarne War
Tax Act within two years of the time when
the matter of the information or complaint
arase. That provision having been dropped,
the Department bas had ta faîl back upan
the ýCriminal law, which. permits of a delay
of only six rnonths within which proceedings
can be instituted. The Minister takes the
opportunity afforded by this error in the
printing of the Revised Statutes ta extend the
time ta three years, instead of twa years, as
heretofore. within which a complaint may be
laid against an incarne taxpayer who bas
made a fraudulent or false return. The reason which the iIepartrnent of National
Revenue gives for this is the fact that the
checking of these statements takes sorne considerable tirne. As honourable gentlemen
know, we file aur returns on the 3Oth
of April and we sornetimes receive a final
receipt only after twelve rnonths.
The
returns are sent ta the Department at Ottawa,
and considerable work involved in verifying
thern. If the law were ta rernain as it is,
awing ta the error in Revising the Statutes,
no penalty could be imposed for its violaHon. Mr. TURRIFE.

tian. 1 may say that Great Britain first provided that a taxpayer could be punished anytime within three years for rnaking a f alse
return; but since 1923, 1 think, the period has
been extended ta six years. This Bill carnmended itself ta the House of Commons.
Besides curing the error made through the
revision of the Statutes the Bill affects ta be
retroactive in the sense that it, shaîl be
deemed ta have corne into force on the lst
day of Janua-ry, 1926, Sa that nothwithstanding any other provision relating ta the prosecution of offences, any offence against the
provision of Section 80 of the Incarne War
Tax Act committee after the lst day of January, 1926, shall be punishable within three
years frorn the time when the matter of the
information or complaint arase.
With this explanation I move the second
reading of the Bill.
Han. N. K. LAFLAMME:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have just cast an eye over this

Bill, and it seems ta me somewhat exceptional
in character. I have noted particularly four
groiunds upon which it could be fairly criticized. First, it is an exception ta the rule of
Article 1142 of the Criminal Codeý. Exceptions in penal legisiation exist provided there
be some reason, not arbitrary in character.
ta justtify thom.
The second ground oaf
criticisrn seerns to be that the legislation is
retrospective instead of prospective.
The

third ground is, that being retrospective it is
fraught with injustice, and hiable ta create a,
miscarriage af justice. A fourth ground that
I might mention is. that being sa. it.would be
a bad precedent.
*Now, let me take up these four points.
As I have said, this is an exception ta
the rule contained in Article 1142 of the

Code, which provides that where offences are
tbe prosecuted under the Summary Convictions Act, there is a limitation of six months.
Therefýore, the proposed Bill is a glaring
exception. Hawever, exceptions can be justi-

fied, provided the reasons for ihem are saund.
What are the reasons? The reasons are given
in the explanatory note, and were explained
by the Leader of the Government a few
moments ago. This note says.
The volume of files and information ta be
examnined precludes in a large measure the
discovery of fraud until after six months frorn
the timne when the offence ivas committed.
That is the reasan.
Whether that is a fact
or flot I do not know. What is apparent,
hawever, is that the reason is aî'bitrary. How
is it that it takes three years for a welI
organized Department possessed of the expert
knowledge ta scan aver a return and check

MAY 22, 1928
it? That Department is rnanned by a staff
of excellent investigetore armed with full
powers. I see thern in the city of Montreai
almost every day. Why flot say two years?
Wlw flot say six? This exception je absolutely
arbitrary, end the faot that a Department
requires three years for the examination of
Governmepit rçturns would flot speak very
highly for it. But there is more than that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It ie much lower
than in Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. LAFLAMME: A comparison, Mr.
Leader, ie neyer an argument; it ie the
juxtaposition of two elemente which may be
absolutely wrong.
I arn dealing with this
Bill in a concrete way, and in~ the atmosphere
in which we are living to-day in this country.
Now, the effect of thie Bill je retroactive.
One would think that we were dealing with
legisiation passed in France 145 years ago,
where not only suspects, but those who are
suepected of being suspecte would, retroactively, be liable te imprieonmient.
Let us
read this:
This Act shall be deemed to, have corne into
force on the first day of January, one thousand
nine hundred and twenty-six, so that, notwithstanding any other provision relating to the
prosecution of offences, any offence against the
provisiong of section eighty of the Income War
Wax Act committed after the first day of
-January, one thousand fine hupdred and
twenty-six, shahl be punishable within three
years fromn the tine when the matter of the
information or complaint arose.
Now, if there is any legisiation which ought
always to receive a cold reception, even in
civil matters, it is retroactive legislation;
and if that je se, how much more is it the
case in criminal matters? And how much
more should it be the case where the offence
deait with is created by the St-àtutes and
by nothing else?
That brings me to the third ground of
criticism.
If this pràvision is retroactive it
is bound t, bhe unjust. Unjust for whom?
Unjust not only for the taxpayers, but also,
for the Crown.
Let me explain.
Takre a
taxpayer who makes, hie returu to-day: in
two or three yeare from, no-w where will hie
books be? They might have been destroyed
by fire, or because he wants to brueh up hie
office; hie might be out of business; hie bookkeepers might be spread ail over the worid.
Therefore by the mere lapse of time of
three years the ta,,payer would be deprived
of the elements of proof necessary to support
hie defence.
Now as to the Crown. It is incorrect te say
that the Crown is interested'in seçuring con-

591

victions. The Crown is interested in seeing
that justice je done, and Crown prosecutors are
just as well Lsatisfied with an acquittai as with
a conviction.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They ought ta
be.
Hon. Mr. LAFLAMME:
Therefore the
Crown is interested in flot depriving the defernce of the elements of proof, written or
otherwise, which would be available; and I
thik that in six monthe the Crown ought to,
be able to decide whether or not it has a
case.
If you introduoe an amendment of thje retroactive character, it is oppressive.
Where
are you going to stop?
Next thing, in the
case of arny offence by nature per se, one
might say "Let us make it retroactive, because
in the year 192 you made a statutory offence
that could be prosecuted within a period of
three years, whereae more grievous offences
muet be prosecuted within six monthe."
1
do 41ot eee the logic of that, ner, with ail due
respect, the comimon sense, which je sO rare,
thotigh we stili perejet i caihing it common.
sfon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I confese that I ar n ot very much
moved by the appeal of my honourable friend.
He thinke that six months je a sufficient liength
of time for the stgte to make up ita mind as
to a probable offence committed by a ratepayer of this country. He knowe that during
the past five or six years, in the case of hie
own returna, as in the case of my return, the
Departrnent lias gone beyond the six monthe;
censequently hie lias the very experience which
ehould dictate hie judgrnent in weighing the
cause for thie Bill. If the Departrnent, receiving tene of thousande of returne during
the rnonth of May, can only investigate somewhat z-apidly the -figures contained in those
returns, in order to corne to a conclusion as
to whether or flot the returne are bona fide,
how mucli longer ehould it be given ta determine doubtfui cases? Most of the returns
are exarnined within a certain nuxnber of
menths, based on returns that have been
made in previaus yeare, and teeted; but a certain numnber of returne are left aside for dloser
scrutiny and greatêr consideration, which requires more than six menthe. If an offence
has been comrnitted, it je flot commritted upon
the c4ay jt je found out, but on the day when
the return was made; so it can only be discovere4 after six menths or a year. Wiii my

because the Department had been unable,
within six months, to find sufficient evidence
to proceed against the offenders? My honourable friend asks, "Why three years?'" Well,
what delay does he suggest? If he says six
months, he bas arbitrarily fixed that period,
and how much greater is the common sense in
six months than in nine or twelve months?
The Department says three years. Perhaps
the Department is somewhat liberal in the
time that it gives, yet it bas as a precedent
the practice of the Mother Country, which bas
fixed six years. I am not wedded to the three
years. If the consensus of opinion in this
Chamber is that two years would be ample, in
Committee we'will say two years. But I believe the principle contained in the first section of the Bill is a good one. It was two
years before, and that was fixed by the legal
experts of the Department of National
Revenue.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Will the honourable
gentleman quote the section of the Income
War Tax Act making it two years?
I will do that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
in a moment. If it were two years up to the
revision of the statutes, why net return to
the two years? Of course it will still be an
arbitrary figure, but all delays fixed represent
a certain arbitrary element.
In answer to the question of my honourable friend, here is the statement which bas
been put into my hands, and which I summarized when I arose for the first time. This
is more precise, and perhaps a little more
technical, than my remarks. Section 80 of
the Income War Tax Act provides:
Any person making a false statement in any
return or in any information required by the
Minister. shall be liable on summary conviction
to a pena1ty not exeeeding ten thousand dollars
or to six nonths' imprisonment, or to both fine
and imnpi'isonmxent.
This is the present Act. Under the summary convictions part of the Criminal Code,
Section 1142, it is provided:
In the case of any offence punishable on

of the offence, and therefore the six months
runs from the date when the offence was
completed, that is, the time of the filing of
the return.
Realizing that a person bas the privilege
of paying his tax by four instalments at bimonthly periods, it is six months from the
date of filhing the return before an assessment notice is issued. This is not to say that
assessment notices cannot be made up, but
the six months' period is used more particularly to clean up the past year's work and
special matters. In any event, it is obvious
that the large volume of returns that must
be surveyed, valued and investigated precludes discovery of fraud before the six
moniths have elapsed.
the adoption of the Revised
Prier t
Statutes of Canada, 1927, it was provided in
the Inland Revenue Act, Revised Statutes of
Canada, Chapter 51, 1906, section 135:
Any information or complaint with respect to
any offence against the provisions of this Act
or any other law relating to inland revenue
may, whenever the prosecution, suit or proceeding is instituted under Part XV (suimary
conviction) of the Criminal Code. be laid or
made within two years of the time -when the
matter af the information or complaint arose.

"Any other law relating to inland revenue"
I emphasized a moment ago-was
-which
broad enough to include income tax, and an
action might have been brought within two
years of the filing of a false return were it not
for the fact that in the 1927 Statutes of Canada the Inland Revenue Act was changed and
called the Excise Act and section 130, instead of using the phrase "any other law
relating to inland revenue" uses the phrase
"any other law relating to excise". Income Tax
is not an excise tax, therefore the two year
period is now excluded, and the Department
is thrown back on the six months' provision
in the summary conviction part of the
Criminal Code.
In England they have, among other provisions, the following

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

MAY 22, 1928
The limitation for bringing ian action under
this section was a.t one time three years, but
it was enacted by the Finance Act of 1923
that the time shall be six years.
Under the Criminal Code it seems that an
action might be brought under Section 404,
reilating to faIee pretences; but i is considered that that would be of doubtil effect.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: It would not be the
obtaindng of something; it would be the
avoiding of paying.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The reason
which ia given I wilH state to my honourable
friend, who can easily make diitinctions and
see the force of the argument. "False pretences" is a representation, either by words
or otherwise, of a matter or fact, either past
or present, which representation is known to
the person making it to be false, and which
is made with fraudulent intent to induce the
person to whom it is made to act upon such
representations.
This section comes under Part VII of the
Code relating to offences against rights of
property, and rights arising out of contracte,
and offences connected with tmde, and subsections 2 and 3 of the same section provide:
(2) Extraordinary commendation or depreciation of the quality of anything is not false
pretence unless it is carried to such an extent
as to amount to a fraudulent mis-representation
of fact.
(3) It is a question of fact whether such
commendation or depreciation does or does not
amount to a fraudulent mis-representation of
fact.
From this it will be observed that while an
action might be sustained, the Code does
not lend itself in that direct manner which is
desirable for prosecution in revenue matters.
Section 407 (a) of the Code, relating to
false statements in writing, is not appicable
to a false statement in an income tax retaurn,
inasmuch as it is not "for the purpose of procuring, in any forn whatsoever, either the
delivery of personal property, the payment
of cash, the making of a hoan or granting the
extension of a credit, the discounting of accounts receivable or 'the making, acceptance,
discounting or endorsement of a bill of exchange, cheque, draft or promissory note.
Nor does that part of the Criminal Code
relating to .the falsification of books of accou-nt
aid, inasmuch as the books miay be correct
but the return itself is false.
In the result, therefore, it seems advisable
to amend Section 80 of The Income War Tax
Act by adding thereto the following:
(2) Any information or complaint with
respect to any offence against the provisions
of this section, whenever the prosecution, suit
or proceeding is instituted under the provisions

593

of the Criminal Code relating to summary convictions, may be laid or made within three
years from the time when the matter of the
information or complaint arose.
2. This Act shall be deemed to have come
into force on the first day of January, one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, so that,
notwithstanding any other provision relating
to the prosecution of offences, any offence
against the provisions of section eighty of the
Income War Tax Act committed after the first
day of January, one thousand nine hundred and
twenty-six, shall be punishable within three
years from the time when the matter of the
information or complaint arose.
Ncw, I hope I have made a case in favour
of extending the delay froin six months, as it
is to-day, to two or three years. Two years
was the date, according to this opinion of the
Depattment, which was fixed prior to the
Revised Statutes, and I have no objection to
returning t'o two years if it is the wi of the
majority of the Senate.
Hon. ,Mr. LAFLAMME: How about making a case to justify the retroactive character
of this legislation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am just comning to that. The public-and when I speak
of the public I mean the ratepayer--has
known, or is supposed to have known, because we are ail supposed to know the law,
that since the law has been in existénce ordering him to make a return, he can be prosecuted for making a false return within twentyfour months following the return which he
makes.
Since then we have had the Revised
Statutes of Canada, which seem to have somewhat blurred the judgment of the general
public, represented by the ratepayer. But
he has been making his returns for six or seven
years. If we do not cover the time that was
fixed before the Revised Statutes altered the
law, there will be a section of the ratepayers
freed from any responsibility for filing a false
return. It will be for the Senate to decide
whether we should not maintain the law, with
its full effect uniformly upon all the ratepayers
who have from year to year made their
returns; because the Revised Statutes having
last year altered the law, and reduced to six
months the date during which the Department
can sue for a false return, a certain number of
men who have made false returns and committed the offence may go free, while those
who will make their return henceforth will
fall under this law and may be prosecuted
during the following 24 months.
I am not specially in accord with retroactive
legislation in penal offences, but it seems to
me that this Act has provided a penalty,
which commends itself, if the opinion which I
have is the correct one, as I believe it is.

DEPARTMENT 0F NATIONAL
REVENUE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 291, an Act Vo amend the
Department of National Revenue Act.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
you will remember that when this Bill passed
its second reading it was not considered in
Committee of the Whole flouse, but was
sent Vo the Committee on Banking and Commerce. In that Committee we heard the
officiaIs of the Department. For myseif I was
satisfied that they made out a good case for
what is proposed in this Bill. There is no
doubt that they require men of such a class
that they will probahly have Vo indicate,
themselves, exactly what they want in the
way of appraisers and other offleers, who
would seem Vo require special qualifications if
they are Vo do their work promptly and well.
0f course, this is an inroad on the Civil
Service Act, and, as I think I said the other
day, there is Êastrong feeling in the country
against any invasion, or at ahl events any
unnecessary invasion, of that Act. A great
many people are jealous of the Civil Service
Act. I arn noV sure that every persn in the
country attaches Vo it exactly the same value,
but there is no doubt that some people have
that Act very much at heart. Whi]e I recognize that the officiaIs have made out a
5610"815

very good case in asking for this legislation,
and I offer no objection to it, yet I think it
is our duty to give to the people of this
country ail the assurance that we can that
the Civil Service Act will flot he unfiecessarily
invaded, and that ail due preeautions will be
taken against the introduction of* the
patronage system ini so far as the present
measure is an invasion of the Civil Service
Act. Therefore I suggest to the flouse an
amendment, or rather an addition Vo the
Bill, which I think wil probably give satisfaction to some, ait least, of the honourable
members of this flouse and to a great many
people in the country.
Honourable gentlemen understand that
under this Bill, when the Board of Appraisers
have examined candidates and have decided
for themselves who are competent and desirable, they send their names Vo the Civil
Service Commission, and if at the end of
fifteen days the Civil Service Commission
have noV acquiesced in the selections, then the
appointments are made by Order in Council.
Now, it is with regard to appointments made
bY Order in Council, apparently overruling
the Civil Service Commission, that I suggest
that this clause be added to the Bill, which
would otherwise be left exactly as it stands:
The Minister shall annually lay before both
Houses of Parliament within two weeks of the
opening of the Session, a return giving the
names of the persons appointed under this Act
by Order in Council, also the time for which
theY are appointed and their salaries, and the
class of work for which they are appointed.
and their previous occupation.
That will isolate these appointments by
Order in Council and will give those people
whose hearts are set upon the Civil Service
Act very clear information as to what is
being done, and give them an opportunity
for criticism if they choose to, make it. It
will also keep this matter as a live issue
before the two flouses, and if there is any
abuse it will be almost certain to come up
in connection with that return every year.
That is ail I wish to say ini the matter. I
hope ýmy honourable friend will accept this
addition to his Bill, hecause, if he does, he
has the Bill passed exactly as he wishes it.
Hlou, Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes. There are t.hree
classes of officers under the Bill, and this
amendment covers ail three.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I wonder if it is
desira;ble, in the case of preventive officers,
to announce who they are.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear. Why
does the honourable gentleman (Hon. W. B.
Ross) not restrict it to the appraisers?
If
you announce who your detectives are, they
will be detectives no longer.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
It may be announced in the papers who they are.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Those names appear,
though probably in an isolated way, in the
Auditor General's Report.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I am referring
only to preventive officers-detectives and other
officers performing secret service.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: This amendment covers
those three classes in regard to whose appointment there is an inroad on the Civil
Service Act. We want to give the friends
of the Civil Service Act some assurance that
a good, sharp watch will he kept upon these
appointments, and that there shall net be
any unnecessary invasion of the Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I wonder if I have
made myself clear to my honourable friend.
I doubt it. What I am suggesting is that
the naines of the detectives or preventive
officers should not be officially published.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Why not?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What ny honourable friend says with regard to the other
classes is quite truc, and I approve of that.
I am only making this distinction with regard
to the preventive officers. I do net think it
is in the interest of the Service that the
names of those dctectives should be known
everywhere.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I can understand why a
preventive officer should not be named in a
particular case, ýbut I cannot see that giving
tie name and the salary of a preventive
officer would be more objectionable than
giving the name and the salary of anyone
else.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, there does not appear
to me to be any reason why the preventive
officers should net come under this amendment. Every preventive officer must be appointed by Order in Council. You cannot
keep the appointment to an office of that
kind secret. In fact I think aill officers appointed by Order in Council have to be
gazetted. Anyway, in tihe district for whieh

act, every mother's son who is interested in
that branch of the Preventive Service will
know that John Jones, or whoever lie may
bh, has been appointed a preventive officer.
So there does net seem to be any practical
gain by leaving that class of officer out.
I am very glad that the amendment has
been accepted by my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand). :I am one of those who
believe in the Civil Service Act, and I should
be very loathe to see it gradually pared away
in the interest of patronage seekers and
patronage vendors. I think the Government
would take a great responsibility on itself if
it showed any disposition along that line. This
amendment brings the matter gup so that each
year the House of Commons and the Senate
may review the circumstances of the appointment, and, as the powers of Parliament are
not taken away, if the Government has abused
its powers it will be an easy matter to revert
to legislation which will bring the matter
right. I am very loathe to believe that the
present Government is not favourable to appointment and promotion by merit in the
Civil Service of Canada, and I sincerely hope
that it will not commit the unpardonable sin
of taking away the virtue of that Act cven
to a small degree.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I would like to support this proposition,
as much for the benefit of the Minister of the
Department as for any other reason. I happen
to have observed the name of one of the preventive officers appointed in the province of
Nova Scotia. Inquiry was made in another
place, and the particulars were brought down,
but I read the facts in a Nova Scotia newspaper. I happen to have known the man in
question for twenty-five or thirty years. I
know that he has none of the qualifications
for the work of a preventive officer. I am
firmly convinced that if the Minister in
charge of the department knew the man, knew
his history, his incapacity, and his absolute
unscrupulousness. he would never have appointed him. I feel sure that, in the language
of the street. some one has "put it over" the
Minister in regard to that particular appointee.
This man must now be well up in years, say
between sixty and seventy years of age.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He is a mere
youth.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: He may be in his
youth, but I would like to see the Minister
and the Department, in the appointment of
those men, select such as could bo depended
upon to enforce tlie law; mon of character,

MAY 23, 1928
men of standing, men who will be respected
and who will do good service for the Department.,
This illustration that I have given the House
is the very opposite of the ideal. I arn saying
it nlot because the gentleman is of the sarne
political persuasion as the Governinent, but
because of my personal acquaintance with
and knowledge of him and bis manner of
living, and ail the details that go towards
making a man effective or ineffective in this
work. I therefore think that it would be well
for the Departinent itself to subinit t.he naines
at the beginning of every session to both
buses of Parliarnent, so that persons might
be known nlot oniy here, but in their own
]ocality.
I feel sure that once the facts are brought
home te the Minister in respect to the man
I have rnentioned, he wiil do what the Liberai
Governinent in Nova Scotia did with humfor hie wa~s foîsted on themn for a while. They
dropped hum: they found out he was no good
there. If the Minister of National Revenue
wi'll personally inquire about this man-I do
not want himi to corne to me, he can go to
other people who know-1 arn sure he wil
reach the conclusion that bis own Department is not at ýaIl strengthened by appointing
such persons.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourabie gentlemen, there is an oid saying, as old as the his,
that when you want te appoint detectives you
do not pick them eut of a religious congregatien; and there is another old saying that it
takes a thief to catch a thief.
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAN,'D: 0f course, I take
that oid saying with a grain of sait. I hope
that the honourable gentleman does not find it
in bis Bible, at ail events.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The trouble with this
man is that hle is too, lazy to catch anybody.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether my honourable friend has given a
sufficiently minute description of the individuai to enable the Minister to put his
finger on the naine of this person, but I wii
gladly transinit the remarks of my honourable
friend to the Mînister of National Revenue.
I think that hie is as intent upon having a
good body of officers and employees as any
Minister who has ever been in that department.
I have said that I accepted the arnendinent.
If there is anything in the criticism, made by
rny honourabIe friend, the senior meinher for
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), the Minister
wiil have an opportunity to say se when the
Bill reaches the House of Cominons.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Here they are.
Honourable
Mr. ROBERTSON:
Hon.
gentermen, I think it is a matter of sincere
regret to al members of this House that
provision was not made for greater gallery
space when this building was erected. The
need for greater space is apparent; but it
is a question of grave importance what the
effect will be if the galieries of the House
are altered as indicated in the Committee's
The acoustic properties of the
report.
Chamber are none too good at present, and
they might be very seriously impaired. Are
we justified in running that risk, and in expending $100,000 or upwards in order to accommodate a few more people at the opening
and the closing of Parliament?
May I inquire of my honourable friend
who leads the Government to-night (Hon.
flMr.
Hon.

WILLOUGHBY.

Mr. Belcourt) whether or net the adoption
of this report at this time will make any
material difference in the situation? I understand that the Supplementary Estirmates have
been brought down in the House of Cemmons, and that they contain no item for this
purpose. Might it not be as wel1 te withhold definite decision on this matter until
another Session, in order to ascertain with
sorne certainty what effect the changes would
have on the acoustic properties of the

Chamber?
that after the expenditure of $100,000 or more
on the renovation af the Chamber, conditions
were stili unsatisfactory. As it is, owing to
the difficuýlty of hearing, we have had te
close one of the galleries. If we were to
open up the two aides we might find ourselves in a very unfortunate position, and as
the adoption or non-adoption of the report at
this time would not seem to alter the situation, I fail to see what advantage is to be
gained by dealing with the report now.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Perhaps my honourable friend was not in the House when I
brought in the report and commented upon it.
I think the opinions expressed by Mr. Pearson and the architect of the Depa'rtinent of
Public Works, both of whorn supported the
proposed change should relieve my honourable
friend's apprehension. I may say that when
Mr. Pearson appeared before the Committee
he asked to be given a couple of wecks to
consider the matter and to prepare a plan,
if ho approved of the change. T'wo weeks
later he appeared again and stated definitely
that the alterations would very considerably
improve the appearance of this Chamber as
well as its acoustic prosperties and ventilation. This opinion was concurred in by the
Chief Architect of the Departiment of Public
Works, who, with the Deputy Minister. appeared before us on three occasions. The Committee, so far as possible, ascertained that the
change would be beneficial in the three respects that I have mentioned and was
unanimous in recommending it.
With regard to the other point raised by
imy honourable friend, I am net without hope
that if the House recoimends the change an
item will be placed in the Estimates which
will enable the work to be donc this year.
I am very strongly of the opinion that the
Committee, after deliberating so long, and
after having gone into the matter so thoroughly, is in possession of all the information
we could hope to get this year or next year
or at any time as to the advisability of the
change.
I think we are all capable of visualizing
what is intended, from the architectural point

MAY 28, 192M6
of view, and I think we will agree, that it
will improve the appearance of the Chamber.
Honourable gentlemen will rernember that a
Cornmittee almost identical with the present
one sat last year and gave this rnatter consideration, but that nothing was done because
the report was discussed, as it is Seing discussed Vo-day, almost, in sight of prorogation.
I have spoken three times on this rnat>ter,
and I confess that I feel as though Lt were
abusing rny privileges. I should lilce to hear
sorne of the members of the Committee expres their views.
Hon. G. G. POSTER: Honourable, gentlemen, 1 was net a member of -the Committee,
but laist year when the matter first came Up,
because at that time 1 wa.s inclined te believe
that it was not advisable Vo make the expenditure that would be involved, I folllowed
the work of the 'Com.mittee very cloeely. The
Cernmittee held several sitstings; the :architect
was present twice, and he was subjected Vo
examination and cross-exarnination. AV first
he did not appear Vo be friend-ly to the
scheme, and asked for two wtekcs' delay to
consider it, at the end of which time he
brought in a report stating without qualification that the alterations would Se' of advantage from every standpoint. I do not think
anything is Vo be gained by delay. The Chairman of the Committee will remember that
at the conclusion of the Cornmittee meetings
I said Vo Mr. Hunter: "Are You quite sure
that we can get the rnoney this year?" and
that he said: "Yes, that is a matter of routine
that can be put through even in these last
days of the Session." I thinJk that the opinion
of Mr. Hunter and of the architeet, Mr.
Pearson, should guide us, and 1 arn going to
vote for the adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Honourable gentlemen, a.s a inember of the Committee, I arn
quite in accord with what the honouralble gentleman from Alma (Hon. *G.G. Foster) has
just said. Last year the architect was opposed
to any change, 'because he thought that it
would affect the acoustios of the Chamber, and
that in a general way it would 'be a mistake
to alter anything. However, ha went away
to Toronto and worked eut a scherne, and
he carne back very strongly in faveur of the
proposai. He said the alterations would be
in keeping wi'th the Chamber as it is at
present, nnd that if -they affected the acoustics
at aIl, it would be Vo improve Vhern. His
idea is that the curtains of the gallery which
is at present in use will be Ilowered in ordinary
times, in the sarne way as those aboya the
Speaker's Chair, and that the new galleries
will be open to the public.

I wish to make it quite clear that at your
suggestion and at your desire the Committee
went into this matter very ca.refully. We do
not wish te put through the alterations; we
leave the matter entirely in y'our bande. We
are in faveur of what has been proposed,
but are nlot pressing in the slightet degree
for the adoption of the report; and whatever rnay be your decision we will abide by
it heartily. Peraonally I arn of the opinion
that the Chamber is too small, and that these
alterations wlll greatly improve it. For these
reasons I arn in favour of the report.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: HonoiMrable gentlemen,
while I arn noV a member of the Committee,
I have had a great deal to do with building
construction, and 1 may say that I have never
been sati@fied with this Chamber. 1 have always been of the opinion that it wae an ugly,
homely thing. I thin-k aide galleries would
add wonderfully Vo its appearance and would
rnake it very rnuch more convenient not only
for oursgelvee but for those who corne here,
especially the ladies. I arn quite sure the
change would flot injure the acoustie properties; that, if anything, it would impreve
thein. Therefore, I think the workc should be
done.
Honourable
Hon. SMEATON WHIITE:
gentlemen, I would like Vo support the motion of the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt). I confirm. what the
members of the Cornrittee have said about
the interviews witb the architect. When these
galleries axe built they will correspond very
rnuch better than the present plan with the
upper section of the waJl, where the windows
are. The original idea of the arehitect was
that there should be mural paintings; but
apparently that scheme fell through. Even
now, wit-h the paintings that we have on the
walls, the Chamber looks unfinished, and iu
my opinion the proposed alterations will
make this a very much handsomer Chamber.
With regard to the acoustic properties, both
the architc.ct and the Department of Publie
Works a.ssured, us that they would certainly
be no worse than at present, and that they
would probably be better.
Hon. Mr. SCHAF'FNER: I arn not a mernber of the Committee, but I have been very
much disappointed with this Chamber ever
since it was built. The on'ly regret that I
have is that anything was referred Vo the
architect of the building. When the scaffoids
were in this Chamber I told him I Vhought
a mistake was being made, that the Chamber was too small, and that Vo me it had
the appearance of a box. He assured me t-hat

SENATE
once the scaffolds were removed the Chamber would be satisfactory. That has not been
the case.
While I had not the honour of sitting in
the old Senate Chamber, my uncle, R. W.
Stephens, who is well known to many of the
older Senators, frequently invited me here;
and I must say that it had upon me a very
pleasing effect. He was a man who expressed
bis pride in such things, and he was very
proud of the old Chamber.
I am very strongly in favour of the report
of the Committee, and shall be very much
disappointed if it is not adopted. Some say,
and perhaps there is a degree of sense in it,
that the expense involved for one day's
ceremony at the opening of Parliament is very
considerable. Personally I do not consider
that at all; I look upon this Chamber as something which we should take a pride in showing
to our friends who come here during the
Session. I am in accord with the opinions
expressed by the honourable gentleman from
Alma (Hon. G. G. Foster) and the honourable
gentleman from Amherst (Hon. Mr. Curry),
the latter of whom, as we all know, bas had
perhaps as much experience in the erection of
buildings as any man in Canada. I was glad
to hear him express himself as he did.
There is another point. Those who sit on
this side of the House are subjected to inconvenience and ill heailth because of drafts.
It is only a matter of time when my honourable friends opposite will be sitting here, and
I have too much good will and too much
affection for them to submit them to such
conditions. I have spoken of this matter not
only to the present Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod, but also to the late lamented Mr.
Chambers, who tried bis very best in every
way to improve the drafts.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Can you improve a draft?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I mean a draft
in the strict sense of the term, blowing on
one's head. Some of us have not as much
hair as we used to have, and a draft is
detrimental to the health.
Furthermore, the ventilation of this Chamber
is not what it should be. If yau go outside
for a while and return, you will realize that.
I do not know why the architect made so
many mistakes, not only in the matter of
ventilation, but with regard to the acoustics.
I think the members of this House will agree
with me that there is scarcely a Committee
room in the building, however small, where
the acoustics are what they should be. As I
say, I shall be very much disappointed if this
report is not adopted, and I hope honourable
gentlemen will agree to its adoption now. The
Hon.

Mr. SCHAFFNER.

Government is not so very carefu-l in its
expenditures to beautify Ottawa that it should
hesitate in this; and surely it should have
first consideration with us, as the two Chambers
of this Parliament should have had with the
architect. He should have considered first the
space required for the two Chambers, and
shoulid have filled in the rest of the building
afterwards. It does seem to me that he
started over on the west side and filled in,
and then he came over here with what he had
left and he said, "Oh, I will make the Senate
Chamber out of that." I hope the members
will adopt this report.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen, I am not on this committee, and I have
not had the pleasure of reading over the report, but I must say that I do not like to see
what I consider a beautiful chamber being interfered with. I particulardy object on the
score of e:pense, for the people of this country are groaning under taxation, and here we
are advocating the spending of a substantial
sum of money to beautify this room.
So far as the ventilation is concerned, although I must say that, sitting where I am,
I have never experienced any draught, I
would be glad to see an improvement, and
would favour anything being done in that
direction if it did not coat the country a
large sum. As to the matter of providing for
a few people more or less, for the opening of
Parliament, I do not consider that signifies
at ail, because no matter how much is expended on galleries, there wil be some who
cannot be aocommodated, much as they would
like to attend those ceremonies.
I am sorry that I must expose my ignorance as to architecture. Coming from the
country as I do, I may nat know the difference between good and bad architecture, but
I must say that this Chamber appeals to me
as being a beautiful room.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Almost as good as a
lumber camp.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, and I remember
many times in a lumber camp there were
offices of our own where the atmosphere and
heating were not as good.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And the language was bad.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: And yet we were
satisfied. because it wauld, have been necessary
to spend our own money to improve matters.
It appears to me that too many people are
embarking on an orgy of expenditure, but the
time will come when we shaU libe sorry for it.
I do not believe that the people of this coun-

MAY 28, 1928
try wiil look with faveur upon our House
urging the Government to make an expenditure of this nature upon a room which. is s0
littie used by the public. I must say I feel
quite strongly on this point, and I would be
very sorry indeed to see any sum of money
spent upon thia Chamber other than what is
necessary in order to prevent the draft on the
heads of somne of my honaurable friends.

should rather look aftar the conservation of

important to sava $100,000 as it is to save
Si .00,0)00.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentleman, I do flot want to give a silent vote on
this matter, but 1 do flot wish to take up the
tima of the House. It appears to me that
this mattar bas had an avolution. My recollaction is that whan the changes in this Chambar ware baing discussad the chief ground of
complaint was the width of the Chamber
itself; that the floor was flot sufficiently
commodious for the ceremenias of the opening and closing of Parliament. I think that
wvas the whole ground-work of the criticism of
the Chamber, and very properly so. Now,
howaver, that bas been abandonad, and we
ara going up higbar, to the construction of
gallaries, wbich is an cntirely diffarent affair,
as I understand it.
Most of the arguments which have bean
addressad to honourable gentleman to-nighit
appear to ha against this movement. One
honourable gentleman bas very correctly
stated that there is hardly a committea room
in this building whicb bas proper aeoustics.
That is one fact. We know that the acousties
and the ventilation in tbis Chamber ara far
from satisfactory. We have there an illustrieus exampla of how a gallery should flot ha
plannecl or built, and wve have hera a still
more illustrious example.
_Now, who is responsibla for all thasa things?
Who are the men who planned this abortive
gallery? WTho provided us with this daficient
and unsatisfactory ventilation? And who made
the committea rooms, in whicb ona can hardly
hiear bis own voice? As I understand it, thcy
are the very people whose advice is now being
taken, and upon whose advica we are asked
to procead; the very gentlemen whose work
sj>eaks for itsolf, and cortainly ducs net spaak
in recommandation.
Now, honourable gentleman. are wve going
te procaed on this axpenditure?
I would
like te sea the Chamber improved, but are wa
going te plunge blindfold into an expanditure
for the construction of gallaries on the faith
of the statamant of gentleman who bave
utterly failed in the past? If wa are going
te make the expanditura, ]et us go te soebody who knows something about ventilation,
and something about acousties. Suraly thare
is somebody in Amcrica; if net, thare is soeoue in Great Britain, or on the Continent.
We brought a man alI the wvay from Enghind

to look over the Hudson Bay port. Why can
we not bring a man from England to look
over the acoustics of this building, before we

undertake to spend

S100,000

more in making

galleries in which a faw people will be eooped,
and only ten per cent of them will be able to

to hear or see anything?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Honourable gentlemen, I have spoken so oftan in another place
and elsewhere about the construction of this
whole building, and the monumental botch
that was made of it, that I do flot intend
to go into the general subject this evaning
beyond making a few observations in connection with this report now before the
House.
Like other honourahie gentleman Who have
spoken, I was not a mamber of the Committee which has brought in this report, and lika
those honourable gentleman, and others who
have flot spoken, 1 feel it would be unganerous on our part, when we did not have an
opportunity of hearing what was adduced before the Committee, to oppose the report
brought in after long and earnest consideration. However, as the lawyers in this Chamber and elsawhere know, many a sound judgment of a court is destroyed by the reasons
given in support of it. Very often a judgruent would: stand more securely if nu resns
werc stated. Now, the situation with regard
to this report is somewhat in the same class.
I am flot impressed, as was the honourabla
gentleman from Amherst (Hon. Mr. Curry),
by the arguments advanced in favour of
adopting the report. The report may be ail
right in itself; I am flot at the moment expressing any opinion as to that; but 1 would
lika to put a question to the honourable
gentleman from Amherst, who very correctly
told us that be had been engaged in the
erection of large, manufactu-rine, establishments and wvas t1horoughly familiar wvith their
construction. If the architect of ene of those
establishments presented him with an estimnate of cost, stated to be $5,500,000 and certified to that estimate, yet, when the work
wvas not fullv completed, hae found that he
had paid out about $13,000,000 would my
honourabla friand place very great reliance on
another opinion expressed by that same architect? I think I can answer without asking
my bonourable friand to do so. He would
flot.
Now, that is precisely what wa are asked
to do to-night. I would not have any objection to the report, nor do I say that I will

603

MAY 28, 1928
not support it; but I do venture to say that
the estimate that has been given of the cost
of these dhanges will be doubled and trebled
if the work is carried oult.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is wel-known
that when you begin to pull a building to
pieces you never know where you are going
to stop, or where the expenditure will stop. I
believe that the objections that have been
raised as to the length and height and
marrowness of this room, its lack of architectural attractiveness, or of appropriateness for
the opening and closing ceremonies of Pariament, will have just as much force if four portilons of these walls are removed on each side
of the chamber, and galleries erected in their
places. There will be a few addiitional seats,
and my honourable friend expressed the
opinion-so did my honourable friend from
New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. Black)-that the
cost per seat would be greaiter than the House
should approve or the country would endorse.
Well, that is a matter of opinion, in regard te
which I do not express mine at the moment.
But I was very muah impressed by a suggestion
made, when this matter came up at an earlier
stage of this Session, by my honourable friend
from Alma (Hon. G. G. Foster), who then
suggested that in order that expense might
be avoided, the other chamber, the House of
Commons, should be used instead of this
Chamber for the function at the Opening of
Parliament, inasmuch as the lack of gallery
acenmodation here was felt chiefly, if not
solely, upon that day.
These are considerations I would like to
place before the Chamber. As I say, not
having been a member of the Committee and
net having followed its deliberations, I feel
that it would be rather an ungenerous thing
to oppose its report, but at the same time
what I have advaniced, I respectfully submit
shoudld be taken into account particularly if
honourable gentlemen have regard for the
expenditure that will undoubtedly be involved,
just as the excess over the estimate on the
construotion of the building was involved
when the architects were given carte blache
and allowed to go ahead on the cost-plus
basis. This willl be another cost-plus job.
Hon. J. S. MoLENNAN: Honourable
gentlemen, may I take one moment to say
that I think some of the criticisms of the
architect of the building have been a little
severe. Most of us have built more or less
humble bouses and have found when we got
them completed that we could have improved
them. I think ithat this building, in its main
aspects, is extremely successful. People who

have seen buildings of aIl kinds, alI over the
wotld, and who have visited this building,
have been impressed by it, and some of those
who know best and have seen most feel that
there has been a touch of genius in the way in
which the arohiteot bas worked out the problems that were before him. There is no
question, however, that this Chamber is not
as good as the old one was, or as we hoped
that this would be; and I am bound to say
that, notwithstanding the assurance of the
architect or anyone else, I am skeptical that
gallieries built in the way proposed would be
successful. I am heartily in support of what
my honourable friend from Mma (Hon. G. G.
Foster) and my honourable friend on the
other side of the House (Hon. Mr. Murphy)
have suggested as an alternative to the spending of this money, namely, that the Commons
should be asked to lend us their Chamber for
one day in the year and we shouild utilize
that Chamber insead of ours. We all know
that, whatever degree of accuracy there may
be about estimates made before a building is
tarted, no contracter is willing to give anything but the roughest kind of estimate when
it comes to breaking into work which already
exists, and such alterations are bound to cost
a great deal. I do not know whether I will
vote for or against concurrence in the report,
but II think that these matters might al te
taken into serinus ounsideration
The motion of Hon. Mr. Beloourt was negatived: contents, 13; non-contents, 35.

INQUIRY WITHDRAWN

On the Notice of Inquiry:
By Hon. Mr. Michener:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the question of the exportation of natural
gas from the province of Alberta to the United
States, and will inquire of the Government
what is their policy with regard thereto.
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: Honourable gentlemen, having received the information that I

The inquiry was withdrawn.
NAVIGATION OF WELLAND CANAL
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION
Hon. J. B. P. CASGRAIN rose in accordance

with the following notice:
That he will call th'e attention of the Senate
at its next sitting to the navigation of the new
Welland Canal, and enquire from the Government:1. Has there been a consultation between the
engineers and the marine officers of the Government or the captains whose vessels may

navigate the new Welland Canal as to the
method of operation?

the sourthern part of Ontario were, on the
contrary, very much in favour of an enlarged

Welland Canal, giving free access to large
ships from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.
In
order to give a decent, first-class funeral to
the Georgian Bay project, the Government of
Right Hon. R. L. Borden appointed a Commission.
That is the finest burial that any
project can have.
To that Commission, if
my memory serves me aright, the Government
appointed Mr. Evans, who had been at one
time Mayor of Winnipeg;
also Colonel

Meighen, of Montreal, and Mr. Gohier, of St.
Laurent. They were all first-class navigators,
but I do not suppose there were the ones
who decided this question of navigation.

In

those days, as to-day, all the interesting questions of navigation seem to be decided by
people who have themselves never gone to
sea and could not scull a boat across a creek.
However, this Commission for years made no
report, or, if they made a report, it was

absolutely of no use, because in the meantime the voice of Ontario had been heard
and the enlargement of the Welland Canal

had been decided upon. We have been discussing often this Session the question of estimated cost.* The cost estimated by the
engineers was $30,000,000, but up to date,
though the Canal is far from finished, the
cost has reached $115,000,000.

With regard to the use of canals it must be

However, the Welland Canal is being built
and will be completed, it is said. in a couple
of years. There is a question in the minds
of many ship-owners whether, when that
canal is opened, big ships will use it. We
shall judge by the results, and we shall not
have very long to wait. Perhaps some of us
will still be alive when it is found out that
that is not a very advantageous development.
The particular purpose in my inquiry, and
in my desire t draw the attention of the
House to this matter, is te ascertain the
manner in which the canal is to be operated.
I am informed by mariners, sea captains, and
so on, that they would not dare, in moving
one of those large steamers from one lock into
another, to put on steam. That is the information I have. At Sault Ste. Marie, of
course, it is all very well to do so, because
there is only one lock there. The ship approaches it slowly, comes to a standstill and
then enters. It does not have to proceed to
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

another lock, and the vessel is perfectly safe
in putting on steam when moving out of the
lock. But in the Welland Canal some means
must be devised for handling those huge ships
that are expected to use this canal. They
would have to be warped from one lock to
the other-if honourable gentlemen know
what that expression means. In the Panama
Canal, in the case of a ship more than 500
feet in length, eight big locomotives are
employed, four on each side, to keep the
ship steady and prevent her from gaining any
more momentum than is necessary. When a
ship is less than 500 feet long four locomotives
only are used.
By the way, we discussed the other day the
question of the tolls that were paid. I have
here a pamphlet of the Panama Canal, giving
a great deal of information on this subject.
Suffice it to say that the toll is based on
the registered net tonnage, which is calculated
at the rate of 100 cubic feet per ton, as we
all know now, having examined this question
since it was introduced in this louse by
the honourable gentleman from Grenville
(Hon. Mr. Reid). The charge is $1.20 per
registered net ton. Take a 10.000-ton ship:
to pass from one end of the canal to the other
it bas to pay $12,000. As an instance of
another kind of tonnage, take a man-of-war.
With the man-of-war, as you know, it is a
question of displacement. This means that if
there were a scale big enough to weigh the
ship, the tonnage would be exactly its weight.
There they charge only 50 cents a ton, because displacement is not useful tonnage, but
is the weight of the ship itself, with the
armament, etc. Then there are hospital ships,
coal carriers, etc. There again the charge
is based on the registered net tonnage, measured by the canal authorities; and I may
say that they do not accept without question
any registered net tonnage, because, as everyone knows who has had anything to do with
navigation, as the ship-owners have. to pay
dues on that, they always try to make out
the registered net tonnage to be as small as
possible. A fee is charged for the measuring
of the ship to ascertain what its tonnage is,
and it is on the finding of the canal authorities that the charge of $1.20 per registered
ton is based.
To complete what I have been saying on
the subject of rates I may mention that I
have here also the rate in the Suez Canal. It
is 7ý francs per ton, besides so much for each
passenger.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Gold francs?

MAY 29,1928
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes. There has
been no change. In the old days that rate

is no lock there, just a ditch.

The radio has now become an old story,

marvel at the invention by which the human

of miles, through all kinds of atmospheric
conditions. IRt still seems like miracle or
magic. But the message so conveyed is far
less wonderful than the medium, and it cannot be said thait through it the range of
human thought has been widened. There is a
certain drop fron the mystic to the commonplace.
I do not undervalue what has been done.

But this is a froc country, and those who like

those who prefer music. Yet making all due
allowances, I am haunted by a feeling that
much more might be donc; that there is a vast
field here whirh we have only begun to explore. I do not place the whole responsibility
for further developmeent on this or any Government, but I believe the Government might
make a substantial contribution toward the
further utilization of this marvellous device.
I am not fault-finding, but pointing out
that we have ýonly made beginning, and I do
net hope to do any more than explore the
field a little farther. What strikes me is that
the Government itself, through the Civil Service is in a position to make valuable additions to the broadcasting programmes. In
the Civil Service we have a body of scientists
who have made a study of the geography and
natural resources of Canada, who are acquainted with its lakes and rivers and mountains, its minerals, its forests, flowers and food
plants, and all its forms of animal life. Very
little of this information reaches the public.
Occasionally there does come out some story
like the discovery of new kinds of wheat,
the preservation of the buffalo herds, the exploration of new regions, the wonderful work

means of disseminating information, valuable
not only in economic sense, but also as a

to be compared with the radio, enabling us
to frame messages worthy of the medium. It
happens at this time that the Government
bas determined greatly to extend the range
of scientific research. Some at least of the
fruits of this research could be put in popular
form and carried into the homes of the people
over the air.

do anuch to enrich the content of -the radio
programmes; to give them a distinctively
Canadian character, to offer instruction and
inspiration to our people, and to make the
message more worthy of the medlium.
When we compare the wonder of the
medium, of the scientific invention, with the
unsatisfying nature of the matter conveyed,
we touch upon a characteristic of our age
which has been the subi ect of much comment.
Immense progress has been made in physical
science, less in political or economic science
and other fields of thought. The telaphone
and automobile have profoundly changed our
mode of living. But we have not evolved a
nýew philosophy of life adapted to the new
conditions. "Knowledge comes, but wisdom
lingers." I have sometimes allowed my imagination Vo range over the idea of whiat might
happen if we applied the patient methods of
physical science to economic questions and
to domestic and international politics. Consider the case of the United States. Physical
science has enormously increased the powers
of production on the farm and in the factory.
What would happen under scientific management with ald its powers, and with the immense natural resources, and a very inventive
and enterprising people? There would be an
sJbundance of food and clothing and alI the
necessities of life, and at the same time
abundant leisure for the develpoment of -body,
mind and spirit. Wha.t actually happens under
our present haphazard and unscientific
methods? What is called over-production,
resulting in the enforced idleness of from two
to four million people, together with a fever
of high-pressure salesmanship pestering people
to buy things that they do not need. Certain -people in a desperate -hurry, others with
nothing to do. Surely here is a field for
scientific research. Then, consider international relations. What cou'ld be more stupidly
unscientifie than war, leaving aside all considerations of humane sen'timent?
What is the trouble? Is it not that, while
in the physical and mechanical field there has
been soientific thinking, patient, fearless investigation, experimentation, open-mindednessl,
wiflingness to scrap old machinery and try out
new things; while these are the methods of
physical science, yet in regard to politics and
iodustrial relations and international relations, and in other fields of thought, we are
hampered by traditions and prejudices centuries old.

609

Some of us are tempted to reflect that if
we could apply the methods of science to
politics and economies and to industrial and
international relations, we might abolish war,
both international and industrial, and bring
about a world surpassing ahl that has been
written of golden ages in the past or of
utopias in the future.
But if you regard thîs as too visionary, you
may at least agree upon the advisabi-lity of
making better use of the particular achievement to which I have referred. It is said
that the Government is about Vo appoint a
commission to enquire into the radio.
Possibly the matter to which I refer might
be regarded as coming within the scope of
that enquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, although my honourable friend
has not closed his notice by a question Vo
the Government, I will make it my duty Vo
draw the attention of the Minster in charge
of that service to the very interesting remarks of the honourable gentleman for which
I am quite sure the Senate is thankful. I
would simply add a word along the line of
the thoughts which have been expressed by
my honourable frîend.
Some ten years ago I wroite Vo the Minister
of Agriculture of 'the Province of Quebec on
the difficulty of retaining young men on the
farm. I could readily sec tha-t young men
were fascinated and dýraiwn away from the
farm *by the pleasures of the city; at the
same time, it appeared to me thnit one of
the cures of the evil was to bring to tihe
rural community some of the pleasures which
are enj oyed in the town; and inasmuch as
my Province is mainly French-speaking, I
suggested to the Minister of Agriculture that
he should go across to Paris and investigate
the kind of films that werc being turned out

their use throughout the villages of thie

The 'answer that I received was

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, with the ]eave of the Senate and in a
matter that 1 consider urgent, I desire to submit to the honourable Leader of this Huse
and to the Covernment circumnstances that 1
think are of great public interest. I take it
that the members of this Chamber are united
in a desire to promote in every way immigration to Canada. I take it that we are united
in ail that it is necessary to do in order ta
induce a tide of immigration to come to this

because I believe that every portion of Canada is interested in this question of immigraHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

tion, I think it my duty to bring before the
Governmcnt through my honourable friend
the leader of this Chamber a matter which
has mome to my attention during the past f ew
hours, and in which 1 think we, as advocates
of and helievers in immigration to Canada,
are greatly interested. Seventeen or eighteen
years ago there came to Canada from England a man and his wif e, with their six boys
and two girls, one son remaining in England.
They lived, worked, and grew here until the
time of the war, when, as became proper sons
of an old English soldier, five of those young
men went overseas to fight for you and for
me. They were joined by the brother who
had remained in England, thus forming a
splendid contribution to the fighting forces
of the Empire. After the war the five brothers
came back to Montreai. and, took up in most
cases their old occupations; those who were
not able to get back their old positions taking up new ones. The oidest of those five
sons, 40 years of age, and married, is superintendent in a factory; the second, 38 years
old, has anothor good position; the third, 36
years nid, runs his own store; the fourth is
carning a living for bimself, and the fifth
occupies an important position in an insurance office in the city of Montreai. One of
the daughters is married, and the other
occupies a position in the Department of
Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved concurrence in the amendments made by a Special

absolutely replace the Canadian Naturalization
Act, which is on the Statute Book, and under
which naturalization can still be obtained.
Naturalization is granted by the State
through the instrumentality of the Secretary
of State; it is the gift of the State or of the
Crown; and the granting of a certificate of
naturalization to an alien is within the discretion of the Minister, who may, with or
without assigning any reason. either give or
withhold the certificate, whichever he thinks
conducive to the public good, and there is
no appeal from his decision. This absolute
discretion rests also with all the various states
of the Empire.
From what is the
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
honourable gentleman reading?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: An Act respecting British Nationality, Naturalization and
Aliens, Chapter 138 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada. That is the Act which is now subnitted for modification or amendment by the
Bill which is before us. I am citing section
4, which begins with these words:
The Minister inay grant a certiflcate of

As honourable gentlemen will see, the Minister may grant a certificate of naturalization
to an alien who makes application for the
purpose and satisfies the Minister that those
conditions are met, but it is ad'ded that the
granting of su'eh a certificate rests in the
absolute diseretion of the Minister.

if some objections did not, reach him, and bis
reply was that there were very f ew; flot, haifa-dozen, and perbaps only a couple.
I would ask the Under-Secretary to corne to
the floor.
My impression is that one or two letters
were sent to the Department objecting to the
name of an apphicant and the writers were
answered that their dut.y was to corne to the
Court and make their objection according to
the terms of the Act. In one or two instances
the reply was that thay did not care to go
to the Court; so that the Department was
left simply with the protest, and, as the UnderSecretary tells me, in those cases tbey put on
a double pair of spectacles to investigate them.
Now, why bave we that, state of things, that
througbout the land, .especially in the West,
where I suppose twenty applications are made
against one in the East, no one bas appeared
at, the Court to challenge any sucb application?
I would suggest that the reason is obvious; it
is a natural one--everyone feels that he should
mind bis own business, and not become involved in difficulties witb a neigbbor, or a
man residing in the samne localitv; and I
realize that it is a matter for a publie official
to investigate and decide upon, rather than
for an individual to corne openly forward and
lay down bis objections in the full ligbt of the
court bouse.
I have indicated that the proceduire enacted
under sections 22 to 27 wvas inefficient, and
useless. Now, wbat. is the value- of the inquiry
hy the .udge, who, receives the application?
He bas, or can bave, the applicant Meore him.
Honouirable gentlemen must rememnber that
the case is uncontested. Affirmations are made
in the application, and under the regulations
a specially preparad formula is provided s0
that the judge may ask for more information,
and also for the production of witnesses; but
in only very rare instances indeed duriing the
last, fourtean years have witnesses heem called.
Generally the affidavit suffices, as no one
objects to the application. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fart that the Court

adopted, but they do not go very far.
The records of Il applicants are sent to the

signed the repo7rts. Tbe Department has now
decided that thiat 'method of investigation was
crude, inefficient, and absolutely useless for
the end in view, nainely, the enligbtenmrent
of the Minister of the Department, and
therafore it bas organized i.ts own investigation from the outset. It proceeds on these
lines. It receives a copy of tbe application
from the clerks witbýin a few days after it has
been brought .to tbem. Then it makes use of
two agencies for testing the declarations of
the applicant. The application mentions the
date of the arrivaI, the name of the port of
entry, tbe railways that caried the appliýcant,
the place wbere ha livas, etc. Armed witb this
information, the Department of State applies
to the Immigration autborities for that man's
record and obtains aIl the information on file
in the Immigration Department wit.h respect

effectively by the Departanent of State, is
similar to the method dol.lowed in other parts
of the British Empire. Nowhere in the
Empire, whether in Great Britain, Australia,
South Africa or New Zealand, is there
machinery such as is contained in the present
Act, whieh, according ta the declaration. of the
Departmen.t of State, has notoriously broken
down. It is by direct control and direct
examination and investigation on the part of
the various 'Secretaries of State that the required information -is gathered in other parts
of the Empire. Our Departmnent of State is
making an effort te harmonize the Canadian
with the British practice. The Department
has been in contact with British officiais on
thîs very 'Bill. It is most desirous that the
man whom. we eall ta the high honour of becoming a British aubject shouJd nlot be a
cause of inju*ry or dishonieur ta the Canadian
naine.
Now, ivhat is the aim of this Bill? I dlaimi
for it that it increases the publicity which
was souglit ta be given under the present Act.
Notice must be gi'ven ta the publie, but it is
ta be given nlot in a place where lew ipeople
congregate, the court-house-and the fewer
who congregate tihere, the better for the
country--hut in the post office, where everyI
one goes. So in suhmitting this MIh invite
a comparison between the post office and the
court-bouse as agencies of pu'hli'city. Before
the applicant sendLs in his application ta the
Secretary of State in Ottawa hie is obliged ta
advertise in a local newspaper, according to
a formn that is prescribed, his intention of
a)pplying for na.turalization. I say that that
method of puhlicity is immensely superior ta
the only one I can find in the present Act,
the posting of the notice in the court-house.

under it a man may advertise in the English
or the French language in fa newspaper
published ini the Ruthenian language, or m'ay
advertise in the Ruthenian language ini a
newspaper published in Englieh or French?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Before rny honourable friend ;passes fr.om that question of
advertisement 'may I ask him. ta interpret
section 23?

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 0f the Bill you

I arn asking the honourable gentleman ta
interpret that clause and tell us whether
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a puzzle
or riddle easily answered.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: A crow-word.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Department
will see that the Firench language is used in
distriets where the great majority of the
people are French, and the English language
in districts where there is a great majority of
English-speaking people.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But that is not
the point. It is more serious than t-hat. Let
us assume that the case arises in a French
district and the French newispaper is ta be
used. The question I arn asking the honourable gentleman is, can the foreigner puhblish
that advertisement in the language whidh hie
himseîf speaks or in any language he likes?
The section does not make it clear whether
the advertisement itself may be printed ini
any language in a French or English newspaper, or whether if it is printed in French
or English, it may be appear in a newspapcr
published in soine other language. 1 amn just
asking this question ta find out how much the
Minister knows about it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend ham any suggestion ta make on
this score, either to the Committee or ta the
Department which, if this Bill passes, will
have ta administer the Act, I arn sure that
due wcight will be given ta bis suggestion, as
it would ta any sugges;tion that might be
made with a view ta irnproving the Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I would
draw my honourable friend'à attention ta
section 23 of the Act as it stands. Here is
the clause:
The application shaîl be delivered at the
office of the cIerk or other proper office of the
court during office bours, and sucli application
shahl be posted by sncb clerk or other proper
officer in a conspicuous place in bis office, continuously for a period of at least three months,
before the application is heard by the court.
Sa the law wills it that the posting shail
take place ut only one place, the cou-rt-bouse.

SENATE
Hon. Mr-. GORDON: That is, the Dejpartment is confined te that place, se that by

Hon. Mr. CORDON:
That is tht very
i-easse why I asked that question. In Cernmittet 1 asked tht question already hrought
up by my ýhenourable friend frein Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach). Tht clause in the
Bill reads t-hat thtse notices are to be pubiished in either tht French or tht English
language. According te my interpretation of
]t, as long as this notice is in English or in
French, it may appear in a paper using a
foreign language. I asked a question on that
point, and the UJnder-ýSecretary cf State said
that by regulation they might change that;
that they woulId net have it go out in ùhat
way. My inference was that the Departinent
wou]d sec that this should net be tht case,
and that tht notice should be published only
in papers using tht English or tht French
language.

Mr. IDANDURAND.

in the event of 50) or 100 applicatio'ns reaching a post office at the same turne, you will
generally see thein one over tht other. However, there will be in any case týhis 8uperiority
over the posting by the clerk of the court,
that wvbcn people congregate in the post office
for their letters they will see the bundie of
applications and may have the curiosity to
examine thein. Tht Secrctary of State does
not attach considerable importance to the
posting of the notice at the post office, or
the courthouse. It is flot his suggestion. This
is not bis Bill; it cornes from the Comnions.
Hie accepts it as the will of Parliament, if it
becomes law, and will act under it. 1 think
it will appea] to my honourable friýend (Hon.
Mr. Gordon). with his experience, that the
notice appearing in a local newspaper will
have far mure effeet un the people of the
neighbour-hood, who are likely to know the
applicant, than the posting of the notice at
the courthonrst. llowever, the flouse of Comimons has decided that it is a good precaution
to have the post office uised, andI it has inýtrted in tIre Bill a requirement to this effect.
This provision is now before uls. As wc are
at present in Committet., wc may strengthen
the feature of publicity in any manner we
ean devise. Com.paring the. Act with the
amending Bill, I do not hesitate to say that
the Bill is an improvement wvith regard to
publicity and efficiency. Thtre wvilýl more
be
pub]icity at the post office than there could
be at the courthouse; but I assumne that the
people interested in the applicant are the

the name of John Jones, le may go away in
disgust without reading anything. The point
I am trying to make is this-and I believe I
am right-that the Department las power by
regulation to require the posting up of a
notice of the kind which I have suggested,
and I do not see why the Department has
not been requiring it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
office?

In the post

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Either in the post
office or in the court-house.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Department would not have the necessary authority
to give orders to the postmasters throughout
the land.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am sure the Department has only to make the request.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Why have they
not authority over the postmasters who are
paid by the Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They wIll have
authority when Parliament givee them
authority, but Parliament has not given that
authority. Parliament has said thait the
application shall go Vo the clerk, of the court
who wil post it in his office. That is the
law.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Do you not think it
would be more reasonable to have te naines
put up in the manner that I suggest, nd
that then the naines would be looked over
more often.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that in a village it is quite pnoticable, but
that in cities bke Toronto or Montreal it
would be impossible, unless you were to type
lists cf the applicants and put them up
separately.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is what I would
like to see done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course new
names would have to be added to the list
every day. There is perhaps seome little
difficulty in applying the suggestion.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: WiN the honouraible gentlemen undertake to see that the
Government supplies elch country postmaster
with a typewriter in order to type that list?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. The names
are sent to the various post offices by the
Department, so the list would be typewritten
here. Of 'course additions are made oonstantly.
As to the question of delay, which, in the
minds of many, represents a safeguard under

the Act as it stands, the notice must be
posted for three months before the application
is made to the Judge. I draw attention to
the fact that under the new diause the delay
will be longer, because the sipplicant must
obtain his application, he must then fil t
out, and, according to the terme of section 23,
he must publish the notice in the newspaper
before he sends in hie application. Section 23
says:
An applicant for a certificate of naturalization under subsection 3 of section 4 of this
Act shall advertise in a newspaper published
at or nearest to his place of residence, in either
the English or French language, in the prescribed fori, his intention to apply, and shall
produce to the Minister a copy of the newspaper containing the said advertisement.
So, under this Act, the applicant muet publish
in a newspaper, in the formn required, his
intention to apply.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If the newspaper is
in a foreign language do they have to publish
the notize in either English or French?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will be for
the Department to give the various communities the greatest publicity possible, and
I suppose they will use their own judgment
and intellignce in obtaining the effect they
want.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is, they will
stick to the Act as long as -it suits thei, but
if it does not, they will step outside of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. They
will not step outside of it. They will issue
regulations which will be sufficiently flexible
to permit of the end in view being attained.
I draw attention to the fact that for the
last six years I have been in contact with the
various Departnents cf this Government, and
I repeat with pleasure what I have already
said, that I have found a degree of efficiency
among the heads of the various Departments
that has suriprised me; and I think anyone
would be inferior to his position if, having
a problem to solve suth as the one my honourable friend suggests, he should fail in
finding a solution.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I have much pleasure
in endorsing what my honourable friend says
in regard to this and the other Departments;
nevertheless, I wonder why it is that they can
do one thing in a certain case and cannot
do it in another. I have it in my mind that
the most important thing is the posting of
the notices and that they should be in such
a form that any person can see who the applicants are.
We can do
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
either one of two things. If we have not

SENATE
sufficient faith in the men at the head of the
various Departments we can sit down here and
take our -pens and devise regulations and put
them in the Bill, or we can follow the usual
practice which allows of regulations being

friend thinIks that is the better proposition, I
suggest to him that he take his pen and prepare regulations.
I contend that clause 24 is far superiar to
the old clause 25, which is to be found on the
Clause 25
right hand page of the Bill.
says:
The applicant qhall produce to the court such
evidence. that lie is qualifiei and fit to be
naturalized under the provisions of this Act,
as the court miay require. and shall also personally appear before the court for examination unless it is establisied to the satisfaction
of the court that he is prevented froi so appearing by souie good and sufficient cause.
That is replaced by section 24, which says:
An applicant for a certificate of nîaturalization siall produce to thef Minister certificates
of character and of adequate knowledge of the
Engish or French language from two natural
horn Britisi subjects who are bouseliolders,
and froi one justice of the peace.
Honourable gentlemen will notice that that
enactment brings to the Department the
niames of three men who live in the neighbourhood. which gives them a beginning for their
investigation. They will have the names of
two British-barn subjects. and a Justice of the
peace. To-day the Department bas not tihat
information. Then it will be for the investigators of the Department, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, to find out the standing of
those men, and if they are good and truc men.
To-d'ay an applicant goes to the courthouse
to make his application, and produces whatever evidence the court may ask for as to his
fitness for naturalization; but in the vast
majority of cases the court does net ask for
other witnesses, and the Department is lef-t
to its own initiative in the investigation.
This new policy will assure uniformity
throughout the land. It will furnish more
simple and more effective machinery, and
will provide a more satisfactory method in
the 'West where the settlers are widely dispersed over the country. The procedure under
the new Bill can practically be carried out at
home. Persons desiring to be naturalized will

Mr. DANDURAND.

not have to go a 'hundred or two hundred
miles to a courthouse; they will simply obtain the application form and the form of
notice, give that notice to the newspaper for
publication, and send a copy of the newspaper
to the Secretary of State.
The staff which has in hand the naturalizatien of aliens has been well trained, and since
1914 has been doing its work satisfactorily,
and I think it can be trusted to continue to
do so. It was my pleasure to test the UnderSecretary of State as to the possibility of
He informed that
political interference.
during the fourteen years that he has had this
matter under his care he has not been troubled
in any way, even by the Ministers. The staff
organized for the carrying out of the law have
performed their d'uties smoothly. They are
given general directions, and when a special
case arises they turn to their chief. It is very
seldom that the Secretary of State in person
is troubled by any special case; if a legal
interpretation is necessary, the case is referred
to the Department of Justice. I may say that
from what we have heard in the Committee
there does not appear to have been the least
vestige of ipolitical interference with the administration of this Act. A question was put
to the Under-Secretary of State as to the
policy of the Department in naturalizing
Orientals, and le told us that the inst:ructions
received, and applied, were to not grant
naturalization, particularly in those Provinces
that refuse to enfranchise them.
Now I think I have fairiy covered the
ground.
I apologize for having spoken at
such great length. One must not forget, however. that under the old procedure the courtlieuse was the means of enlightening the Secretary of State, who, after recoiving a report,
was the absolute master, and had the power to
say yea or nay. So affter all, the power has
always been in tlie Secretary of State, and all
ihat we are doing now is to substitute a
better method.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlenien, mîost men, I think, prize most highly
ihose things which cost them sonie effort and
sacrifice to obtain. Citizenship in Canada or
in any other country ought to be highly
prized by the citizens of that country. Men
secking admission into societies of any sort,
men entering upon the marriage state, or
becoming members of Parliament or Ministers of the Crown, expect to undertake serious
duties and to assume serious obligations. If
I have any criticism of the Naturalisation
Act, it is that it is too easy for a person
coming from another country to become a
citizen of Canada. A man can become a

MAY 30, 1928
citizen without being duly impressed with tihe
importance of the responsibilities he is undertaking, and the obligations to which he is
assenting. That, however, is not under consideration here.
My honourable friend the Leader of the
Government has intimated that the Act is
apparently satisfactory, with the exception of
the method by which an alien can become
naturalized; and I wonder just why it becomes so important to amend this particular phase of the Act at this time. My
honourable friend has placed a very beautiful
dressing in the front window of the shop, so
that there are probably 40,000 aliens coming
to Canada annually. If that number of people
are assimilated into our citizenship year by
year, without having impressed upon them the
fact that they are assuming responsibilities
in becoming citizens of this country, I think
our standard of citizenship will in time
seriously deteriorate.
Therefore, instead of
making it easier to become naturalized, we
ought, in my humble opinion, to make this
a more ceremonial undertaking than it is at
the present time. That is one of the complaints II have with reference te the proposed
amendments to the Act.
The leader of the Government intimated
that this Bill came from the House of Commons, and therefore the Department could
not answer a certain question that my honourable friend from Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Gordon) put to him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

One clause.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If I remember
correctly, it was stated to the Committee by
the Under-Secretary of State that this Bill
eranated from the Department itself, and net
from any outside source. Therefore it would
appear from that evidence, which I have no
doubt is correct, that there has been no complaint on the part of the public at large
who are affected by this Act, or of aliens
seeking naturalization, and that no general
complaint has been received seeking for an
amendment of the law; which rather inspires
the wonder why this particular clause of the
Act should come to the front at this time, and
why these changes should be suggested.
Now let us examine the clauses under consideration, particularly sections 22 to 27 of the
present Act, all of which it is proposed ta
delete, substituting therefor three new sections. Let us sec what the present practice
is, and what the present 'law requires, and
then let us proceed briefly ta note the effect
of the new sections as proposed.

619

Under the present law a man coming to
Canada from any country outside of the
Empire, must show that he has resided in
Canada for five years, unless he has previously resided in some other portion of the
Empire for a period, in which case he must
have total residence in the Enpire for five
years before he can be naturalized. He may
then file an application with the Clerk of the
County Court, stating that he is going te be
or is an aipplicant for naturalization as a
Canadian citizen. The clerk of the court
posts that application on the wall of his office
in the courthouse. Now, I assume there is
a courbhouse in probably every constituency
in Canada, which would roughly be about
245, and there is a clerk in charge at each of
those courthouses whose duty it is te see
that this law is carried out, because it is
t
the law · hat it shall be done in that manner,
as my honourable friend has clearly intimated.
Then the present law provides-but it is
proposed ta delete this provision-that three
months shall expire after the notice is posted,
and immediately subsequent ta the expiration
of that date, or shortly thereafter, the judge
having jurisdiotion in that locality will pass
upon the application, and consider any objections may be filed by any of the residents in
the community, and forward his recommendation to the Secretary of State at
Ottawa, which official has absolute jurisdiction either ta grant or refuse ta grant the
naturalization certificate. But if the application is granted, the Department then issues a
certificate, which is sent te the clerk of the
court in the constituency where the man
resides, and the clerk or the judge of the
court, as the case may be-I think the law
says the clerk-brings that man before him
and presents him with his certificate, and administers the oath of allegiance ta His
Majesty the King. That is the present
procedure.
Now, mark the change. It is proposed now
that the applicant need not ta go ta the court
ta make the application; I assume that he
can obtain the application forms from the
department. The applicant sends his application ta the Secretary of State, who then causes
the notice to be filed or posted in the post
office. Honourable gentlemen can imagine just
what that means, and what importance might
attach ta that, especially those who have had
the privilege or otherwise of visiting a great
many country post offices. But how many
post offices do honourable gentlemen suppose
there are in Canada? I did net know until a
few minutes ago, when I sent for the Postal
Guide, and I found that one way of arriving

SENATE

620

at the number was to turn to the list of post
offices in the Guide. That list runs continuously from page 213 to page 498, and
contains nothing but a list of post offices and
postmasters. That is, 285 pages of the Postal
Guide are taken up with the names, and I
found by counting that the number of names
per page averaged 45; so that roughly we have
11.800 post offices in Canada in which to post
these notices. Now, if the Secretary of State
is going to undertake to look after all those
postmasters, and see that they carry out the
law, he has a task that is impossible to
accomplish.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend does not intimate that the notice
must go to all post offices?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.:
friend says so.

My honourable

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No: it goes to
the post office of the party applying.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But my honourable friend will surely admit that there will
be people in every section of the country who
will be secking naturalization, and therefore
every post office in Canada is liable to have
a notice posted. I will give further details on
that point a little later.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the only
communiity interested, or chiefly interested, is
that in which the applicant lives, and people
who go to the post office where the notice will
be posted.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is truc to a
degree. However, before this notice is posted
in the post office, something occurs which I
omitted to mention; that is, that the applicant
must advertise, in the newspaper nearest to
his place of residence, the fact that he is
applying for naturalization. The section specifically referred to is section 23, which says:
An applicant for a certificate of naturalization under s'ubîsection 3 of section 4 of this Act
shall advertise in a newspaper published at
or nearest his place of residence, in either the
Englislh or French language, in a prescribed
forci. bis intention to apply. and shall pro(Ice to the Minister a copy of the newspaper
containing the said advertisement.
Honourable gentlemen, last year some 75,000
people came into Canada from various
countries, and it might be illuminating to
point out that 10,128 Ruthenians alone came
in last year. My honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) mentioned,
in a very able speech on another subject a
few weeks ago, the number of Ruthenian
newspapers that were printed in Canada. Those
people live very largely in colonies, and they
will come to some of those settlements where
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

their own people reside, which is natural, and
under this law, if it comes into effect, you will
see in a Ruthenian newspaper a little half-inch
notice, in either French or English, that somebody is applying for naturalization.
Now, what does that mean? As my honourable friend the leader of the Governmont
said, it does not mean anything; and he is
right, because the people in the Ruthenian
neighbourbood who read newspapers. but are
not able to read the original language. will
not take the Ruthenian paper, and therefore
will not know that this immigrant is applying
for naturalization; and nobody will kn.ow anything about the advertisement except the
Secretary of State, who receives a copy of
I presume
that newspaper under the A-ct.
that they will probabfly be able to increase
the bids of people who buy waste paper in
Ottawa, as a result of all those newspapers
coming in. At any rate, the Secretary of
State has to receive a newspaper fron every
one of those 40,000 people who annually will
b- applying for naturalization. and on receipt
of that newspaper and application, a notice
wvil be posted up in one of the 11,800 post
offices of Canada.
Thcn what happens? The present law proviles that for a period of three month.s that
notice will remain in the court house. and
amy person residing in the comunity, or who
knows anythinmg about this man, as a right
to file objections to his becoming a naturalized citizen, just as is the practice in any
society everywhere, whether fraternal, religious
or parliamentary. The practice is that the
public shall have a right to file an objection
against a man being married, against his taking office of various sorts, against his beconing a member of a fraternal society; but when
it comes to making him a citizen of Canada,
the public is to know nothing about it. or
have no opportunity of filing an objection :ny
longer, because section 24 of the present Act
is practically elininated, and is not replaced
by aiv words in the new sections proposed
to be adopted.

Well. I will
to move an

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Now, following
that, let us see what happens. After the
application lias been received, and one of
those 11,800 postal offices has had a notice
posted in it, ai the end of three months tho
Secretary of State may or max' not, at his
discretion, issue a certificate of -naturalization, making the applicant a citizen. He has not

of a court; he knows nothing of the situation
h:mself; ail that ha bas is that two neighbors
and a justice of the peace in the locality rend
in a letter indicating the man's eharacter;
and, strange to say, section 24 does not even
require a certificate of good character, it
êimply says:
An applicant for a certificate of naturalization shall produce to the Minister certificates
of character and of adequate knowladge of the
English or French language from two natural
born British subjects who are householders, and
one justice of the peace.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That means
good7 character.

Hon. Mr. DANDU-RAND: I said that when
the law does specify somethlng, nothing
against thatispecîfication can be done. When
it does flot specify, then it la left to intesrpretation and to regulations.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend the leader of the Goveroment answered
that obpection himself a littie whole ago,
when he said that the neighbors of the applicant, having to live beside hlm, and wanting
to ha at peace and harmony with hlm, would
not be incliýned to do anything but agree
and say, "Yas, he is a good fellow, and ought
to ha naturalized." Therein lies the very
objection that I take to the Act, and my
honourable friand answered it most effectivaly
himself.
Than, after that is done, after the three
months have elapsed, and without any reference to any report from anybody except two
neighbors, the Sacretary of State may issue
a certificate of naturalization, initiating the
candidate into the solemn rights of citizen.ship of Canada. But again we flnd a strange
discrepancy. At the present time, when a
certificate is issued, the Department sends it
to the county court, and the ceramony of
administaring the oath of allegiance to Ris
Mai esty the King is gona through in each
case. But honourable gentlemen will notice
that thera is no provision for that in this
Bill. Section 27 of the present Act provides:
Upon the applicant taking and subscribing
the oath of allegiance, which may ba so taken
and subscribad by any parson duly authorizad
to administar judicial *oaths by the laws of the
province in which the applicant residas, the
clark shall deliver the certificate to the applicant.
At the present time, in the absence of
anything to the contrary-and my honourabla
friand has clearly stated that when the law
does not specify, nothing caa be done--all
that happens is that the certificate, is mailed
from the office of the Secretary of State to
the applicant, whoever he may be, and probably ha cannot read a word that is in that
cartiflcate, and he will go back as a citizen of
Canada, with ahl the duties and obligations of
eitizenship.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my bonourabla friand allow me to put a question to
hlm.?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Ail right; let us
follow that trail a minute-vhen the law does
not specify, the Dapartments and Go-vernment are free to pursue their own course anid
interpret it as they will. 1 arn beginning to

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The answer to
my honouraible friand is that in the Naturalization Act these tbings hava been spacifically
providad for hy law, and that the Govern*ment
of which I had the honour of being a meniber
for a, short period, did not give much consideration ta the Naturalization Act, baca-use
of more serlous things; but we neyer underftook for one moment to taka advantage of it
by omitting perhaps the most serlous clause
in connection with naturaization-that a man
should personally take the oath of alagiance
to Ris Mai asty, and flot leave that to the
whim of any depa.rtment or officer of a department, to issue some regulation upon it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: All right. Will
my honourable friend now inform the House
who is going to administer the oath of
allegiance-the postmaster?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Who will administer the oath of allegiance?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely my honourable friend can trust the Department with
enough sense to have that donc properly.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is done properly under the present law by the county
court officials, but they are being withdrawn
from the picture.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It is the clerk.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But my honourable friend has represented to the House that
the main object in amending this Bill was to
save the poor applicant from going a few miles
to the court house and ]et him go to the
post office. Surely if he was going to the
court house in one case he should do it in
this case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw my honourable friend's attention to Section 22 of
the regulations which were laid down by the
Government in 1915:
Oaths of allegiance omay bc taken by any
person authorized to take judicial oaths by
the law of the province in whicha the applicant
resides.
That is the law that will continue in force.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That naturally
means that the oath will be administored before the certificate is delivered.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Now, let us sec.
In section 4 of the Act, subsection 4, that my
honourable friend has just quoted, we read:
A certificate of naturalization shall not take
effet until the applicant has taken the oath
of allegiance.
Therefore, under the law a certificate cannot be forwarded to the applicant; tha.t is
clear. Now, who is it going to be forwarded
to? It cannot mean the postmaster; it must
be some offioiaI authorized and qualified to
administer oaths. So that we get back, in the
actual operation, to the amended Act. In
its real operation the applicant will finally
have to go to the county court house or some
central point where an officer qualified to administer oaths is to be founad.
So much for that side of it. Now we come
to another phase of the question upon which
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

one perhaps hesitates 'to be too definite; but
in years past I have had the pleasant privilege,
which I think was a most useful one, to have
reasonably accurate and intimate knowledge
of all parts of Canada, ani it has been conspicuously true that advantage has been taken
of the new settlers in Canada, from the
political standpoin't, imany anli many a time.
I am not accusing any particular party or
Government, but it is in my opinion the duty
of Parliament to throw all possible safeguards around the newcomer that he may
become an independent citizen and not a
subservient one. Therefore I draw the House's
attention to this fact, that under the law
as it would be if this Bill were adopted things
could happen that cannot happen now.
If I remember correctly, one of the things
done as a result of the investigation that my
honourable friend referred to a few moments
ago, made by the Government of which I
happened to be a member, was to increase
the length of time between the application
and the granting of the certificate, so that
just prior to a general election, for example,
it would be impossible, or at least much
more d.fficult, to naturalize a whole lot of
people. There was a further check in the law
requiring the name of the applicant and the
fact that he was applying for naturalization
to be posted in the office of the County Clerk
three muonths before the certificate could be
granted. If a general election or a by-election
in the riding were in the offing, what would
happen? Any person interested from a political standpoint could go to the County Clerk's
office and there he would sec the list of the
names of all persons who were seeking to be
naturalized as citizens of Canada. and it was
the easiest thing in the world to check that
list against the voters' list and sec whether
any person included in the voters' list was
a naturalized citizen.
But what may happen now? I do net say
it will happen, but what could happen is this.
No man can go around to ail the post offices
in a constituency and check up all the lists in
all those post offices and t:hen, with the information thus gathered, examine the voters'
lists in all the ridings. That would be impossible. Thereforo it is entirely within the
bounds of possibility that men may come
forward and swear that they are naturalized
citizens, without knowing the nature of the
oath that they take. Men may be given the
franchise who have net taken the oath of
allegiance to His Majesty and who have no
knowledge of the fact that they are violating the law or taking a false oath. Surely it
becomes the duty of Parliament to place as
many safeguards as possible around the people

MAY 30, 1928
whom we solicit to corne to this country,
whom we bring her-e in the hope of making
them. citizens, to replace, if you please,
the Ca'nadian-iborn citizens who, in larger numbers, during the saine period, have emigrated
eleewhere. It is a serious question froin the
standpoint of the standard of Canadian citizenship in. years to corne, and I say to you
in ail earneatness that if this House passes
týhis Bill you are in my opinion dealing a blow
at the improvement af the standard of Canadian cit.izenship and enablingi a log-rolling
process to he introduced and, put into operation at electian time if any Governinent in
power should so determine or desire.
I want to say this in passing, that I know
whereof 1 speak. During an election in a certain constituency in Western Canada representatives of a provincial governinent went up
and down that constituency telling those poor
foreigners, who, could not speak either English
or French, "Unless you vote for such a party
you are going to lose your title to your land."
In rny 'humble opinion that sort of thing is
absolutely contemptible and ought, tio be
punishable by law.
Are we going to encourage abuses? Arc
we going to open up further avenues whereby abuses of this sort may be perpetrated
upon an innocent, unknowing alien population. whom we ought to endeavour ta educate
to higher standards of citizenship instead? I
arn opposed to the adoption of the Bill.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I propose to make but very few
observations on this Bill. I would flot say
anything 'but for the fact, that was indicated
by the honourable leader of the Government
when he ipointed out to the Huse that
undoubtedly a very large number of applications coming 'before (bhe Departinent will
corne froin the newer parts of the West. That
is pa'rticularly true of the rural parts; and I
dare say that in the growing towns in the
province of Quebec, and pa.rti'eularly in the
city of Montreall, where there is a considerable foreign immigration, and also in the
city of Toronto, the same observation might
bie made as I would apply to Western Canada.
The honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), who 'has just taken
bis seat, has dealt with this question rather
extensively and very ably, as is usual for hlm.
This wîll eut very short the observations that
I shahl make.
There is no question at ail that the present
Act is a wanderful improvement on the Act
whîeh. preceded it, and which was surrounded
with very iew safeguards and certainly was
worked in the Western country, and, ta be

623

perfectly frank, by both parties, to their
political advantage at election time. The Act
lent ýitself ta that. We know where canvassers and pe.rhaps certain candidates, not
very scrupulous, went about the country with
certificates of naturalization in their pockets,
ta be delivered to the voters only in case they
voted right. The present Act is a great
advance on that.
It was a gesture of
Imperialisn, to wh'ich, I respond. It was
Sound desirable that the conditions for
naturalization should be sirnilar throughout
the great British Empire, and the present
Act has undoyubtedly been drafted wi'th that
end in view. As has been pointed out very
properly by the honourable leader of the
Government, this does nat take away the Act
that 4lieady exists. If you want to have your
naturalization as a British subject good anywhere you must corne in under the new Act.
Many of us who live in the West have had
occasion to re-naturalize, if I may say 80,
persons who h-ad al.ready been naturalized
under the preceding Act. I inyself have had
personal experience of 'that in rnany cases.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And then,
for the renaturali-zation, the honourable
gentleman applied directly ta the Secretary'of
State.
Hon. 'Mr. W'ILLOUGHBY: Ye6, under the
new Act. AIl the safeguards that the Secretary of State has now adopted, as described
very fully, not only in the speech af the hionourable Leader, but s.lso in the Cornmittee by
the Depu-ty iMinister, narnely, the procedure
of referring to the Mounted Police and also,
ta the Immigration officers for fuller information on the history and conduct af theý person
seeking naturalization, can of course be used
under the present law, whether we amend it
or not.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: They are being
used.
Hon. Mxr. WILLOUJGHBY: Yes, they are
being uscd naw. It is sought ta amend the
law because 'the prirnary step of proceeding
before a judge is 'considered to be na longer
necessary. To that opinion I do nat adhere. I
think tihat in the eye of the foreigner eoming ta
this country, particularly the foreigner unfarniliar with aur ilanguage and our customns,
the rnast iinpressive part of the whole eere'rnny is the appearance befare the local judge,
wha represents in the distriat the m'ajesty ai
the law. The immigrant has corne frain a
cauntry where judges have perha.ps more drastic powers than in Canada, but in any event, to
the newcomer and to the people of the whale
circurnscription in which he lives the judge

SENATE

G24

typifies the law and the power of the law,
and I think it would be a very retrograde stop
te change the Act by eliminating that portion
which makes necessary the reference to the
judge. It may be perfectly true that some
district court judges rather cavil at this work
being thrust on them, thinking it to be purely
administrative work. It is said that some of
them assert that they are not the people to
judge of policy. It is very easy however, for
a judge to say-all that he is required to say
-whether the applicant for naturalization understands English or French, and whether he
is of good character or not. The judge himself should have if ho wants it, and there
could be if it were necessary, a departmental
regulation that he should be supplied with it,
accumulated hy the
all the information
Secretary of State, both from the Mounted
Police and from the Immigration Department, and he could pass finally on it. The
Department of State might provide a certificate in such a form that it would have perhaps more dignity in the other Dominions. I
say that the judge himselif, just as ha was the
authoritv dealing originally with the application. could be the final authority giving the
certificate, without ever referring to the
Secretarv of State at all. and the certificate
would be valid throughout the world. Or it
might be desirable-it i not provided in this
Bill-that the judge's certificate coming to the
Secretary of State should be replaced, for the
purpose of a person travelling abroad, and
for recognition throughout the British Empire,
by a certificate from the Secretary of State,
wvho would act on the judge's certificate.
I do not think the ordinary judge in Canada
treats the immigrant's application as a joke.
Very far from it, in my opinion. There may
be some captions judges. We lawyers in pracfice before the courts, from the lowest to the
highest, find thiat some judges are of more
pleasant temperament than others, but I would
certainly stand up for the dignity of the Bench
and say that all judges in Canada recognize
'their judicial functions and in granting naturalization are acting bona fide and with reasonable care.
In consequence of the speech of the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) I wirll not reiterate objections
which ie has already expressed. I do think
that the Act at the present time coulid be
used polit ically. I am not saying that it is
being so used. The Deputy Minister is a
gentleman with whom I have ong been
asquainted and in whom I have great confidence, but he himselif bas said frankly, in the
Committee, as you would expeot him to say,
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

that owing to the manifold duties of his office
and the numerous applications for naturalization, it is -only isolated and new cases that
are referred to him. I cannot say whether
any one of his subordinates in thiat Departnient is not ready to play politices. I aim not
going to say that any of them do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are all
nominees of my honourable friend's party.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I presume thaýt

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But I am glad
to find that they are such ýa good, surviving
lot that all of them appointed by the preceding
administration are st-ill on duty. I wish they
may live long, if that be the case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I learned when
we met in Committee that the Chief of tie
Branch is the brother of a former Secret'ary
of State; if I am net mistaken, of Hon. Mr.
Coderre.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In any event
of
the granting of applications is capable
political control. I wiull tell you how it might
be exercised in a large way; and this would
be quite obvious to those who know more
about politi.ce than I do.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Botter not tell
them. They may not know.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: For tie benefit
of the innocent leader of the Government I
will say that all that has to be done is to
give an intimation te ithat office .that it need
not be too precipitate in the issuing of the
certificates, or, on the other hand, that ift
should hasten them. Suppose there is a byelection pending and there are in the constituency many foreigners who ooulýd become
voters if they were naturalized by the Seeretary
of State. Suppose the pressure of business in
that office were so great that it was net
possiible in the ordinary course of affairs to
issue certificates of naturalization with any
too great promptitude.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But they could
be delayed under the present Act.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Quite true. It
can be done under the present Act, but we
have a sefeguard to some extent. But, just
te complote my thought, lot us suppose, on
the other hand, that a certain party hoped

MAY 30, 1928
to benefit by the very prompt despatch of
certifiaates from the office of the Seoretary
of State, it being thought that the foreign
vote was favourable to the Goverament. In
a constituency of the sort I have in mind
appeal is always made to the foreign vote;
and, unfortunately, this Government, as we
well know, has to-day tihe vast majority of
the foreign vote of Canada. It has 95 per
cent of the foreign vote in the whole of the
Prairie Provincee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am happy
that such a certificate is given of the good
tTeatment we accord them.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am surprised
at the five per cent.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
What I am
surprised at is that we have any. Government officials regudate these matters, but I
do not think we should expose them to
temptation by giving tbem a power which
some Secretary of State 'or some other Minister over in the House of Commons may urge
the Department to use politically. As my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has
said, this can be donc under the Act as it
stands at present, but you have a great safeguard in the fact that the public of the whole
district where the man resides know that he
has gone before the judge of his district and
made an application, and the judge bas sent
in a certificate recommending him. That is
something very important, which would be
known locally, and then the candidates and
all the people interested in that electoral district, if there is a delay, would want to know
why the Secretary of State is not performing
his duty by issuing the certificate. If you
have not that preliminary inquiry on the part
of the local judge, the Department at Ottawa
may staN the applicant off indefinitely, saying
that they are making inquiries about this,
that and the other thing, and the certificate
comes or does not come just as it suits the
Department, or-shall I say?-as it could suit
the Department.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
go to the opposite extreme.

Or they might

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, either one
extreme or the other, just as it suits the
exigencies in a particular county.
I am not going to impute bad faith to the
honourable gentleman in bringing in this
Bill. I have never done so to any set of
gentlemen who sat opposite me anywhere. I
must give credit to my honourable friends for
desiring to legislate in the best interests of
the country and the best interests of the

62

foreigners coming here and desiring naturalization, but I do think that the Government are
taking the wrong route, and that what they
are proposing to do by this Bill is an extremely retrograde step.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, as one of the members of the Banking
and Commerce Committee I listened to the
explanations given by the Under-Secretary of
State, which were very plausible.
I would
acquit him of any ulterior motives in framing
this Bill: I think he did it for the purposes
of administration. But there is a difference.
between departmental administration and the
public spirit or the public welfare. If we had
an autocratie form of government the Bill
devised by the Under-Secretary of State
would probably be the very best method that
could be adopted, but the conditions in Canada are entirely different. In addition to the
objections against this Bill urged by the honourable member from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), there is about it a feature that
strikes me as still more objectionable. I refer
to the fact that the taking of power from the
judges and the centering of it in the Secretary
of State is a retrograde move. As a matter
of fact we know that the Liberal policy was
always different from that: it was the policy
of Liberalism that you should not give to a
government autocratie power. I would like
to draw the attention of the honourable
Leader of the Government to an article which
appeared in the Manitoba Free Press, discussing this Naturalization Bill. As the
Manitoba Free Press is the leading Liberal
paper in Canada, I should think its opinion
would have some effect. I need not read all
the editorial, for it is too long, but it winds
up in this wav:
It is perhaps desirable that the Secretary of
State should have the final word as to who
is eligible to become a Canadian citizen, or in
a broader sense, a British citizen. Leaving the
matter of naturalization with the courts need
not deprive him of that right. The situation
might best be met by having the Secretary of
State iay down the rules, regulations and tests
governing naturalization, and that these should
be applied by the courts of the country or by
such other officials who might at all times be
above suspicion of political partisanship or
motives. The final papers could be passed upon
by the Secretary of State. This would leave
the final power in the hands of the Secretary
of State, but the machinery provided for carrying out the details would act as an automatic
check on any misuse or abuse of the Governmental authority.
We imagine that the bulk of the Canadian
peonle would prefer to leave the matter of
naturalization in the hands of the courts, with
reasonable and sensible tests to bring out the
applicant's fitness, or lack of it, for Canadian
citizenship.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

That is fromn the Ieading Liberal newspaper
of -Canada. There is a similar editorial in the
Winnipeg Tribune, urging that this matter be
left to the courts. As Winnipeg is the gateway of the West, I think these papers express
the sentiments of the people of that country,
and that their opinions are worthy of consideration.
One serious objection that I have -to this
Bill, entirely apart from what 1 have said, is
the secrecy of the proceedings. The papers
are ail sent to Ottawa, and if anyone desires
information, how is he to get it? It is purely
autocratie, and 1 cannot see how the honourable Leader of the Governrnent can congratulate himnseif upon introducing a measure of
this kind. What did Sir Wilfirid Laurier say
when the Act of 1914 was introduced? H1e
moved that the Bill ho referred back to Committee, and this is -the statomnent he made at
that time:
We have given the courts of iaw th power
to determiine that question, and we have provided that the applicant rnust corn before
the court and give evidence of bis character;
that the judge rnay, if not satisfied m-ith the
proof placed before hini, ask for further evidence, ani that there niay be a trial before
the judge as to whether or not the applicant
is a fit and proper person to be a British
subjeet.
Further on he says:
T'he judge determines the question. and thoni
the matter is not finally disposed of, but is
roferred to the Secretary of State, m-ho, pureiy
arbitrarily. without giving any reasons. but
simply of bis own wiil, rnay or may not grant
a certillcate. Such a disposition is ahsoiutely
repugnant to tbe spirit of our institutions.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier objected to the Secretary
of State having the final word. H1e thought
that was repugnant to -the spirit of British
institutions. I do not desire to take up too
much time on tihis subject, but I do want to
object to the Bill on -the ground that it gives
this arbitrary power to the Department to
grant naturalization or t0 refuse it, as it sees
fit.
Something bas been said about the poliitical
effeet that this legisiation wili bave. I do flot
suppose the honourable gentleman bas any
desire for that sort of thing, but nevertheiess
the Bill iends itseif to political manipulation.
Anyone can go out into the country and say
to these foreigners: "The Government of Canada is al'l-powerfui; they are the oniy ones
who can naturalize you, and if you do not
do as they say, you cannot get your naturalization." We know what bas taken place in the
West, and how bomestead inspectors have
gone ont .with patents in their bands and bave
said to people: "Unles3 you do sa and so, you
wiii flot get your land." That wa.s tone in
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Manitoba, in Alberta, and in Saskatchewan.
Wbiie the gentleman who drew the Act may
neyer bave thought of it being used in that
way, it can be sa used, and will be sO used.
I do not think the Bill is an improvement
on the old law. I think the taking of the oath
of allegiance should be surrounded with more
forma and ceremnony, and that the oath shouid
be administered by some high officiai. Týhere
is not a boy of twenty-one years of age who
cannot to-day get a commissioan to issue
affidavits. Every lawyer and iaw student can
be appointed a commissioner to take affidavits, and when someone walks into their
offices t0 take an affidavit they say: "Ail irigbt,
sign it there," and: that is the end of it.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen,
I want at the outset f0 pay a tribute to the
honourable the Leader of this House for the
able presenfation that he bas made on behaîf
of this Bill. 1 arn sure that if there was anyfhing more to be said, iho would have said it.
In my opinion he bas overestimated the
advantages which will accrue under the new
Bill, m-bile at the same tirne be bas magnified
the disadvantages under the old Bill.
Now, it is not my purpose to go into details
wbich have been covered by bonourable gentlemen wbo have preceded me, but I wish to
devote a few moments to some of the high
lights which are apparent to me fromn the
proeeedings in the Conmmittee wbieh con.sicered
the Bill, and fromn the discussion wbich bhas
taken, place to-day. Wben the whole substance
is boiled down, it seerns t0 me that it presents
tîvo particular high lights, oine of which is the
proposal to t.ransf or the autbority of the judges
to a Minister of the Crown. The argument
usod in support of this change was thaf, in
the first place, the judges are diiatory in their
duty, or at ieast not very efficient ini the
service they perform. Coming as I do fromn
Western Canada, and having lived there a
great many years, and having had an opportunity t0 observe personally the actions of
the judges in the courts, I cannot agree with
that suggestion. On the contrary, I think I
can safely say from. ry own observation fhat
the judges of WVestern Canada, or at ieast thoso
in the Province of Saskatchewan, are giving
very close personal attention to this very
question. On innumerable occasions I have
se-en applicants corne before the judges there,
and bave heard fhemn interrogated as to their
knowledge of the languýage and their right t0
citizenship, as required under the present iaw,
and alrnost invariably the .iudge bas given
intelligent consideration to the duties that ho

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Pcrhaps the honourable leader of thc Gov ernent xviIi inforin the

of which tbreugh the House of ('ommons bas

whioic Cornmittee was dcceived. Nowv, that
is net oivý qîtite possible but probable, and
1 believe it dees bappen. Tbat is one of tbe
things fihat the Bill wouid dio a great deal te
bead off.
The second tiiing about those divorce petilions iii the oldco
euntry is, that the cases

MAY 30, 1928
are watched by one of the law offices of the
Crown, called the Xing's Proctor, on bebaîf
of the Government. If we had a divorce
court, I think that would follow as one of the
features of the court. At present there are
two parties to ecd case, thc petitioner and
the respondent, but this would bring in a
third .party who would be quite indifferent
to cither the petitioner or the respondent, and
who would look at the case entirely from
the point of view of public interest. I
believe that a divorce court, if modelled on
the English Divorce Court Act, would nlot
only ensure a tendcncy, but a certainty, of
substantial reduction in the number of
divorces that are granted.
There is another weak spot in dealing with
divorces in this Chamber, and it is this. I
neyer could devise any method by whidi,
mhen a petition was being heard before the
Divorce Committee, we could get extraterritorial evidence; yet every now and again
there was need for such evidence. I remember
one case in particular where a party living
in Hong Kong would have been a very
material witness if we had any machincry for
getting et him, or examining himn tiere; but
wc cannot issue a commission for taking
evidence elsewiere. The court could do that,
and could issue a commission into any part
of the country.
Then, again, the present method becomes
very onerous. Take that very case mentioncd; besides failing to get the evidence,
there would be the cost of getting it iy
bringing a witness biere. We have no law
to compel a witness to come, but even if he
came voluntarily the charge would be very
beavy.
I. regret, as much as any member of this
Huse, that there sbould be divorces in the
country. 0f course, a divorce is only a
symptom: there is always sometiing back of
it which is very regrettable. But wc have
divorces, and if we can minimize them. and
impose greater precautions against collusion,
and supplement the powers of the Senate by
passing the whole matter over to the Courts,
which of course have very muci wider
macbinery than we have, we would be doing a
gond tiing, even assuming that divorce is
bad.
An Hon. SENATOR: W-hat about alimony?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: That is aside of the
question, but I am looking into, the heart
of thc problem as closcly as I can. If I
thought a Divorce Court wou'ld increase
divorces, and bring tic marriage laws into
disgrace, or turn themn into a farce, I would
be Vhe lest man in this House Vo ask for a

629

Divorce Court. 'But
everytbing points to a
Divorce Court, which bas very substantial
pewers, and bas not the evils tbat are
attendant upon divorces as granted by the
Senate. That is no't tie f ault of tie Senate.
If you have no arms yon cannot reaci out.
Now, I do net tiink that we are quite
rigitly treated in this bouse. 0f course, the
gentlemen have their rig'hts: if they bring
up the Bill, and vote it down, that is their
sovereig-n rig:ht, I Vbink no one in tbis House
would complain for one minute about tbat;
but to kcep the Bill back, and avoid a vote,
is not fair play, and the time is coming when
some issue will have Vo be raised with the
other bouse, in wiicb Vbey will have to do
one of two things, eitier pass the Bill or
rejeet it. That is their rigit, but it is simply
intolerable t-hat this present position should
continue, and I do not tiink tiat tbis bouse
siould very long put up with it.
H-on. Mr. WILLOUJGHBY: I am not going
to speak on the subi ect of divorce but ratier
of the Bill. 1 introduccd the Bill into this
bouse, and it passed last year, as it passed
this year, witbout anybody opposing it. It
ivas rather well on in the Session last year,
and it was my intention at that time to have
some gentlemen in the otier House become
sponsor for the Bill ûiere. I had in view a
very desirable gentleman to propose it, but
it was learned tiat the Minister of Justioe
was about to go, as 'le subsequcntly went,
to tic opening of the Australian Parliament
at Canberra, as a delegate from Canada. It
was suggested to me, and I quite acceded Vo
tie view, tint perbeps it looked to be, noV
tie proper tbing to do, to introduce a Bill of
that kind in his absence. Tiat vicw was advanced by friends of tinat Minister, and I acceded Vo it. That is the reason why we did
flot actively proceed with the Bill last ycar.
Had the Minister of Justice been in the
House during ail that Session tie. Bill would
bave been prucecded with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I will make it my special duty
to draw tic attention of tic Prime Minister,
and also tbe Minister of Justice, wbose name
bas just been mentioned, to Vie situation as
brought to tie attention of Vhio Ciamber by
tie memibers wbom we -have just heard.
Perbaps it is not in tbe proper form, or in
conformity witi tbe rules of either Giamber,
tbýat one should criticize the other, but I
simply desire to state tuis, VbaV tic new rules
for the management of thc debates in the
other Ciamber seemn to have left Loo little
time for private legisiation, also for public
législation prornoted by private members. I

SENATE

630

understand that the state of things just now
in the other Chamber allows private legislation only two hours a week, one hour on Tuesday or Wednesday, and one hour on Friday,
for disposal by that Chamber, and that the
public bill which is now referred to stands
behind that private legislation, and can only
be reached when the private legislation is
disposed of.
Now, it so happens that with the new regulations it clearly appears that the majority
in the House of Commons is no more the
master of the situation. Half a dozen members can dictate their will to that Chamber.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: One can.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: One has.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say six members, because there is only an hour for the
discussion of private legislation and for public legislation initiated by private members.
The question is, will this free country, blessed
with democratic institutions, permit a condition of things where the will of the majority
cannot be made to prevail? These rules, having been tested, will probably need revision.
It is for the Commons to decide.

By the Honourable Mr. Bourque:That he will enquire of the Government:
1. Have negotiations been reopened for
the acquisition of the Kent Northern Railway,
and if so, with whom?
2. Wben were negotiations reopened?
3. Is there any correspondence on the subject,
and if so, first, with whoin; second, what are the
respective dates of letters and telegrains on the
subject?
4. Is the Government aware that the people
of the districts that said railway serves are
compelled to pay excessive rates as compared
to Canadian National Railways rates?
5. What action lias the Government taken to
carry into effeet regarding this railway the

Appropriation Act, No. 2, chapter No. 52,
Statutes of Canada, 1918, for its acquisition at
a price of $60,000, but as this was not acceptable to the owners the sale was not consummated. It was represented to us that the
present was an appropriate time to reopen
negotiations on that basis and we recommend
that this be done."?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BOURQUE: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman if there is any
possibility of getting an answer to this inquiry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The last time I
inquired, the Secretary of the De.partment was
to send me an answer shortly. I had it in
mind to draw the attention of the Minister
of Railways to the inquiry this morning. I
shall do so to-morrow, and I have strong
hopes of obtaining an answer for my honourable friend by Tuesday.
IMMIGRATION

RESTRICTIONS

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see that there
are no Orders of the Day; but before moving
for the suspension of ithe sitting till 8 o'clock
this evening, in order that the Committee on
Pensions may have an opportunity of making
its report, I shall read the answer which I
received from the Immigration Department in
reply to the inquiry of my honourable friend
from Alma (Hon. G. G. Foster). It is as
follows:
Referring to the discussion in the Senate
yesterday with regard to an application for
the admission to Canada of one W.- and wvife
to join relatives in Montreal, in which the
statenent w'as made that the Department
required a $5,000 bond before entry could be
allowed. I an submitting below the facts as
appearing on Departmental file:
One W.- applied to our Agent at Liverpool,
England, to be allowed to proceed to Canada
to join his father. a resident of Montreal.
His previous occupation was cotton weaver and
lie expects to do "light work" in Canada. On
being mîedically exanined lie was certified as
follows:
"W.- aged 40 ycars, is certifiable under Sec.
3. s.s. (c) of the Immigration Act, on account
of poor physique and doubtful constitution.
The applicant is under-weight, pale and anaemie
looking. There is a mitral systolie murmur and
tachycardia, evidencing a deranged action of
the heart. The applicant gives a history of
being subject to frequent colds. He must be
considered a poor physical risk."
The case was subnitted to the Department
by the Director of European Emigration,
London, for investigation of the settlement
arrangements.
It was established tliat the
relatives in Canada were in a position to
receive the applicant and his wife.

631

MAY 31, 1928
Section 3 of the Immigration Act reads as
follows:
"No immigrant, passenger or other person
unless he is a Canadian citizen, or has Canadian domicile, shall be permitted to enter or
land in Canada, or in case of having landed
in or entered Canada shall be permitted ta
remain therein, who belongs ta any of the
following classes, hereinafter called "prohibited
classes":"(a) ..................................
"(b) .................................
"(c) Immigrants who are dumb, blind, or
otherwise physically defective, unless in the
opinion of a Board of Inquiry or officer acting
as such they have sufficient money, or have
such profession, occupation, trade, employment
or other legitimate mode of earning a living
that they are not liable to become a public
charge or unless they belong ta a family accompanying them or already in Canada and which
gives security satisfactory to the Minister
against such immigrants becoming a publie
charge."..
The medical evidence brings W.- within the
provisions of the above quoted section. He is
not coming ta assured employment and his
physical condition is such that some security is
required against public charge liability. The
father expressed a willingness ta execute a
bond of indemnity, as referred ta in the section
quoted. Admission was approved subject ta the
filing of the said bond. A blank copy of the
bond form is attached hereto. The amount of
the bond in this present and in other similar
cases is $600, the sureties requiring ta be
property owners in Canada. The statement
that the relatives in Canada have been
requested ta place with the Department a
$5,000 bond is incorrect.

PENSION BILL
REPORT

0F

SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

Hon. H. S. BELAND moved concurrence
in the report of tbe Special Committer to
ivhom xvas meferred Bill 289, anl Act to amend
the Pe-nsion Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I would
like to submit for youm consideration a frw
observations in connection withi numemous
amcndments wbicb have bren made by th(b,
S pecial Committce. The Bill ns brou-lit to us
fmom. tbe House of Commons contain, tbirtyfour clauses.
0f these tbirty-four clauses
txvent.y-two have bren adoptrd by the Comnmittre wvitbout nny amendment wbatsoevrr.
To the other twclve clauses amendments have
bren added, but many of these amendmnents
bave relat ion only to administration aînd are
intended to clarifv the present law.
The
claiuses xvbicb appear to bave attracced more
attention. cspecially froni the representatives
of

sldiers'

organizations, are

only four or

fixe; as t matter of fart, the Comminer baive
thoughs i luit the number niigbt be
educed
to four. Tbese four clauses are 2, 7, S and 25,
thluugbi I mliglbt add that section 31 is alsu,
of i-calimotne
Wiib the, pnirmission of bonourab1 e members 1 wxill rcfiain from any attemps to du ah
w-oh ithose claxuses relating to admini-tratin
and aiinuing to, make the present
law
and wilI confine mnyscîf to clauses 2, 7,clo-arer,
S and
25.
Section 2 bas reference to the interpret.u ion
cliý, of-cn
the present law; the Pensioni Act,

JUNE 1, 1928
1 mean, of 1919. In the present Act the word
"'appearance", is interpreted as follows:
"Appearance of the disability" includes the
reappearance of a disabilirty which has been
reduced sufficiently to permit the member of
the forces to serve in a theatre of actual war.
This interpretation, it was contended, was flot
clear. There was considerable ambiguity about
it. It was argued tihat in the case of a member of the forces who suffered înjury or disease,
who subsequently served in a theatre of actual
war, and who was discharged to pension, if
he thereafter married and if he ultimately
died of the said injury or disease, lis widow
should be entitled to pension on the ground
that, he having ibeen returned ta a theatre of
actual war, there was no reappearance of the
injury or disease until aSter the marriage,
although as a matter of fact the man was
actually pensioned for such injury or disease.
Furthermore the word "disability" was improperly used in the interpretation. Instead
of the word "disaibility" the interpretation
section should 'have used the word's "injury
or disease."
In 1920 the Statute was amended to read:
"Appearance of the injury or disease" incýludes; the recurrence of an injury or disease
which has been so improved as to have
reinoved the resultant disability.
This interpretation has stood since the first
of September, 1920, a period of almost eîght
years, and this is the first time after alapse
of eight years that it bas been suggested that
the interpretation should be enlarged ta include not only the present interpretation, but
also what we consider the ambiguous interpretation of 1919.
The attention of honourable gentlemen is
directed to the fact that thousands who were
boardcd unfit and marked unfit served in the
Forestry Corps and other non-combatant
units far removed from the scene of hostilities,
yet because they served in France, which is
considered a theatre of war, all these cases
would he jnchidpd in the original interpretation. Those cases would also be included wha
h'ad served in a theatre of war and were subsequently boarded unfit and were again returned ta a theatre of war in a non-combatant
unit.
Now let us pass to paragraph 7. This is a
very important section: it has to do with the
aggravation of an injury or disease whiclh
existed before enlistiment. Your Committee
particularly cails attention to the fe.cV that
any man suffering from a pre-en-listment injury
or disease, if he served in a the-atre of war,

Vhpn is pensioned upon discharge to the total
extent of bis disabi'lity altlhough a consîderable portion of such disability rnay have been

633

pre-enli;stment. The present law provides that
when a -man suffering fnom*a pre--enlistment
injury or disease dies cf this condition his depend-entsQ are pensionaible if death is the result
of the aggravation. The Pension Commissioners, in order Vo arrive at a definite policy
in t-hese cases, have for the 'past eight years
adopted the rule that if the pension is fifty
per cent of the total disability, then death
shail ha oonsidered as the resuit of the aggravatiýon. It was proposed in the present
Bilil to amend the present law to pension
dependents when the aggravatiïon of the injur.y or disease "sulbstanially contributed" to
the deat)h.
IV has been contended that pension shýould
)e granted in these cases even if the aggravation was net fifty per cent. It was suggestcd
that possibly Vwenty-five or thirty-three par
cent might ýbe con-sidered a substantial aggravation, but the observations on this point
were rather indafinite, and it appears te your
Committee that the wording of the amendment is iikewise indefinàte and ambiguous.
Furthermnore, your Commdttea sees no go-od
reason for adoptIng the.present amend'ment,
in view of the fact that all meinhers of the
forces who served in a theatre of actual war
are actua-ly pensioned to the total extent
of their disability. The proposed amendment bas reference to those who only scrved
in Canada, or Canada and England.
Section 8 is also a very important clause.
It deals with the date after ivhioh no application foer pension may be made. Honourable
gentlemen will remember that there is a l'imitation to nine years aSter discharge. The Bill
as we received it from the House of Commnous provided for the complete remnoval of
any ti-me limitation. On tihis dlause t.he Committeeafeter much consideration caýme to the
conclusion that that should lie granted., and

the clause stands as contained in the Bill
brought fr.om. the Commons.
Now, I aca coming to section 25, which is
considered perhaps the most important clause
of the Bill. This section provides for the
paymexat of a pension to a widow who married
a member of the forces after tîhe appearance
of the injury or disease resulting in death.
This -is a fundamantal and radical change in
the pension law and one of mementous consequenices. This section of the Bill was considered by the members of the Committee
as extremely difficuIt of interpretation and
also of application. The principle of the
presen-t ýlaw has been in force sinca June, 1916,
a period of twelve years. Your Committee
considers it inadvisa"ble that any change cf
sncb a fuindamental and radical nature should
lie introduced in the Pension Act. I feel,

SENATE

634

however, honourable gentlemen, that though
I have a certain knowledge of the soldiers'
problems, I am not in a position to comment
upon the action of the Committee in as clear
a manner as you perhaps desire, and I have
thought that one of our honourable members,
who was also a member of the Special Committee and who has had an extensive experience with the sold-iers' probleins and was
himself a distinguidhed soldier in the army,
might supplement whatever I have said in
connection with dause 25. I am reasonably
sure that I may expect the honourable Senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) to
deal a little further with this important clause
25, which has to do, as I have said, with the
award or refusal of pension to the widow of
a soldier who married after the appearance
of his disability.
Honourable gentlemen, these are the only
observations I think I should make in connection with the report of the Committee.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
gentlemen, contrary to the popular notion,
the history of pension legislation for soldiers
is a comparatively short history. Prior to
the Great War there were pensions, it is
true, but they were limited in their scope
and application, and the wars which preceded
the Great War were also limited in the casualties that resulted. Pension legislation such
as we have it to-day is of comparatively
recent growth and may be said to date from
about the year '15 or '16. All the nations
who took part in the war have produced pension legislation, and there has been a great
deal of liason amongst the various nations
and much consultation on the part of each
with regard to the law in other countries. In
a general way the principles of pension law
are fairly common throughout the whole
world. We in this country have reference
to British legislation, American legislation,
and to the legislation of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Newfoundland; and
we also have occasion to look at French and
German legislation. The pension law of all
countries, and of our own in particular, is
highly technical.
Only a man with legal
training can fairly grasp the principles involved. So technical is this particular subject, that it has almost attained to the dignity
of a branch of the law. In addition to legal
training, one ought to have some knowledge
of the ex-service men and their problems to
be in a position to thoroughly understand the
law and its administration.
In dealing with this Bill the Senate Committee followed its usual practice, which is,
first of all, to ask: What does the clause
Hon. Mr. BELAND.

mean? How will it operate? and, What will
it cost? These are the three avenues by
which the Committee approached the various
clauses of the Bill.
Now, I am going to discuss only one particular clause, and I shall endeavour to discuss it in such a way as to make clear to
the House and to the country the reason for
the action of the Senate Committee with
respect to it. Since 1916, as my honourable
friend the Chairman of the Committee (Hon.
Mr. Béland) bas pointed out, the principle
underlying this particular section bas been
that a woman who married a man subsequent
to the appearance of his disability was not
entitled to a pension. In other words, in the
case of a woman who marries a man knowing
that he has a disability due to an injury
received in the service, the country is under
no obligation, since, in theory, she married
that man knowing that he had a disability
from which he subsequently died.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? How would
the woman know this? Only a7doctor could
know it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is one of
the difficulties that I will touch upon as I go
along.
The converse of that proposition is that the
State owes something to the widow of a
soldier whose marriage took place prior to
the appearance of the disability. The policy
of the law as laid down in 1916, was, I submit, to guard the State against the designing
woman who married a soldier who had, a
disability from which he might die. The
glaring example before Parliament at that
time was the condition of affairs prevailing
in the United States following the American
Civil War, where, apparently, according to
the law, the widow of a pensioned soldier
was entitled upon his death to at least part
of his pension, and where young women of
eighteen, nineteen and twenty were marrying old men of eighty or so who were receiving pensions, and upon the death of whom
they continued to draw pensions for many
years. Now let me repeat. The policy of the
law in Canada in 1916 was that a woman
who married a man subsequent to the appearance of his disability was not entitled to a
pension in the event of -his death. The Bill
as brought down proposed to change that principle. and to admit that a woman who married
after the appearance of the disability was
entitled to a pension. The argument in support of that can be briefly stated. There
might have been an engagement to marry

JUNE 1, 1928
previaus ta the enlistmnent of the soldier, an
engagement which hie was bound ta carry out.
Secondly, it rnight be, and it has been argued,
that the country ought not ta penalize a man
who bas earned' jts gratitude by suifering a
disability during service, by rafusing a pension ta his widow in the avent of his deatb.
Sa we have before us these clauses which
are intended ta widen the scope of our lagislation with regard ta widows, and ta alter
the principle ta which I referred a marnent
aga, by providîng that in certain cases the
widow of a pensioner wha married subsequent
ta the appearance of the disability should be
pensioned.
Now, the operation of aur law in this particular regard, and the operation of this particular clause in the Act, cails for sympa thatia
consideration. 1 shahl axplain. A man ta
get a pension under aur iaw must show that
the disability from which he suifera is due
ta an injury wbich. be raceived while in the
service. I arn not now speaking so much
of the case of the man who lost a leg while
in the service, and wbo was pensioned from
the date of his demobilization, as of the case
of the man who was discharged frorn the service apparantly fit, and who, thrae or four
yaars afterwards, developed a dlisabllity tracea;ble bo an injury received while in the service.
If you lika, we wilI take the case of such a
man wbo, disohargad physically fit in 1919,
devalops in 1923 a disability which hae proves
is due ta an înjury receivad while in the service, and who thereupon is awarded a pension by the Board of Pension Commissioners.
In 1919 hae is fit-nothing wrong as far as
anyone can sea; in 1920 or 1921 ha marries;
in 1923 hae gats bis pension, and in 1925 ha
dies and his pension ceasas. Now the question is whether his widow is entitled ta a
pension. llnder aur law the question arises,
first of ail: Did ha dia of his pansionable disability; and, secondly, if ha did, did the widow
marry him previaus or subsaquent ta the appearanca of his disability? You will remiemaber that I said that when ha himself appliad
for a pension hae had, ta show that the disability for whicb hae was pensianed in 1923
was attributable ta bis service; consequantly
it had ta ha shown that bis illness -of ta-day
want back througb bis documents, through
the evidenca that can ba produced, ta the
tima when ha was in the service, and that
hae suffered the injury or disease upon which
bis disability is based. Now cames the widoSv
ta dlaim a pension. Sha says: "I married him
subsequent ta the appearance of the disability,
anid hae died of a pensionable disability." But
the Board of Pension Commissioners already

bas on file the evidence upon which the pension was made ta hirn, whiah shows that the
disability from which hie was suffering was
incurred while in the service; and in the case
of sa diseasas of the system it is stated
'by the law as interpreted by the Commission
that the injury or disease appeared while ini
the service. Consequently the widow is not
entitled to a pension, because she married
him subsequent to the appearance of the
disability.
Having regard to what 1 said, that the purpose of the law was to proteet the State against

been granted to this man because bis disability
was due to service; and when she applies for
a pension she is told that she married him
subsequent Vo the appearance of the disability,
because it was upon evidence of that disability that t~he pension was grante-d to him.
What it cornes to is this: the evidence upon
which the pension is granted to the soldier
himself is the very evidence that precludes
the woman from getting a pension.
1 venture to say, while not disclo-sing what
was said or done in the Committea, that the
members of the Committea were very sympaI think the
thetic towards that situation.
members of the Committea realized that there
was in the law a forrn of injustice to widows in
this catagory, and that they would have liked
to flnd a formula of words which would ta
somne extent deal with the situation. But the
Naw, if
difficulty was to ftnd the formula.
we take the Bill as brought down, we find in
section 25 an alltempt utpon the part of the
members of a Select Committee of the other
House to deal with the situation, and in subparagraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4, they go inta partieulars as to the means wharedby a woman
who bas married a man after the appearante
of his disability may coine in for a pension.
But upon applying our three tests to these
First, we find

difficulty in understanding what they mean.
Again; whlen we seek ta ascertain how they
would oparate, we find ourselves confronted
with ýdifficulty, bacause, for instance, one of
those clauses provides-I arn just quoting it
ini a rough way-that a woman may have a
pension if she has gone to the Commission
and received a certificate from the Commission

636

SENATE

that the man was not likely to die of his pensionable disability.
Well, it is obvious to
anybody that nio medical man is going to
give a certificate that a person will not die
of a particular disease.
I cannot see the
use of passing a set of clauses which purport
to give relief, when, with the knowledge that
we have of how reasonable professional men
will interpret the law, we know that they are
no good at all.
It would be a mockery, in
my judgment, to pass these clauses which we
have difficulty in understanding and applying, and when we know, at least, that under
them it is impossible to give any benefit at
all.
On the other hand, if an interpretation is
given to the clauses which might be given,
and if the clauses are administered as they
might be administered, from the information
that we had before us, it is alleged that the
cost to the country would be $1,400,000 annually. I do not think the Committee shied
so much at these clauses because of the
amount as because they could not understand them, and could nat believe that they
were workable if they did understand them.
We then sought some alternatives. We
had a clause sent to us by an honourable
gentleman in the other House to take the
place of these clauses. To that the Committee gave most careful consideration. While
it was clearer than the clauses in the Bill, it
nevertheless laid upon the Board of Pension
Commisisoners the task and the duty and the
responsibility of interpreting a clause which
left the whole matter somewhat in this situation: that Parliament would be passing a
clause which pretended to ameliorate the
condition of those widows, but under which
the Commission would be unable to grant relief. We would then stand before the country as persons not realizing the importance
of what we were doing, or as placing the Commission in the position of not granting the
amelioration which Parliament intended. In
either case the situation is bad.
Then we had before us another clause.
That clause was vague and indefinite, and
what the Commission might do under it no
one could say. Again we found ourselves in
much the same position.
Perhaps it would be well to put these
clauses in the record. I have here the clause
submitted 'by an honourable gentleman in
the other House who frankly admited to us
to put it midly, that the clauses in the Bill
were of questionable value, and in place of
which he offered the following alternative:
No pension shall be paid to the widow of a
member of the forces who was married to lim
Hon. Mr.

GRIESBACH.

after the appearance of the injury or disease
which resulted in his death unless in the
opinion of the Commission the condition of
such member of the forces was at the time of
the marriage such that it would be reasonable
to anticipate that the injury or disease would
not result in death.

As to that clause the Committee applied
the simple test of asking the officers of the
Commission: "How many men have you a
record of who married subsequent to the
appearance of their disability and who are
now dead?" The answer was: "We have 700
such men." Then the Committee said: "In
applying this clause to their cases would the
wiidows receive a pension, or would they
not?" The answer of the Commission was:
"They would not, for how could we now admit that, when the woman married the man,
claiming to believe that he was not likely to
die of this particular disease, and when in
point of fact Le is now dead, and died of
his pensionable disability?" So that under
this proposed clause, according to the advice
of the Commissioners, the very class of
widows in whose interest the clause was introduced would be ruled out.
Then we con'sidered a clause submitted by
service men themselves:
Section 25. No pension shall be paid to the
widow of a member of the forces if after due
investigation the Commission is of the opinion
that she married him knowing that he was
suffering at the time from an injury or disease
which she might. after prudent enquiry, expect
would result in his early death.
Applying this clause to the 700 men now
dead, whose widows married them after the
appearance of the disability, and whom it is
now hoped to benefit by this clause, here,
aga'in, these women would be ruled out, because the Commission is asked to say that
the widow married him knowing he was suffering at the time from an injury or disease
which would result in his early death, as she
might have known affer prudent inquiry. Because the men are now dead of their pensionable disabilities, the Commission is bound
to find that when those widows married them,
they must be presumed to have known that
early death would result.
Well, going back to the beginning, I think
I may say that the Committee was sympathetic in respect to the law as iit now is. The
Committee was confronted with this simple
question: Shall we depart from the principle
of the law that the woman who marries a
man after the appearance of the disability
shall not have a pension? And, if we depart
front that principle, what formula of words
shall we use to benefit these particular people,

JUNE 1, 1928
wit.hout opening the door so wide that the
cost to the country will be more týhan the
country can bear?
Throug-hout this discussion, not only this
year but in previous years, it lias been a
question of a formula of words; and, aithougha
I belong to the class of persons I described
as being the most likely to know this Iawa member of the legai profession, a otudent
oi this particular law, and an ex-service man
-I arn bound to confess that with ail the
thought 1 have been able to, give it I was
unable to submit to the Cornmittee or to this
Huse a formula of words which wouid permit this country to depart from the principie
establisrhed twelve years ago, with the possibility of con.ferring a benefit upon the clams
th-at we have in mi, and at the saine tirne
safeguarding this -country against the expenditure which it ought flot be asked to bear.
lion. J. A. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, it bas been suggested that I ohould make
a brief reference to one other section in the
Bill, section 12, what is commonly called the
meritorlous section of the Pension law. It
will be renernbered that under the old law,
if a soldier was debarred from applying for
pension on accounit of some of the provisions

of the law, and if hie had a specially meritorious case. hie could apply for a pension n-otwîthstanding the fact that the provisions of
the Act deharred him from doing so. I put
extra ernphagis upon the words, a specially
snerit-orious case.

Under the nid law an application could be
made either to the Board of Pension Commissioners or to the Board of Appeýal, and

the mai ority of each of those boards had to
condur before a pension of this class couid he
granted.
In the operation of that iaw difficulties have
arisen.
It can he readily conceived tha-t
where an application was made to one board,
it would agree, but when referred Vo the
other board there might lie disagreement,
without any right of appeal to, any other
party. In other words, in some cases the applicant feli betiween two stools, and i-t was
feit by those interested that if possble there
should be some change made in the law.
As a consequence, we have the provisions as
they stand in ùhis Bill in section 12.
As the Bill stands, it provides that an apphication in the first instance may be rnade to
the

Board

of

Pension

Commissioners--the

Commission-and, if they agree, then a menitorious pension is granted.
If they disagree,
or refuse to gran1tthe pension, then an appeai
lies to, the Appcal Board, and if that Board
grants the pension the matter is settled.
In

other words, instead -of the application being
rnade to tlie two boards, as under the nid
Iaw, with the proviso, that bath boards must
agree, we now have the proposai that the application be made in the first instance to the

Pension Comm-issioners, and if they agree
the pension is granted. If they do not agree,
then an appeal !;es to the Appeal Board, which
setties the matter one way or another.
We considered the snatter at very great
lcngth, and after much discussion finally came

te the conclusion that we shouId amend that
clause, and I wili state briefiy the general
purport of our amendment. It is this: that
in evcry case of this kind, an application
should be made in the first instance to, the
Board of Pension Commissioners, in the samne
way that any person applies for a pension.
That is te enable the Pension Coýmmissioners
te determine the fact that the person apýplying

is not entitled, stnictly speaking, to a pension
onder the provisions of the law. Once that
is determined, we thought it advisabie that,
instead of the application for meritorieus pension being suhmittcd to, the two boards separately, we should provide an entirely new

board, to consist of two members of the Board
of Pension Commissioners and two memliers
of the Appeal Board; 'that those four should
conigtitute a separate court to consider -the
merits of the case.

After a great deai of discussion we carne to
the conclusion ýthat in the vast mai ority of instances those four wouid be able to reach a
conclusion; in other words, there would noV
be divisions, two against two.

In case there

should be a division, we made the further
provision that when the members of this new
board stand two for and two againgt the
application. then a judge of the Exchequer
Court of Canada should lie called in to decide,
and his decision should be final. That is a
radical change frorn the present provisions of
the Act so far as the administration of the
iew is concerned. bit after fully disoussing thse
matter with both the Commissioners and the

Board of Appeal, as well as with the returned
soidiers thernselves-in other words, ail parties
interested-it was gcnerally conceded that
this provision would be better than those that
stand in the present law.
Hon. A. H. MACDONELL: Honýourable
gentlemen, I have here Vwo tables of figures

Re-establishment, and which were before the

Hon. J. J. DON-NELLY: Honourable gentlemen, althotîgh 1 was not a member of tihe
Consmittee. i-t wa-s my privilege to attend the
sitýtings, and I wish to commend the members
for the diligence and ability they gave to the
discussions. I do flot rise for the purpose of
offoring any objection to the findings of the
Comnyittee, but merely to place myseif on
record as objecting to a re-mark which was
made by the honourable member for Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Grrie-sba.dh) when explaining one of the clauses of the Bill. If I understoýod him correctly, ho took the position
that only members of the bar. or legal genHon. Mr. MACDONELL

tlemen, were capable of fully understanding
the question that was undor discussion.
Now, that brought to my attention an article
-wýhicli I read :n the Library this morning.
It wvent on to say that the legal profession
wvas ovcrcrowded, addlng that, it wa's the
easiest profession in Canada to which to gain

that profes,-ion was overcrowded was that the
gentlemen who presided over the examinations did flot bar anynne unless bis lack of

JUNE 1, 1928
only reason for rising. I decidedly objeat
that we shoudd place ourselves on record as
assenting ta the remarks of the honourable
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I arn very sorry,
honourable gentlemen, if I misled the Bouse.
My knowledge of the law prior ta the war
was confined to the statutes of the Province
af Alberta, and during my absence, when my
back was turned, the Legislative Assembly
of the Province af Alberta amended all the
law I ever knew.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
is on the motion for concurrence in this report.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen. 1 did not rise more promptly because
I supposed we were about ta adjourn at
1 o'clock. Do we go on?
Saine Hon. SENATORS:

Go on.

If the discusHan. Mr. DANDURAND:
sion ie over at half-past one and we dispose
af these two Bills, we need not return in the
afternoon, but may adjourn ta Tuesday.
But, if the discussion is to expand beyond
haîf an hour, I would say that we should
adjourn until 3 o'clock.
I hop)e not ta
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR:
expand the discussion beyond haîf an hour.
I would like ta second the observation of
the honourable gentleman on my lef t (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly), that somne of us who are not
members of the legal profession are capable
af understandîng and interpreting the English
language. I ame not too modest to claire
soine proficiency in that respect myseîf.
When, just now, 1 heard the hanourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Macdoneîl) read the scale af payments by several
countries towards the victires of the war, it
seemed ta me a matter of very great regret
that in a country sa generous as Canada
appears ta be, even .by comparison with aur
more wealthy neighbours, we should be coinpelled ta sentence all peneioners to a life of
celibacy or ta throw overboard their widows
-seven hundred of whoma are said to be on
the list to-day-for no better reason than
that a Committee of the Sonate af Canada
cannat find words ta express the idea in the
minds of members of the Bouse of Caremons
in sending ta us this Bihl for dealing with the
widows of pensioners. I think that is no
reasan at all. I cannot admit for a moment,
and there must be many mombors af this
Bouse who also will be boath ta admit, that
there is any idea, of aur obligation towards

639

the widows of Canadian soldiers, as called for
by our duty as citizens, that we cannot find
words to express. 1 would like to see somne
much better reason than that put forward,
and 1 think it would be worth while for the
Senate to seiid the report back ta the samne
committee, or saime ,other committee, that
they might stay with it until they could find
words to exipress the benevolent intentions
of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: A committee of laymen.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: For myseif as a miemaber of the Senate, I would be ashamed to go
hack to the pensioners in the locality where
I live, with whom I have had a good deai
of association, and tell them that we had to
forsake the widows -because we could flot
find words to express what we would like to
do. That, honourable gentlemen, is the proposition placed bof ore us at this moment, that
we should deli-berately 'throw out saime pro-.
vision, admitted by the House of Commons,
because we think it is flot exactly right and
we cannot improve upon it.
I will not labour that question funther, but
will leave to the common-sense, of this House
the question whether or not we should condemn all pensioners ta a life of celilbacy or
should desert the widows of pension-ers who
unexpectely die. That ie the situation with
wich we are conironted.
As ta thle other matter, to which the hionourable gentleman fromn Salteoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) called attention, I would like to
make this sugestion, tvhat the experience of
soldiers with the Appeal Board has not led
them- to expeet very much fromn any combirnation made from the present Pension
Board and the presenrt Appeal Board as a
ne'w court ta whom they sihould present their
appeab. I have had ta do with several
appeals hand-led under tihe present system.
My experienoe is that tlie Appe-al Board is
absolutely futile, and that when the Appeal
Board does give a decision over-riding the
Pension Board, and the Pension Board has
to give effect ta that decision by assessling
the amount of pension coming to the claimant,
theY have taken it, out on t.he pensianer by
giving to him only the verv simallest nominal
Pension that the law provides.
I have in mmid -a particularly shocking case
which has been presented in every quarter
where a case can be presen-ted, but without
relief, and there seems ta be noa possibility
of relief. It is the case of a man accepted
as a fit soldier. He passed three boards in
Canada and tïwo or three boards -in England,
and served sixteen months in France. As

640

SENATE

the victim of an explosion while in the fighting fine, he finds himself with a paralyzed arm,
an arm now withered and bent se that he cannot straighten if out. When he came before
the Pension Board for a pension. they found
from his statement on the application, that
he hurt this arm when he was a child, and
they said: -Ah! A pre-war disabil.ity: nothing doing for vou."
He was successful before the Appeal Board.
He got a comrnittee of two doctors and one
layman there. They realized that it was
absolutely impossible that that man could
hav e been acccpted by any recruiting officer,
or commanding officer, or board of inspection anywhere, or could do duty at ail with
an arm like that. They sent him back to
tho Pension Board with a decision that he
was pensionable. The Pension Board then
declined to make any examination of him.
According to the authority of their own letter
to a Minister in the other House, who took
up the case with t'hem. they said that what
they did then with that man was simiply
to make an arbitrary award without any examination-an arbitrary award that his disability was 25 per cent, but that only 5 per
cent of thaft was due to war and that man,
with his arm withered and disabled as a result
of his service in France, is paid the magnificent sum of $375 a month as compensation
for hia disability, and he has no appeal.
Now, there is a combination of the present
Appeal Board and the present Pension Board.
I for one have no confidence in any new
Board constituted under those circumstances.
If yon ask for a suggestion I would say that
pensioners should have the right that -is cormon to citizens of the country. If we are
guaranteed anything by any of the laws of
Canada and we do not secure it-anything
except a pension-we are at liberty to take
the mitter before a judge of a court. It
seems to me that in the matter of pensions,
when a soldier feels that he is entitled to a
pension and is unjustly refused it, he should
be able te take his claim before a court,
just as he would take any other cilaim. Until
we get away from Government Bureaus and
refer such matters to a court we shall never
allay the unrest on the part of the soldier
population of Canada arising from the fact
that they are subjected to so many disabilities when they attempt to deal with the
Bureaus as at present constiituted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I alone in the Senate stand as a
100 per cent disability man. My disability
became evident when, some years ago, I took
fhis seat as representative of the Government.
I bring the ministeriad measures before this
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Chamber, and my mandate is to explain and
defend them. I have not the freedom of
ection which aIl my colleagues enjoy. To this
extent I am handicapped.
This Bill has come from the Commons with
the endorsation of the Government. It was
the result of the work of a Committee of the
House of Commons.
Likewise the Senate
Committee returns tlhe Bill to this Chamber
-fter having duly studied if. I will bow te its
decision, hoping that it may meet wi'th the
approval of the other House.
The motion was agreed to.

RETURNED SOLDIERS' INSURANCE

BILL
REPORT

OF

SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

Hon. IH. S. BELAND moved concurrence in flie report of the Speciat Committee
to whom was referred Bill 290, an Act to
atmend the Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Honourable gentlemen, fliere is ounly one important clause in
this Bill: it is the clause whieh provides for
the revival of the returned soldiers' privilege
of applying for insurance. This privilege expired under the stafute five years ago, in 1923.
Now it is proposed in the Bill that came from
the House of Commons to revive that privilege and extend it for five years longer, that
is, to the year 1933. The Committee. of which
I was Chairman, amended this section by
reducing the five years to one year, or rather
extending to all returned soldiers the privilege
of applying for insurance until the 1st day of
Septenber, 1929.
Hon. A. H. MACDONELL: Honourable
gentlemen, I have a memorandum addressed
to the
olinoturable Leader of this Chamber
by Mr. Finlayson, Superintendent of Iosurance, regarding this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
before the Committee.

Which was laid

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Laid before the
Committee.
Re Bilt 290. an Act to anend the Returned
Soldiers' Insuirance Act:
Section 2 of this Bill provides that applications for insurance may be received under
the Act from July 1, 1928, up to July 1, 1933,

a period of five years.

JUNE 1, 1928
This Insurance Act was first of all for a
period of one year; then it was renewed for
two years, and since 1923 it has been closed.
The returned soldiers asked to have it opened
indefinitely, but the Commons considered that
was too much, and in the Bill which they
passed the period was extended to five years.
There are in Canada 400,000 returned men.
Of that number 27,000 have taken out policies
under ,this Act. If the privilege were to be
left open indefinitely, as men grew older and
became subject to bodily ailments, etc., they
would begin to apply for policies under this
Insurance Act, and the amount involved
would of course be too great for the State
to bear.
The Bill then came before us. This memorandum from Mr. Finlayson gives the information you would like to receive regarding
the proposed amendment:
The Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act was
passed at the Session of 1920 and came into
force on the lst day of September of that year.
The Bill had been originally drafted for introduction at the Session of 1919, but its introduction into the House was postponed until
the Session of 1920.
As originally drafted, the Bill provided for
applications being received thereunder for a
period of one year from the date of its coming
into force.
During the discussion of the Bill before the
Banking and Commerce Committee, a suggestion was made that this period should be extended to two years, and the undersignedThat is, Mr. Finlayson-under examination by the Committee, made
the following statement:
"We must remember this, that the longer
we keep this open the greater selection there
is going to be against the Government, because
there will be disabilities arising due to causes
other than service. These men will have the
unqualified right to come in. The time should
not be too long, because the Government bas
te be protected."
The Committee fixed the period at two years
so that no applications would be received after
September 1, 1922.
At the Session of 1921 the Committee considered a suggestion for an extension of the
period te five years, but this was rejected by
the Committee.
At the Session of 1922 an amendment was
adopted extending the period for one year, but
restricting the classes of persons who might
insure under the Act. This classification is
contained in the schedule to the amendment of
that year. Chap. 42.
No further extension was thereafter made
and the door was closed to further applications
on and after September 1, 1923.
The restriction to one year was placed in
the Bill in view of the fact that while all the
disabilities then existing might be safely
assumed te be due to service, that assumption
would soon cease to be justifiable.
That assumption is certainly not justifiable
at the present time, nearly ten years after the
end of the war. Persons who had been discharged from service fit have developed impair56109-41

641

ments due to normal physical deterioration, and
other persons now fit will develop such impairments during the next five years.
All these persons, who are not at the time
of application seriously ill, may have their
applications accepted, and even if they are
seriously ill, if they have dependents and if
their disability is pensionable, they will have
the right to be insured.
In the latter case the value of the pension
is deducted from the claim, but it must be
remembered that with the lapse of time the
commuted value of the pension becomes
steadily less so that the relief from this
provision is a decreasing quantity.
The chief danger in the proposal te revive
the Act for the purpose of new applications
is that persons net seriously ill at the time of
application may yet have illness of a character
that later on will cause excessive mortality,
and when it is considered that there are
probably 400,000 returned men eligible for this
insurance the danger of loss to the Government
is very great.
There is the further danger that at the end
of five years every argument that bas been
advanced for the revival of the Act now can
be, and probably will be, used to have the Act
extended for another five years, and so on
indefinitely.
Since 1920 the rates for selected lives
charged by insurance companies have decreased,
both on the participating and on the nonparticipating plans, this being due to the
general improvement in mortality on selected
lives. The result is that there is no inducement at the present time for insurable lives
among returned men te take advantage of this
Act. They can get insurance protection at
lower rates elsewhere. There is, however, the
danger that men now insurable in other conmpanies may be deterred from effecting insurance
at the present time by reason of their knowledge of the fact that even if they become iII,
or even seriously ill, they still have a chance
for insurance under this Act. They may rely
on this assumed guarantee of insurability to
put off taking the protection and, in the event
of sudden death or the occurrence of serious
illness excluding them from this insurance, their
dependents are left without protection.
There is always a tendency on the part of
insurance prospects to put off securing their
insurance as long as possible, and the revival
of this Act is an invitation to such persons to
delay another five years.
There would be practically the same objection
te a renewal of the Act for even one year, as
it may be safely assumed that further extension
of the period would be demanded and probably
granted a year hence.
If there are now returned men whose
dependents are entitled to protection by reason
of their service, in the event of their death,
the necessary provision should be made by
amendment to the Pension Act.
As to the amount of loss to be apprehended,
this will depend on the amount of insurance
written.
If insurance te the amount of
$50,000,000 is written and if it is assumed that
the mortality to be experienced will be twice
as great as that shown by the table on which
the rates are based, the loss to the Government
on the firt year's operation would be approximately $500,000.
If the excess mortality is
50 per cent of the tabular mortality, the loss
would be one-half of that amount, or $250,000.

EIsED EDrION

SENATE

642

This loss would accumulate with interest subject to the reduction on account of the accumulation of reserve, but subject to increase with
an increasing adverse mortality.
In considering this scheme there must be
taken into account the expense of administration, none of which has been taken into account
in the accounting of the Fund. This would
include not only the expense directly connected
with the administration of the Act, but the
overhead expense and expense such as postage,
rentals and other services provided by the
Government.
Taking everything into consideration, it
would appear to be more in the public interest
to have the Act remain closed as respects new
applications and to make the necessary provision for dependents and returned men by way
of amendment to the Pension Act.
Respectfully submitted,
G. D. Finlayson,
Superintendent of Insurance.
In order to make it possible for the wives of
returned soldiers, who married after the
appearance of disability, to be provided for,
we have agreed to the reopening of the
insurance privilege for one year. This insurance privilege is open te all returned men
under the regulations previously applied. and
the limit of insurance is $5,000. The Committee desires to point out that while this
privilege is open to all returned men, yet
the Committee bad particularly in mind
returned pensioners who married after the
appearance of the disability.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, from what I have heard of the dis.cussion-and I have net heard it all-it
appears to me very clear that the Committee
were most desirous of providing something
for the widows of returned men who married
after the appearance of the disability. The
service men have been led to expect that
seme legislation would be brought down which
would assist them in their desire to obtain
something for the widows of returned men
The Committee admit that
in this class.
they find it difficult to draft a clause properly
covering such a situation. The case is not
altogether as bas been stated. The widows
of returned men are net all designing women;
many of them married soldiers expecting them
net to die, but to live; nevertheless some of
them did die and leave a number of dependents.
Those are cases which certainly should appeal
to us.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Would my honourable
friend allow me? Does the honourable genthe
to children amongst
tleman refer
dependents? The children are pensionable.

KENT NORTHERN RAILWAY
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BOURQUE inquired of the Government:
1. Have negotiations been reopened for the
acquisition of the Kent Northern Railway, and
if so, with whom?
2. When were negotiations reopened?
3. Is there any correspondence on the subject,
and if so, first, with whom; second, what are
the respective dates of letters and telegrams on
the subject?
4. Is the Government aware that the people
of the districts that said railway serves are
compelied to pay excessive rates as compared
to Canadian National Railways rates?
5. What action has the Government taken to
carry into effect regarding this railway the
following recommendation of the Royal Commission on Maritime claims (Duncan Commission, page 41, section 31):"Kent Northern Railway.
Representations were made to us on behalf
of the population of the area covered by the
Kent Northern Branch Line Railway, as to the
prejudice being suffered by reason of the unsatisfactory service rendered by that line. It
appears that at various times proposals have
been made that the Government acquire this
property and at one time negotiations had
reached the point where provision was made by
Appropriation Act, No. 2, chapter No. 52,
Statutes of Canada, 1918, for its acquisition at
a price of $60,000, but as this was not acceptable to the owners the sale vas not consumated.
It was represented to us that the present was
an appropriate time to reopen negotiations on
that basis and we recommend that this be
done."?
T have an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer for the honourable gentleman, but as
T do not see him in his seat, I wili place it
upon Hansard.
The trecommendation of the Duncan Commission was that negotiations for the acquisition of the Kent Northern be reopened on the
basis of the offer of $60,000, which the owners
had previously deolined to consider. As yet
no intimation has corne from the owners that
they are prepared te negotiate on that basis.
Their last proposal of which there is record,
was that the Government should pay back
to the stockholders what they had put into
the property, which at that time (1923) was
said to have been $125,000.

643

JUNE 1, 1928
In 1925 the present management looked
over the property, but decided that the
proposai that the line should be taken over
could flot be ccnsidered~ at that time.
The question of the possible acquisition of
the line will have further attention in connection with railway matters generally as
affecting the Maritime Provinces.

commîttee was appointed by the Senate to
inquire into the Greater St. Lawrence Waterways and when the inquîry got under way
several citizens and newspaper correspondents
who desired to attend the hearings, and, in
some cases, to offer information, found that
they were excluded. This exclusion lias flot
been maintained throughout but the present
position is that no one can tell until the committee meets if the session is to be secret or
open.

The Senate adjourned until Tuesday next
at *8 p.m.

1 arn at a loss to understand how anyone
could become imnpressed with the idea that the
hearings of the Committee were not wide
open.
I neyer gave any such direction except
on one day in the early stages.
On thýat one
oocasion the public were not admitted for the
reason that the only business was to decide
about some witnesses proposed to be called.
That meeting only lasted a few minutes. No
witnesses were heard.
Lest I should be criticized, I reminded the
Committee of the Senate mule mentioned. The
Committee at once unanimously approved of
the open door.
Moreover, the Committee
had decided to print the evidence of witnesses,
and the Senate approved. As usual, the press
has been supplied with copies.
Having
decided to publish the evidence of witneess
and distribute sucli e'vidence, why should the
Committee attempt "secrecy" by hearing witnesses rbehind closed doors?
If there were doubt in any person's mind in
this regard, I was always accessible to anyone who desired to, be informed.
The Clemk
cf Committees was also always accessible.
It
would have beeui an easy matter to make
enquiry-quite
as easy as to send the
inaccurate report I have read.
The Committee have been aeeking information and have nothkng to hide.
It is regrettaible that in respect to sueh an important
national matter an inaccurate and misleading
report in regard to the Committee has been
published.
I should add that as far as I know only one
newspaper published the inaccurate report.

ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAY INQUIRY
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, on a question of privilege, not relating
to myseif personally, but to the Senate in
general, I wish to, direct attention for one
or two moments to an article which. appeared
on June 2nd in the Manitoba Free Press. The
article is headed. "Senate Secrecy," and is
apparently fromn the staff correspondent.
It
is dated fromn Ottawa, and reads as follows:
Ottawa.-The 8enate of Canada lias the distinction of being the only legislative body in
Canada whose committees are required by rule
to ait in camera. The committees of the House
of Commons and of the various provincial
Legisiatures are always open to the public
unlesa the members decide otherwise, and then
such a decision governs only the conunittee
meeting in progress.
The Senate, apparently, decided to reverse
the usual order of procedure and to that end
included in the rules the following provisions:
"Senators, though not of the committee, are
not excluded from coming in and speaking (at
meetings of committees), but they muet flot
vote. T bey sit behind those who are of the
committee.
No other persons, unless commanded to attend, are to enter at any meeting
of a committee of the Senate or at any conference."
This ruie, extraordinary as it may seem, lias
not been a dead letter in the rule book of the
Upper House. Only a f ew days ago it was
enforced in a ve<ry remarkable manner. A

PENITENTIARY SERVICE
INQUIRY AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. J. D. TAYLOR rose in accordance
with the following notice:
Tiat lie will call attention to communientions
between high officers of the Penitentiaries
Branci, and between these officials and the
Minister of Justice, indienting grave

ialadmsin-

istrationi of the Penitentiarv Service; and will
inquire wliether or not the Goverinent will
make the situation thus disclosed the subject
of judicial or other independent investigation.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I have to
present to-night a plain, unvarnished tale of
official turpitude protected by a Ministry of
Justice. Whether or not the Ministry' of
Justice is to be found an accessory after the
fact I leave for the moment to be decided
upon the answer to the question of which
I have given notice.
The occasion for this inquiry is the dismissal of a warden in the Penitentiary Service of Canada, but the idea behind the inquiry involves something much more serious,
namely, the rights of Civil Servants generally, the employees of the Government
throughout Canada, to protection against acts
of tyranny on the part of departmental
officials their superiors, and the right of Civil
Servants generally to access to the Ministers
of the Crown in appeal from the subordinate officers directly over them. In the case
referred to the warden of the penitentiary on
duty at New Westminster had the honour
of occupying a very high place in the Civil
Service of Canada. By the action of this
House a few years ago the plane of the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND;

wardens was raised. They are not now
appointed to any special penitentiary, but are
appointed wardens in the penitentiary service of Canada, and are liable to be assigned
to any institution at the direction of the
Minister.
The charge of the penitentiaries of Canada
is by another Act, passed at about the same
tine. confidod specifically to the Miniter of
Justice at Ottawa.

It is truc that the Min-

ister acts, as a Minister must act, through a
subordinate, in this case the Superintendent
of Penitentiaries, but it is distin.ctily laid
down in the Act that the Supe rintendent is
onIv the creature of the Minister and that
the Minister is not absolved in any way fron
any responsibility by the fact that he acts
through the Superintendent of Penitentiaries.
The Minister is the man, and as I sec it, the
Minister's decision is entitled te be had on
every matter affecting the superior officers of
those institutions.
The officer affected by the instance I am
abbut to relate is not an adventurer, is not
a humble or insignificant individual with no
place in the community. Colonel Cooper
served gallantly in the war. He served in the
battalion taken overseas by the very gentleman who is now Superintendent of Penitentiaries. He was well known to this officer, General
Hughes, the Superintendent of Penitentiaries,
and because hc was well known and in four
years of gallant service overseas had established a reputation and satisfied his superior
officers of his ability and his fidelity to duty,
Captain Cooper was invited in 1920 to enter
the Penitentiaries Service. A letter inviting
himn said, "Yeu are the sort of man we want

JUNE 5, 1928
in our service," showing that his character
had been specially thought of before the invitation was issued to him. He was not a
man looking for a job; he was a good citizen
of Canada endeavouring to re-establish himself on his return fromn the war; was at liberty
because he was not yet re-established; was
known to be so by the officer in charge of
the penitentiaries, and invited to enter the
Penitentiaries Service.
So satisfactorily did the invitation result
that although Captain Cooper joined the
staff at St. Vincent de Paul as a guard and
office assistant to the Warden, there arising
necessity for strong and improved administration at the Manitoba Penitentiary, this officer
was promoted, after only one year's service,
to be a warden in the Penitentiaries Service
of Canada and was transferred to Manitoba.
In Manitoba his record appears to have
been pe.rfectly satisfactory, because after two
years' service there he was again transferred,
on the recommendation of the same General
Hughes, the Superintendent of Penitentiaries,
with a complimentary letter ¡praising him for
the way he had rejuvenated the Manitoba institution. He was transferred then to British
Columbia, where in the opinion of the Superintendent an improvement in the administration seemed to be imperative. He became
Warden in British Columbia in 1923 and has
been Warden there from that day to this,
without a single adverse report so far as he
knows. While he has knowledge of reports
of the most complimentary nature made on
him by the Superintendent and by the Inspectors, so far as the late Warden Cooper
knows there was no black mark against him
during the five years of his service as Warden
at New Westminster.
The rift in the lute came in September,
1927.
There was the usual semi-annual
visitation on the part of the Superintedent,
the Inspector, and another officer from
Ottawa. I use the word "visitation" advisedly,
because the movement of these officers upon
the several penitentiaries of Canada is a very
very solemu affair to those under them. There
are pomp and circumstance connected with
it that would do credit to a victorious general
visiting his main camp.
However, that is
another story. As I have said, the rift in
the lute occurred at the close of the visit of
September, 1927, when, after spending several
days there, the Superintendent, the Inspector
and the other officer, who, I think, was an
accountant-however, he does not corne into
the story-met Colonel Cooper in his own
house. They had told him how satisfactory
their inspection had been, and they mentioned, just before leaving, that there was

645

at New Westminster one little point of difference that they would like to clear up, because
iýt made friction in the establishment. That
point of friction was between two ladies of
the households of the penitentiary officials,
and, as the Superintendent gallantly and quite
correctly said: "This is none of my affair;
I do not want to go into it. Things are
running smoothly in this institution-I have
so reported elsewhere-and I would like you
to clear up this only item of friction that
there is." So he left New Westminster.
In ýconsequence of this request, Warden
Cooper addressed to him a few days later
the letter which I am about to read. Let me
say in passing that I dislike taking up the
time of the Senate in reading these letters,
but that, so far as I know, every attempt
hitherto made to bring these letters to the
attention of the Minister of Justice bas proven
abortive. I have been unable, and others who
have interested themselves in the case have
been unable, although we have been addressing the Minister since December last, to secure any evidence or any indication to lead
us to believe that the Minister has found
time to look into this correspondence, or that
he is at all acquainted with affairs as they are
at New Westminster. So far as we know, he
has relied solely upon the officer against whom
I now make this arraignment for whatever
it may be worth, and I know no other way
of insuring that this matter does come to the
attention of the responsible Minister and his
colleagues in the Government than by reading
the letters as I propose to read them.
I may say that these letters are marked
"secret and confidential," nearly every one
of them, but that after his dismissal from
office Colonel Cooper wrote to the Minister,
asking him to take cognizance of these letters,
although they were marked secret and confidential; that the Minister replied to him that
he could not ask the Superintendent for the
letters, because of these markings, but that
it was perfectly competent for Colonel Cooper,
the late Warden, if he so desired, to send them
directly to the Minister. Colonel Cooper has
assured me that he bas sent these letters
directly to the Minister. As I say, I have
not been able to see any evidence that the
Minister bas read them, but they are released
jointly by Colonel Cooper, who has delivered
them to me, and by the Minister of Justice,
who wrote to Cooper that he might forward
to him the confidential letters so that the
Minister might take official cognizance of
them.
I may say that I have omitted passages
from these letters. I am perfectly content

SENATE

646

that any honourable gentleman in the House
should read the passages I have omitted, but
they are purely personal paragraphs, affecting
people not in the story. With that reservation
I will read the letters.
Do I underHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stand that the honourable gentleman is reading letters written by Colonel Cooper, the
ex-Warden?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:

Yes, sir.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And not letters
from the Superintendent, marked confidential?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I intend to read a
letter from the Superintendent marked confidential, subject to the permission of the
Senate, on the ground, as I have said just
now, that these letters have been specifically
released by the person to whorn they were
addressed, and whose right, as I see it, is to
treat them as confidential or not to treat
thern as confidential, because they were really
intimidations received from his superior officer,
as to which ho had a right to complain to
the Minister upon receipt of them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But there are
two parties to the correspondence.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Surely, and the Minister, who is the superior of the Superintendent, has written to Colonel Cooper a letter.
which I have here, saying that there is no
objection to Colonel Cooper sending them
directly to the Minister so that they may
become official. And I may say that a motion
bas been made in another place-I think it
has been ordered, although as to that I am not
sure, but I know the motion has been made
-that this very correspondence be produced.
Here is the first of the letters:
Secret and Confidential.
September 17, 1927.
The Superintendent of Penitentiaries,
Ottawa.
Sir,
Referring to the discussions between us
during your recent visit, I yesterday called at
the residence of the Deputy Warden Trollope
and found him to be sufficiently recovered to
discuss business.
I told the Deputy Warden that you had
informed nie that requests had been made to
Ottawa for my removal on the grounds of lack
of harmony existing between us.
There is a passage that I omit.
The Deputy Warden asserted that when
questioned by you during the luncheon of
yourself and party at his bouse on the 12th,
ha had replied emphatically that there was
no trouble whatsoever between us and ho could
make no complaint of my treatment of him.

Hon. Mr.

TAYLOR.

I omit the rest of that letter. Any honourable gentleman who desires to see it is
quite welcome to it.
That is on September 17th. On October 1
Warden Cooper again addressed the Superintendent:
Secret and Confidential.
October 1, 1927.
Sir,
Referring to my letter of September 17, as
the Deputy Warden continued to be absent on
sick leave, I quietly looked into the situation
in the community. So far from there being
any feeling of resentment at the alleged lack
of harmony between the Deputy Warden and
myself, there is absolutely no suspicion of it
except in a small circle, and there, only from
the statements of the Deputy Warden's wife
herself. In this circle, her complaints have
hitherto been considered a matter for mild
amusement, but have now become boring.
The words of one husband were "I am sick
and tired of these continual complaints; I hate
to see her come into the bouse. My wife has
advised ber to forget this rankling bitterness
as she is only hurting herself".
I am sure that you yourself are becoming
tired of these repeated complaints to you,
apparently repeated and reiterated on each of
your annual visits, and equally denied each
time by ber husband.
Under these circumstances. I have come to
the conclusion that for me to take any action,
legal or otherwise, would be to give the complaints the notoriety the lady is evidently
seeking. I do, however, resent her attempt to
introduce "petticoat rule" into the administration of the Penitentiary.
I do not know if the untruthful statement
regarding the Assistant Auditor General
emanates from the same source, but would
again assure you it has no foundation in fact.
This campaign of calumny will continue until
the lady is definitely told that her attempted
interference in Penitentiary affairs will not be
tolerated.
This action would support the
Warden's authority and certainly make his
position more tolerable.
I would respectfully ask that should my
removal or transfer be under consideration by
the Honourable the Minister, that ho would
afiord ie an opportunity of being hoard before
arriving at a decision.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) H. W. Cooper.

person had suggested in the presence of the
Superintendent that this Warden Cooper, of
British Columbia, was a rather superior man,
who might in time be found very well fitted
to be Superintendent of Penitentiaries. Those
of us who remember the creation of the office
will recall that in finding a Superintendent of
Penitentiaries there was very great difficulty,
quite unparalleled, I think, in the history of
the Oanadian Civil Service. Parliament had
created an office with a large salary and very
great responsibility, an office very attractive
in every respect, and there was no person at

Superintendent seems to have taken great
umbrage at the suggestion, .particularly from
a man qualified to be Superintendent himself,
that he should be allowed to talk to the Deputy or the Minister, and this is what he
wrote back:
Office of Superintendent of Penitentiaries,
Ottawa, Oct. 8, 1927.
Private, Secret and Confidential and
not to be placed on file.
Dear Sir:
I note you have written officiallyLet me interrupt here to cal attention to
the fact that, while this letter is marked
"private and confidential and not to be placed
on file", it purports to be the answer to an
official communication, and therefore in a
sense becomes official itself, ntwithstanding
the indunction as to secrecy.
I note you have written officially, as well
as secret and confidentially, regarding a subject
that should not have been put on your file, nor
should any officer of the Penitentiary have been
permitted to write for you such a letter. I
hope you wrote it yourseif.
To digress again, this scolding letter was
not written by the Superintendent himself, but
bore the initials of the stenographer to whom
lie dictated it:
I note you have been discussing this matter
with a man outside the penitentiaryThat, I may say, is against the penitentiary
rules; you muet not mention anything about
the penitentiary to any one unless you are
superintendent, and then there are no rules.

647

I note you have been discussing this matter
with a man outside of the penitentiary and
quote what he is supposed to have said ta you
and the advice he gave to his wife. Now,
may I advise you, once and for all, the great
bulk of evidence and the consensus of the
opinion of every person who has mentioned
the matter to me, has been that Mrs. Cooper
is to blame; in fat, she has not confined her
activities to New Westminster or Vancouver,
but has come far east of there in her remarks
regarding Mrs. Trollope and not only Mrs.
Trolope, but has told people much nearer
here t han your place that the Trollope's were
supporting a motor car which they could not
afford and a number of other statements concerning them. Now, it is none of Mrs. Cooper's
business what they do and it is very peculiar
that all three of the officers from the Branch
who were at Mrs. Emery's little tea given for
us, remarked after leaving, of how Mrs.
Trollope endeavoured to show to those present
that there was no trouble existing, but in each
case was repelled by Mrs. Cooper. We all
saw Mrs. Trollope pass a plate of cake ta her,
and she refused it by shaking her head.
This is the official correspondence from the
man with the power of life and death over the
recipient of it:
But almost immediately after took a piece of
the sane cake from the same plate when offered
by another person.
That is, the lady changed her mind.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
have been in the cake.

It could not

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: The letter proceeds:
I have told you before, and I repeat it,
that Mrs. Trollope has never spoken one disrespectful word of Mrs. Cooper to me, and I
am assured by the other officers from this
Branch that what I have said in this respect
applies also to them.
Now we cannot allow the esprit de corps
of the institution to lie broken up by any
person. The individual does not count in the
matter, and I have repeatedly warned you that
this kind of thing must stop. I am given information since leaving your institution, of a
positive case of where Mrs. Cooper made disparaging remarks of Mrs. Trollope and not only
of Mrs. Trollope but about their inability to
afford what they were doing. I have never
known a case of this kind before in the
Penitentiary service. I warned you a year ago
of this very matter, but you disclaimed any
knowledge of such goings on or any act on
behalf of Mrs. Cooper against Mrs. Trollope.
It seems to me I have heard the phrase
"goings-on." I think that old ladies use the
term a good deal. He goes on:
I am responsible for both your appointment
and that of Trollope. I am interested in you
both and I put it up to you to see that this
undignified, unladylike squabble stops.
Now I do not wish to hear any more on this
subject. This letter is written to you not so
much as a penitentiary officer, but as that of a
friend. I put you where you are, I want to
stay behind you, I want to see things succeed,
but I want to see that my efforts are not going
to be frustrated. I will not hesitate to act if

JUNE 5,1928
Three gentlemen in responsible positions, take
the course, somewhat unusual in polite circles,
of watching Mrs. Cooper so closely that they
notice her refusal of a piece of cake from Mrs.
Trollope. Into this action, they read repulsion
by Mrs. Cooper of Mrs. Trollope's friendly advances, and gravely comment upon this after
leaving the bouse.
I omit a paragraph.
I regret to have to state unpleasant facts,
but it is the only way to clear up a situation
the unpleasantness of which did not orginate
with me or mine. Gossip is by no means confined to this Penitentiary, it apparently touches
every official of other Departments who visits
here, as shown by records, and the repetition
of a jesting remark by another Warden was
once the cause of a public call down at a Convention. Even the head of the Branch is not
left in peace as a person at an eastern institution claims to be able to repeat at first hand
derogatory remarks made by him concerning
the wife of an Inspector.
If the Superintendent is made the subject of gossip, I suppose
a Warden cannot expect to be exempted.
Referring to your remark that this is the
first case of the kind known, may 1, in no unkind spirit, but simply as a statement of fact,
point out that this is the first case where subordinates and their ivives have personal relationships and friendships with the Superintendent.
No Warden can give efficient service when
his support by his superior is called into question. To permit criticismi of him in drawing
rooms or there discuss Penitentiary matters,
strikes at the very root of the Warden's authority, and removes from him the calm confidence necessary to handle his staff and establish an esprit de corps.
I sincerely trust that out of this regrettable
discussion some good will accrue. Shall we accept your public declaration: "I hate a tittletattle; I have no use for a tale bearer; if there
is anything wrong, go to your Warden like a
man." Let this spirit be enforced uniformly,
letters making charges against officialsWardens or anyone else-be referred to the person accused, and while it is known that every
complaint will be investigated, the person complaining will be held responsible for its accuracy
and freedom from malice. If this is donc and
inspecting parties will refrain from visiting
subordinates and their wives or establishing
personal relationships with them the path of
a Warden will be smooth indeed and the main
obstacle to the efficient conduct of public affairs
removed.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) H. W. Cooper.
General W. St. Pierre Hughes, D.S.O.,
Ottawa.
My information is that this was the last
correspondence on the subject, the last open
chapter in the difference of opinion beitween
the Superintendent and the Warden.
The
Superintendent got busy at Ottawa. This
last letter was written at the end of October,
and late in December he secured an order
from the Minister for a special inquiry into

649

affairs at New Westminster, notwithstanding
that it was only in September that a regular
thorough inquiry had been made and the
institution found to be correct in every particular. There had been no escapes; there
had been no riots; there had been nothing
public-nothing except this correspondence
about a five o'elock tea, between the parties
in the meantime.
Yet the Superintendent
secured a special inquiry into the institution
-as I see it, a vendetta, directed to an officer
of the Department of Justice, to go out to
British Columbia and "get" this warden. I
use " get " in the sense in which it is used by
inm'ates of the penitentiary.
My information is that when the inquisitor
arrived there he made no general attempt to
inquire into affairs of the institution, but instead of that he sought out every employee
there whom Cooper had disciplined during his
whole five years, and even in those cases had
to use threats and intimidation to induce them
to say what they did, and even this evidence
was permitted to be taken down only to a
limited extent by the shorthand writer whom
he brought with him.
I am informed that any matters that those
unwilling witnesses mentioned that did not reflect upon the warden were exoluded from the
evidence. That is part of the inquiry which
I wish to have-whether anyone has presumed
to present to the Minister evidence procured under such conditions.
I am informed
thait in sone cases the information that was
given was obtained by threats and intimidation, and particularly by reading to those
officers the section from the Penitentiary Act
giving to any officer appointed by the Minister to hold special inquiry, the right to commit to the common jail for fourteen days any
person not properly answering his questions.
I am told that this was on ,the lips of this inquisitor with every witness he examined, and
iot only with ordinary witnesses, but that with
the warden-his superior in rank in the service-that he was just as truculent as he could
have been with the newest guard, and that
over and over again he threatened the warden
with comnitment to the common jail for
fourteen days because the warden wished to
amplify his answers 'to this junior Inspector
from the Justice Department.
To me these things are unspeakable, that
any officer should be allowed to go through
the country in that truculent manner, browbeating and tyrannizing over men entitled
to the respect of their aæociates as well as of
the general public. However, that was what
happened in December. When this inquisitor

SENATE

650

came into Colonel Cooper's, I am informed
he declined to give Cooper any information
as to what evidence he had taken. He had
before that refused in writing to allow Cooper
to be presenýt at the taking of any evidence,
and when be saw Cooper himself he declined
to teltl him whait evidence he had secured or
from whom he had secured it, but confined
himself to asking certain questions. I will
mention only one question to show how misleading the questions and answers were. He
had learned fron the Trade Instructor's Departrment that Colonel Cooper had procured a
galleon-that is a toy ship fixed up with sails,
and everything-from the Trade Instructor's
Department. The way it came to Cooper
was this: " Is this your signature?" The document was the requisition for a galleon.
Cooper said: "Yes, that is my signature."
"Yes, I presume
"Is that date correct?"
Another document
It is there."
it is.
was produced-"Is this your signature?"
" Is that date correct?" " Yes."
" Yes "
One document was a requisition for a
galleon, the other was a receipt for a galleon. 'Te difference between the two dates
was five days. Those dates were correct.
The question was: "Can a galleon be made
" It takes
in five days?" " Certainly not."
many months to make it, doesn't it?" "It certainly does."
The niatter ended there, and that is all that
goes to the Minister-that Cooper apparently
was caught snitching a galleon from the Trade
Instruotor's Department, without being charged
for it, and through some accident putting in
a requisition only five days before when it
When
should have been in a year before.
this man had gone away Cooper followed the
matter up with the Trade Instructor, and this
is what he found: that there being present a
high official from Ottawa, with some ladies
in his party, and one of the ladies having
expressed the wish that she might have one
of those toy ships, Cooper had gallantly
sought to get it for ber. He had gone with a
requisition to the Trade Instructor, and the
Trade Instructor had said: "Why, I have
one of those in my own house; I will give
you that to present to this lady, and will
So be gave it to
make another for myseilf."
him five days after the date of the requisition,
and presumably made another for himself.
Anyhw, that transaction was entirely innocent, but the way it was put by this inquisitor, who was the personal enemy of
Cooper, as known to the whole institution out
there, would lead the Minister to think that
amongst other delinquencies this warden was
snitching material frem the institution without paying for it as he was supposed ýto do.
We have no knowledge of what was told the

nouncing the investigation, as delivered by
Inspector Jackson:
New Westminster, B.C.,
December 23, 1927.
Warden Cooper,
British Columbia Penitentiary,
New Westminster, B.C.
Re Investigation, etc.
Sir,
I beg to acknowledge yours of December 21st
requesting notice of the time and place that I
will hold the hearing in regard to the investigation of certain charges made by youNote that: "certain charges made by you."
-and investigation into the administration of
the B.C. Penitentiary.
Also your request that you be represented by
counsel during the investigation and that you
be permitted to adduce evidence and examine
and cross-examine any witnesses at the hearing.
I informed you on my arrival at the institution of the reason of my visit and read to you
the authority granted me by the Department
of Justice. I also read to you Section 21,
Chapter 35 of the Penitentiary Act dealing
with my duties as Inspector of Penitentiaries.
I now infornm you in writing confirming what
I have already told you verbally, that I will
open the enquiry at your institution on the 23rd
of December at or near 10.00 a.m.
I further notify you that you are not entitled to counsel at an enquiry, neither are you
permitted or entitled to be present during any
evidence being taken (except your own) and
you cannot examine or cross-examine any
witnesses.

This for your information, please.
Yours sincerely
(Signed) E. R. Jackson,
Inspector.
So we have an official document from an
Inspector, saying: I am here by authority of
the Minister of Justice to investigate charges
made by you, but you are not to be rpermitted
to tell me what the charges are, or to be
present to prosecute them or to call evidence
in support of them; nor are you to be permitted to hear statements made against you,
or to examine or cross-examine witnesses. And
it was under these circumstances that this investigation was held in December.
In December the attention of ýthe Minister
of Justice was called to these extroardinary
proceedings, and he was asked to have the
matter looked into at Ottawa, and, if possible,
So far as
to give it his personal attention.
I am aware, no answer to that request ever
came from the Minister of Justice, and so far
as Colonel Cooper is concerned, or so far as
I have heard, there is no evidence that the
message ever reached the Minister of Justice.
The matter rested from December until
February; and towards the end of February
a telegram came one day to Warden Cooper.
I think I remember the exact words: "You

JUNE 5, 1928
have been retired to promote efficiency and
harmony. You will be given the gratuity to
which you are entitled. You will, on receipt
of this, hand over your keys to your deputy
warden." When Cooper got that he opened
the door and found the deputy warden there
ready to take over his keys: he had been
already advised. Thrown out like a malefactor,
without any notice whatever! No urgency; a
quarrel in September, investigation in December; in February a wire "Get out when you
get this wire." This from the gentleman who
writes in so many letters about maintaining
the esprit de corps of the staffs of the penitentiaries in Canada!
Meantime Captain Cooper had become Lt.Colonel commanding the local regiment, and
served his terrn faithfully and well, as he had
served in every other capacity. But he was
thrown out with a contemptuous message as
if he was a malefactor found stealing the
change of the institution! And to this day he
cannot get any explanation or any statement
from any person as to what he was supposed
to have done to merit such treatment.
You will say he got a gratuity. The gratuity
is provided for by section 32 of the Penitentiaries Act. I quote from the Revised Statutes:
To any officer whose conduct has been good,
and who has been faithful in the discharge of
his duties ,there may be paid-so and so. It is a certificate of good conduct. The superintendent, in order to warrant
the 'Minister in taking $1,400 out of our
Treasury and paying it to that warden, had
to certify that to the Minister-that his conduct had been good, and his record correctand he did certify that; and yet he threw him
out in that contemptuous way. That is one
of the matters I want inquired into.
I omitted to say that the warden, when he
takes office, is sworn to carefully observe and
carry out all the regulations of the penitentiary. By the Act to which I have referred,
it is provided that the warden of the penitentiary shall be the chief executive officer of the
same, and as such shall have the entire
executive control of all its concerns, subject
to the rules and regulations duly established,
and the written instructions of the Superintendent or of the Minister. That gives the
warden authority over all prisoners who come
there. But warden Cooper has had the
unique experience, possibly not paralleled before in any institution in Canada, of receiving
from the Superintendent two letters in violation of the regulations which he had sworn to
observe in toto. These letters, like the others
that I read, while they compelled him to

651

violate the regulations that he had sworn to
observe, are marked "personal and confidential," so that if any trouble arose the warden
would not be in a position to say "I did this
by direction of the Superintendent." The
first is as follows:

The Warden,
The Penitentiary,
New Westminster, B.C.
Hon. Mr. SMEATON WHITE: Is Dr.
Blank a prisoner?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: He was a prisoner then.
He has since been released. Blank, of course,
is not the name.
The reason I read these two letters is that
quite recently one of my colleagues had a
conversation with the Minister of Justice on
this subject, and the Minister of Justice
mentioned, as one of the most serious matters
connected with Colonel Cooper, that he had
violated the regulations in connection with
this Dr. Blank-as to whom he had been
expressly directed by the Superintendent to
violate the regulations because this unfortunate
man was a personal acquaintance of the

SENATE
Superintendent and bis family. It was no
doubt an innocent violation, though a usurpation of the warden's authority as to what
quarters this man was to occupy and how he
was to be employed. But in the face of the
assurance contained in the letter that "I feel
you would not run any risk" in violating these
regulations and the oath of office, now and at
the instance of this same Superintendent the
Minister holds as a most grave offence, that
Warden Cooper violated the regulations in
the case of this prisoner. The circumstance
was that, coming from a journey one night
and finding one of his children very ill, under
suspicion of having diphtheria or some other
infectious disease, and there being only a parttime do'tor on the regular staff of the institution, who being ill had left his practice in the
hinds of his partner, the warden made no
attempt to get this very busy nan from town,
but remembering Dr. Blank, and the permission
from the Superintendent to exercise discretion
in forgetting regulations with respect to him,
had brought this dector into bis house, which
is in the penitentiary grounds, to examine the
child. The doctor gave hini a reassuring report
and went back to bis cell, and nothing
happened. I aim told that in the Minister's
mind that is one of the serious crimes the
warden has commnitted, and for which he has
been punihed ly losing eight years of his life
and by being thrown out of the service as if
he was a malefactor of some kind.
Yeu will say he got his gratuity. He got
$1.400; but he had paid into the retiring fund
over $2,000. which, in two years would have
given him a permanent supcrannuation of
$800 a year. By his sudden removal be was
deprixcd of that, and was compelled to sell
at onction for S300, which was all he could get,
bis household furniture which was worth close
to 82,000. He was led te serve eight years in
the penitentiary service, which fits him for no
other employment, and he was thrown out
without a trial, or a statement of what he had
done to deserve such treatmenet, and was
refused access to the Minister or the Deputy
Minister.
I said at the beginning that I would leave
it to the judgment of those who heard my
story whether or not the connection of the
Ministry of Justice with this affair warranted
the suggestion that they were accessories after
the fact. I have a little to add in that
connection.
I am permitted to refer here to answers
given in another place to questions put on this
subject. I am aware of the strict rule against
referring to debates in another House, but I
took the trouble to look up the rules, and I
say on my responsibility that the regulations

of the House of Commons directly lay down
that one may refer to the printed proceedings
of another House, although he must not controvert statements made in debate. This is
my warrant for referring to these answers,
although I do not need to refer to the other
House, because the answers have been printed
in the publie press and I think I am privileged
to read them. I read these answers to show
that-a member of Parliament having sought
to inquire into this matter, and having framed
a number of questions which ho thought
would bring out the material facts-nearly
every one of the 17 answers given in the other
House after a long delay, and therefore after
mature consideration, involves direct misrepresentation either by assertion or by omission.
The Minister net being in this House, I call
to the attention of bis colleagues in the Government, that an official of a Departnent has
blen permnitted to put into the hands of bis

untrue. This is a very grave statement that

First of all, he says: "Colonel Cooper was
not dismissed." That is repeated six times.
Colonel Cooper was "retired" in a sense, but
in the whole history of the penitentiaries
there is no other instance of a high officer
contemptuously thrown out, as tlus man has
been thrown out. If this does not constitute
dismissal, I do not know how else you could
justify the term dismissal. Technically, to
bring him under the gratuity Act, he is
retired; really, he is dismissed. He has not

yesterday the elevators here handled approxmately 78,000,000 bushels. This includes some
local transfers from one elevator to another.
These transfers are more than off-set by additional wheat that bas been shipped in sacks
that went direct from the cars to the boats,
and is not shown in the elevator receipts. We
have actually exported approximately 72,000,000
bushels. There are 3,500,000 bushels in the
elevators, and at least 2,000,000 on cars en
route here. I am advised by the C.P.R. officials
that their loadings for here are keeping up, and
are practically as good as they were in December and January. I have not the figures of
the C.N.R., but I do not think they are doing
as well just now, for the reason that there is
more delay in threshing on C.P.R. territory
than on C.N.R. We have shipped approximately over 4,500,000 bushes this month, and

sales have been made for June, and some for

Flour shipments to date run to 826,000
barrels, as against 542,000 barrels at this date
last year. This is, as you will note, a substantial increase. This applies all along the
line, both with respect to inward and outward
cargo.
I think it must be very gratifying to us all
to know that Vancouver Haebour Board is
not only managing the harbour with great
success, but that the shipments of grain
tbrough Vancouver port are growing yearly. I
might add that Prince Rupert is doing no
mean business for a young elevator.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I would like to ask if
the elevator at Prince Rupert is the one that
was constructed by the Federal Government
at a cost of several millions, and handed over
to a private corporation at the nominal rental
of one dollar a year?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Really, I am
not in a position to be cross-examined about
that. I am merely communicating some information about the success of Vancouver, and
perhaps Prince Rupert; but it is probably
true that the elevator was given over to the
people interested in the grain business, because
it was not constructed for the benefit of Government and Parliament, but for the purpose
of shipping grain.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I would like to ask
him whether he considers that the faet of the

old Board of Harbour Commissioners, and
put in a new Board, is responsible for the
very large increase in the shipments.

trade at Vancouver.

PENSION BILL
CONSIDERATION OF MESSAGE PROM HOUSE
OF COMMONS-REAPPOINTMENT OF
SPECIAL COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Comnens disagreeing te
certain amendments made in the Senate te
Bill 289, an Act to amend the Pension Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have just read the reasons given
by the House of Commons for disagreeing

655

with a certain number of amendments which
were made in the Senate to this Bill. As
they are mostly technical and in order to
follow them, one would need to compare
them with the clauses of the Bill, I suggest,
after having consulted with my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. W. B. Ross) and other
honourable members of the Senate, that the
Senate reappoint the Committee that has
dealt with this Bill, and refer this message
to that Committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
honourable Mr. Dandurand, seconded by
Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that this message
be referred to the former Oommittee.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It will have to be reappointed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: That this
message be referred to a Committee composed of Messrs. Beique, Béland, Belcourt,
Blsck, Calder, Dandurand, Griesbach, Hatfield, Laird, Macdonell, Robertson, Robinson,
Ross (Moose Jaw), Ross (Middleton), Sharpe,
Taylor and Turgeon.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, before that motion is put, as a matter
of information I would like to ask a question of the honourable leader of the House.
This is a Government Bill referred to a Committee of the Governments nomination, on
which the Government has equal representation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Or thereabouts.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Has equal representation,, I think I am correct in saying.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Perhaps so.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: What I want to know
is whether the Governinent urges this Bill
upon the Committee, whether the Government makes any attempt to pass it through
the Committee, and whether the Government
is behind the Bill in this House. I ask this
question because it seemed to me very unfortunate that the other day we disposed of a
matter so important to so many people in Canada without any leadership from the Government whose Bill it is, and without any knowledge on the part of this House of the contenta
of the report from Committee which we passed.
I would suggest to the Government that if it
really supports this Bill from the House of
Commons it should give to the Committee
of the Senate, and to the Senate itself, some
leadership in this matter, but that if, on the
other hand, it abandons the Bill here and

very plain, so that the responsi-bility
where it belongs.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to answering my honourable friend,
and I think I can do so in the spirit in which
my remarks were couched when the report
of the Commititee came before this Chamber.
The varions clauses of the Bill had been
framed and agreed upon by a Committee of
the House of Commons which had held 47
sittings. Its conclusions on certain clauses,
I suppose, though I have no special knowledge,
were the result of compromise for the purpose of bringing about unanimity. The Government transformed the Committee's unanimous report into a Bill, which, perhaps by
agreement, was passed by the Commons without much discussion, and the Bill came bore.
I intended, as representing the Government,
to give as much leeway to the Senate as the
Government gave the Commons, in view of
the whole matter having been referred to a
Conmittee of the Commons.
I do not know what is in the mind of my
honourable friend, or whether he desires that
on such a technical matter I should ask the
loyal support of all the mnembers sitting on
this side, and stand by the clauses without dotting an i or crossing a t. My honourable friend
in his remarks of la.t week expressed surprise
at the Senate Committee having been unable to find a formula which would conform
with the desires of many honourable members of the Senate. As a matter of fact no
vote was taken on the question of altering
the underlying principle of the Pension Bill.
There were expressions of opinion in the Committee. My honourable friend was somewhat
severe on the Senate Committee and on the
Senate for hesitating to try to find a formula of words. I should have pointed out to
him that the House of Commons Committee,
which was quite a large one, composed of
serions men, and which had worked upon this
same Bill and the clause in question, produced
after 47 sittings a formula which, they practically admitted, was not an ideal one and
My honourable
was perhaps unworkable.
friend, who as a layman has his own judgment to direct him, and who has a wide
knowledge of the English language, thought
that it was a question of words only. It
was rather a question of trying to crystallize
in words a very difficult situation for which
the House of Comnons, after 47 sittings of
its Committee, had not succeeded in finding
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

a formula. That is perhaps what I should
have told my honourable friend in defence of
the action of the Senate Committee on that
clause.
I intend to treat the Senate with as much
consideration as the Commons was treated
by my colleagues in the other Chamber. In
this respect I repeat whait I have just said.
This is a highly technical matter, and it is for
this reason that, at the suggestion of honourable mernbers of the S nate, I have agreed
tha't we should do again w'hat we did in other
circumstances with a similar Bill, and refer
the Bill to a Comimittee. If my suggestion
does not meet with the views of the majorvty of this Chamber, then we will consider
the Bill in Committee of the Whole, or consider it here and now.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, may I be permitted? I have no desire
to detain the Senate, but I do not think the
honourable gentleman bas put the matter
quite fairly. The Bill is not so very technical
in the matters of importance to those whom
it was intended to favour, that is, the exsoldiers of Canada. It is a matter of dollars
and cents with them or their widowed dependents. There is very little that is tcchnical
about those clauses that were struck out by
this Chamber.
Now, if the Gove rintent would give a bold
lead to the Committee and say that it had
no desire that the money grant favoured by
the Commons should\ be reduced in the Senate,
and if the honourable leader of the Government so instructed the Committee and this
Hou-e, I feel that the Senate would not heitate. I have no authority to speak for the
Senate. I speak my own opinion, from my
own, genera'l knowledge, that the Senate
would haie no disposition to trim froin those
soldiers and their dependents any dollars that
the Commons is willing to give to them.
That is the kind of leadership that I would
like to see the Government give the Committee, and the Senate os a body, in connection with this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, although my nanme does not appear as
that of a member of the CommitteeHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes, it does.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There were two
Committees appointed. I would ask that the
name of Hon. Mr. Béique be added.

JUNE 6,1928
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 know that 1 was
a mernber of the Committee, because I was
present when the Committee was appointed
and my namne was mentioned. I followed the
sittings of the Committee with as mucli attention as I was capable of giving, and I must
say that as far as I arn concerned, it is not
a question of wording. 1 arn satisfied with
the wording upon which the report of the
Committee was based. If it were a question
of wording, I would try to find a way of
expressilg what was intended.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to say .iust a word or two in
reference to the attitude of the Committee on
this legislation. I think I have been a mcmber of every Cornmittee, either of the Coinmons or the Senate, dealing with pension
legislation and other legislation relating to
returned soldiers, and I think I may say
without contradiction that the attitude of the
great mai ority of the members of those confmittees lias been absolutely sympathetie.
There has been an endeavour at ail times to
do the. right thing for returned soldiers. I
think I may say also that there lias been an
utter lack of what miglit be called partisanslip in dealing with this problem.
The honourable member for New Westminster (Bon. Mr. Taylor) to-day invites the
Leader of the Government to show a bold
front, to indicate leadership. Well, if that
means anything, it means that lie should take
a purely partisan view of this situation, and
should endeavour to force through this Bouse
a measure that may not meet with the approval of the majority. I take it that the
Senate sits as a rcviewing body, to rcvicw
legisiation seriously and without partisanship,
and that we should approacli this legisiation,
as we should all legisIation, and deal with it
in a non-partisan way. So f ar as I can
remember, that lias always been our attitude
in the past, and, because this class of legislation will corne before us many tirnes in the
future, I trust that will continue to be the
attitude of the Senate.
One other point. The main clause of this
Bill deals with a principle that lias stood on
ýour Statute Book since 1916. 1 arn sure there
is no doubt in the rninds of any memiber of
this Bouse that it is our desire, and the desire
of Parliament, that the widow should receive
a pension if conditions can be set around the
law that will prevent abuses. That is the
whole question. We aIl know what has taken
place in .the United States, where not only

657

hundreds of people, but thousands, have been
pensioned who neyer should have been pensioned.
We are asked to-day to write in our law
a new principle that will open the door to aIl
sorts of abuses. In that sense we have had
difficulty, as lias been said, in finding a
formula. My honourable friend (Bon. Mr.
Taylor) thinks it should be very easy. Well,
it is not. I would like him to try it. In the
Bouse of Commons they tried not only for
many days, but for many weeks, and they
finally had to admit that they had made a
failure. Weeks afterwards they. carne to us
with another suggestion, which we found
equally to fail; then we had a suggestion
from a third party, and that also was found to
be lacking. Our difficulty is to find language
upon which we can base a principle witliout
permitting an abuse that would cost this
country many hundreds of thousands if not
millions of dollars. There is no objection to
sending the Bill back to Committee. Let us
try it again. I doubt very mucli whether we
will get over the diffioulty, but in any event
there are other clauses that require our attention, and upon which we can perhaps agree.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I should like
to add the naine of Senator Beique to that
Comrnittee, because lie was on the other
Cornrittee which dealt with the Insurance
Bill. It was due to oversiglit that lis narne
was lef t off.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would suggest that
the naine of Senator Taylor also be added.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I join with rny
honourable friend in suggesting that the narne
of the honourable gentleman frorn New Westminister (Bon. Mr. Taylor) be added to the
Cornrittee.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand,
amended as suggested, was agreed to.

PENSION BILL
REPORT 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON MESSAGE
FROM HOUSE 0F COMMONS

Hon. J. A. CALDER moved concurrence
in the report of the Speciail Committee to
whom was reýfeýrred a message from the House
of Commons agreeing to certain amendment9
made in the Senate to bill 289, an Act to
amend the Pension Act, and disagreeing with
other amendments.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, before the
House is called upon to vote on concurrence
in this report I think it advisable, that I should
make a further statement in explanation. I
am sure we ail realize that the report presented to us is in many respects of a very
technical character, and unless one has followed the legislation and knows exactly what
Hon. Mr. HARDY.

these various clauses purport te do, it must
be difficuit to understand what we aim te
accomplish.
1 have therefore prepared an
additional very brief statement, which I
would like to submit to the House, and with
your permission I will read it. It is quite
likely that we shail have a discussion on this
matter, and what I have to say may afterwards be supplemented by other mnembers of
the Committee.
As Chairman of the Special Committee appointed to consider the message received from
the House of Commons wvith regard to our
amendments to Bill 289, I desire te add somne
explanation to the report just submaitted te
you for consideration.
In their message the House of Commons
declared that they disagreed with aur amendments te six clauses, namely, 2 (a), 7, 12, 25,
30 (10) and 31.
I shaîl deal with t.hese
briefiy, and attempt to indicate the decisionsreached by yeur Committee in each case.
Doubtless, if we have a debate, other members of the Committee will elaborate, if necessary, the reasons for the conclusions reached.
Wjth respect te clause 2 (a), upon which
'there was a idisagreement between the two.
'Houses, this clause as it stands ini the original
'Bill is intended te re-define and extend the'definition of the expression "appearance of the
injury or disýease," a termi that is u.sed througheut the law, ta a greater or less extent. AUI
through our discussions it was admitted that
that clause had a direct, relation te clause 25
of the Bill, and that its retention or rejection
depended upon the final deci-sion of the Comnmittee with respect te clause 25, which is the
clause that 'debars a widlow from receiving a
pension if she marries a, soldier after tbe appearance of his injury or disease.
As yoiîr ýCommittee finally approved a new
clause 25, it was generally admitted that
clause 2 (a) wvas unnecessary. We therefore
recommend that the Senate, insists on its
amenidment, which will have the affect of
striking clause 2 (a) from the Bill. I think
there will be ne dissention as fax as that is
concerned.
For the reasons set forth in our report we
recommend that the Senate aIse insists en its
amendmient te clause 7.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What is the purport of the clause?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That will corne in the
axplanation. The clause of the report is as
follows:
2.* That the Senate doth insist on its sixth

amendment, striking eut clause 7, because un-

JUNE 7,1928
der section 1l of the Pension Act ail who
served in a theatre of war have been pensioned
or are pensionable ta the full extent of their
disabilities without any deduction in respect
of their pre-enlistment condition.
That is, it makes no difference u.nder the law
what the condition of the man was, whether
he was sick or had some disability, or anything of that nature, priair ta his enlistinent, if
ho served in an actual theatre of war, hie is
pensioned ta the full extent of bis disability
regardless of bis condition prior ta enlîstment.
flan. rMr. CORDON: Is that taken care of
in the new Act? It was in the previaus law.
flan. Mr. CALDER: That la the existing
law. Ahl of those wbo served in an actual
theatre of war are pensioned ta tbe f ull extent of their disahility under the existing law,
r'egardless of wbat their condition may have
been prior to enlistment.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: If the honaurable gentleman will excuse me, I have personal knawl,
edge that that is nat the case. The Stevenson case is an example of it.
flan. Mr. CALDER: Weil, I will have ta
leave ta others, who are probahly more familiar than I arn with the 'provisions af the law
and its aperation, the privilege of answering
my honaurable friend. Our report says:
The existing law clearly provides that even
those who were found by medical examination
ta be unfit for front line service shall also be
pensioned ta the full extent of their disabilities,
notwithstanding the fact that their service in a
theatre of war was of a non-combatant character, far removed from the scene of active
hostilities. The existing law which bas been
in operation saine ten years is definite and is
well un(lerstood.
In other words, persans wbo served in a
theatre of war, wbetber tbe service was at the
front or on any occasion behind the trenches,
in the variaus corps-labour battalion, forestry
'battalion, etc.-are, under the existing law,
pensioned ta the full extent of their disability,
hio matter wbat their conditon. before enlistment may have been. The report praceeds:
Clause 7 proposes an amendment thereto providing that pensions shahl be awarded ta dependents wbere the aggravation of a pre-enlistment injury or disease substantially contributed
ta death. Consequently this is obviously intended ta caver only those who served in Canada and England,
-nat in an actual theatre of wax, because
adJ those wbo served in an actual theatre of
war are taken care af by auýr present haw, and
are pensionable ta the fuil1 extent of their
disability. Then we close that paragraph of
the report with thîs remark:
The difficuhty of interpreting the words "substantially contributed", caupled with the fact
5610e-42J

659

that the present law seems to be sufficientlY
generous to caver aIl classes that would corne
i:nder this clause, warrant the conclusion that;
it cannot be reasonably justified.
Now, I leave it to others who desire ta
make any other explanation. in regard to our
action in regard to this clause.
As regards clause 12, your Committee has
reported that it agrees wi'th the amendmnent
suggested in the message fromn the flouse of
Commons. This clause deals witb the granting
of pensions in specially meritorjous cases.
The amendment referred ta is intented ta
make clear the grounds upon which. an appeal
may lie for this purpose. The provisions of
the existing law in this respect are flot extended.
Cilause 25 of the Bill was previously rejected
by your ýCommittee. In its Message, the
flouse of Commons insisted an its adoption,
or, in the alternative, the adoption of a new
clause in its stead. As previously reported,
your Committee deemed it inadvisable ta recommend the adoption of this clause, chiefly
on the ground that whllst it would take care
of ail cases of deserving widows who married
after the appearance of the injury or disease
which resulted in death, there was the great
danger that the door would ho thrown open,
and that pension benefits would accrue ta a
large number of widows wbo were admittedly
not entitled thereto. The attitude of your
Committee generally with respect ta àis
problem was that if at ail possible the Iàw
should be so amended as ta provide for what
are commonly referred ta as "deserving cases"
flonourable gentlemen will ýremember a statement made the other day by the Senatar from
Edmonton (flan. Mr. Griesbach) in this
regard.
With this end in view your Cammittee considered at great length same five or six amendments suggested ta, us, al of which in due
course were rejected. At aur sitting yesterday,
the Chairman of the Board of Pension Comnmissianers was assigned the task of endeavouring ta draft a clause that would reasonably
meet the situation, in view of aill aur discussions. At aur meeting this marnîng Colonel
Thompson submitted his praposed amendment, and it was approved by the great
mai ority of the Cammittee.
The .proposed amendment as adopted, and
reported to this flouse, follows:
25. Subsection one of section thirty-two of
the said Act is repealed and the following ig
substituted therefor:
32. (1) No pension shahl be paid ta the widowOf a pensioner unless she was living with hink
or was maintained by hlm or waz, in the

660

SENATE

opinion of the Commission, entitled to be maintained by him at the time of his death and for
a reasonable time previously thereto.
2. No pension shall be paid to the widow of
a member of the forces unless she was married
to him before the appearance of the injury or
disease which resulted in his death(a) Unless the injury in respect of which
le was pensioned or entitled to pension would
not shorfen his expectancy of life; or
(b) Unless he was not chronically ill of a
pensionable disease and not in receipt of pension in respect thereof.
Then, it is proposed that this new provision
shall not be made retroactive. We found that
if that were .done in many cases, widows
would be entitled to sums running from $3,000
up to $7,000 in a lump sum. Consequently
the Committee decided that as it is a new
principle to be adopted, it should not be made
retroactive, but should begin to run from the
date that this law would come into effect.
With respect to clause 30 (10), which is
purely administrative, your Committee bas
recommended that the suggestion contained
in the message of the House of Commons
should be adopted. This clause deals with
the officers, clerks and employees of the
Board of Appeal.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
World the
honourable gentleman kindly review that
clause about the clerks and employees?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is this way. The
Appeal Board shall be attached to the Department of Pensions and Health, and the expeees required to be incurred for the discharge of its duties, including the salaries
of its officers, clerks, and other employees,
shall, on the approval of the Board, be paid
out of the moneys provided by Parliament.
We felt that as the Board has a small staff,
and knows what is required of it, where it
should go, and what expenses it should incur; in order to avoid conflict between the
head of the Board of Appeal and the deputy
head of the Department, as to what expenses
should be allowed the men, once the stamp
of the Board is put on it is just a matter of
costs.
As to clause 31, the sixth paragraph of our
report is as follows:
6. That the Senate doth insist on its twelfth
amendment, amending clause 31, because under
the existing law the soldier himself, or in the
event of bis death his widow, his children or
his parents, have the right of appeal on the
ground that the injury or disease or aggravation thereof resulting in disability or death was
attributable to or was incurred during military
service.
That is, in appeals from the Board of
Pension Commissioners to the Appeal Board,
the existing law is quite clear, that a soldier
Hon.

Mr. CALDER.

himself, or, if he dies, his widow, his children,
or his parents, have a right to appeal to the
Appeal Board, in case of pension being refused by the Board of Pension Commissioners.
There is no doubt about that: the law is
quite clear in that respect.
In regard to paragraphs (a) and (b) of
clause 31, which we recommend to be struck
out, they are not clear. If you read them,
you will find the greatest difficulty in understanding just exactly what they mean.
It
has been represented to us, so far as the very
best information we could get is concerned,
that those paragrapbs (a) and (b) of clause
31 are intended to give a right of appeal to
dependents other than a widow or chi'dren,
who claim their financial resources are inadequate. So our report states:
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, while
not clear, are intended to change the existing
principle of the right of appeal, particularly for
dependents, other than widows and children,
who claim their financial resources are inadequate. The Senate is of the view this is not
advisable.
I thought it advisable to make that additional statement in order that mem' ors of
the House might at least try to grasp same
of the features of this very technical trouble.
It is quite likely that if we have a discussion
of the report, other members of the Conmittee will supplement what I have had to
say.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlenen, I do not think a matter like this should
be passed without any remarks at all. Being
naturally modest, I am somewhat diffident
about standing up, seeing that I was the subject of a mild lecture yesterday for being a
partisan on this subject. The application of
that remark puzzled me a littile, if it meant
that I acted as a political partisan, for my
desire expressed at the moment was to support the Government, which had not been a
fixed habit of mine. If, on the other hand,
the suggestion was that I was a partisan of
the soldiers who are petitioning Parliament,
I am rather proud to plead guilty to the
indictment.
It is true that during the war I was not
able to give much active service myself, but
I was very active in enlisting soldiers.
I
probably enlisted 2,000-i,000 besides the regiment which I was permitted to take as far
as England-and I remember very well, during
that campaign, the wealth of assurance that
was poured out to ail the relatives, the fathers
and mothers and dependents of those soldiers,
as to what we would do for them when they
came back. . The recollection is still vivid in

members of the forces and their dependents
except section 25, which the Committee of
the Senate struck out during the previaus
proceedings.
The other amendrnents arc
very largely a matter of words, and I think
are flot the subjeet of very general agitation.
N*ow, as to section 25, dealing with the
pensions to widows, I ýread in one of the
newspapers to-day the statement-I do not
know on what authýority it is made-that a
large appropriation submitted to the other
House in the Supp]ementary Estimates was
foir the purpose of paying to dependents of
:soldiers the moneys that they expected to
get under the Pension Act as passed by the
House of Commons. I say without fear of
contradiction that the action now iwecammended to the Senate with regard to section
25
will
almost
totally
deprive
those
dependents of any of that large suma of
money; that this section adopted to-day is
an absolute blank sa far as any effec't is
concerned.
The only two paragraphas added to the law
as it stands at presenit are these:
No pension shall be paid
(a) Unless the injury in respect of which lie
was pensioned or entitled ta pension would flot
shorten bis expectancy af life.
That is wholly a matter of opinion, to be
decided flot by any independent auth.ority,
but wholly by the Board of Pension Commissioners. Those of us who have had ta
deal îvith the Board of Pension Commissioners, and who kn.ow the nature of their
decisions when there is any poasibility for
dispute, will recognize that that para.graph
(a) is absolutely valueless Vo every person.
Paragraph (b), tbe only other section o"
Ibis ha.ndsome gift offered to the widows of
ex-soldiers, says:
Unýless lie was flot chronically ili of a pensionable disease and flot in receipt of pension in
respect thereof.
As f0 that, I say it also is absolutely
valueless because of the nature of the proceedings before the Pension Board. When
a soldier cornes up now and reports a disaibilitY
and asks for a pension in respect -of it, lie
is invariably cballenged Vo conneet up the
disabîhity with bis active service. The man
will go back over the intervýening ycars, and
lie wvill say: "It is true I didn't report that
wben I left, and there is nothing in my papers
about it; but I bave been suffering from those
sympf.oms more or less ever since." And tbey
will question bim and say: "The first year

to a pension is keen, he will naturally .say:
"Yes, I think I did."
"And you did the
second year, and the third?" "Yes." "And
you really think you connect it np with yonr
service?"
"Yes."-and lie gets bis pension.
Týhen he dies, and wheýn lie dies tbey read
this section, and they say: "Why, lie thinks
lie bad those symptoms immediately after lais
discharge,"-and there is no pension comirig
Vo the widow. I do not tbink that is fair
treatment Vo soldiers.
Nowv, I do not koow how far I arn privileged
Vo refer to proceedings in Committee. If I
amn ont of order, I would quite will'ingly be
checked, because I have no desire ta do anyfhing contrary Vo the miles of this Hanse. 1
thin-k it is worth while to, say tbis, bowever:
that our Committee were, tendered the olive
braîîch fruni the House of Commons in the
nicest and most. pleasant way; there was fia
acrimaniaus dispute between the two bodies,
but the House of Commons, througli their
accredited representatives, came ta ns witli
alternative sections Vo 25 in writing. Tliey
withdrew tbeir demand that we restore the
section as it was before, and said, "We will
he sati'sfied if you put these in." Naw, the
sections so submitted provided sometbing very
substantial for the soldiers: they bad ail the
safeguards of tbis~ resolution against what they
called "moribund marriages", but they contained in addition a recognition of the fuifilment of pre-war engagements. That is a
subjeet witb wbich we are very familiar, and
it need hardly be explained that a great
niîmher of marriages occurred immediately
following the release of soldiers f rom active
service. Io recognitian of tbat a proviso, was
put in that fia pension shourld be payable ta
the widow of a soldier nnless she had married
him before, the coming into force of the Pension Act of 1919-that wonid be before the lst
of September, 1919-and that wonid have
taken care of mast of the pre-war engagements.
W~e are toid about the exfraordinary cast

state noV a bvpotbeticai case, but an actuai
case of a young soldier who eniisted in 1914,

ta survive ten years, during the greater part

sub.stantial living. H1e died last year. The

JUNE 7, 1928
widow is told that tliere is ne pension whatever for lier because she married him after
the first appearance of the tuberculoeis. Is
that the limit to which th.e Senate is willing
to go in view of the ample provision. made
by the Bill sent to us frorn the House of
Commons?
I referred to what happened yesterday in
the Comxittee-the overtures made to us,
the aceeptance of whicli would have perfectly
satisfied the House of Commons. They wore
made by the Chairmnan of the Pension Committee there, who was presumed to speak on
behaif of the Government, and wlio was also
understood to speak on behai-f of the other
Party there, the House of Commons being
practicaIly unanimous on the subjeet. As the
honourable gentlemnai from Moose Jaw (Hon.
Mr. Calder) lias said, the Chairman of the
Board, Col. Tliorpson, was asked to draft
another section. The rea.son lie was asked to
draf t it wae because tlie Committee dividedi
on the section as offered. by the House of
Commons--tliey divided evenly, 50 per cent
of tlie Committee being for agreeing, and, the
other 50 per cent being contrary-and the
unexpected entry of a gentleman wlio liad not
been in previously gave t4e onie vote upon
whicli tlie House of Gommons provision was
lost. Then it was that the Cliairman of the
Board was asked to present a draft, whicli
resulted ini tliis gold brick, if 1 may use the
terma without disrespect.
Anotlier thing liappened in tlie Committee
this morning which I tliink should be mentioned. We hear very often that the difficulty in the way of proper provision for
soldiers' dependents is the Conservative
Senate. 1 do flot think tlie imputation on
the Senate is fair; but we do *lear over and
over again that the Senate did thus and so.
Now, if we adopt this report, I wouild like
to have it made plain that this action is not
primarily the action of the Conservative
Senate, because no less a person thon. the
Minister of National Defence, the guardianin-chief of the soldiers' interests in Canada,
appeared before our Committee this morning and said that the provision now before
us had bis approval; and, of course, having
bis approval, it lias the approval of tlie Governme'nt.
If the lionourable
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
gentleman would allow me, I think it only
fair to the Minister of National Defence that
I sliould make a statement. Wlien Colonel
Raîston was asked to make a statement as
to wliat lie thouglit of this, lie made it quite
clear that lie was not speaking as a Minister
of the Crown, but only in his individual
csDaCitv. becau.'%e everyone can iinderstand

M63

that without full consideration of the measure
with his colleagues, and unless the *Government itself took action on the matter, lie
could flot speak otherwise. Therefore it is
scarccly proper to say that any expression lie
gave vent to in tlie Committee this morning
was on behaIf of the <3overnment.
H-on. Mr. TAYLOR: I do net think I said
that.
You said lie was
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
speaking with full autliority.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I arn obliged. to the
lionourable gentleman for lis other lecture.
I was there and heard what was said, and
the main fact is that a gentleman wlio is a
Minister of the Crown, and the guardian ini
the Cabinet of the interests of tlie soldiers,
a man who is in the Cabinet because lie is
suipposed to have tlie absolute confidence of
the soldiers-and I have no contradiction te
offer to tliat-accepted in the Cornmittee this
morning the proposal. that is now before us.
My point is that, the case being se, it should
not be put about in tlie country or liere that
anyt.hing tliat happens to ths Bill to-day is
the evil work of the Conservative Senate.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
gentlemen, juet a few observations in defence
of the work of the Committee, and dealing
with wliat lias juet been saîd by the lionourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Taylor) on the two clauses to whici lie
lias referred.
On the clause regarding aggravation the
statement cf the Committee ia that under
existing law Vliere is ne deduction on account
of pre-enlistment condition with respect te
those wlio served in a tlieatre cf war.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Where is that law?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I arn about te
read it. I shail read new from the Pension
Act itself, section 11, subsection (b):
No deduction shahl le made from the degree
of actual disability of any member of tlie forces
wlio lias served in a theatre of actual war on
account of any disability or disabling condition whidh existed in hlm at the tîme at which
lie became a member of tlie forces; but ne pensien shaîl be paid for a disability or disabling
condition which at sucli time was wilfully concealed. was obvions, was net of a nature te
cause rejection from service, or was a congenital
defect.
These words in the conclusion of the paragrapli are words whicli do net really affect
the situation at ail.

JUNE 7, 1928
Committee in accordance with a ýsort of entente cordiale that has «developed .between, the
two Houses in the discussion of this matter. 1
tbink it only -fair ta say that.
ýI would like ta offer -a few observations
with regard ta this section 25, the clause dealing, with. pension ta the widow who niarried
subsequently ta the appearance of the disability. When, a few days ago, 1 spoke on
this question I said. that the law was very
technical, very camplex, very difficuit to understand, very difficult ta explain, and it is
necessary only ta repeat ta the Senate, at
this time the story of this particular clause
in arder te bring out h-ow difficuitthe question
bas been. When aur Committee first assembled we had laid bef are us the Bill as it came
from the Hanse of Gommons, and clause 25
praposed ta deal with this case. Before the
Bill came ta us at ahl I had called upon certain
members of the Cammittee of the other flouse
iid asked them what this clause meant, how it
would aperate, what it would cost, and s0
forth, and I found the members of that Committee very shaky an the clause-very shaky
indeed. Sa when we reached this clause in aur
Committee we adopted the somewhat unusual
expedient of asking certain praminent mcmbers of the Cammittee of the other flouse ta
attend upon us and discuss the clause witb us.
It must be borne in mind that the Committee
of the Commons held 47 sessions and the
evidence that it taok comprises 250 printed
pages. As a result of the 47 meetings and the
250 printed pages the Gommons Committee
produce section 25 of the Bill. Certain members of that Committee came before us the
other day, and the discussion had lasted anly
five or ten minutes when they entirely receded
from the position taken on this clause of the
Bil, adrnitting that it was practically useless,
it could nlot be explaîned, and they had grave
dauhts t.hat it would work. They themselves
offered us another clause, which I read the
other day, and will read again:
No pension shalI be paid ta the widow of a
meniber of the forces who was married ta hini
after the appearance of the injury or disease
which reeulted in bis death unless in the
opinion of the Commission the condition of
sncb rnember of the forces was at the time of
the marriage such that it wauld be reasonable
ta anticipate that the injury or disease would
liot result in death.
)Previously we had ascertained that, se far
Ëw the records of the Pension Commission
show, there are about 700 widows whose husba.nds died of their pensianable disability and
wha married prier ta the appearance of the
disability. Having received this clause from
these gentlemen in lieu of what is contained
in the Bill, we proceeded ta test it by asking

665

anc question. We asked, "What effect will
this clause have with respect ta these 700
widows for whom we are particularly anxious
to do something?" These gentlemen at once
turned ta the members of the Board of Pension Commissioners, who were present, and
asked theni, as we ail did, how they wauld.
interpret the clause with respect ta those
widows. Their immediate answr-and we al
agreed, I think, with the soundness of it-was
this: "In the case of theise 700 widows, as we
interpret this clause, we believe they would
get nothing under it, because when they were
married it must have been reasonable, in the
opinion of the Commission, ta anticipate that
the injury or disease would not result in death,
and in point af fact 'the husbands are ahl
dead." How could the Commission interpret
this, clause favourably ta th-ose 700 widows
when the men have actually died?
Han. Mr. CALDER: From their disability.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH: Fram their disability. Con.sequently it was scen at once
that the clause served na useful purpase.
Then there was submitted ta us a clause
fram the representatives of ex-service men.
Here again wc faund that so much was left
ta the discretian of the Commission, by the
use of the wards "an carly death", that if
this clause were applicd ta the case of the 700
widaws they would get nathing.

ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAY
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honouraible gentlemen, on behaif of the Committee appointed
to inquire int o the matter of the development
and improvement of the St. Lawrence river,
1 have the honour of submitfing the third
report, and in the usual procedure I arn asking the leavc' of the House that if ha adopted
this afternoon.
I may be aliowed f0 say that there is no
specifie finding in the report in respect f0 the
iindertaking. The Committee have heard a
good deal of evidence which they regard as
valuabie. They regret that further time was
not at their disposai to hear other wifnesses
whose attendance was confemplafed. They
suggest and recommend that the Scnate might
again next Session appoint a special committee
f0 continue the inquiry, and they recommend
the printing- in blueJaook f orm of the proceedings and evidence of the Committee. That
is, the substance of the report which I arn
submitting, and in which I move concurrence.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
before this report is concurred in 1 would like
to say a few words on the work of the Committee, and also wîth reference to this great
undertaking. Let me say at the outset that
the work of the Committee was weil done,
and very valuable information was obtained
from those who appeared and gave evidence
before the Commitf ce. 1 think that the members of the Committee as a whole took very
great interest in the proceedings, and fbey
were able at the close of our sittings last
nighf f0 say thaf the information they had
obfained wvas very valuable to fhem in helping
thcm to corne to a conclusion on this problem.
Although 1 understand this situation perhaps as well as any other member of the
Senate, I reeeived information that I had flot
had before. and that is very valuable to myself in enabling me to reach a conclusion. I
agrec very fully with the suggestion in the
report that it would be in the interest of this
projcct that ne'xt Session a new Committee
should be formed, and proceedings carried
on iii the same manner- but I take it for

JUNE 7, 1928
granteci, from what 1 have seen in bath of the
Ottawa evening newspapers, that some action
is to be taken in the near future, and I would
like ta a9k the honaurable leader of this House
exactiy what that action is to be.
But before I corne to that, I wauld like ta
niake a few remarks with regard to this great
scheme, and refer ta some pointe raisei li the
Committee. Let me say again ta this honourable House that this question is nlot a new
:)ne: it has been before Parliament in different
ways during the last twenty years. It came
up first in 1908. I was a member of the House
of Cammons at that time. The St. Lawrence
Power Company presented a Bill before Parliament asking for power ta build a transmission line from Carnwall ta Brockville;
and the prapaganda has gane forward that al]
&long the line we would thus, for the first
time, have electric lights. I thought I knew
ail that was going on at the time, but 1 did
not knaw until that Bill came befare Parlia'
ment that the Aluminum Company of
Massena had purcbased this company, and
ta my surprise their Bill containeci a clause
that gave that power company the right ta
builci a dam-exactly what is being proposeci
now-and deveiap power on the St. Lawrence
at the Long Sault Rapids.
0f course, we opposed that clause, and at
that time the fact came out that the Aluminum Company was the owner of the St. Lawrence Power Company.' Sir Wilfrid Laurier
was then in power, andi Right Honourable
Mr. Graham was Minister of Railways and
CanaIs, andi they, with their supporters, and
assistance from the Opposition sîde, succeeded
in having that clause thrown out, andi the
Bill practicaliy nullifieci in consequence. So
that the transmission line was neyer proceeded
with. That was the first time that I, or I
believe any member af the Commons, knew
that the Alumînum Company were the owners
of the power company situated at Cornwall.
That is not the first time that that company
has tried ta get this concession. At present
they have a concession, through the St.
Lawrence Power Company, which ta my minci
is unfair; and although it is very small to a
certain extent they will have the Government
of Cana-da by the throat, if I maiy use that
phrase, for the next fifty years, because of a
contract given in 1896 ta the St. Lawrence
Power Company, whicha wae then owned by a
private gentleman, the contracter. He got
the right ta develop 2,500 horse-power and, the
contrart contained a clause that this company
was ta furnish sufficient power ta open the
gates and to furnish lights along the canal.
That contract did not involve very much

667

horse-power, but electricity was not knawn
then as it is to-day. The, Minister at that
time gave a contract for what I have since
understooci would ha from 50 ta 100 horsepawer, at the very most, because, according
ta the reports from the Departruent, there was
a certain quantity of horse-power necessary
for each hock. That contract was given at
863.00 per horse-power for 20 years, renewable
at a rate s0 far as rentai ondy was concerned.
That was il years bef are the canai waa
finisheci, and, nothing was done unider that
contract. At that time it transpireci that the
St. Lawrence Power Company haci been solci
ta the Ahuminum Company, andi that contract
was again renewed for 89 years, I think-11
years off 100; and w'e are paying $63.00 for
horse-power, and wihl do s0 for another 50
or 60 years, on account of that coiitract, no
made.
But that was net the worst of it. When the
campany got the contract renewed,. or changed,
they made the minimum 400 horse-power, andi
the iights saine 274. The resuht was that the
contract was realhy sa unreasonabie that I
understand the Government decideci that it
would be better ta expropriate this company,
and do the lighting themnseives. But the
Ahumi.num Company having purchased the
power company for somne 35M6,000, they immediateiy lasueci bonds ta the amount of
$1,700,000 against the enterprise so that it was
much cheaper for us ta continue paying the
363.00 horse-power than for the Government
ta buy the company andi pay interest on
$1,700,000 warth of bonds.
That action of this Company made me a
littie suspicious as ta carrying on any agreement with them. But we have haci a littie
more experience. I think ail the members
of the Committee remember that it was
brought out that a dam haci been placed
across the South Sault IRapîis; that a channel
was obstructeci, but the obstruction was ta be
removed by the end ci the war, or in five years
at the most. They have faileci ta remove it,
andi have refuseci ta do so, although it is ten
years now sinice the war. It appears that the
United States Government cannot force them,
on account of the powers given ta this Company under a charter.
The present position of that Company leade
me ta ineist that everything that is done in
connection with the St. Lawrence Waterway
shoulci be donie direct with the UJnited States
Gavernment, so that when any question. cames
up, or any dispute, or rearrangement, we will
only have ta deal with that Government, and
nat be forceci ta take such a course as we have
had to pursue in the Chicago draÀinage case.
Again I refer ta the Chicago drainage canal.
Honourable gentlemen wihhl remember that so

668

SENATE

far as the power of the United States Government is concerned, Chicago has the right
to go before the courts, and that it is only
upon their decision that the Government can
take action.
What I am a Little suqspicious about, and
what I am afraid might happen is this. The
Aluminum Company have a charter that gives
them a. great deal of land in that locality,
on the American side of the river. What they
did not secure in that way they purchased.
They have also purchased the 'St. Lawrence
Power Company, and all the land in that
vicinity. Therefore, when the dam is placed
across the river at this particular point the
Company will own everything except the bed
of the river on the Canadian side. Now, if
I understand the Constitution of the United
States with reference to Treaties, this Company woulid have the right to appeal to the
courts in case of any dispute; therefore I
urge tiat in making an arrangement with the
United States every precaution should be
taken by our Government in order to be sure
that we are protected.
I am giving you some of the reasons why
I fear what may happen. If the canal is
built on the American side, as was recommended or suggested by the Joint Engineering Board. three of the locks-one at Crysler
Island and two at the Long Sault R.apids-will be on the American side of the river.
According to the Treatv of 1909. whatever
rate the marine of this country has to pay in
tolls for the use of our canals has to be paid
by the shipping of the United States; and for
the use of their canals we have to pay the
same rate that they charge their marine.
There would be very great danger, therefore,
if this canal were ovned by the Aluminum
Companv-especially in case of any dispute
between Canada and what, apparently, would
be the United States, but what in reality
would be the Aluminum Company-because
they could impose such a rate of tolls as
would practfically destroy our St. Lawrence
waterway. That is another reason why I say
the Government should take every precaution.
Up to the present we have had control of
our own waterway all the way from Port
Arthur to Montreal. When I say that, I mean
that whenever a vessel has come to an obstruction around which a canal has been built,
the locks having been on our own side of the
boundary, our vessels could go through them
without interference on the part of the United
States or of any private corporation. If we
adopt tha scheme that has been suggested,
either the one-stage or the two-stage scheme,
the only pliaces where there would be any obstruction on the United States side would
Hon. Mr. REID.

be at Crysler Island and at the Long Sault
Rapids. In the Committee two of the engineers who were on the Joint Waterways
Commission were asked if it would be possible to build this canal on the Canadian side
of the river and secure the same results as
if it were built on the American side, and I
think I am right in saying that both of them
answered that it would, but that the cost
would be $3,500,000 more. The extra cost
was the only reason, so far as I remember, for
the decision to build the canal on the American side. In other words, it was a matter of
economy.
I would like to suggest that it
should be remembered when this matter is
being finally considered, either by the Government or by Parliament, that it would be
botter for us to pay the extra $3,500,000 and
have the ownership and control within our
own country, thus avoiding any possibility of
trouble and the danger of not keeping on
good terms with our neighbours across the
line.
But there is another phase of this question.
We in Ontario-and I suppose this applies
also to Quebec-have been anxious to get
power. For twenty years we have been trying
to develop power. We look for a great future
in Eastern Ontario, say from Toronto east, by
reason of the development of this large amount
of power at Beauharnois and on the International Section. Now, the evidence is that
2200,000 horse power will be developed on
the International Section. The engineers have
decided that half of that amount will go ta
the United States, and half will come to
Canada. But they have placed the power
house and the works on the American side.
That it seems to me would not be satisfactory
to Ontario or to Canada. So far as Quebec
is concerned, it is all right, because all the
power to be developed and all the works to
be built in that section are in the Province
of Quebec. But if this power house on the
International Section is built on the American
side of the river, we will be at the mercy,
not of the United States Government. but of
the Aluminum Company, and we would not
be in such an advantageous position as if the
development took place on our own side of
the river. Therefore, so far' as that matter
is concerned, I urge that each country should
have its own power plant on its own side of
the line, and I would impress upon the Government the importance of seeing that that
is done.

At yesterday's meeting, I think it was we
had as a witness another of the engineers of
the Joint Commission, and in addition to the
questions that I have already mentioned about

JUNE 7, 1928
the developmnent being in the United States,
I asked if the weirs ta control the passage
of water down the St. Lawrence in order ta
protect the harbour of Montreal, and the
lakes and the river between Montreal and
Cornwall, were also, to be placed on the Amenican sicde of the river. He answered yes. He
stated that of course these works wouid have
ta be piaced under a Commission, which, I
suppose, wauld, be composed of an equal number of Americans and Canadians. But I arn
flot satisfied that we will 'be fuily protected
in that way, because the whole construction
is on the American side, of the river, and
under the contrai and operation of the Aiuminum Company. My judgment, for what it
is worth, is that power will be the paramounýt
issue wit-h the Aluminuým Company, and that
navigation wili be secondary. Therefore, I
say again that t-hose weirs, or a sufficient
inumber of them ta contrai the flow of water
in order ta proteet Montreal Harbour and
the river beiow Cornwall, shouidi be iplaced on
the Canadian side, even if it involves a ioss
of power. These are very important matteis
ta those who live along the St. Lawrence.
Navigation, it seems ta me, should be paramount, and power should itake second place.
There wiIl be deveioped at BeauhAarnois.
and on the International Section, sufficient
power for Ontario and Quebec for many years
ta corne. As you know, Ontaria has not the
-population ta absorb 1,100,000 horse-power as
soon as these rworks are constructed, and if the
power house is ta be built on the American
6ide of the line, we wll be in the position of
either haý.dng ta take the power or of having
ta aliow it ta be exported. I admit that
proba'bly we wiil *be offered our share of a
million horse power; but if we say we cannot
use it at once, I think aux chances of getting
it later wouid not bc very good. Along the
St. Lawrence between Cornwali and Brookville we are now using power purchased from
the Aluminum Company, which. develops it
at Cedar Rapids, for which. we are paying
$15 a horse power at Cornwall-I amrnfot
complaining of the price-and 75,000 horse
power for lightîng and power purposes is being sold in the United States in the tawns
and villages within, say, 100 miles of Massena.
Therefore 1 amn pleading with the Government ta be very careful and ta go very slowly,
as the right honourable 'gentleman from
Brockville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) bas said,
until they -are sure that Canadian interests
are protected beyond ail question. Sa far as
the present situation is concerned, I have no
fauIt to firîd with the action of the Government or of any other persan. .1dlo not blame
the engineers for trying ta economize; but I

t'hink that it wouId be faise econamy for us
not ta spend a littie more money in aider ta
contrai the situation ourselves. The Government and its Advisory Committee have heid
this matter up pending fu-rther investigation,
and it is for that reason that I, amn urging taday-tbe last opportunity that I wiil have this
Sessian-that they shouId proceed very cautiously.
There is another reasan why I amn speaking
to-day. It was nat my intention ta say anything on this matter uýntil next Session. I
was under the impression that nothing would
be done regarding this de'veioprnent until next
Session, but 1 noticed in the Ottawa papers
of last evening the statement that the 'Gavernment hati practically deoided uqSon the location
of tjhe terninais for this deep waterveay. What
alarmed .me was the statement in another
place that these terminals will be placed as
stat-ed, pravided an agreement ean be carried
out with the United States in connection
with the deepening of the channel. I do not
know what that really means; whether it may
ref-er ta the deepening of the channel
between Prescott and Lake Ontario, or ta,
work that may be done between Cornwall
and Lake Ontario. For the life of me, I
cannot see why there should be any agreement made at ail; and, as a matter of' fact,
the Minister who made -the statement said
that it was nat necessary ta make the agreement in order ta carry out this work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What page?

Hon. Mr. REID: He stated at page 3983:
I would say that at present the decision is
somewhat contingent upon the arrangement
whieh can be made with the Government of the
United States as ta the work ta be dane in
their own chlannels. The Government have
arrived at a decision, provided suitable arrangements can be made.
Then he was asked:
I suppose that no matter where the terminais
were Iocated some arrangement would have ta
be made with the United States in regard ta
dredging?
To which he answered:
Not necessarily.
I take that ta mean that it is not neoessary
ta enter into this agreement in order ta carry
on the construction of the terminal. The
American Government are making Ogdensburg
their terminal point, and if tbey do that
they wiil have to widen their channel between
Lake Ontario and Ogdensburg. There is now
plenty cf water, but in order ta make it
safer, they will have ta spend a million dallars.
Then on the Canadian side there are one or
twa small shoals ta be dredged, and 'it bas

670

SENATE

been stated in one way or another that the
cost may be $100,000--some have put it as
high as $500,000-to make a safe channel
froin Lake Ontario down to Ogdensburg on
the American side or Prescott on the Canadian
side. But I cannot see, for the life of me,
why it is necessary to make that agreement
at the present time, or before the Government
have decided what final action they are to
take in connection with the whole international section.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: You could not use
the new Welland Canal unless there were a
place to discharge. You must have a place at
Prescott in order to utilize the Welland.
Hon. Mr. REID: I am stating only that it
is not necessary for us to enter into an agreement with the United States whereby they
will do certain work if we will do certain other
work in connection with these terminals.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is not this
really what the Minister meant, that the
location of the terminals at Prescott is contingent on the United States Government,
either through agreement or otherwise, doing
certain works on the channel west of Prescott?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

On their side.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is, the
channel on their side of the river.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If he says it
would be unnecesary if the terminals were
somewhere else, does he not mean that if the
terminals were ýplaced for instance at Kingston, at the foot of Lake Ontario, no work
would be necessary on the American side, but
if they are at Prescott -the channel on the
American side will have to be deepened, and
that must be done either by the Anerican
Government or through agreement with them?
Hon. Mr. REID: He may mean that, but
he does not say that. There is the point that
I am raising, in order that I may get an answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Reid) is in error.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think that is
whýt the Minister says.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the Minister speaks of works on the American side.
Hon. Mr. REID: Where does he make that
statement?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend give me again the page from
which he has read?
Hon. Mr. REID.

Hon. Mr. REID: Page 3983:
I suppose that no matter where the terminals
were located some arrangement would have to
be made with the United States in regard to
dredging?
Above that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there appears this statement:
Mr. Elliott: I would say that at present the
décision is somewhat contingent upon the arrangement whieh can be made with the goverrnent of the United States as to the work
to be done in their own channels.
Hon. Mr. REID: That may mean exactly
what the right honourable gentleman from
Brockville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) has
stated. I think his interpretation is probably
right. If the section from Prescott to Ogdensburg west to Lake Ontario is meant, then of
course there is no question at all about that
t
point. If the sta ement does net mean that,
and if tîhe decision is contingent upon dredging or other work to be done between Cornwall and Lake Ontario, or in other parts of
the St. Lawrence, then I arn afraid we may
have trouble. That is one reason why I am
eager to have a thorough understanding in
this respect. Another reason is this. If I remember rightly I have read somewhere
eviýdence to the effect that the Aluminum
Company are to do adl this work between
Lake Ontario and the Long Sault Rapids, and

they would spend

$1,000,000.

Now,

if

an

agreement is to be made with the United
States Government I would suggest that the
Canadian Government should be sure that
that agreement -does not tie them up; that is,
that the agreement covers the section between Ogdensburg or Prescott and Lake
Ontario and does not bind them in any way
as to the work eastward to Cornwall until
they come to make the final arrangement, perhaps on the advice of the Advisory Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Now, I think
I can convince my honourable friend that
my interpretation of the minister's meaning
was right:
Mr. Geary: I suppose that no matter where
the terminals were located some arrangement
would have to be made with the United States
in regard to dredging?
Mr. Elliott: Not necessarily.
That means, in my humble judgment, that
if the terminals were located west of the
point where the American channel has to
be dredged, it would not be necessary to
make any agreement.
Hon. Mr. REID: I agree that the interpretation given by he right honourable Senator from Brockville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
is the interpretation that we should accept,

JUNE 7, 1928
and I trust that if at next Session we are
discussing any arrangement that lias been
made, the honourable leader of the Goverument will lie able to say that thuis has been
the interpretation upon whieh action bias been
based. That is the point I wanted to have
cleared up. My desire to have it thoroughly
understood is one of the reasons why 1 speak
th-is afternoon. We who live on the St.
Lawrence have had se much trouble in the
past, or there have been so many possibilities of getting into trouble, with this company, through action which they have taken,
that I t1hink honourable gentlemen will agree
that 'it is not too much f or us to take every
precaution we can for the future. It is for
this reason that I arn expressing some of my
fears. Let me add that personally I took a
strong position three or four years ago, and
subsequently. I agree with the right honourable &entator from Broekville, when lie sa.ys
that the development must go on. It may
not be carried out immediately, buý the
tirne will corne wlien it must be made, and
I would like to see it du-ring my lifetime.
When the question came up about four years
ago it was due to propaganda started by the
United States, in which they did not hesitate
to say that they were willing to pay a large
share of the cost of this great work-whether
it was one-haîf, or what proportion, 'I do
neot remember. I thought we were justified
in coming to sorne arrangement with them,
but after a little while it turned out that
we were to be ini the same position as in the
case of the St. Lawrence Power Company:
that the Aluminum Company was behind the
whole scheme; that it was not going to cost
the United States Government one dollar, as
the company were going to do ahl the work
and to have the power. 0f course they could
very well afford to undertake the development, because it would not be too expensive.
So, as soon as I realized that we were to
lie entirely in the hands of the Aluminurn
Company again, I was opposed to any such
proposition.
As 1 have stated, the evidence adduced before our Committee has been very valuable
and of great assistance t'o us. I trust tha;t the
information obtained on the St. Lawrence
waterway will be hrought up and discussed in
the House at some future Session. My fears
are more than ever justified. The honourable
leader of the government in this House will
undoubtedly discuss this whole question from
time te time at Gouncil meetings with hie
colleagues.- He lias liad, I believe, an advantage over other members of tlie Governinent
ini having heard the evidence given before the

671

Cornmittee. I believe lie is i a much better
position than he was to understand the situation. I shaîl be pleased if at another Session
the lionourable gentleman can informa us that,
lie having taken an active part, the Government have arranged ta place the canal and the
power-liouse entirely on our own side and we
are not under obligation to any other country,
but are in exactly the same position as at
present, with respect to our navigation and
power. If tlie honourable gentleman can give
us that assurance. I shaîl feel just as proud of
him as I did of the right lionourable gentleman
from. Brockville (Right Hon. Mr. Grahiam)
when lie knocked in the head the proposal
tliat was mnade in 1908; and I arn sure Ontaro
will feel grateful tliat our power is saved for
ourselves. We cannot develop and use 1,100,000 horse-power within the next two, three,
four, five or six years: we bave to develop the
units as we requirie tiemn.
Now, a certain proposition lias been made.
I do not know whetlier it is worth considering,
or wlietlier the Government would consider
it. The Aluminum Company have offered to
develop the navigation and power withou't
cost ta the United States Government if the
company inay have the power. Why cannot
the Canadian Government offer ta allow the
Government of Ontario to take advantage of
a similar proposition, if the decision of the
court is in favour of the Dominion Government? Sucli a proposition miglit be made te
the Hydro Electrie Commission to take over
the oonstruction of the power plant and ita
development, and, if tihey refused, wliy should
the Governrnent not let Canadian citizens
have an opportunity te 'build ou-r portion on
condition that they may have tlie power at
rates to lie agreed upon? If, on the other
hand, it is decided that .the Ontario
Governmenit own the .power, let ûhem prooeed
with the development on aur side.
As I
remember the evidience given by members of
tlie Joint Engineering Board, tliey stated-and
lionourable gentlemen who were present will
know wliether I arn puttting the facts correctly or not-that if the two-stage proposition weïre undertaken we sliould have at
Crysler Island about 300,000 or 400,000 horsepower on the Canadian side, and 300,000 or
400,000 on the American side. I asked whether
we could develop 200,000 horse-power on our
side at Barnhart Island, and the engineer who
answere.d the question said, "Yes, 200,000
or 300,000.', 1 arn not quite sure that lie did
not say 500,000. At all events, between the
two points we should have probably 600,000
or 800,000 horse-power on the Canadian side.
I arn so anxious to see Ontario and Quebec

possible that in years te come the Governments may not be on as friendly terms as they
are to-day, and the United States Government, simply by placing a toll on that small
section of the St. Lawrence waterway under
their control, could deprive us of our navigation, or could at least prevent us from operating unless we carried out what they desired.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Do you mean
that they would drive the traffic te the American route?

For instance, if they put 5 or 10 cents a

DIVORCE BILL (ONTARIO)
POSITION OF THE SENATE

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I wish to read a statement relating te the
Bill which we have been discussing somewhat
I shall read it without
with closed doors.
any comment at all: I am not going to add
anything te it or subtract anything from it.
It will be open te every member of the House
te discuss it as much as he sees fit:
Before the Orders of the Day are called,
I wish te make a short statement te this House
in respect te the Divorce Bill which was passed
by this House in the early days of the Session,
namely, on the eighth day of February, and
which now stands for consideration ii, the
other House.
I have already given te this Chamber some
of the reasons why, in my opinion, it is

JUNE 8, 1928
desira.ble that this Bill hould become law,
and why, ini my opinion, it would not lead to
an increase in the number of divorces, but
on the contrary would have a tendency ta
decrease the number. I need nlot repeait these
reasons.
If the other Bouse rejeots this Bill after
consideration, as they have a right to do,
then the members on this aide of the Bouse
will ask the Commons to bear one-half of the
petitions for divorce which may reach Parliament. In the event of the other Chamber
not dealing with this Divorce Bill, I arn in a
position ta state that the members on this side
of the Bouse will refuse ta serve on the
Divorce Committee, with this exception, that
they will, as formerly, hear any petitions th-at
corne ta the Senate from the province of
Quebec.
This iS in furtherance of the declared intention of this Chamber nlot ta interfere wjth
the question of divorce so far as it relates
ta the province of Quebec, as stated. and expIained on the first introduction of the Bill
in this Chamber. Excluding Quebee, the oniy
provinces without a Divorce Court are Ontario
and Prince Edward Island; so that this statement wi!l be of most interest ta the people of
these twa provinces.
That, I arn satisfled, is the almost unamimous opinion of this aide of the House. There
was no formai meeting ta discuss the matter,
but I have discussed it with members of the
Committee and with as many inembers of
the Bouse as I could sec, and that is the position that the great majority of them take.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honiaurable
gentlemen, eince we have heard the abatement
of the honourable leader on the cither aide
as ta the gtand which membere of the Sonate
for whom he speakas may take next Session,
I feel that the Senate and the public have not
sufficiently -appreciated the imnportance and
the mort dieagreeable character of the woerk
which. has fallen upon the group of Senators
who undertook ta sit in the Divorce Coinmittee. While we -have ail done our share in
dealing with questions thiat have caine beo re
us, without attracting the notice of the outaide public, the nie members wthom we appomnted tao the Divorce Committee have been
obhiged te work day in and diay out, wîthout
any adjoumment, and withaut the advantage
of enjoying -tihe fresh, air during certain houre
of the day. Their conduot bae been nioet

it.

far as I airn concerned personally-of the very
effective regulation of traffic by, I presume,
the Department of Public Works and the
Mounted Police. I think it must have been
very gratifying to honourable memibers of this
House, as well as to honourable members of
the other Chamber and te the public, that,
after some delay, this work was taken in hand
with resolution, and most effective provision
was made for the protection of people who
are moving about Parliament Hill. For my
part I want to congratulate those concerned,
and particularly the officers of the Mounted
Police, who have been doing this service in
a most effective and gentlemanly way, as
they always do.
One thing remains now, I think, namely,
that the city of Ottawa should take up the
question of traffic regulation on Wellington
street. I hope that effective means willî be
put into operation by the authorities of the
city of Ottawa to control the traffic on
Wellington street, which is at times very
perilous indeed for pedestrians.
PENSION BILL
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: I rise to a question

of privilege arising out of the debates in this
House yesterday. During the debate on the
Pension Bill two honourable gentlemen
thought it proper to question a statement of
fact that I made as to the insufficiency of the
law at present to protect appeals which
soldiers are naturally entitled to make. I said
at the time that I had the documents supporting my position, but that they were in
the hands of a menber of the other House.
I have the documents now. I have on one
page a review of a case addressed to the
Hon. J. H. King, Minister of Soldier's Civil
Re-establishment, recourse being had to him
only after this unfortunate man had run the
gamut of all the appeal boards, medical units,
and all other organizations he could find. He
finally came to the head of the Department,
and asked him for redress. Dr. King, I may
say, is usually sympathetic with those cases,
so that the man was net using any poor
judgment in going to the 'Minister; and this is
the reply he got:
Ottawa, November 25, 1926.
Honourable J. H. King, M.D. M.P.,
Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment,
Ottawa, Canada.
No. 216720 Pte. Wm. A. Stevenson.

Dear Dr. King:
With reference te the marginally named man,
the following is a review of his case as set
forth by the Chief Medical Adviser:
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

"This man's arm was fractured in 1897, twenty
years before he enlisted, and since that time
the joint has been weak and stiff.
"The Commissioners have very carefully considered the case and are of opinion that the
arm condition was present prier to enlistment
and was not aggravated during military service.
"The man appeared at Head Office and was
examined by several of the Medical staff. He
stated at that time that his condition was
aggravated by his being blown up by a shell
and rendered unconscious and that he was
evacuated from the lines four hours after his
explosion. A thorough search of the Casualty
List and Part Il Daily Orders of the First
C.M.R. Bn., in which e states be was wounded,
fails to show any mention of a casualty having
occurred to this man. If he was sent out of
the lines as a casualty it would be mentioned
in Part II Daily Orders.
"Mr. Stevenson appealed to the Federal Appeal Board and its decision was that the arm
condition pre-existed enlistment and was aggravated on service. The Pension Board then
pensioned him for aggravation of the arm condition (as per the ruling of the Federal Appeal
Board) at one-quarter of his entire assessment
in respect of the arm.
"This is a purely arbitrary award and was
made in accordance with the judgment of the
Federal Appeal Board. The total disability
from the arm is estimated at twenty per cent
and he was awarded five per cent pension retroactive to discharge. At the present time
be is not totally disabled from his arm condition. If he had lest his hand he would be
entitled to only sixty per cent pension and if he
had lest the arm at the shoulder he could receive an eighty per cent pension only according
te the regulations. The Board of Pension Commissioners was of the opinion that this man's
arm was in exactly the sae condition as when
he joined the army but on the judgment of the
Federal Appeal Board one-quarter of the total
disability was awarded for aggravation."
It would appear that this man injured his arm
before enlistment, and that he is entitled to an
aggravation only of the condition. This be has
received back to the time of his discharge. Your
enclosures are returned herewith.

Hon. Mr. COPP:

Who signs that?

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: J. F. Ellis, Commissioner. The enclosures include a photograph showing the man's condition. I regret
that the photograph cannot be placed on
Hansard, but I have it here. It shows one
arm capable of full extension, but the other
know of my
arm permanently bent. I
own knowledge that this is not in any sense
a faked photograph, because it was taken
under the direction of a medical officer of
a Unit, who served through France ,and
who knows all about soldiers their treatment
and their weaknesses. He assured me that
the arm could not be straightened any more
than as shown in this photograph, and that
he had personally taken the matter up with
the local authorities and with Dr. King.

JUNE 8, 192867
I mention this simply to show the wrong
that we have donce to men of this class by
excluding the right of appeal which, the Coinmons offered to themn, owing to the statements so positively made to us yesterday,
that they were slready fully provided for,
and also to support the statemients which I
made, as of my personal knowledge, that
cases like this ooeur anKd are not proîvi-ded for.
There is another point to which I wieh to
take exception. I have flot understood that
courtesy in debate has become merely a
legend in this Chamber. I have thought it
was one of the distingui8hing marks of the
Senate, and so far as I arn concerned I have
endeavoured to comport myseif with that in
mind. I think I said nothing yesterdav
provocative of any unkind rejoinder froin any
source; yet I see this froin no less a person
than the leader of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: A statement which hie
did not volunteer, but which the Committee
asked of him.
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: I myseif asked.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Yes, he volunteered his
attendance there for the purpose of being
asked.
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: Yes, with other mentbers of the Gommons Committee. -I pity my
honourable friend's state of mind.
If that is in accordance with the courtesy
of debate Whirh is supposed to rule in this
Chamber, or to have ruled, then I fail to
understand what courtesy is. In My opinion
it is a most improper statement, which. shouid
have been chalicnged and recalled whcn made.
I myseif resent it. I might have reflectedI do not intend to reflect now-on the mentality of my honourable fricnd, in the attitude
he took in connection with the matter then
under discussion. I did not do so. I said
nothing provocative, and I think it should
not pass unnoticcd that an unscciy remark
of this kind was made by the leader of the
Senate respecting a msn who had done nothing to cause it.
Honourabie
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I oonfess that I was somewhat
adverseiy affccted 'by thé attitude of my
honourabie friend yesterday; and since hie
refers to what was passed in this Chamber
I have no objection to explain to him how
iny sentiment was cxprcssed -in perhaps too
abrupt a manner. I feit, and I still feel, that
the Senate of Canada has a duty to perform.
We are a revising body, and the more we do

addressed ourselves to the solution of a most
difficuit problein, that of pensions to soldiers.
I think we have done so in a way deserving
commendation fromn the members of the
House of Gommons who came -by invitation
to the sittings of our Committee. Now, I
believe that my honourable friend in the
debate yestcrday sinned against two miles
which should govern members of the Senate.
He enlarged upon what had taken place in
Committec. The rule is that there should
be no statement as to the incidents in Committce, and that mile is obviously just, because there are no shorthand writers to take
down exactly ail that is said.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen will remember that 1 callcd attention to
that, and asked that I might be checked if
I may say
I were transgrcssing the rules.
that I have not found any rule except that

suspicion that there was one, and I inviteI.
challenge ycsterday, but there was no challenge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, documents
which were brought to the Gommittee may be
referred to. I abstained froin stating what
had been my action as representative of the
Govcrnment in the Committee, as to, motions
that I had made and that had been rejected.
I abstained from. doing that because, I wanted
the work of that Committee, and the result of
that work, to be the product of the whole
Committee, and I .bowed to the décisions of
the Committee.
My honourable fricnd went one atep
further, by singling out one of the gentlemen,
whom. we had invited with other members of
the Commons, to, attend our sittings; and hie
stated that the reason hie mentioned the presenice of that Minister waa that hie might share
the responsibility with us in the decision we
had taken. He also, mentioned the politicaI
or Party effect which it would have. I confesa
that that displeased me, and I believe it dis,pleased a number of other members of the
Senate. Now, it was unf air to put that Min,ster in that position, because the whole situa:tion had not been stated. What was the
situation? The situation was that suggestions
had come from the other ChamberHon. Mr. TAYLOR: If I might interrupt
the honourable gentleman, I 'would have liked
to discues that matter myseif, but I realized
that II could not do so on a question of
privilege. Now, if the hoaiourable gentleman
is going to, discuss the position of the Minister on a question of privilege, I would like
the opportunity to discus it aiea.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, I simply
want to say this, that my honourable friend
did not do justice to the party that he mentioned, and that is what was somewhat vexing.
The Minister of Defence had come there at
the demand of Mr. Barrow, the representative
of the returned soldiers, in order to help
him, and help their views to prevail in the
Committee, or assist by some suggestions. The
Minister accepted the invitation, and came.
He was sitting there when the provision that
we had delegated to the Chairman of the
Pension Board was read to us. It was a new
proposition, and everybody proceeded to examine it. The honourable gentleman from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) stated yesterday that it was he who turned to the Minister of Defence and asked him bis view.
The minister was then conferring with Mr.
Barrow and examining it at first sight. They
were agreeing that after many attempts had
been madeHon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, I rise to a point of order. I think the
honourable gentleman is out of order. I have
raised with respect to him the point that he
used towards me certain language whieh in
my opinion should be withdrawn.
It was
not competent for me on a question of privilege to discuss the matter which he is discussing now. If it was not competent for me, it is
equally not competent for him. The point
I have raised is open to him to discuss. The
other question he may discuss in another way,
on tJhe motion to adjourn, and then we may
all participate, but it is not open to him to
carry on this discussion on the question of
privilege raised by me. I appeal to you for
your ruling, Sir.
R:ight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He is telling
you why he used the language.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: He is not permitted
to use the language at al].
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will close the
two incidents by simply stating these facts.
The Minister of Defence has wuitten to me
that in answer to a question he had said that
from a quick examination of the clause which
we adopted he was impressed with ist and
felt tihat it registered the desire of Parliament to accept the principle of providing
for the class of cases we had in mind , and he
thought lit would be worth while to give the
clause a trial for a year to see how it would
work out. That was after conferring with
the soldiers' representative who had invited
him there. A number of attempts had been
made to find a solution and all had failed.
Here was a solution that had been presented
by the Chailrman of the Board.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Now, as to the remark I made, I regret
exceedingly having been under the obligation
of saying somethi-ng that wns disagreeable
to my honourable friend. It bore only on his
state of mind which brought into the debate
a party interest, which we all wanted te see
eliminated.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I appealed to Mr.
Speaker a while ago to know if this was in
order. To my mind it is clearly out of order.
I behieve that if it is out of order I am entitled to say something in answer to the
closing statements of the honourable gentleman, who has not withdrawn his offensive
remarks and has not palliated them in any
way. I claim that there was a direct breach
of the rules of this House and of the courtesies that we expert in this House. As to
the Minister, I made no comment whatever
on his right to be in the Committee or his
right to do what he did. I have read carefully what I said, and I stand by every word
of it as proper and decorous. Whet I sa.id
was that whatever happened in that Committee had happened on the advice and with
the consent of a gentleman who was Minister of Defence and the soldiers' spokesman
in the other House, and that I hoped that
what had happened and was happening would
not be made the excuse for a repetition of
the cry that soldiers' legislation was bedevilled
by the Conservative Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only statement I can make is that my remark was
simply addressed to the inappropriateness of
my honourable friend's bringing into the debate the party question, inasmuch as our
joint effort was to keep this matter out of
party wrangles.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: How about the Conservative Senate? You have that spread all
over the country.
MESSAGE FROM HOUSE OF COMMONS

THE LEAGUE 0F NATIONS
CANADA'S REPRESENTATIVE

On the Orders of the Day:
'Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
wit.h, I should like to asic my honourable
friend who is representing Canada at the
presenit meeting of the Council of the League
of Nations at Geneva.
The HonourHon. Mr. DANIDURKND:
able Philippe Roy, our representative at Paris.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE tE. POSTPER:
And under instructions, special, or general,
fromn the Government?
Ail I can say
Hon. Mr. DA.NDURAND:
is that I was informed as to the matters on
the agenda, and I found that there were but
two questions, namýely, the Hungarian Optants
'n Transylvania, and the importation of
contraband materials of war into Hungary
con.trary. to the terme of the Treaty of
Trianon, which was discused at the last
meeting, while another Cana dian representative sat in the Co-uneil. .1 feit it my duty
Vo informn the Hon. Mr. Roy in a summary
manner as to the discussions and conclusions
with regard to these matteTs. I have reasoln
to believe that they will not be finally disposed of at this aitting.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: The Leader of the
Senate will permit me to say that hie personally wau certain that the Council of ýh
League of Nations would follow the usual
practice and postpone to the greek ca'lends
any embarrassing questions.
0f course, my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend would mnuch, prefer that
there should be no such unions, where Governments meet, and that matters should
continue to drift, as they drifted before the
war, and end even ia chaos.
BUJSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND:
gentlemen, there are no Orders of the Day,
and the Senate, having finished its labours, is
awaiting legisiation from the House of Commens. It is very difficuit to prognosticate

677

w.hen the labours of the other House w-ill
end; but the Senate is in attendance. I
suggest, with the concurrence of this honourable House, seconded by the right honourable
gentleman fromn Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham), that the Senate suspend its sitting
tilt halý-past two this afternoon, because tben
we wilýl know whether there is a Iikelihood
of prorogation to-day. If there is not, we
may then adjourn to Monday of next week.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, I certainly have no intention or
desire Vo dictate the time to whieh we
should or will adjourn, but it seems to me
that it is noV dignified for this House teo it
here hour by hour and day by day, waiting
to be told that at a certain time we are to
be called upon to prorogue Parliamenýt. If
at 4 or 5 o'clock this afternoon the House
of Commons is going te send to this Chamber
the bundlie of Estimates and appropriations
that I have heard of, I hardly think it is fair
to asic us to consider them on such short
notice. If my honourable friend would move
the adjourniment, of the Senate until Mon,
day or Tuesday, regardlles of what is done in
another place, and in anticipation of the
rumeurs on -the street and elsewhere that
Parliament is not going to prorogue to-day,
we would have an opportunity of studying
measures that are altogether too important
to be deait with in the short time that will
be at our disposal before the Governor
General arrives. 1 un-derstand tbhat some
private legislation of very great importance
to the part of the country which I come from
bas run out. 1 tbink the honourable gentleman miglit very well ask that the House
adjourn until Monday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My bonourable friend will recognize that it bas been our
practice, when we are through with our work,
to await the good pleasure of the Commons,
at the same time not forgetting what we
ourselves owe Vo the country. My suggestion
hs that we should meet again at half-past
two. If we are told then that the Commons
will finish their labours and send Vo us the
Supply Bill, say at 5 o'clock-it is the only
Bill 1 expect te seecooming from the Commons--then it will be for the Senate ta decide
whether -it bas enough time, as it generafly
has had in the past, to diseuse the Bill. If
the Senate feels, when it sees the Supply
Bill, that it needs a day or two ta discuss
it, it is supreme and will decide accordingly.
1 would urge pny honoura bic friend not Vo
insist, before we know what >work: is coming,
that we should adjourn until ncxt week. If

78

SENATE

the Leaders in the other House, whom I will
consult, feel that it is useless for us to remain
here during this afternoon to await the result
of their labours, I will move the adjournment to a day next week, probably Monday.
Hon. Mr. REID: It is quite evident from
the remarks of the honourable gentleman
that he does not expect anything to come
from the Commons with reference to the
Divorce Bill. Has he made any inquiries of
the Government as to whether or not there
is to be a vote upon it? If he bas not done
so already, will he inquire and let us know
the situation at half-past two.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that the Bill in question can only be taken
up ahead of the Bills that stand before it
on the Order Paper by the unanimous consent
of the House. I think a request will be made
for that unanimous consent, but I have not
much hope that it will be granted.
The sitting was suspended until 2.30 p.m.
At 2.30 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, in conformity with my statement
of this morning I sought the best information
I could obtain, the result of which is that I
will move now that the sitting of the Senate
be suspended until 6 o'clock this afternoon.
I am told that I shall have by that time
sufficient knowledge as to the possibility of
prorogation this evening, and I shall inform
the House accordingly. If there is no possibility of prorogation, I shall naturally move
that the Senate adjourn until Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
NAVIGATION

OF WELLAND

CANAL

INQUIRY

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
gentlemen,
suspend is
an inquiry
I consider

Honourable

before the motion to adjourn or
put, I desire to draw attention te
which I made weeks ago and which
very important. This is the notice

that I gave:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
at its next sitting to the navigation of the new
Welland Canal, and enquire from the Government:1. Has there been a consultation between the
engineers and the marine officers of the Government or the captains whose vessels may
navigate the new Welland Canal as to the
method of operation?
2. Are the vessels to approach the locks and
negotiate them on their own steam?
3. Is it the intention to employ tugs as in
the Manchester Ship Canal?
4. Is it the intention to use locomotives as
on the Panama Canal?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

5. If such consultation bas not taken place,
will the Government, in the near future, act in
the premises in order that no delay occurs once
the said canal is completed?
I made a few remarks at the time. I know
the honourable Leader bas forgotten this
matter, and I forgive him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sure that I have forgotten.

I am not so

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have made careful inquiry and there bas been no answer
given to these questions. Of course, what
concerns only my humble self does not matter
se much, but the dignity of the Senate is at
stake, and when we ask a question of the
government we are, entitled, I think, to have
some answer during the Session. The answer
in this instance would have been very easy.
Now that the honourable gentleman desires
to have the sitting suspended until 6 o'clock,
I think that between now and then be can
easily obtain the answer if be will.
I have just now repeated my questions. I
will not discuss them once more, for I explained them fully on a former occasion;
but I would point out that if no action is
taken in the matter to which I have drawn
attention. it may require years to do what
should be done in the first place. Unless
some method is adopted by which the canal
may be navigated, an expenditure of $115,000,000 will be absolutely of no use to the shipping of this country. I dare say the inquiry
had slipped the honourable gentleman's memory, but I think we are entitled to an answer.
It is very important in the public interest
that something should be done; otherwise,
under present conditions, vessels cannot navigate the Welland Canal under their own
steam.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend is in error if he thinks that the matter
bas slipped my rnemory: it bas only slipped
out of the Routine Proceedings. If the bonourable gentleman had seen to it that his
inquiry was retained on the Order Paper until
he got an answer, it would have been before
me each day and I should have had my
secretary telephone the Railway Department.
I did draw the attention of that Department
to the matter. I do not know by what
accident it bas disappeared from the Order
Paper before the answer bas been given, for
an inquiry should remain on the Order Paper
until it is answered. I would point out te
my honourable friend that this is Saturday
and that on Saturday afternoon I may not
find the Department open.

BILL No. 3
FIRST READING

Bill 359, an Act for granfing fo Bis Majesty
certain sums of moýney for the public service
of the financial year ending the 3lst March,
1929.-Bon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, we have
now the final legislation of this Session witb
the coming of the Supply Bill. If covers the
lion. W. B. ROSS.

Main Estimates for 1928-29. With tbese we
are familiar, because wve biave already voted
part of them, for the months of April and
May. Tbey are contained in Scbcdule A.
We have also before us Schedule B, totalling
$47,156,644.50, which represent s the moneys to
be expended by the Staf e railway system and
the Merchant Marine, under the administration of the same Departmenf. We bave in
Schedule C the Supplementary Estimates,
copies of which were disfribufed to honourable members of this Chamber, and which
ropresent a further expenditure of $10.468,611.91. I need not enter into the defails of
theso supplementary estimates: I tbink tbey
have not been criticised, and wc are warranfed
in faking for granted that fbey are justified.
In fact the supplementary estimafes for 192829 were very carcfully examined before being
presented f0 Parliament, and I am free f0
say that fbey do not include ail the items
wbicb the various heads of departmnents wouid
have liked f0 find therein. Members of the
Government hear advice in favour of economny
and rctrenchment,' and they are as disposed
to follow this policy as are those who 50
freely give thaf advice, but of course the
Governmenf's situation is somewhat different,
in that if bas f0 deal with concrete cases.
and wben if bears voices raised in different
parts of the country if renhizes that while
economy is always urged, if is fo bc prau.tised
rather by one's neigbbour.
Scbedude ID represents a proposed expenditure which is bard f0 fix cleai'ly. If is an
aufbnrizaftion to advanoe for the paymenf of
pension th-e amount of $1,000,000, plus a
9mall amount, $200, covering a special oase.
The total mentioned is probably an outside
figure. Af aIl events tif represents the desire
expressed by Parliamenit f0 pncovide whatever miay be required under tbis bead.
Bon. W. B. ROSS: Bonourable gentlemen,
I shall bave very f ew remarks to make in
respect of t:bis Bill. if wil'l in effecf end our
Session, a Session as f0 whicb, on the wdîiole,
the Senafe may congratulate itself ind say
that if, bas done ifs9 work quite efficientiy,
wifh a minimum of friction, and ta the satisfaction of the country.
I will flot enter into a discussion on fhe
details of the Supply Bill, bu.t I must express
my satisfaction af the deletion from tbe Bill
of item 519 wvhich at one time threatened
f0 be a disturbing factor in this Huse.
I
wvould noît like if f0 go ouf fo thbe country
that the items of supply bave not been the
subjet of thougbt on the part of boneurable
mnemibers of tbis Huse. Alt'bough we have
bad no formaI debaýte on the Supply Bill and

JTUNE 11, 1928
no formai xiesolutions, I amn able to say that
the Bill has been the subject of a great deal
of thought by honourable memibers of this
House; and it is proper tihait such should be
the case. With these rernarks I arn content
thaV the Bill should paes at once as lhid
before us.
There is, iiowev'er, one further rernark th&t
mayr fot be out of place. 1 look forward in
anather Session or two, to. the time when we
may tre.t the Sýipplýy Bill in a fashion somewhat different frorn the wia.y we have ýtreated
it in the past. It cornes before us in a solid
block. That difficulty la of course palbâted
by the fact tthat, tas I hiavP eilready stated,
the Bill has been the subj ect of a gooci deal
of individual consideration. In another part
&f tihe world there is a praotioe which we
have flot yet a.dopted, namnely, that of sending
the Supply Bill back ito the House of Commons for reconsideration. lu -the Australian
constitution, which precludes the Senate from
âmending the Stipply Bill, there is a cl-ause
providing thait, although the Seniate rnay not
aliter the Bill, it mey senci it back to the
Lower House with the requet to reconsider
tihe items. That anethod has only the effeet
of provoking friendly discussion, fer, afiter ali,
the Senate caiuvt interfere, with tihe SUpplY
Bill if the Governmenft 'insista on iV. 1t .might
be practicSble to have our Supply Bill corne
up to us ia sections. Take for example the
Departrnent of Riailws.ys, or the Post Office:
thât would flot be too big a subi ect for this
flouse to deal with at one time. If the
estimates carne before us secition by section,
insteaci of ail corn4ng togeth-er, we anight conemtrate our efforts upon ea.ch section. I rememiber the man who coinplained that his
rnater was in -the habit of Vhrowing the yearly
statuties at him: he scid he did nàt minci that
at a&l,but when. he took to throwing at him
the consolidated stâtutes, lie objeeted.
-Pight Hon. Mr. ýGRAHAM: It wus toa big
a load.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I feel the same way
about the Supply Bill. If it were sent up Vo
us piece by piece we coulci deal with it more
gatisfactoriiy, but when we receive the consolidateci Supply Bill it almost frightens one
to look at it or attempt Vo say anything
about it. The future will Vake care of îtself,
but I think that, without our Constitution
l4eing changed at ail, there la room for a
1 ttIe friendly interchange of views between
thia House and the other, and if that method
*Ore adopted the complaint made here that
the work la deferred until laVe in the Session
and la then dumped on us in one mass would

681

be obviateci. Furtherrnore, that interchange
of views would be, I believe, an acivantage
to the country.
That is ail I have to say at present with
regard to the Supply Bill. I hope that when
we nicet next year we shall be able to congratulate ourselves upon Canada having haci
in 1928, la the fieldi, the forest, the mine and
the factory, a prosperous and splendid year.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable gentlemen, there is a good deal to
think about in what -the honourable Leader
on the other side of the House has saici. I
want to addc a suggestion that I think cornes
within the four cornera of the Supply Bill.
ln the city of Montreal the C.N.R. has expended considerable money andi contemplates
expending many millions more for the creation
of new terminaIs, particularly, 1 thinli, for the
passenger traffie of that railway. This is
esseatial, because the traffie requires iV. It
is necessary for the safety of the public, and
it must be done in order to carry out an
order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, particuiarly along the line of the
elimination of many level crossings. The
C.P.R., with lits very rapidly increasing traffic,
will soon have to make an improvement or
enlargement of its facilities. The suggestion
I have to make to the Covernment, the Canadian National andi the C.P.R. is this, that
iV is noV too late for representatives of the
two latter to sit arounci a table together andi
discuss the possibilty-yes, the advisabilityof creating la the great city of Montreal a
central union station for aIl outgoing andi ail
incoming passenger traffic. This is according
to modern railway activity. IV is almost
necessary for the city of Montreal, it would
be a great boon Vo, Vhe travelling public, from
Europe as well as from other parts of Canada, and to rny mmnd it would he an economy
for the two railways.
The motion was agreeci Vo, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Re saici: Honourable gentlemen, may I
take occasion to say that the surprise expressed by some honourable niember of the
Senate at the length of our first adjourament
and the curtailment of the work of thie
House has noV been justfed. I saici at the
time that I thought we shoulci have plenty
of time to cope with ail the work and that
before prorogation we shoulci be awaiting the

SENATE
good pleasure of the House of Commons. As
a matter of fact we have been awaiting it
for the last two weeks, when only the Pension Bill amendments and a short Bill respecting Soldiers' Land Settlement occupied
our attention.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
After which His Exoellency the Govemor
General ws pleased to close the Second
Session of the Sixteenth Padiament of the
Dominion of Canada with the following
Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I desire to express my appreciation of the
careful attention you have given to the various measures submitted for your consideration during the present session of Parliament.
It is a source of special satisfaction to
note that the public accounts of the fiscal
year recently ended disclose a substantial surplus and that you have been able to effeet a
further reduction in the public debt as well
as a further material reduction in taxation.
The trade of our country continues to expand. Exports of manufactured goods are
being well maintained and our total exports
to foreign countries show a considerable increase. It is anticipated that the volume of
foreign trade will reveal a further increase
as a result of the trade agreements just concluded.
I am gratified to observe that the interest
and benefit of ex-service men and of their
dependents has had particularly close and
sympathetic attention during the session. As
a result of the consideration you have given
to this most important subject, an Act has
been passed which considerably extends and
improves the provisions made for pensions in

SENATE
respect of disabilities and death connected
with the War, also an Act reviving the beneficial provisions of the Returned Soldier's
Insurance Act, and an Act affording further
material relief to Sold-ier Settlers.
The amalgamation of the Department of
Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment and the Department of Health into one department to
be known as the Department of Pensions and
National Health accords with a natural evolution and is a step which should serve to
promote efficiency and economy in administration.
The General subject of immigration, includng the work of the Department of Immigration and Colonization, has received careful
study throughout the session by the Committee on Agriculture and Colonization. After
months of inquiry into the many phases, both
national and international of this important
and intricate problem, the Committee has reported its conclusions and recommendations,
and the report has been adopted.
The extensive and important recommendations of the Commission recently appointed
to investigate all phases of the fishing industry of the Maritime Provinces, the Magdalen
Islands, and the coastal portion of the Province of Quebec, have been met in part, and
will continue to receive the attention of my
advisers.
The report of the National Advisory Committee on the St. Lawrence Waterway project
together with the views expressed thereon by
the Government of the United States in an
exchange of correspondence, which was submitted to Parliament at the present session,
will continue to receive careful consideration.
In this connection, provision has been made
for referring to the courts certain questions
as to federal and provincial jurisdiction with
respect to navigation and water powers.
The offer of assistance in the formation of
Civil Flying Clubs has met with a widespread response. Flying training has already
been started by Clubs both in eastern and
western Canada. The construction of the airship mooring tower at St. Hubert Aerodrome,
near Montreal, is being pressed with energy.

The special provision made for the establishment of National Research Laboratories
should greatly facilitate industrial research
and prove an aid to the more thorough utilization of our natural resources.
The provision made by the amendments to
the Federal District Commission Act, with a
view to commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation, will serve materially
to enhance the position of Ottawa as the
capital of the Dominion.
The appointment by His Majesty's Government in Great Britain of a High Commissioner to represent its interests in Canada has
been received with much satisfaction.
The appropriations of this session will
enable steps to be taken shortly to establish
Canadian Legations in France and Japan. It
is gratifying to know that the arrangements
recently made for the further restriction of
immigration from Japan, combined with the
exchange of Ministers between Japan and
Canada, give promise of affording a satisfactory solution of this long standing question.
The Canadian Government has learned with
deep interest of the proposals which the
Government of the United States, following
extended discussions with the Government of
France, has advanced for the renunciation of
war, and, in accord with His Majesty's other
Governments, has accepted the invitation of
the United States to participate in the signature of a multilateral pact directed to this
end and which it is earnestly hoped will materially strengthen the cause of peace throughout the world.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have
made for the public service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Abundant evidence surrounds us of the
For
increasing prosperity of our country.
this and other blessings I join with you in
humble gratitude to Divine Providence.
