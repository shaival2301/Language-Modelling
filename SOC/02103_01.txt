SUSPENSION OF RULES
MOTION
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved:
That during the present session of parliament
rules 23, 24 and 63 be suspended in so far as they
relate to public bills.
He said:
I point out to honourable senators that
the passage of this motion will in no way
take from the majority of the Senate the
right to decide the procedure which should
be followed in the consideration of legislation which comes before the house. Such a
motion is usually presented near the end of
a session, when any variation from the
regular procedure as to the passage of public
bills requires the unanimous consent of the
house.
I hope that, under the circumstances,
honourable senators will see fit to concur in
the present motion.
The motion was agreed to.
THE LATE RIGHT HONOURABLE W. L.
MACKENZIE KING
TRIBUTES TO FORMER PRIME MINISTER
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, on Saturday evening, July 22, 1950,
the career of the Right Honourable William
Lyon Mackenzie King came to an end at
his summer home in Kingsmere, Quebec.
He was for so long a prominent figure in
the public life of Canada that the great
majority of Canadians could scarcely recollect the time when he was not a dominating
personality in public affairs. Most of the
members on this side of our house, including
the most senior ones, were appointed by
governments of which he was the leader,
and many of them enjoyed a most intimate
association with him during his long political
life. It would be difficult indeed to assess
accurately the influence he exerted, over
the years, on the political thought and action
of the Canadian people.
Although he enjoyed political support for
an unparalleled period, it was inevitable that
at times he, and the policies which he
espoused, should be flercely assailed. It is
generally recognized that Canada is a difficult
country to govern under the most favourable

3

circumstances; but when, in addition to the
problems of peace, there arise the tremendous responsibilities of war, the likelihood of
violent differences of opinion is multiplied
many fold.
If there was one underlying principle
which ran like a silver thread throughout
the policies which governed Mr. King's long
political career, it was his passionate devotion
to the cause of national unity. He seemed
instinctively to think that in this country,
with its diverse and varied racial origins,
there existed circumstances fraught with
grave danger, but offering at the same time
tremendous possibilities. He seemed to realize that if, under the strain of great events
and deep emotions, long-forgotten animosities were revived, they might kindle a flame
which would soon run like a forest fire,
threatening our very na.tional existence. He
seemed to feel on the other hand, that if
during the most critical moments calm
councils could prevail and a deep sense of
national unity always be kept in view, there
would emerge in due course in this new world
a nation not only great in itself, but one
destined to provide an example for all the
world to witness and, he hoped, to be emulated.
At times his caution provoked great resentment, his facility for compromise was ridiculed, and his failure to take under some
circumstances more decisive action was
severely criticized. How history will assess
his influence time alone will show. But the
fact remains that during the period in which
he directed the affairs of Canada there was
achieved a degree of unity and harmony
among the various diverse elements within
her boundaries, which left little to be desired.
His careful approach to the events leading up
to the Second World War resulted in securing parliament's unanimous approval of the
policies he proposed to it. Throughout the
entire period of hostilities and the trying
circumstances of the post-war years, the unity
and co-operation of all sections of Canada
provided an inspiring spectacle. From a position of comparative obscurity among the
nations of the world, Canada had assumed a
position of great importance and influence in
the councils of the nations-an influence far
exceeding the numbers of her people.
The halls of parliament in which he was
such a familiar figure shall know him no
more, but his influence on the political
thought and action of the country he served
so well will be felt far into the future.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I think it is most fitting that this house should
give a little time to remembering the passing
of one of our great Canadians. I believe

SENATE
that in general our references to the passing
of others than our own members should be
few, but I heartily agree that this is one
instance when we should say something.
Though not as familiar with Mr. King as the
leader of the government was, I have had the
pleasure of knowing every Canadian prime
minister since the time of Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
who himself was one of our great statesmen.
The holders of that high office have been, in
turn, Sir Robert Borden, the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen, the Right Honourable
William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Right
Honourable R. B. Bennett, then Mr. King
again, until the time of his retirement, when
the present Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Louis S. St. Laurent, took over.
Prior to coming to the Senate I had been a
member of a provincial legislature, but not of
the House of Commons, and therefore had
had no opportunity of becoming familiar with
the outstanding figures in that house. However, I was not long here before feeling the
dominant influence exercised by Mr. King.
During the fifteen years that I had an opportunity to observe his work, I saw that he
created in parliament a unity that was
striking for this country. There were violent
differences of opinion as to his policies, yet
no matter how widely one disagreed with
him one felt that he believed in the policies be
was advocating.
I prize very highly my associations with
Mr. King over the period of fifteen years. As
an ordinary member, and later in the position which I now hold, with the duty of
representing in my feeble way the policy of
my party, I at times considered it necessary to
criticize legislation introduced by Mr. King's
government; but nothing that I ever said
made the slightest difference in the personal
relations that existed between us during all
those years. I saw him when he made his last
public appearance; it was at the Country Club,
on the occasion of the dinner to the British
Empire Press party; and I knew at that time
that the end was near. When I came up to
him he greeted me in the old university style,
"Hello, Haig! How are you?" Now he has
passed on. History will establish his place
among the prime ministers of this country,
and I am persuaded that it will be a very
high one. Personal animosities that have
existed from time to time will disappear and
his true worth will be known.
Speaking on behalf of my party, as well as
for myself, I am glad of the opportunity to
pay this word of tribute. I hope that Mr.
King's nephews will ever remember his
splendid service to our country. He seemed
to have devoted his whole life to that service,
for apparently in his university days he was

training himself for public life. It would be
a wonderful thing for Canada if more of our
young people, especially our young men in
the universities, were to dedicate themselves
to public careers in this country.
Mr. King held the office of prime minister
longer than any other man in the British
Commonwealth. He was very highly regarded, and we here can all say that we have
had the privilege of knowing a truly great
Canadian.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, there are in this chamber former members of Mr. King's cabinet-some of them
much older than I-who should perhaps take
precedence over me in paying tribute to
his recent passing, and so I paused for a
moment to see if any others were about to
rise.
I knew the late Mr. King for many years.
I had the honour to be present as one of his
supporters at the great convention of 1919,
when he was elected leader of the Liberal
party. As early as 1912, I remember attending a convention called for the selection
of a leader of the party in. the province of
Ontario. I held up the -convention for a half
a day or more in a futile endeavour to
have an invitation sent to a young man who,
in 1908, had been elected to the House of
Commons as member for Waterloo.
Hon. Mr. Euler: North Waterloo.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, North Waterloo.
Looking back with the knowledge we have
today, one can see what a mistake it would
have been to have appointed Mr. King party
leader in Ontario at that time. Such a move
might have robbed Canada of the greatest
prime minister she has ever had.
Since his appointment as party leader, I
watched Mr. King's career with infinite satisfaction, and noted his success, his sterling
qualities and his truth. He was always on the
side of liberty and freedom. As the poet
Pope said, "the proper study of mankind is
man". Mr. Mackenzie King was an expert
in the knowledge of men and in choosing the
proper man for the right position. Furthermore, in his book he made the statement that
over all is humanity; and throughout his
entire life his policies followed the precept of
putting the rights, privileges, and welfare of
humanity above all other things.
Mr. King was a man of wide sympathies
and a kindly attitude; be was an enigma to
most people, be was so quiet and yet so
efficient. At one time I set down in writing
what I thought to be an analysis of William
Lyon Mackenzie King and his success. I
said at that time that there was nothing

AUGUST 30, 1950
miraculous about his marvellous success; it
was quite a natural result from the qualities
which he possessed.
I set down as my first point that Mr. King
was endowed by nature with a keen, sound
and unusually powerful intellect. Thus, he
had the capacity to reap the fruits of long
training and great experience. The combined
result of such ability and experience was
wisdom.
As. my second point I said that Mr. King
had an abiding faith in the efficiency of right,
together with a clear grasp of what is right
and a genuine desire to do what is good for
all mankind. From that it followed that his
impulses were sound. Men marvelled at the
soundness of Mr. King's advice and the way
in which his judgment was continually justified. Of course his judgment proved sound:
the reason was that right was his pole-star,
and when he laid a course through uncharted
seas he always arrived in port because he took
as his guiding star some high principle of
truth, right, justice and humanity.
The third point which I noted was that even
at the height of his fame the pomp of high
office never affected his personality; he was
always able to maintain a delightful humility
the humility of Uriah Heep, but a
-not
genuine humility that kept him on the same
level as those with whom he spoke. Power
never spoiled Mackenzie King, nor did flattery ever turn his head.
He was genuinely kind-hearted, as I know
from my own personal experience.
The leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke
of an occasion when, after opposing one of
Mr. King's policies, Mr. King approached
him in the same unruffled way as he would
have done under other circumstances I
could reminisce for a long time, but I will
only mention an instance which occurred
while I was a member of the House of
Commons and I had occasion to disagree
with a resolution moved by Mr. King. One
often hears about the "rule of the whip" and
the "discipline of the party". On the occasion
to which I refer, I, a back-bencher in the
hoise, presumed to move a resolution opposed
to that of my leader, who was also the government leader. My proposal was ruled out of
order. A short time later I met Mr. King in
the lobby, and we proceeded to discuss the
question. I said, "I am sorry to have moved
a resolution opposing yours, but I have to
live with myself in the future". He replied,
"But you were all wrong". We discussed the
matter further, and parted the same good
friends that we had been previously. Such
an experience explains why Mr. Mackenzie
King was able to gather around himself the
most powerful political party in the history

of Canada. It was not because he had a welldisciplined following, but rather because his
followers were loyal and capable, and could
walk with him as well as after him. The
faithfulness with which he worked, the industry which he devotedi to his task, and the
exclusiveness with which he gave himself to
that task explains the success of the great
leader whom we mourn today.
One of my main contacts with the late Mr.
King was in connection with labour. I
looked upon him then as the greatest Minister
of Labour that Canada ever had, and I still
hold that view, though there have of course
been other great ministers of labour. Perhaps
at this time I should mention the continuity
of policy carried on within that department.
Mr. King was made Minister of Labour
because of his experience in dealing with
humanity and because he had exposed certain
outrages to working girls, chiefly some
employed in the match trade. As a result of
his ability and understanding of humanity he
was chosen, first, by Sir William Mulock, to
be Deputy Minister of Labour, and then, by
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to be Minister of Labour.
Al through the years he carried on his policy
of careful, efficient and capable protection of
human rights, particularly the rights of those
least able to take care of themselves.
The labour portfolio has always been
regarded as a tough one to handle. The
Minister of Labour, ancient or modern, has
always been involved in some labour dispute;
and as it is his duty to be impartial, the
tendency of both parties engaged in the battle bas always been to think that the impartial
man is taking the opposite side. These disputes are so absorbing that one is inclined
to lose sight of the forest, so brilliantly lighted
are the trees.
Mr. King commenced a policy of impartiality that was splendidly followed by another
Minister of Labour, the late Honourable
Humphrey Mitchell. We are missing both
these men. The wisdom of Mackenzie King
and his strong hand would be very welcome
in Ottawa today, and the democracy, good
will and ability of Humphrey Mitchell would
be equally welcome. The late Humphrey
Mitchell played a great part in the development of Canada in recent years. We all
remember how during the war he kept our
working population engaged in their tasks.
It is true that war measures of an almost
repressive character-we would certainly call
them such in times of peace-were necessary
during the war years; but Mr. Mitchell, with
his genial character and common sense, and
through the patriotic efforts of the people of
Canada, was able to regiment the working
force of this country as it had never been

SENATE
regimented in the past. Under the leadership
of Mr. King and Humphrey Mitchell Canada's
war effort was the admiration of the world.
Both these men played their parts in the
development of our present social security,
in the raising of the standards of living as
we have seen them raised in our time, and
in helping to bring about a state of full
employment which is the envy of most countries. They were able to bring about a fair
measure of industrial peace, which made the
growth of Canada possible in these last few
years; but it was in labour law and its
administration that Mr. King and Mr. Mitchell
will longest be remembered in labour circles.
I suppose that everyone in this chamber is
familiar with what might be described as the
revolutionary advances in labour law. All of
us know that at one time it was a criminal
offence to belong to a labour union in England.
The Tolpuddle Martyrs and their story is
known to most Canadians as well as to
Englishmen. The Tolpuddle Martyrs were
poor farm labourers who, in view of their
already pitiable economic condition, organized
a society to resist a pending reduction in
wages. They were called before the magistrates and were deported to Van Diemen's
Land. I know something about that because
upon the shelves of my library there still
rests a pamphlet written by my great uncle,
who spoke in the British House of Commons
more than one hundred years ago in the
defence of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. The public
opinion raised by their heart-rending story
was so great that the fundamental law of
England was changed, and it was no longer
a criminal offence to belong to a labour
union. The legislative advances in criminal
law achieved at that time are to be found in
our own Criminal Code of today. That was
the first of the great revolutionary reforms
in labour law, and it is the foundation stone
and basis of our present labour movement.
The second great reform in labour law was
developed under the hand of Humphrey
Mitchell and under the guidance of Mr. King.
The British North America Act assigns the
control of wages, hours and conditions of
labour to the provinces, but there is an overriding provision which gives the dominion
sweeping powers in times of crisis. When the
recent Great War broke out the federal
government was thus in a position to assume
control of industrial matters throughout the
entire dominion, and this it did. The Labour
Code, drawn under the guidance of Mr.
King, and directly under the hand of
Humphrey Mitchell, is the basis of the present
labour law of Canada. It was enacted in the
first instance as an order in council, P.C. 1003,
under the War Measures Act, and bas been

adopted by practically every province of
Canada. You and I in this chamber joined in
making it an Act of Parliament applicable to
those portions of industry which are under
dominion control. It provided for collective
bargaining and for the appointment of representatives of the unions. It gave to labour
unions the civil right of the individual to
belong to the union of his choice. It provided
machinery for the appointment of representatives, and it also provided that any collective
agreement reached between the majority of
the employers and the employees in any
industry should be binding upon the entire
industry.
Finally, in collective bargaining it ruled
out the representatives of company-dominated
unions. That, honourable senators, is the
second great revolutionary advance in labour
law in the last one hundred years or more,
and these two men were chiefly responsible
for bringing it about.
I suppose I have spoken rather too long,
but one could, I think, dwell for many hours
on the achievements of my old friends Mackenzie King and the late Minister of Labour.
I join with the leader of the government
and the leader of the opposition in paying
respects to Mr. King, and I am glad to have
had this opportunity of paying my respects
also to Mr. Humphrey Mitchell.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
for the settlement of labour disputes the
great statesman to whom we are now paying
a final tribute, Mr. King, bas left us this
message:
The existing attitude of capital and labour toward
each other is too largely one of mistrust . . . this
attitude must be changed to one of trust inspired
by faith.

These words are taken from the beginning
of the introduction to Industry and Humanity,
which in my opinion is the most important
book written by Mr. King. In fact, I would
without hesitation call it his masterpiece. In
1919, immediately after this work was first
published, I had the privilege of reviewing
it in La Revue Trimestrielle Canadienne. I
speak with some emotion, because thus began
my association with my late friend and leader.
I must add in all sincerity that I always
considered myself as not only his modest
though faithful follower, but also as his
pupil, even his disciple, in industrial matters.
Today I will try to sum up the fundamental
principles of the doctrine which Mr. King
embodied in the volume to which I have
referred and also in what was probably his
main contribution to our social laws, the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act. This
statute drafted by Mr. King more than forty
years ago, when he was Deputy Minister of
Labour, has been copied by legislative bodies

AUGUST 30, 1950
in a number of countries, and has won for its
author praise from many quarter. For instance, Dr. Charles W. Eliot, President of
Harvard University, said:
One sees clearly that the Canadian action on the
labour problem has been and still is the most intelligent and successful in the world.

From such an authority as Dr. Eliot, this
was high praise indeed.
In his outstanding constributions to the
solution of social problems Mr. King was
always guided by the same thought. I
quote again from the introduction to his
work that I cited a few moments ago:
. An industrial system characterized by antagonism, coercion and resistance must yield to a new
order based upon mutual confidence, real justice
The change will
and constructive good will.
involve patience, but nothing short of it will solve
the problems to which industry gives rise.

Mr. King told me, as he told many others,
that in his search for a procedure to obtain
industrial peace he received his most direct
incentive from a statement of the great
French scientist

and

humanitarian, Louis

Pasteur. This statement, which was quoted
to him by his own brother, the late Dr. King,
was as follows:
Two contrary laws seem to be wrestling with
each other nowadays: the one, a law of blood and
of death, ever imagining new means of destruction,
and forcing nations to be constantly ready for the
battlefield-the other, a law of peace, work and
health, ever evolving new means of delivering man
from the scourges which beset him.

Will industry continue the struggle and
antagonism dividing its essential partners, or
will it seek to establish between them the
co-operation which is indispensible to their
common welfare? This question, which still
confronts us, can be answered most favourably by following the doctrine of co-operation
which Mr. King advocated and practised
throughout his life. That doctrine was based
upon the deeply Christian faith of the great
statesman, who always firmly believed in the
brotherhood of all men and in the divine
fatherhood of God.
Honourable senators, those of us who were
present at Mr. King's funeral service in St.
Andrew's Church will always remember with
deep emotion the singing of his favourite
hymn, whose concluding words expressed the
theme underlying all his social policies,
namely, that we are all brothers and all
children of the same Father. This is a very
simple but immortal thought.
Industry and Humanity is more than a
book, it is a living message which Mr. King
delivered to us in his lifetime, and which he
has left with us as his last will. We shall
continue to hear his words beyond the grave.
They will ring forever in our hearts. May all

Canadians understand and listen to the earnest call of Mr. King for co-operation without
distinction of faith, race or class.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I feel that the voice of a French
Canadian should join those already heard, in
a last tribute to a great prime minister who
has passed away.
If Canada has been fortunate in having
such a prime minister, French Canadians had
no small part in this good fortune.
When I first entered this Chamber, I met
Mr. Mackenzie King and mentioned how hard
a task it must have been for him to administer
such a large country where conditions vary
from East to West. He answered: "That is
true, but a vast country like Canada can be
administered by compromise, as there is such
a wide difference between the needs of the
various provinces along the Atlantic, in Quebec and Ontario, as well as in the West and
British Columbia". He also added, and this
will serve as a personal guidance for the rest
of my life: "You know, when you have a
problem never forget that it has several
angles, just as a medal has two sides. Those
who only consider one side are unable to
judge impartially. Always look at both sides.
As no problem is ever all black or all white,
try and find the answer which will serve
the greatest number of people in our nation".
Some have claimed that Mr. King was a
man of compromise. It may be so. But if his
compromises were mide to benefit the greatest
number of people in our country, we can
congratulate ourselves and praise their author.
The late ackenzie King happened to be
prime minister during peculiar and sometimes dificult times. Therefore, he had to
resort to certain manoeuvres. That is where
a navigator shows his ability, and we can say
that our former leader navigated well indeed.
If Canada has emerged from the last war with
more greatness than ever, it is due to the fact
that our country was headed by a man whose
very name of King was a majestic symbol.
(Text):
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
regret that I have not the ability to properly
express my feelings with regard to the departure of a great Canadian, Mr. Mackenzie
King.
It was my privilege to serve as a minister
under Mr. King for a period of years, and I
have intimate knowledge of his ability as a
leader and of his capacity to face problems
close to the people. I realize that as time
goes on his proper place in the history of

SENATE

Canada will become more evident, and that
when that history is written the Canadian
people will better understand and appreciate
the part he played in the development of
Canada during the momentous years of the
twentieth century.
I associate myself with the carefully prepared remarks of the honourable leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and also
with the sentiments expressed by my good
friend the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). I
do indeed feel keenly the loss of Mr. King, a
close friend and a great Canadian.

MAINTENANCE OF RAILWAY
OPERATION BILL

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have no way of knowing how long it will
take the other house to deal with the special
railway legislation now before it, but as
honourable members are aware, that house
is proceeding industriously and with great
expedition: it sat during the lunch hour,
and I understand that it will sit during the
dinner hour. I am sure it is the desire of this
house, in order to avoid any delay, to hold
itself in readiness to consider this important
legislation at the first possible opportunity.
Under the circumstances, therefore, I would
move that we adjourn during pleasure, to
re-assemble at the call of the bell at 5:30

AUGUST 30, 1950
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: With leave of
the Senate, I move that the bill be read the
second time now.
Honourable senators, I am sure that the
interest that has been displayed and the mass
of information which has ibeen available from
one source and another removes the necessity
and indeed makes it highly undesirable for
me to delay the house unduly in presenting the
reasons which led up to this bill being
presented for our consideration. The purpose
of the bill, as honourable senators well know,
is to deal with what amounts in effect to a
national emergency that has arisen in this
country as a result of the -circumstances surrounding the present railway strike. That is
the chief reason for the assembling of parliament at a period somewhat earlier than
originally had been intended. Even in normal
times a prolonged interruption of rail service
in Canada would cause very vital disruptions
in our economic life. I am sure all will agree
that especially in times such as these the
deterioration of the vital interests of all the
Canadian people 'caused by the strike cannot
continue, and that immediate resumption of
railway services is highly desirable.
On the other hand, how to accomplish this
has been a very difficult problem to solve. The
right of labour to organize, negotiate, and,
if necessary, to strike, is a primary concept
and principle in our idea of democracy. In
the present case all parties have exercised
what all of us realize are their legal rights.
However, the exercise of those rights has
caused a situation whereby a great many
Canadians may be materially harmed and the
public interest may suffer. To allow this to
continue would create, I submit, a situation
that this house would wish to avoid if at all
possible.
The present demands by the unions began
on June 16, 1949. Negotiations between them
and the railways continued until September
1949, at which time conciliation officers were
appointed by the Department of Labour. As
a result of their report a conciliation board
was appointed, under the Industrial Disputes
Investigation Act. This board made its report
in April of the present year. The recommendations contained in the report were not acceptable to the unions, who indicated that it was
still their intention to strike. Since that time
the representatives of the unions and the railways have met at various times without success. When it became apparent that no
settlement could be reached before the strike
deadline, the government appointed a mediator, with the consent of all parties. His

attempts to bring about a settlement of the
issues involved were also not successful. The
Prime Minister then requested that the strike
be postponed for thirty days, to allow further
negotiations between the unions and the railways. This offer was not accepted, and the
strike occurred.
After the strike began the Prime Minister
met with leaders both of the unions and the
railways. He did not suggest any terms of
settlement, but pointed out the severe emergency that the strike was creating. He said
he knew the strike was not intended to injure
the economy of the country, but that in fact
its continuance might cause a serious disaster.
The unions and railways extended him every
courtesy and consideration, but still found it
impossible to come to terms.
The government then drafted the bill which
in the main is the one before us. It is intended
to deal with only the present special situation. I should like to emphasize that the
legislation is not designed or intended to
establish a precedent for the future but
deals with this emergency and nothing more.
The measure is a regrettable necessity, which
I sincerely hope will cause no malice or misunderstanding among Canadians. Let us
hope that it is received in the same spirit
in which it was conceived.
The bill provides, honourable senators, that
the railway operations must be resumed
within 48 hours of its becoming law, and that
every employee who is on strike will return
to his duties with the railway company by
which he is employed. The 48 hours will
start to run from the beginning of the day on
which the measure becomes law.
During the negotiations it appeared at all
times that the railway companies were prepared to off er a wage increase of at least four
cents per hour to most of the employees concerned. The government at first thought that
it would- not order the hotel workers back to
work, as there seemed to be some doubt as to
whether such drastic action was necessary in
the national interest. However, it was pointed
out that all the unions concerned had banded
themselves together and pledged their support to one another, and that action which
might seem to distinguish among them would
create a difficult situation. Therefore, it was
decided to order all the strikers back to work,
and to increase all their rates of pay by four
cents per hour, rather than make any distinction. For this purpose the bill provides
that the collective agreements that were
under negotiation when the strike took place
-these are listed in Schedule B to the billare amended by increasing all rates of pay
contained therein by four cents per hour.
With this one exception the agreements under

SENATE
which the members of the unions are to
return to work are the same agreements that
were in force when they went on strike, and
these agreements are to continue in force
until new ones are executed between the
unions and railways.
Provision is made for terminating such
agreements. If within thirty days-the bill
originally provided fifteen days-of the coming into force of the Act no new agreements
have been made or no arbitrator has been
agreed upon for such purposes, the government will appoint an arbitrator who shall
decide all matters not then agreed upon, and
his decision shall be final. The powers of
such arbitrator are listed in section 5 of the
bill. I should mention that the thirty-day
period may be extended upon the joint
request of the unions and railways concerned.
May I further point out that section 5 has
been amended.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Have those amendments
been printed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: They have been
printed, and I think some copies are available
for. general distribution.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should like to have a
copy.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Perhaps the honourable deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will
hand you his copy, while I read the amendment to the house. It has to do with the
limits within which the arbitrator may negotiate. I shall read the amendment, and make
such further explanation as I can.
Subsection 3 of section 5 now reads:
(3) In deciding any matter under this section,
the arbitrator shall decide the matter within the
limits of the proposals that he determines were
made by the railway companies and the unions in
respect of that matter at the time negotiations were
terminated between them on the twenty-sixth day
of August, nineteen hundred and fifty, or were
made by either of them after the commencement
of this Act at any time before the matter came
before him and which narrow these limits, but
the arbitrator by his decision shall not provide for
a reduction in a rate of wages established pursuant
to section 3.

That has to do with the four cents an
hour.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Is that a new subsection?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is a new subsection
3, and the present subsection 3 will become
subsection 4.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Read it again.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It reads as follows:
In deciding any matter under this section, the
arbitrator shall decide the matter within the limits
of the proposals that he determines were made by
the railway companies and the unions in respect
of that matter at the time negotiations were
terminated between them on the twenty-sixth day

of August, nineteen hundred and fifty, or were made
by either of them after the commencement of this
act at any time before the matter came before him
and which narrow these limits, but the arbitrator
by his decision shall not provide for a reduction in
a rate of wages established pursuant to section 3.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Tell us what that means.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I should like to ask the
honourable leader how long we must wait
before we are given the amended bill? I
understand that the bill now in our possession has been amended in several places. I
would much prefer to have the amended bill
before me.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am in the hands
of the house. I must. confess that the other
place moved with such alacrity that it caught
me almost unprepared to give an explanation, but I realized that it would be in the
interest of the Senate to have the matter
brought before it as early as possible. How
long honourable senators wish to consider
this matter is for them to decide.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
leader whether the clause which he has just
read refers to the increase to be asked by
the workers, or to the pay which was in
effect before this request was made?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I must confess I am
not an authority in these matters. Perhaps
those who heard the discussion in the other
place could inform the house better than I,
but my understanding is that the arbitrator
is to arbitrate as between the proposals of
the railway companies on the one hand and
the unions on the other. The question will
then be narrowed down to the best proposals.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: It applies to the present
case only?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Oh, yes. It all applies
to the present case only. It says:
In deciding any matter under this section, the
arbitrator shall decide the matter within the limits
of the proposals that he determines were made by
the railway companies and the unions in respect
of that matter at the time negotiations were
terminated between them on the twenty-sixth day
of August, nineteen hundred and fifty, or were made
by either of them after the commencement of this
Act at any time before the matter came before him
and which narrow these limits . . .

Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable
leader a question on that point? It is my
understanding that the unions made what
they called certain concessions. I am not
going to say what they were. Then, after
the strike commenced, they withdrew the
concessions they had made and said in effect
"Now that we are striking we are not going
to make the same offer as we made before".
Which of those two is going to be taken into
consideration?

AUGUST 30, 1950
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, which?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am bound to be
guided by this phraseology. It states:
-the arbitrator shall decide the matter within the

limits of the proposais that he determines were
made by the railway companies and the unions in
respect of that matter at the time negotiations were
terminated between them on the twenty-sixth day
of August, 1950Hon. Mr. Baird: That was the old rate?
Sorne Hon. Senators: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. David: Al that was accepted at
that time would remain, and the amount of
4 cents an hour would not be reduced. That
is the point.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: It continues:
-or were made by either of them after the commencement of this Act at any time before the
matter came before him and which narrow these
limits, but the arbitrator by his decision shall not
provide for a reduction in a rate of wages estab-

lished pursuant to section 3.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would that not set the
arbitrator in right where the negotiations
broke off? Would that not make it clearer?
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Not necessarily, because
it says "or were made by either of them after
the commencement of this Act".
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As I understand it, the
parties are required to negotiate, and the
arbitrator will arbitrate between the narrowest limits, whatever they may be, but he will
not be able to reduce the increase of 'four
cents provided for by section 3 of this bil.
He may, of course, make that increase larger.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the leader another
question? Last night I listened to the final
report made by the Minister of Labour, which
set out the final offer by labour and the final
offer by the companies. Is this arbitration
to be as between those two offers? Like the
honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), I think the unions said they withdrew all their offers and would stand on their
original demands.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is right. Which is
going to be considered?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I should like
to know.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: They could make a new
offer.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will read the amendment again, very carefully, and ask honourable members of the legal fraternity to
interpret it. They are much more familiar
with the meaning of legal phrases than I am.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before the leader proceeds, may I ask if we cannot at least have
typewritten copies of the text of the amendment?

Hon. Mr. Haig: I have another suggestion
to make. Although I objected strenuously
when the rules of this house were amended
to permit a minister, holding a seat in the
other house, to come here and explain his
legislation, I think that in this instance we
should ask the Minister of Labour or the
Minister of Transport to come over and tell
us what their departments understand this to
mean. It is those departments who will have
to see that the law is carried out.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Surely we are more intelligent than they are!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I read the wording two or
three times and I could not see through it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will read it again,
as clearly as I can, and then invoke the good
services of legal members of the house to
interpret it. We have a number of distinguished
members of the legal profession here this
evening, the honourable leader of the opposition being one of them. The amendment
reads:
In deciding any matter under this section, the
arbitrator shall decide the matter within the limits
of the proposais that he determines were made by
the railway companies and the unions in respect
of that matter at the time negotiations were terminated between them on the 26th day of August, 1950,
or were made by either of them after the commencement of this Act ...
Hon. Mr. Davies: That is, after the Act is
passed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, after this Act is
passed they will negotiate, and I take it that
if the limits are narrowed by negotiation it
will then be for the arbitrator to arbitrate
within them.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The limits cannot be
enlarged, but they may be narrowed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will start again to
read the amendment:
In deciding any matter under this section, the
arbitrator shal decide the matter within the limite
of the proposais that he determines were made by
the railway companies and the unions in respect of
that matter at the time negotiations were terminated
between them on the 26th day of August, 1950, or
were made by either of them after the commencement of this Act at any time before the matter came
before him and which narrow these limits, but the
arbitrator by his decision shall not provide for a
reduction in a rate of wages established pursuant
to section 3.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is four cents?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is four cents, as
provided in section 3.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I understand that the
period for the reaching of an agreement,
under section 5, has been extended from fifteen to thirty days.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. That amendment
and the one I have just read are the only
two changes from the original bill.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I do not know that
I can say much more as to the details of the
bill. Perhaps some of my colleagues who
listened carefully to the debate in the other
house might be willing to give a fuller
explanation.
Hon. Mr Roebuck: May I ask what is
meant by the words "narrow these limits"?
If the men said they would take three cents
instead of four cents, would that narrow the
limits?
Hon Mr. Hayden:
No; the four cents
increase is basic.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the men say they
want five cents instead of four cents, will
that narrow the limits?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No; that would widen
them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But if they said they
would take three centsHon. Mr. Hayden: They cannot say that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, what is meant
by narrowing the limits? If the men said
they would work forty-two hours, would that
be considered as narrowing the limits or
widening them?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That would widen them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How am I to know that
it would narrow or widen them?
Hon. Mr. Horner: You know everything.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unlike the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), I do not know everything.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I add just a
word? The impression I have is that the
present situation is of grave importance to
the country as a whole, and I think it is
desirable that in our consideration of it some
thought and appreciation should be given to
what I believe were the very serious difficulties confronting the negotiators on both
sides. It is very easy for the proponents of
one side or another to say that the representatives of the railway companies or those
of the unions were too rigid and unyielding,
but I suggest to honourable senators that in
these trying times the negotiators were faced
with unusually difficult problems. On the
one hand there were the negotiators for
the railways. I am not qualified to give an
authoritative statement as to the financial
consequences of the best offer that they made,
but these would represent a very substantial
figure.
The railway representatives are
charged with the responsibility of appreciating that money does not grow on trees, and
that sooner or later any increased costs
must come from the treasury or from freight

rates. They would realize that in serious
times like these that might not only have a
very serious effect on the general economy
of the country, but if freight rates were
increased to such a point as to bring about
a serious loss of traffic to the railways the
whole problem might be further complicated.
And indeed that last mentioned possibility
might well be one of the inevitable consequences of this short strike.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It will be.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Undoubtedly there
is the possibility that some business people
may conclude that they do not need to use
railway services in future so much as they
did in the past. As I say, the railway operators were charged with great responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Tell us something about
the government's responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Well, this is a free
country. The government had taken the
view that the representatives of the railways
and of the unions are responsible men who
would realize that the collective bargaining
system, which possesses great benefits and
advantages, also makes necessary the assumption of heavy responsibilities. My honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) would be one of the first to deplore
and oppose government intervention and
interference with business. More than once
he has made the rafters ring by his attacks
upon the government.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Just a minute!
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The representatives of
the trade unions also were charged with very
grave responsibilities. I wish to remind the
house that the existing agreement was negotiated in 1948, and that the circumstances
surrounding the recent negotiations between
railways and employees, both in Canada and
the United States, have changed considerably.
There has been a continual rise in prices.
Almost every index published shows an
upward trend. This problem, as I say, does
not apply only to Canada but also to the
United States. In a recent copy of the
New York Times it was reported that the
Chrysler Corporation had voluntarily offered
to its employees a pay increase of, I think,
ten cents an hour. That indicates that the
company recognizes the seriousness of the
problem. The men representing the unions
have been faced with a tremendous responsibility, and sooner or later a solution must be
found for the problem of adequate pay.
Honourable senators will appreciate the difficulties faced by the negotiators on both sides.
The government used every means in its
power to settle the wage question before a

AUGUST 30, 1950
strike occurred. Indeed, this bill asks that
negotiations be continued for a further thirty
days, and if at that tirne an arbitrator has
not been agreed upon the goverrnment may, at
the request of the parties, extend the period.
In the final analysis the government asks the
railways to resurne operations and the men
to return to work. I am hopeful, honourable
senators, that this request will be met.
Some· Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I hope that I will not say anything that will
arouse an acrimonious debate in this house,
but the fact is that the railways are the
Confederation would
life-line of Canada.
never have been but for the bands of steel
which cross this country. The Maritime
Provinces entered confederation on condition
that a railway be built from that area to the
central provinces. British Columbia made a
similar demand before coming into confederation. The Prairie Provinces were not settled
to any extent at that time, but that area
could easily have been serviced by an
American railway line. The distance from
where I live to the nearest American railway
is only about 65 miles. My honourable friend
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) is,
I think, about 25 miles from an American
railway.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I am about 55 or 60
miles away.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In any event, the present
Prairie Provinces were then territories and
did not bother with terms.
We start out with the railway system as
the life-line of our country. In the course of
our development two provinces have never
felt the impact of the freight rate structure on
their products. I refer to Ontario and Quebec,
which because of their proximity to the Great
Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, have never
suffered from transportation problems in the
same way as have the outlying parts of
Canada. British Columbia, for instance, has
been relieved to some extent by reason of ber
ability to ship via the Panama Canal route,
but the people of Western Canada and of the
Maritime Provinces are very seriously affected
by the operation of the railway systems, and
particularly by the cost of shipping freight.
I would point out to honourable senators
that if it were not for the Crowsnest Pass
agreement, which is now in statutory form,
the farmers of the three Prairie Provinces
would not be able to continue their grain
operations. The rates under this agreement
concern only the shipment of grain east and
west.
Hon. Mr. Aselline:.Export.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Export grain, shipped east
or west. Because of the Crow's Nest Pass
agreement the whole impact of the freight
rate structure does not fall as heavily as
it otherwise would on the three Prairie
Provinces.
I would say, honourable senators, that
ninety-nine per cent of the people of Canada
will hail with delight the passage of this bill
tonight.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The only question that comes
to my mind is whether the provisions of the
bill are fair to all parties concerned. During
the past fifty years, as was pointed out by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) this afternoon, there has
been great development in labour relations.
We must face the fact that labour has a
tremendous backing. We sincerely feel that
the men and women who labour are entitled
to a fair day's pay in return for a fair day's
work. That is fundamental. Provided a man
does his job well, there should be no discrimination against him just because the boss
does not like him. I need scarcely remind
honourable members that the children of a
labourer father who comes home at five or
six o'clock in the evening, have just as much
regard and esteem for their father as have
the children of the father who comes home in
a limousine. Furthermore, the children of
the labourer have the same rights in this
country as the children of the father who
rides in a limousine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Of course. That is fundamental.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not want to cast a
vote in this house, or elsewhere, which would
in any way destroy the fundamental rights
that labour has acquired in its dealing with
organizations which employ it, except in circumstances where the union has usurped the
right of parliament to deal with matters
affecting all the people.
I have no objection to clause 2 of the
bill, which provides that the railways must
resume operations and that the men must go
back to work. As to the increase of four cents
per hour, as provided by section 3, I am not
very much concerned. What I am concerned
about is the fact that we are approaching
a new development in labour-management
relations.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Han. Mr. Roebuck), I think referred
this afternoon to what is known as the
Lemieux Act. I believe that Act went further
in protecting the rights of labour than any
other piece of legislation. The measure before us meets that Act head on. The honourable leader of the government has said that

SENATE
the measure deals only with the present issue.
I would remind him that one may regard
a lawsuit in the courts as only one case, but
it may be cited frequently as a precedent in
future cases. It may well be that parliament
will on a future occasion face a problem
similar to that now before us, and what it
will do at that time one cannot predict.
I have been hopeful that the government
would see fit to adopt such a policy as that
in force in the United States, where the
President has power to seize the railways
and appoint an administrator. The government here could do the same thing, and the
railways would continue to operate. However,
the government has not seen fit to adopt
that method, and I do not propose to move
an amendment at this time.
The current trouble started in about June,
1949. In the fall of that year the government appointed conciliation officers to study
the matter, and later a conciliation board was
set up to deal with it. The companies accepted
the board's findings, but the men refused. It
should have been clear to the people of Canada then that we were heading for troubled
waters, and the government ought to have
known better than the rest of us what was
going to happen, because they had their
investigators and negotiators at work. Only a
week before the strike was declared, I believe,
the Deputy Minister of Labour said there
would be no strike, that an agreement would
be reached. An agreement had always been
reached in the past, but I think another factor
entered into this dispute. The world is now
facing a crisis-I am not referring to Koreaand a person would have to be deaf, dumb
and blind to not know that Russia is getting
ready for war. While we hope that it will
not happen, each of us in our heart really
feels that it may. That is the situation which
is agitating our men and women. They are
uneasy.
Our labour unions believe that if war
comes, labour prices will be fixed and workmen will be unable to get any increases. They
are jumping now for all they are worth so
as to get their increases before the clamp
goes on. If I were a labourer and thought as
I now do, I too would be getting ready for a
war. Why were we called together this session? It was to deal with this bill; but in two
or three weeks we were going to be called
anyway to deal with another matter.
I should have liked to see clause 5 make
provision for the procedure they have in the
United States. There the President takes over
the control of the railroads and they continue to operate. Then a solution is worked
out. In these nine days of standstill our
railroads have lost a tremendous amount of

money 'and business that they will never
recover. Canadian businessmen have found
that trucking is a good substitute for certain
kinds of railroad transportation, and to that
extent the railroads will lose business. That
is my opinion and I think it is shared by some
wholesalers and other people in the country.
The fish producing industry of northern Manitoba has already suggested that instead of
waiting for trains to take out their products
they should have trucks to carry it to points
of embarkation. I think that to a degree this
sort of thing will happen all over Canada
especially in Ontario and Quebec. If I were a
labouring man or a representative of labour
I would be bitterly opposed to clause 5. I
would say, "Don't you tell me that this is only
going to be used in this one case. Perhaps that
is true, but it will be used as a pattern in
other cases that come up".
Hon. Mr. Hardy: And quite right too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, that is your opinion,
not mine. I still firmly believe that more
can be accomplished by negotiation than by
dictation. If anybody has had anything to
do with bringing up a family he knows what
I mean. Here we are saying to the labour
unions, "If you people cannot agree about
something, and we declare it to be a matter
affecting the interests of the whole of Canada,
then we can put in an arbitrator, and he
will settle it".
Subsection 3 is not quite what I thought it
was. After reading it carefully I noticed a
clause which helps me to understand it.
In deciding any matter under this section, the
arbitrator--

And these are the words that change the
whole meaning.
-shall decide the matter within the limits of
proposais that he determines were made by the
the
railway companes and the unions . . .

In other words, no matter what the unions or
railways may say their proposals were, the
arbitrator could say "No, that was not the
proposal; here is the proposal", and then
determine accordingly. Therefore the clause
does not mean anything.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is that not how a judge
in a court decides a case? He hears both
parties and decides the case on the facts.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but this does more than
that. It provides that he can determine what
the facts are.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, it does not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it does. He can
say what the limits were. It says, "based on
the facts before him".
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It is his understanding of the offer.

AUGUST 30, 1950
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, that is not what it says.
It says:
-the arbitrator shall decide the matter within the
limits of the proposals that he determines were
made . . .
No matter what the parties may say the proposals were, the arbitrator will determine
what they were. He is the man who will do
that.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: How would the arbitrator reach his decision?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know. If the unions
came forward and said, "What we proposed
was this", and the railways came forward
and said, "No, what you proposed was that",
the arbitrator could say which he thought
was right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: He can hear witnesses
and investigate in any way he wants to.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Somebody will have to
determine, will he not, what the proposals
were? If the arbitrator does not determine
it, who would the honourable leader opposite
suggest should do so?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, those words should
not be here at all. They were not in the
original bill proposed by the government, and
it was only after criticism that this proposal
was inserted. The original bill did not contain this proposal at all.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: May I ask the honourable
leader opposite what would happen if that
amendment were not there? Would it not
then be open for the arbitrator to decide that
the men should receive something less than
the railways offered on Saturday last. Is
that not the reason why the amendment was
inserted? Was it not to ensure that the arbitrator should not in any event grant less than
the railroads had offered in their best offer?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The same applies to the
men.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Is it not insurance?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is not what the Act
originally intended to do.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: What does that matter?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It makes quite a bit of
difference.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: No, it does not. Let us
get on with the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It makes quite a bit of
difference, and as for getting on with the bill,
I will just take my own sweet time. I am
a good timekeeper. I can stand all the
needling my honourable friend wishes to give
me. I will just stand up here.
69266-3

Hon. Mr. Horner: You will be all right as
long as that fellow from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) doesn't get after you.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) says
something when he says that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I will spar with him any
time he likes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: With whom, the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, boy, you have nerve.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As I have said before, this
marks the first time in the htstory of the
Parliament of Canada that compulsory arbitration between employer and employee has
been introduced into the legislation of this
country.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Was it ever needed before?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know. We shall
come to that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the alternative?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know. We shall
come to that too in just a minute. If the
United States saw fit to have legislation
authorizing the President to seize the railroads, why cannot we try that system?
Apparently it works in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Is not that compulsory?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is compulsory to seize
the railroads, but it does not say what the
hours or wages will be.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They have to work that
out.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and the President
appoints a fact-finding committee which
reports to him. The unions in the United
States have always been in favour of that
system. In fact, when the present railway
dispute broke out in the United States the
unions there requested the President to seize
the railroads.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Labour requested it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, labour requested it.
There- are seventeen international unions
affected by the strike in Canada, and the
same unions function in the United States.
I want to state that as emphatically as I can,
and I wish it to be recorded that I for one,
am not at present in favour of compulsory
arbitration.
It does not matter how much the leader of
the government may attempt to soften down

SENATE
the bill by saying that it applies only in
the present case; I think it creates a bad
precedent. In my opinion the situation
could have been saved through the appointment by the government of an administrator
to keep the railways in operation, so as to
give labour and management a further chance
to try to come to an agreement. The conditions under which they were negotiating
made it difficult to reach any conclusion.
The conciliation board's recommendations
were not acceptable to the union.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? What power has the President of the United States to ensure that the
railway men will continue working even
though they may not agree with the report
of a committee?
Hon. Mr. }fayden: None.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But they are under the
control of the army.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That control is a great
deal more potent than anything provided for
in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be, but the
unions over there have asked for it.
Hon. Mr. Farris, Why?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) will
bear me out in that statement. And if they
are not afraid of it, I do not think I should
be afraid of it for them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But the unions over
here have not asked for that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I pass on to another
point. As soon as increased rates are
approved by the arbitrator, if he does that,
there will be an application by the railways
for more money. Now, who is going to pay
the increased freight charges to provide that
money?
Hon. Mr. Hardy: The people will pay.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The people of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and the other western provinces and of the Maritime Provinces will
pay most, and my honourable friend's province will pay the least of all.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: It will pay more than
any of the others.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, sir.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: In our province we have
more than four million people, in yours
there are about half a million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Ontario sells goods to us,
and if it did not do so it would not have four
million people. Unless the railway services

are cut down and men thrown out of employment, the additional money will have to be
got somewhere, and it can only come from
increased rates.
Hon. Mr. Hardy:
Ontario and Quebec.

It

will come

from

Hon. Mr. Haig: That is where I suggest
it should come from. Those provinces have
most of the money in Canada, so why should
they not take care of these extra charges?
My honourable friend will have to pay more
income tax.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: He cannot pay any more.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, he can. We can
take his shirt off his back.
I want to say that the shippers in seven
of the provinces cannot pay any higher
freight rates than they are now paying, and
the only way in which additional money can
be raised for the railways is through general
taxation on all the people. We are paying
a tremendous sum now for one of the railways, and that sum will be increased.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Does my honourable
friend suggest that if an administrator were
appointed there would be no application for
increased freight rates?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Then, if we still
would be subject to demands for higher
freight rates, what would be the advantage
in appointing an administrator?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point is that I do not
believe an arbitrator should be empowered
to decide upon the rates of pay for the
employees. That should be a matter of negotiation between the unions and the companies.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan:
That is a fine
system so long as it will work, but in this
case it did not work.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know whether it
had a chance to work or not. This application by seventeen unions has the backing of
all the unions in the country, and they say
they do not believe in compulsory arbitration.
If an administrator were appointed, and after
a reasonable period of negotiation under collective bargaining it was found impossible to
reach an agreement, it might then be necessary to take further action; but at this stage
the men and the companies should have a
further chance to negotiate.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: They have had a
chance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: About two years ago I heard
the Minister of Finance say that he believed

AUGUST 30, 1950
the cost of living index would not go higher
than about 145. I believe he meant that, yet
today we know that the index is 167. I presume it will go still higher, and if it does we
are bound to have requests from people on
fixed salaries, such as railway employees, for
increased pay.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Just like the senators.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did they get an increase in
pay?
Hon. Mr. Euler: When the arbitrator is
considering the whole case, will he not deal
with that situation on its merits?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The point I am trying to
make is that I do not think the parties have
been given a fair chance to reach an
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They have been trying for
more than a year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But they have been negotiating during all that time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And they failed to reach
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They came pretty close
together.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Not close enough, though.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe not, but they were
pretty close. I may be wrong, but I think
that if they had been urged a little more they
could have been brought to an agreement.
Before I became a senator I sat on a number
of arbitration boards, and my experience was
that differences could generally be argued
until an agreement between the parties was
reached.
I have spoken longer than I intended, but
there is one more word that I wish to say.
Candidly, I feel that the government has to
take a lot of responsibility in this situation.
I place the responsibility on the government,
and the record will show in the future that
this was the first government in Canada to
introduce legislation making an agreement
between capital and labour a matter of compulsory arbitration. At present I am not in
favour of it. It may be that in years to come
I shall see more necessity for it, but I repeat
that at the present I do not like it.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to prolong the debate or delay
for long the passage of this bill. But I wish
to say a few words about it. Coming as I do
from Saskatchewan, I have always claimed
that that province has a greater need than
any other for good railway service, because
out there we have not the benefit of competi69266-3*

tion from water transportation which other
provinces enjoy. And as I have said on other
occasions in this chamber, our province
creates more new wealth than any other does
from the soil-and it does that without robbing anybody. With an area of seeded graxi
almost equal to that of all the other nine
provinces together, we had a prospect of producing $400 millions from the soil; but unfortunately a frost occurred in several parts of
the province. With all my forty years' experience I am not in a position to assess what
the frost damage will be. Frost comes in
waves, and while some areas may escape
damage, others do not.
The province of Saskatchewan has always
faced a serious problem.in the transportation
of its produce. For instance, we can raise
horses. You good people who have been
attending the Ottawa Fair and eating tasty
hamburgers made out of horse meat did not
suffer any harm. If it were not for the high
freight rates from the West we in Saskatchewan could raise horses for that purpose.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Grant: You also have a good
government in that province.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Since you raise the question, I will answer you. The government of
Saskatchewan is just as good as any Liberal
government I have ever seen.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: My main purpose in rising
to speak tonight was to emphasize a point
which I thought my leader did not emphasize.
What concerns the people on the streets of
Blaine Lake and the surrounding country,
which I represent, is who had the responsibility of avoiding this railway tie-up. Was it the
president of the Liberal association? Was it
the government? There are always lots of
people who want to push to the front, and
who wish to be chairman of this or that
committee when there is no danger or serious
trouble threatening. The same is true of the
government; it wants power.
The opposition in this house is a meagre
group, but surely the public will not condemn
us for lack of action. Surely the whole burden
of responsibility for failure to halt the strike
is upon the government. Who else can be
blamed for this stagnation in transportation
throughout Canada, which has lasted a week
or ten days, and which is forcing the poor
farmers to pay an extra $4 a barrel for
gasoline.
The boys from my part of the country
who work as section-hands on the railway
tell me that with their ballots they received
instructions to vote to strike; but that there

SENATE
would be no strike. Some of the strikers
who helped me thresh some rye said that they
never expected or wanted a strike; their
salaries were sufficient for their needs.
Your Honour has always been very kind to
me, and I propose to ask that a rule be
enforced in this house during this and future
sessions. The rule I have in mind is perhaps
more important than any other in the book.
I refer to the reading of speeches.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I may make many mistakes, and I am sorry that it is often quite
difficult for the reporters to take down what
I say. I got into difficulty with the Grain
Exchange in Winnipeg because the reporter
misunderstood me, ' and made me use
the word "board" when it should have
The reporters have my
been "pool".
sympathy, because I know I sometimes
speak very rapidly, but at least, I do not
read my speeches. I may commit other crimes,
but that is not one of them. I am sure there
is not a man in this chamber who could not
make a better speech than I can, but many of
them read what they have to say. If Your
Honour would enforce the rule in this respect
there would be greater public interest in what
is said here.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: And there would be better
speeches.
Hon. Mr. Horner: A former Speaker ruled
against the reading of speeches, and I was
delighted to hear him say that we were
appointed to this chamber because we were
supposed to have some ideas of our own.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Honourable senators, on
a point of order, I think the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake bas run off the
rails. He is entirely out of order in discussing
matters that have nothing to do with the
bill before the house. I think he should stick
to the switches. I would ask for a ruling as to
whether the honourable senator should not
confine himself to the bill before us.
The Hon the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I would say that the point of order is well
taken.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think so too. I will
proceed to deal with the bill in accordance
with the suggestion of the honourable senator
from Brockville (Hon. Mr. Hardy).
I say that there is not a farmer or businessman in the province of Saskatchewan who
did not expect that the government would
prevent a railway strike, and I charge the
government with failure to meet its responsibility in this regard. The government could
have called the cabinet together, discussed
the matter with the leaders of the unions

and settled the differences long ago. As it
is, I have to leave my work and spend my
valuable time in coming to Ottawa, while the
whole transportation system is tied up for
,a week or ten days. I arn still a useful
person in any place, and I am expressing
my views tonight because of a keen sense
of my duty as a senator fron the Province
of Saskatchewan. I repeat that the government should have taken action long ago, and
the strike on the railways should never have
occurred.
I would remind honourable senators that
in the Province of Saskatchewan many millions of dollars worth of land was given away
in order to secure a railway. The Canadian
Pacific Railway bas sold much of its land,
but it retained the mineral rights on it and
is today reaping large benefits from this
source. Yet we are forced to view this
sickening spectacle of steel rails carrying no
produce.
I make no apology for the time I have taken
in criticizing the government for its failure
to prevent a railway strike. I am perhaps
prejudiced in such matters as these, because
I do not believe a strike has ever helped
anybody. In my opinion the courts of this
country are fair and just, and if anybody
has a grievance he can get redress. Everyone in Canada has the right to speak for
himself as I am doing tonight in my humble
and inefficient way before the Parliament of
Canada. Our free democracy permits the
individual to go before the courts to get
justice. I am not stating the policy of any
party when I denounce strikes generally,
but am expressing my own personal belief.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Order!
Hon. Mr. Horner: Am I not in order?
Hon. Mr. Hardy: No, you are not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Certainly he is.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, I am perfectly in
order.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I am going to ask the
Speaker again to rule that you are out of
order.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Let him finish.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not out of order.
Here is the point. The Canadian Government
should have settled this strike. It should
never have occurred in the first place. It
bas cost this country $100 million now, and
it can al be charged directly to the government. They had every power to prevent the
strike.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake a question? He

AUGUST 30, 1950
has stated that the government should have
settled this matter without parliament being
called.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Would he suggest to the
house how the government could have settled it?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will suggest that the
government could have insisted that the railways carry on; they could have said that
parliament would be called but that in the
meanwhile the railroads must carry on at
any cost. The government could have
ordered the railways to keep operating.
Hon. Mr. Grant: They can now.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They could have then,
and at the same time they could have carried
on negotiations and called parliament. Had
I been Prime Minister I would never have
allowed any such condition to develop. I
would have given labour everything they
asked for and would have called parliament,
carried out negotiations and obtained confirmation of any agreement. In any case I
would have seen that the railroads never
stopped operating for one solitary day. I
claim that was the duty of the government.
I may be wrong but that is what I would
have done. I would have seen to it that not
one single trained missed its service.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Supposing the government issued such an order and the men said
"We will still strike"?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The government never
issued any such order. They pussy-footed
and pussy-footed. They wanted the vote of
everybody.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Sit down.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will not. I may just
as well say what I feel like saying and be
done with it. If you are trying to run a
country you have got to be either a man, a
mouse or a long-tailed rat-if you know what
I mean. You ask for authority and then you
are afraid to use it. That type of government has no right to exist in any free country, and that is the sort of thing that I am
afraid will bring about dictatorship. That
is what brought it elsewhere-weakness on
the part of the government. What I really
want to say is that the government have to
run this country and see that the railroads
are run. The people of Canada paid
hundreds of millions of dollars for these railroads, and nobody knows this better than
does the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). Even the Churchill railroad was paid for by Western Canada land.
Now those roads are idle and carloads of

twine and farm machinery are sitting in the
sloughs and railroad men are telling the farmers whose wheat is threatened with frost that
they cannot unload their machines. Talk
about dictatorship!
I want to know how long this condition
will continue. Am I not right in declaring
that it was the first responsibility of the
government, and of the government only, to
keep the railroads running and to avoid a
strike. If it had to make what it thought an
unreasonable agreement it could have called
parliament and said, "Here, this is the best
we can do. We kept the railroads operating,
but now we want the support of parliament."
But the government just waited until the
present situation developed.
What has it cost this country, and what will
be the result so far às the railroad men themselves are concerned?
The International
Harvester Company sold all the large trucks
they had; they thought they were a drug on
the market. What will be done with them?
People like myself and many others have
now taken their first trip in an airplane.
What have the railroads and railroad men
lost? What will all this trucking activity
result in?
Honourable senators, I do not wonder at
all at the honourable member from BrockvilleHon. Mr. Hardy: From Leeds, please.
Hon. Mr. Horner: -from Leeds. I annoyed
him greatly; but I thank honourable senators for bearing with me. Coming as I do
from the greatest province of Canada and
the province most affected by this strike, I
felt duty bound to say a few words of criticism of the present condition.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear hear.
Hon. Saller Hayden: Honourable senators, I
do not propose to prolong the discussion on the
second reading of this bill, but there are one
or two things that I feel I should say,
particularly after having listened to the most
interesting remarks by the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). I have
always felt that he was a very good friend
of mine, and I hope that he feels that I have
always been a good friend of his; but regardless of all the friendship and personal liking
I have for him I must say to him that before
the things could be done that he was charging
the government with failing to do, we would
have had to create a lot more law than now
exists in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I do not agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I want honourable
senators to know, as I am sure they do, that
when this strike took place, the men who

SENATE
went on strike were not violating any law of
the land in Canada, because there was no law
which prohibited or prevented them from
striking. Everything that has been done to
date has been done in a legal and orderly
way and in accordance with our Canadian
laws, but it has exposed a weakness in our
system.
We now find a clash of two ideologies or
philosophies, or whatever you wish to call
them, as to the adjustment of rights between
employers and employees. The right of
labour to make use of the strike as an
offensive or defensive weapon against
employers has been well recognized. I would
be the last person in the world to say that
anything should be done to take away that
right in the least particular. But today a
second principle stands out-the welfare and
safety of the state. When you have a clash of
those two great principles, then, so far as I
or any true and loyal Canadian is concerned,
there can be but one opinion, namely, that
the safety and welfare of the state is of
paramount consideration. If, as I believe, the
safety and welfare of the state has been
threatened by the breakdown in the railway
transportation systems in Canada, then it is
time we brought our laws up to date and
put them in such order that we can protect the
welfare and safety of the state; yet we must
do it on a basis which will not work unduly
to the detriment of the unions and labour
interests of Canada.
I believe the purpose and design of this
bill is to protect the safety of the state and
at the same time protect to the greatest
possible extent the rights of labour. So far
as this bill is concerned, all those things which
were not agreed upon in the negotiations
between the railway managements and the
railway unions are to be the subject matter
for consideration by the arbitrator. Now, if
we cannot find a fair-minded and impartial
arbitrator in Canada, then I would say I do
not know what other measure could be
adopted to ensure the protection of the best
interests of the working people and the
unions, as well as those of the railroads, which
really represent the interests of the people,
including so far as the Canadian National
Railway is concerned, the workers themselves.
If we have confidence in our courts and can
choose proper judges, surely we should have
confidence that somewhere throughout the
length and breadth of our country there is
an individual who can act fairly as an umpire
between the railways and the railway
employees. That is why I do not propose
examining this measure with any particularity. The words used may not be the best
ones, for the bill was drawn rather hastily,

but it is apparent that the framers of the
legislation desired to accomplish two great
things: to protect the welfare and safety of
the state, and at the same time to prevent
more than a minimum of injury to the
working interests.
It has been suggested that the measure
possesses the feature of compulsion, and that
compulsion is bad. Certainly I agree that the
strong arm of compulsion, when wielded in
private disputes between management and
labour, is bad unless it is necessary to protect
the safety or order of the state; but once the
safety or order of the state is concerned, I
do not think that it is any worse to make it
compulsory for management and labour to
lay their problems before an arbitrator and
to be bound by his decision, than it is to conscript ail able-bodied citizens for protection
of the state in a time of apprehended danger,
or to institute compulsory control over prices,
rents and other matters in order to safeguard
our economic system during the stress of an
emergency. For the fact is that we are in
real danger at the present time, and we cannot afford a continuance of the existing tie-up
of rail transportation.
I say that in these circumstances the government could not do anything other than it
bas done. As soon as the unions and the railways had reached an impasse and mediation
proved of no avail, the government had no
option but to ask parliament for authority to
appoint an arbitrator vested with the power
to make a decision binding on both parties.
This bill contains nothing more and nothing
less than that. It has nothing to do with
situations that may arise in future, except in
so far as it may lead to an expression of the
views of parliament and of the people and
bring about consideration at a later time of
some means of assuring that never again will
our laws be in such a state that should there
arise an emergency threatening the country's
economic life and welfare the government in
office will be powerless to take action under
the law without first having to call a special
session of parliament and seek approval.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Does he contend that
this government was powerless to deal with
the situation without calling a special session?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In the light of what little
understanding I have of the laws of this
country, I say to my honourable friend with
all the vigour at my command that the government was wholly powerless. The only
laws that we hadHon. Mr. Horner:
gentleman say-

Will

the honourable

AUGUST 30, 1950
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let me finish. I enjoy
my honourable friend's interruptions, but I
wish he would let me answer one question at
a time. For more than forty years we have
had on the statute books of Canada the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act and the
Conciliation and Labour Act. But a study of
these statutes will show that although there
is machinery that may be set in motion if, for
instance, a municipality is likely to be injured
because of a threatened strike among railway
employees, and although there is provision
for the setting up of a board of conciliation
and, in the event that the board's recommendation is not acceptable to the parties, for
the appointment of a board of arbitration
with power to hear witnesses and make recommendations to the minister. Nowhere is the
force of law given to the decision of either
the board of conciliation or the board of
arbitration unless that decision is agreed to
voluntarily by the parties. So I say that there
is at present no law that would authorize the
government to bring about a termination of
the existing strike. The Prime Minister of
Canada, with all the dignity and responsibility
attaching to his office, requested that negotiations be continued for thirty days in order to
see whether it was possible to work out a
compromise agreement, and I consider that
when this request was declined the time for
action by parliament had come. And as I
see it we are here now in the interest of the
people of Canada as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
gentleman why the government did not use
the War Measures Act, which is still in force?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: of course, I cannot speak
for the government. I may say, though, that
I remember that after the war was over my
honourable friend and other senators, of whom
I was one, criticized the government for daring
to carry on under the powers given to it by
the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Then why was the Act
not withdrawn? The government kept it in
force in order to deal with an emergency, and
when an emergency arose the Act was not
used.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have no desire to prolong the debate
and I do not propose to do so, but I have been
so long associated with labour unions, and particularly with railroad labour unions, that I
cannot permit this occasion to pass without
one word at least as to my own position in
the matter. And while I regret delaying the
house to this extent, I feel that I must do so.
My vote in favour of the measure may
perhaps be interpreted by some of my friends

on both sides of the dispute as an indication
that I like the bill, but I want to say publicly
and plainly that I do not. In that opinion
I think I am not alone, for I believe that
no one in this house likes the measure. I
certainly dislike it. Argue as you will, it has
the element of compulsion in it. But, honourable senators, I agree with the senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) that at the time
the negotiations broke down there was no law
which gave the government power to order
the railroads to -continue operating. To the
course that has been taken there was just
one alternative, and that was to grant the
employees' demands to a sufficient degree to
keep the wheels turning. My own view-and
I have no objection to any one's ýdisagreement
with it-is that this is what should have been
done.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That may still happen.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It may still happen. I
am sorry that we are here. I think the
demands of the employees were moderate. The
wages paid to the men on strike are low,
although the general opinion seems to be that
they are high. Many maintenance men on
rights of way are being paid today as little
as 65 cents an hour, and you and I know
that no man can live and keep a family on
that wage. In the past the wages of our railway men, or of some of them, used to be
the highest in the country, but today that is
no longer so. I have been told that at one
time the engineers-they are not on strike-.
were 'up in the first, second or third category
of Canadian industrial wage earners, but that
today they are in about the twenty-seventh.
The men who are now on strike are poorly
paid and their demands are not exorbitant.
Moreover, I think it is foolish to say that the
economy of Canada could not carry the
financial burden of paying these men at least
what they ask. I would point out that in the
past five years the Dominion of Canada has
spent some $9 billion in capital goods, including houses. As the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has said, increases in railway
wages might have necessitated a redistribution of the burden in some way. My opinion
is that the demands of the workers should
have been met, at least to such an extent as
to keep the wheels turning.
I can see no good purposes in the criticisms
that have already been voiced, or in my add.
ing to them.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Then why do you not
quit?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable gentleman did not quit when he was invited to
do so.

SENATE
The fact is that we are confronted with conditions, and whether we like the bill or not
the public interest requires that we vote for
it. We are in somewhat the same position as
a drowning man who cannot argue about the
colour of the life preserver that is thrown to
him. While it is compulsory that we vote
for the measure now before us, I think that
everybody should understand that we do so
because we have no other course. We are
not necessarily approving all the principles
that may be found in this bill, but we are
voting in an emergency when the economic
life of Canada demands that the railways
resume operation. Indeed, the interests of
the men themselves demand that we pull them
out of this position. But let it not be thought
for one moment that we are laying down a
precedent that I, at least, will vote for in the
future.
I therefore regretfully vote for this measure,
and I hope the railway wheels will be turning
twelve hours from now.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill

they did so on the orders of Stalin and his
Cominform.
Through the infiltration of their agents,
the Soviets were able to conquer China with
ease. They already controlled Manchuria.
Now, they are planning to seize Tibet, Indonesia, Burma and other Asiatic countries.
In Europe, half of Germany, Poland, the
Balkans and Hungary are already under
the yoke of communism.
We have known for some time, from the
statements made by Stalin himself and
through the writings of communists who have
seen the light, that the Soviets' ultimate goal
is to dominate the world, to subjugate all peoples, forcing them thereby to accept the communist creed.
This creed, need I recall it, is a total denial
of human rights. It rejects God and therefore destroys not only all Christian religions,
but also all sects which believe in a living
and eternal God.
The hour may be more critical than we
realize. We, who consider freedom and the
respect of human beings as sacred, have the
pressing duty of girding ourselves against
this imminent and dreadful calamity.
We are appalled at the thought that this
universal upheaval has been wrought by a
handful of communistic doctrinarians who
have deluded the Russian people into thinking
that their way of life is infinitely superior to
ours, as they claim our world is fashioned by
capitalists without a conscience and without
a soul.
However, we know full well that were the
Russian people freed from this reign of terror,
were they to know the advantages of a democratic government, they would undoubtedly
choose our form of administration. Cruelly
tested by adversity, they certainly have entertained for a long time dreams of regaining
their freedom.
In order to draw a true picture of the disastrous situation which would prevail if,
through nonchalance or indifference, the
democratic peoples of the world failed to get
together in an effort to stem the tide of communist ambition, it may be well for me to
draw your attention to the present state of
mind of many of the leaders of Asiatic countries. A great Chinese thinker, in a book
written in 1943 and entitled Between Tears
and Laughter, describes this strikingly. Listen
well to what this Chinese scholar has to say:

"The awakening of Asia-and I include Russia
which is half Asiatic-is the greatest single
happening in history..." And further on:
"In order to maintain the system of the nineteenth century, the white peoples will have to
strangle Russia and China. At this stage, it
may be too late.

. ."

That was in 1943 and

he replies by the following questions: "How
did the imperialism of the nineteenth century
begin? What did the white man do to conquer the world? And what led him to believe
in his superiority over other peoples?" The
answer is categorical and concise: "The white
man had guns and the Asiaties had none.
The answer is as simple as that!. . ." He
goes on: "If the reader still follows me, he
will grasp immediately that the only logical
means of keeping Asia in a state of permanent
subjection, is to prevent the Asiatics from
becoming acquainted with the use of cannons
and guns . . . During the past century, only

this lack of armaments has maintained the
supremacy of the white race in Asia. What
the second great war suddenly revealed is
that the Chinese and the Russians now have
guns. This simple fact will change the course
of the history of the world for this deficiency
no longer exists. And what is even better is
that the Japanese can fight as well as the
white men"-these are the words of a
Chinese,-"the same can be said of the Russians and the Chinese."
And mind you Lin Yutang wrote this book
seven years before the Soviets seized China.
Taking for granted the sayings of this
author, it means that the peoples of the yellow
race are attempting to dominate the rest of
the world. That is a nightmare which haunts
the minds of leaders, whether European or
American. This eventuality was generally
considered, as impossible, but it may be wise
to revise our views on that subject. Honourable senators, if it is wise to refrain from
becoming absorbed in this terrifying thought
in order to safeguard our better judgment
and avoid panic, it would nevertheless be well
for us to reflect upon these matters so as not
to have to blame the Russians for our own
Our training would make this
mistakes.
easy for, in final analysis, the great majority
of democratie leaders base their conduct upon
the soundest principles of Christian philosophy. We have never wanted and we are not
seeking the destruction of any other nation.
When certain European and American countries penetrated into Asia in order to develop
its natural resources, it is evident that they
indirectly helped these Asiatic peoples to

SENATE
modernize themselves. Once this result was
achieved and these nations declared their
intention of recovering their independence,
they have obtained it. This is what happened
in the case of the United States in the Philippines, of England in India, of France in IndoChina and of the Netherlands in its Asiatic
possessions.
Let us not despair, however, for I believe
we have more cause for hope than for despair.
Far be it from me to speak like a preacher.
I would simply suggest that we act in such
a manner as to show the nations that we have
faith, to show them that, even if we are weak
and fallible, we still have faith. Our reason
for hope lies in the attitude which must necessarily be ours from the spiritual point of view.
It is fortunate that our ideology, based upon
the principles of eternal justice and charity,
opens wide before us the possibility of complete regeneration. Why not recognize it for,
as human beings, we know that we are fallible
and that every one of us, whether important
or unimportant, rich or poor, employer or
employee, has too often strayed from these
principles. If we are really determined to
bring peace to the world, if we want to safeguard our own future tranquillity, let us
recognize that armed strength alone is not
sufficient. What we require above all else is
a sincere love of beauty, truth and goodý all
divine attributes capable of ensuring peace
of mind. Our spiritual leaders have often
reminded us of this.
One of the foremost dignitaries of the
modern church, the late lamented Cardinal
Villeneuve, in the course of a masterful
speech he delivered during the last conflict,
gave us indefectible rules in this respect:
"The Holy Scripture is filledi with examples
showing that the steadfast resources of
Christian people, when they wish to prevent
calamities and wars, have always been public
prayers, penance and faith in Divine
Providence . . ."

Further on, he said: "We

strive for victory because we have faith;
because our enemies think they can defy a
divine power they challenge or curse, while
we, even though we are not without fault, at
least know how to pray; because in spite of
our trespasses and our mistakes, and in spite
of those of our allies, a first breath of
Christian regeneration has been felt both on
them and on us. Indeed, we may ask with
confidence and expect with great hope the
victory which a powerful God always denies
wisely to the enemies of those who believe in
Him. We must not forget, however, as Lord
69266-4j

Halifax once mentioned, that our prayer must
above all seek God's will, thereafter trusting
our ways with confidence into His hands".
There we have the spiritual side of the
danger which threatens us. What about the
material side? Towards the end of the last
conflict, and since then, scientists have discovered new weapons of such great force that
they multiply infinitely the means of destruction of all belligerents. The most abhorrent
aspect of such discoveries is that these means
of destruction do not only attack armies, but
also women, children and old people. Indeed,
should the Korean conflict become a world
war, we may all expect belligerents to use the
atom bomb and the H-4bomb in their struggle
against each other. That is why it is supremely important for all democratic countries
to unite, to form an impervious whole of
their strength, thereby showing that Communists have no right to jeopardize thus the
peace of the world. That is why the Canadian Government has expressed, through the
King's worthy representative, its determination to introduce legislation which, I trust.
shaîl be adopted without delay by both
Chambers, in order to increase our armed
strength to the level of presently urgent
needs.
Honourable senators, I could hardly bring
this humble effort to an end without a word
of tribute to the memory of our deceased
members. I wholeheartedly join with other
members of this Chamber in offering my
deepest condolences to the bereaved relatives
of honourable Humphrey Mitchell and Mr.
Gleason Belzile. I also concur in the tributes
which have been paid to that great statesman, William Lyon Mackenzie King. Let me
first paraphrase the eulogy delivered by Bossuet at the death of the Prince of Condé: "I
am equally overwhelmed by the greatness of
my subject and, I must confess, by the futility
of my effort." What part of the civilized
world has not heard of the works and
benevolence of this worthy diplomat, of this
great statesman? They are spoken of everywhere. The Canadian who extolls them has
nothing new to teach abroad. Whatever I
may say about them today, your thoughts
will overtake me and I shall have to contend
with your secret reproach of not having said
enough. We, feeble orators, can do nothing
to magnify the glory of souls who have risen
above the commonplace.
Let me state merely that he was, without
ostentation, a patriot and a Christian. The
illustrious story of his life will inspire future
generations.

SENATE
May the flame kindled by his noble soul
forever enlighten the Canadian nation and
guide it toward its final destiny!
(Text):
Hon. George H. Barbour:
Honourable
senators, in rising to second this motion I
should like first to pay tribute to a former
member of the House of Commons for Prince
County. I refer to the late Right Honourable
Mackenzie King, who on October 20, 1919,
was elected by acclamation. Several eloquent
tributes have already been paid to his memory in this chamber, and I am sure that
the people of Prince County will read them
with approval.
I wish to thank the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for allowing me
the privilege of speaking at this time, though
I must confess that I would be much happier
if I were listening to somebody else, and I
certainly would be much more comfortable.

Some Hon. Senators:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Barbour: However, having been
asked to attempt the seconding of this motion,
I shall do my best, for I feel that in giving
this privilege to me my province has been
honoured.
I am sorry that because of not knowing the
French language I was unable to follow the
honourable gentleman from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis), but I am sure that he made an eloquent speech.
Parliament met for this session under conditions hitherto unknown in Canada. Honourable senators will not soon forget their
journey to Ottawa at this time.

We have

come here by bus, by plane and by motorcar.
The tie-up of our train service, with not a
railway wheel rolling in Canada, was something that we did not expect to happen in
this dominion. I came up here by motorcar,
and it was not until the third day of the trip,
after having driven through Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Maine, and New Hampshire,
that in Vermont I saw a train moving. There
was not much danger of being struck at any
of the railway crossings on that trip.

and other members discuss the vexed question with which they were dealing. The
discussion was, I think, in strong contrast
to what would be heard in a dictator's
country. The members spoke in their usual
tone of voice and, in the end, accomplished
what they had set out to do.
The strike is now settled, but in the last
week or so there was a good deal of discussion about collective bargaining. Now,
I do not know what is meant by conciliation
boards or boards of arbitration unless there
is to be some conciliation at the meetings
of these bodies. If no one-is willing to give
and take there is not much sense in holding
meetings; and if an arbitrary clause had to
be inserted in the bill in order to get desired
results, I am sure it is not the government
that should be blamed. I read in the Financial
Post an article setting out the steps that led
up to the strike, and I will quote a few
extracts:
April 15: Conciliation boards recommend the 44hour week with an hourly raise of 6.63 per cent.
May 1: Railways
reluctantly accept boards'
findings.
May 12: Unions reject recommendations, order
strike vote.

I should say that was fairly fast action for
the unions to take. If they wish to bring
about better conditions they should be willing to sit down and reason matters out.
Now I should like to read a paragraph
from quite a long editorial in the Globe and
Mail of August 31:
The government mediator, Dr. W. A. Mackintosh,
bas put his finger on some of the salient causes.
He found a complete lack of confidence between the
parties to the dispute, and a very low level of effectiveness in collective bargaining in the industry.
Matters like these are of very great importance in
explaining why there was a strike, and they show
why the government was wise in allowing the
issue to come to its final stage.

The Globe and Mail evidently thinks that
the course taken by the government was the
best in the circumstances.
I should like to suggest to both the railway
management and the union representatives
that before they have any further meetings
they read the 13th chapter of the First Epistle
to the Corinthians and try to understand what
is meant there by the word "charity." If they
do that and carry on their dealings in a spirit
of charity, they will find that it "never

As I see it, the difference between what the
Hon. Mr. Barbour: This Canada of ours unions demanded and the railways offered
is a great country, and it has always been was very small in comparison with what the
blessed with a stable government. I am people of Canada were bound to lose through

AUGUST 31, 1950
whereas the people of the country lost
millions of dollars because of the tie-up in
transportation. I believe that by striking the
unions really lost more than they gained.
I cannot see how we are going to be able to
bring down the cost of living index if all the
people in the country are to have a 40-hour
work week. I would suggest that the best
way to reduce the cost of living is to work
harder and produce more goods, and by
doing that we also would likely be able to
purchase more for our dollar.
The Speech from the Throne says that
parliament will be asked to consider the
Korean situation, and to provide funds for
national defence and for armed forces which
may be required abroad. I am sure that what
happened during the first and second world
wars is fresh in the minds of everyone here.
Now the governments of Canada, the United
States and other Western countries are uniting and forming, as it were, a police force, in
an endeavour to stop wars at their source and
prevent them from spreading over the globe.
I am sure that everyone is proud of the way
the young men of this country enlisted when
they were asked to volunteer for service in
the war in Korea. It is worthy of note that
about 60 per cent of the enlistments were by
soldiers who had served in the Second World
War.
Before concluding, I would be remiss if
I did not say something about Prince Edward
Island, the province which is sometimes called
"the million acre farm." I do not say that
it is the best province in the dominion-a
claim which one sometimes hears. I could
perhaps claim for it the second place amongst
the provinces, but I do not wish to go even
that far.
One of the terms under which Prince Edward
Island entered Confederation was that the
province was to have continuous communication with the mainland. For a good many
years this communication, especially in the
winter months, was not very satisfactory.
My memory goes back fifty<two years, to a
time when, during the winter months, I
crossed by ice-boat, the fare being $4 if
the passenger remained in the boat, or $2
if he got out, put a strap over his shoulder
and helped to pull the boat. I recall an
occasion when a member of the federal
parliament made the crossinig and was the
only one who remained in the boat.
Conditions of communication in the early
days were not good. At one time a crew of
about six men went with the boat, which they
rowed through the open water and pulled
over the frozen ice. On one oocasion the
little vessel encountered a snowstorm and
lost its way. It remained stranded on the

ice during the night, and both the hands
and the feet of one member of the crew
were so badly frostbitten that they had to
be amputated. The crew burned the mail
and everything they could to keep themselves
warm during the night.
About thirty-three years ago an ice-breaker
was built in Glasgow, Scotland for, I think,
the Borden government. That boat is still
running and is in good order. A second
ice-breaker was completed in Montreal in
1944, at a cost of more than $7 million.
That vessel is owned by the Department
of Transport, but on August 10, 1947, it was
officially turned over at Charlottetown for
operation by the Canadian National Railways. The government of Prince Edward
Island, the boards of trade and others have
felt that the boat, which accommodates
seventy-five motor cars and eighteen railway cars, should not have been strike-bound
and tied up at the wharf when hundreds of
people were desirous of crossing to the
mainland.
The Premier of Prince Edward Island,
Mr. Jones, whom many honourable senators
know to be a big, .broad-shouldered man,
announeed that he would call the legislature
into session. The following day Mr. Hall,
who apparently has some human kindness
in his heart, ordered the strike-bound ferry
back into full operation. I do not know
whether he feared that the premier would
take the vessel away from the railways.
In any event, the union head saw fit to put
the men back to work.
About 70 per cent of the people of Prince
Edward Island are rural; they work hard and
long hours, and do not belong to unions. The
only means by which they can obtain some
of the luxuries which the central provinces
have is by producing quality goods. This
they try to do. They raise seed potatoes which
I think I can properly claim are the best in
Canada. This seed is shipped to most of the
other provinces and to about half of the
states in the American Union. Last year a
large shipment went to Israel, and perhaps
more will be required by that country this
year.
The Island raises fine Yorkshire hogs. At
the Charlottetown exhibition this year we had
a very good judge from the province of
Saskatchewan. He was so impressed by the
quality of our hogs that he bought three
carloads to take back to Saskatchewan. I
think if the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) would tell what he
knows, he would say that he owns some of
these hogs. The hog producers in my province
have to buy feed from Saskatchewan, raise
the hogs, and then sell them back to Saskatchewan. Now that province is attempting to

SENATE
catch up with us, and is buying the hogs to
be fed in Saskatchewan. Last spring, when
the Manitoba floods were receding, the farmers of Prince Edward Island got together and
sent a carload of hogs to the farmers around
the city of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Our farmers provided
the hogs, and the feed dealers supplied the
feed to be used en route to the fiood area.
I trust that the people who received the hogs
were pleased with them.
The best beaches in North America are to
be found on the north shore of Prince Edward
Island. These beaches have been visited by
some honourable senators, and we are of
course pleased that the genial Clerk of this
chamber finds his way there each year. I
will not recite all the hardships he had getting transportation from Borden to Pictou,
Nova Scotia, when he received the call to
attend this session of parliament, but I know
that he lost a good deal of sleep.
Prince Edward Island has not benefited
greatly from confederation. At the time of
confederation our own tailors made our
clothes, and there were cabinet-makers, shoemakers and carriage-builders all doing business on the Island. In 1881 we had a
population of 108,891, and by 1891 it had
increased to 109,078. Today the population of
the Island is only about 94,000 people. Notwithstanding the birth rate, this decrease in
population is the third highest in Canada.
Most of our children are raised in farm homes,
where they learn to work, even if it is only
on the farm. They work and go to school;
they do not become juvenile casualties. But
our farms cannot take care of them all, and
we lose most of our university graduates to
Ontario and other provinces.
Some time ago I asked my room-mate, the
honourable senator from Montague (Hon. Mr.
Grant), where his family had scattered to.
He informed me that two sons are doctors in
Summerside, and two daughters, one of whom
is a nun, are living in Charlottetown. Two
other sons are doctors in Saint John, while
three other daughters are practising nurses in
Montreal. Two younger boys attend Montreal
University, and another daughter is living in
the United States and still another in Windsor.
I am sure honourable senators agree that it
is not a happy situation when a province educates its children at great cost only to lose
their services when they graduate. So far as
I know we have no communists in Prince
Edward Island, and I am confident that our
young people make good citizens wherever
they go.
I thank honourable senators for their
patience in listening to me.

Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I move
the adjournment of the debate, and will be
ready to proceed on Tuesday next. I should
point out that it will be somewhat difficult
to carry on this debate, because we have
already dealt with half of the Throne Speech.
I am advised that the legislation proposed by
the government to deal with the Korean situation, and the general military program, will
soon be brought down in another place. This
will give me and others an opportunity of
studying it. As the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) has informed the house,
the members of another place are going to
sit tomorrow, Saturday and Monday, and if
at the end of that time I do not know what
the legislation is all about, I shall never know.
Hon. Mr. Farris: You can tell them what it
ought to be.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall certainly do that.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wanted to inform the
house that my speech will be very short.
Hon. Mr. King: Good.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) says "Good".
I quite agree with him.
I join with the leader in urging that those
members who wish to participate in the
debate should be ready to proceed. If I were
not ready myself I would quickly step aside
and let somebody else carry on; but I promise
to be ready. I am sure the majority of
honourable members agree that we came here
to do a job. We have done half of it in two
days, so perhaps we can do the next half in
another five to ten days. By the end of next
week we ought to complete the second half
of the job.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We had an illustration last
night of what this house, or any parliament,
can accamplish if it wishes to. I know that
many members here would like to have participated in the debate last night on the very
important railway question; but had they
done so it would only have prolonged the tieup of railway transportation.
I think the situation with respect to Korea
is somewhat similar. The world is confronted
with an exceedingly difficult problem. I do
not wish to anticipate what the government
intends to do, but apparently it had a military
program that would have taken from two
to six years to complete. The Korean situation, however, indicates that we are not going
to be allowed six years in which to work out
a program. I am not saying that we shall

AUGUST 31, 1950
have war, but I arn suggesting that we shall,
if we are not ready for it. I think that is the
keynote of the whole situation which confronts Canada. Nobody wants war. We hope
that we will not have one, and we think we
will not if we are ready for it. I think that
idea is f airly prevalent ahi over Canada. For
these reasons I move the adi ourrnent of the
debate, and I promise I shahl not be long on
Tuesday afternoon. Other honourable senators had .better be ready to follow me, because
we could run out of business and the house
could prorogue before they would ever have
a chance to make their speeches.
Mon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I ar n ot in a position to say just what legislation may corne before the house on Tuesday
afternoon at 3 o'chock, but I may say for
information that a complete staternent of the

views which the govern*ment holds on the
international situation, and an outline of the
military program. in respect to national
defence, is being made this afternoon in
another place by the Ministers of External
Affairs and National Defence. That statement will be available for honourable senators. It is usual for the leader of the government to follow the leader of the opposition in
the debate on the Speech frorn the Throne,
and I shall be perpared to follow hlm. immediately. Other honourable senators will, of
course, flot be precluded from speaking later
ini the day.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, September 5, at 3 p.rn.

higher. For a good many years I sat in
opposition to a provincial government who,
when questioned about their policy, always
replied by asking the same kind of question
just asked by the honourable senator. Once,
in a moment of weakness, I told that government how to save a million dollars in their
next budget, and believe it or not they
accepted my advice and saved a million
dollars. Then they won the very next election
because they said to the people "Look at what
we saved you-a million dollars". I am not
giving advice now, I am seeking it. I want
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) to tell us what the government is
going to do to reduce our cost of living. Shoes,
clothes, food and shelter have all gone up in
price. In my city, which is not a very

houses are selling as high as $15,000 or
$16,000. Rows upon rows of other houses are
selling for as much as $8,000 or $9,000 each.
I do not know where it will all end. History
shows that the cost of building rises and then
falls, but that it never f alls quite to its
former level. The responsibility for the
increased cost of living lies right at the doorstep of the government. I wish the leader
opposite would give us some solution, but I
do not want it to be the solution that was
given a year ago. In the 1949 session taxes
were reduced because, the government said,
the country was going well; yet now, almost
within two years of the election, before we
on this side have fully recovered our breath
after the licking we took in that election
the government are ready to put those taxes
on again. I want the leader of the government to tell us why they reduced the taxes
in 1949 and why they are putting them back
now. I expect the answer will be that it
is because we are at war. Well, we are
just at the same war we were at then. It
has not changed a bit. It is the same old
cold war.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: There was an election
then.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, I would not accuse
the government of playing that kind of a
trick. Perish the thought that any government of this country would reduce taxes
just before an election and 'then put them
back on as soon as the election was overt That
could never never enter my head.
Some Hon. Senators:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I come now to what, in my
judgment, is the most important matter in
this debate. I have been making speeches

in legislatures and in the Senate for a good
many years, during a little over thirty years
of continuous service. Not many have served
this country longer. Throughout all this
time I never thought I would have to deal
with so critical and important a situation
as the one in which Canada finds itself on
this fifth day of September, 1950. I think
we are now faced with the greatest crisis
in our istory. We see the aggressors, cold
and unafraid, attacking the United Nations
Organization, the only body where different
countries have been at all able to reach any
kind of an agreement. Most people in
Western Europe and the 'Western Hemisphere are agreed that we should be properly
prepared in the event of world war breaking
out.
Since 1945 the Parliament of Canada bas
voted $1,500 million for military estimates.
That is an average of at least $300 million
a year. But the average must be more than
that, because this year's estimate was $425
million, and, as my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) knows, one item
alone of the general estimates that we investigated in committee contained an additional
$55 million for military purposes.
However, let us take the figure of $1,500
million as having been voted in the last five
years for defence estimates. Despite the
voting of that sum, what happened after the
25th of June, when the North Korean aggressors moved south, backed by a Russian
mandate? I say "backed .by a Russian mandate," because there is no doubt who gave
the order to the North Koreans to march.
Let nobody have any misunderstanding as to
that. People have said that we should
not mention Russia for fear of bringing on
reprisals, but the day for that kind of talk
bas gone for ever. Everybody knows that
Russia gave an order to march, and that the
North Koreans marched in cold-blooded
aggression. At the next meeting of the
United Nations Security Council, on the
29th of June, the action of North Korea was
declared to be aggression, and the countries
of the United Nations were called upon to
put it down.
Let me pause here to point out that
because of certain circumstances Russia was
not at that meeting, and thus it was possible
for the representatives of the other nations
to pass a unanimous resolution. I am going
to quote briefly frorn a speech made yesterday
in the other house by the Secretary of State
for External Affairs. I agree with the minister as to the facts, but I do not accept the
conclusions that he draws. I was a delegate
at one session of the United Nations and I
have never believed that Russia would do

SENATE
anything intentionally for the preservation of
peace. I defy anyone who has attended
United Nations meetings as a representative
of Canada to point out to me one vote, one
speech or one move of any other kind by
Russian representatives there, for the purpose
of safeguarding peace. Whenever Russian
representatives have spoken at the United
Nations they have said something designed to
cause trouble, and they have used the organization for propaganda purposes and nothing
else.
Now I come to what the Secretary of State
for External Affairs said yesterday, and I call
attention to it because had Russia been
represented at the meeting of the Security
Council on the 29th of June the council could
not have passed the resolution calling upon
member countries to stop the aggression in
Korea. Here is what Mr. Pearson said:
For reasons which to me seem pretty clear, we
did not contemplate this kind of aggression.
I admitted that the other day and a good deal has been
made of that admission. Why did we not expect it?
In the first place, we did not expect it because
there were no military agreements under article 43
by which we were bound.

I am quite free to admit that the leader
of the Canadian Government delegation to
the United Nations in 1946-at that time he
was, I think, Secretary of State for External
Affairs, and he is now Prime Minister-suggested that the United Nations should have a
military force to be used against any nation
that took aggressive action in any part of the
world. My honourable friend the leader of
the government here (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
was there at the time, as I was. The suggestion did not get very far, as I felt it
would not after I heard the speech that
Molotov made at that session.
Mr. Pearson went on to say:
In the second place, we did not expect it because
it was difficult to visualize a resolution of the
Security Council to use force against a communist
state which would not be vetoed by the U.S.S.R. as
a member of the Security Council.
Therefore,
realizing the weaknesses of the Security Council in
this matter, realizing the unlikelihood of the United
Nations being able to live up to its joint obligations
in respect to this kind of aggression, certainly from
communist countries, we had along with other countries worked out the North Atlantic pact under
which our obligations in respect of that group of
states would be specific and would not be vetoed by
anybody.

It is fortunate for the rest of the world that
Russian representatives, who for some six
months had been absenting themselves from
Security Council meetings, were absent on
June 29. But Russia undoubtedly saw her
mistake, because at the July meeting she was
represented again.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The Russian representative came back on the lst of August.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, the 1st of August.
Thank you.
On the 14th of July the Secretary General
of the United Nations called upon member
countries to send ground forces to defend
South Korea.
We sent three destroyers
from the Pacific coast, and about a dozen
TCA planes were used for transport purposes
from Washington, on the Pacific coast, to
Tokyo. But what was the response of our
government to the call for ground forces?
None at all. On the 7th of August the
government announced that it would raise
a special force to be sent wherever the United
Nations might require them, but that probably six months would be required to train
the force.
Now, here is what I wish to emphasize.
From 1945 to the end of June this year we
had spent or voted $1,500 million to help
fight aggression by Russia or any other
country, but when we were called upon to
send ground forces the government admitted
that it was unable to furnish any at all.
That is the situation. Today the defenders
of South Korea are fighting to save that
country against the invaders from the north,
and the question in everybody's mind is,
"Are the defenders going to succeed, or will
there be another Dunkirk?" All the world
knows that the British people have been hard
pressed to get enough money and goods to
do with; and the British government has
trouble in Malaya, and threats of trouble at

Hong Kong. Yet British troops are helping
to defend South Korea. We also know that
Australia had fighting airplanes in South
Korea almost as soon as the Americans did,

and now she is sending ground troops as
well. I am not saying whether or not we
should have sent troops. I am simply pointing out that when we were asked to send
some we did not have any. I may be told
that we have forty-five thousand men in the
army, navy and air force,.but the government
has said that they were not trained for the
kind of fighting going on in Korea. They
were trained to defend Winnipeg, Edmonton,
Lethbridge and other cities against the
Russians if an invasion were attempted from
the north. But does anyone think that any
little force we could put in the north country
would stand up against the kind of attack
that Russia would make if she did decide on
an invasion?
Here are two simple facts that have always
appealed to me. We fought World War I
in Europe, but we know from what the
Germans have told since that if they had
been successful in that war Canada would
have been the first country taken over by
them. World War II also was fought in
Europe, and again we know that had the
Germans been successful in that war the

SEPTEMBER 5, 1950
first country they would have taken was
Canada. And Canada is the country that
Russia would take over first if she won
World War III. There are a number of
reasons for that. It is adjacent to their own
country, it is only slightly populated, is rich
in natural resources, and would provide
them with a bulwark against the United
States. Someone may say that the United
States would not let them take over Canada.
I do not know what the Russians can do.
The current issue of the Saturday Evening
Post contains an article showing some things
that are feared by two able reporters who
have lived in Europe for a number of years.
It is a well known fact that Russia is always
trying out the soft spots. Why did she attack
The
in Korea instead of in Germany?
reason is that she concluded-fortunately
for us, wrongly-that the United States would
not go to the assistance of South Korea. If
Russia had not been stopped there, where
next would she have attacked? I personally
do not know, but according to these men who
have been abroad and know the situation,
she would have attacked through Iran.
Would the United States and Canada have
gone to the aid of that country? Certainly
if the United States did not choose to protect
South Korea, she would not go to the
assistance of Iran. And if she went to the
assistance of Iran, she would probably hâve
to go alone.
We are today facing a most serlous situation, which the government must have known
was upon us. The minister admitted that he
was relying on not having to defend against
an aggressor by reason of the likelihood that
Russia, through the United Nations organization, would veto any such proposal. If
Russia had been at the meeting of the
United Nations at which the decision to
defend South Korea was. taken, she would
have vetoed the authority to do so, and we
would not have been called on for military
assistance. Under those circumstances the
United States would probably have had to
stand on its own feet. At one time we bitterly
criticized the United States for its policy
of isolationism, and we might well have said
that that country was getting some of its
own medicine.
But it would be equally wrong for us to
do what we criticized the United States for
doing. I fail to understand the attitude of
anybody who says that Canadian troops should
fight only in Canada. Leaving aside for
the moment the question of loss of life and
destruction of armaments, what loss did
Canada suffer in the First World War compared with that of Belgium? In the Second
World War what did we endure in comparison
with the people of Great Britain, of Belgium
or of Holland? Furthermore, compare our

losses in World War II with those of Russia.
True, we suffered loss of men and materials,
but our country was not devastated in the
same way as was the western part of the
Soviet. My theory is that we should fight wars
elsewhere, because if we fail to do so we may
ultimately have to fight them on our own
soil. We all know that if the forces of the
United Nations are defeated in Korea, Russia
will then turn on Iran, or Germany, or
Yugoslavia. One by one these countries will
fall, until eventually Russia will move all
over Europe, and then we will be slaves for
eternity. That is the feeling of the people
of Canada today. True, Canada has a population of only 14 millions and the United
States has about 150 millions and is the
greatest manufacturing nation on earth.
Nevertheless, the fact is that our country
is the more attractive of the two to an
enemy today, and therefore we ought to be
doubly prepared to protect ourselves.
How can anyone who believes in a Supreme
Being stand by and say that we should not
defend ourselves against aggression by communism? Why that attitude should be taken
is beyond my comprehension. I have known,
as many honourable senators have known,
what it is to have a son fighting overseas;
and knowing that, I say that we must face
the serious conditions of this crucial period.
In my opinion this is a more crucial time
than were the days preceding either the
First World War or the Second World War.
We now face an enemy that is carrying
war into every part of the world. My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) may say-and he may have some
reason for saying it-that if we had given
a little better living to the people of Asia,
of the Malayas and certain other countries,
there would be less reason for them to fight
us today. I do not know that that is the
answer, but I am fully aware of the fact
that Russia will do everything she can to
make the peoples of those countries believe that the communistic form of government will give them plenty; and they will
refuse to take note of the slavery into which
the peoples of countries now under the control of Russia have fallen.
For these reasons I should like the government leader in this house to tell me what is
the policy of his government, first, regarding
the open aggression in Korea. The honourable gentleman need not remind me that
Canada has sent three destroyers and twelve
planes I think that I am as good a Canadian as anybody but, ladies and gentlemen,
I ask'you seriously, is Canada's contribution
a generous one? When we realize that we are
fighting the worst aggressor in the world
today, it is not much of a contribution. We
know, of course, that we are not fighting

SENATE
this battle alone. If the whole affair ended
in Korea, one might regard Canada's contribution as satisfactory. But, I repeat, if
Russia wins in Korea she will move on to
another target.
The communistic philosophy has spread
the world over. Indeed, we have communists
right here in Canada: and does anyone suggest
that if we were at war with Russia they
would not do everything they could to hasten
the downfall of this country? Certainly they
say they would do just that, and I do not
know why they would not carry out their
threat. The communists in European countries, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia,
which have fallen to Russia, have assisted
the aggressor. This is particularly true in
Czechoslovakia where, according to an article
I read only recently, those men about whom
there is any doubt are being killed off.
Secondly, I want the government to tell
me what is the obligation of this country
under the Atlantic charter, and how is it
intended to carry out that obligation. I see
by the Hansard of the other place that the
government proposes that parliament vote
$142 million-presumably to maintain the
special force for Korea-and the following
further amounts: $409 million, $2 million, $5
million and $3 million. These votes are all
beyond the $425 million voted during the
previous session of parliament.
I admit that such huge expenditures will
require increased taxation, but that does not
answer my question. I repeat. What is the
government doing to carry out the terms of
the Atlantic charter, in the event of Russia
attacking some part of Europe tomorrow?
What would our government do if Russia
went into Norway, or Holland, or Belgiurn
or Luxembourg? How would we do our part
to meet su.ch an attack? True, we have set
up a group of five or six thousand men
for United Nations purposes, but that would
not be enough.
It must be rernernbered that we do not
have five years in which to prepare. At the
most we have two years. I am one who
believes that Russia has not enough atomic
bombs to carry out her purposes, and therefore is holding back. But we have not enough
bombs either. I think it was Mr. Drew who
said that we are living on borrowed time.
At one time we thought we had five or six
years in which to prepare to defend ourselves, but on June 25 last we apparently did
not have any time at all.
I have spoken long enough, and my honourable friend the leader of the goverament
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) may say that I' have
announced no policy for the Conservative
party. Well, I have no authority, and it is
not my responsibility, to announce a policy.

When this country went to war in 1914
that great statesman, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
who was then leader of the opposition in
the other house, did not announce any policy
or suggest to the government what it should
do. The situation is the same today. This
is your baby. What are you going to do
about it? We have allowed the present crisis
to dangle since June 25, and today we are
no nearer to knowing what we are going to
do than we were then. We know that we
are going to vote money for defence purposes, and that six or seven thousand volunteers have been asked for. The government
has asked veterans of World War II to
volunteer-a policy that is being criticized
across Canada. I wonder whether the time
does not come when a man might be considered to have fully completed his service
to his country. If my boy or your boy went
through the last war, he should not be called
upon to go through another, especially when
so many young men did not serve their
country at all. I know how the parents of boys
who fought in the last war feel about their
sons being asked to volunteer again. I do
not refer to the troops who guarded our coasts
or who stayed in Britain and did nothing.
I am talking about our boys who fought in
Italy and at El Alamein and in Germany; our
boys who flew over enemy territory whenat least in the early days of the war-onethird of thern would not come back from a
one-night raid. I am talking about the boys
who made thirty operational trips over enemy
territory, fighting to save democracy for the
rest of us. I question the right of the government to ask those men to volunteer again.
It is a very grave responsibility; but if that
is the government's policy, I want to know
it; I do not want to pretend it is something
else.
Just what is the government's policy in this
whole show?
I do not agree with Mr. Drew or with Mr.
St. Laurent. I am beginning to think that a
world war is inevitable. I have never known
a dictator to quit-unless he was shotand I do not see 170 Russian divisions in
Europe standing still and doing nothing when
faced by only about 12 allied divisions. If it
were not for the fact that the United States
has the atomic bomb, the Russians would be
moving now. The Russian tanks used by the
North Koreans were found to be so far
superior to the tanks used by the Americans
that it was simply a joke, and only the bigger
American tanks now being used are able to
hold their own. The enemy in Korea is not
using any aeroplanes to speak of, but when
the Russians attack in Europe they will have
thousands of planes.

SEPTEMBER 5, 1950
What is the Canadian government doing to
meet this challenge, which is right at their
doorstep? I admit that their responsibility
is tremendous, but they have to face it. We
have gone to help the United States, and from
reading this article I have come to the conclusion that perhaps they are just as far
behind in defence matters as we are; our government may even be in a better position
than theirs. But that does not help us or
save the Korean people who are being chased
out of their homes. They have no satisfaction
in knowing that the Americans had been
there after the last war and then had got out.
The Americans should, have remained and
trained the South Koreans, just as the
Russians are training the East Germans. The
East Germans are trained and armed, while
the West Germans are untrained and
unarmed. I realize that we in Canada, and
in the United States, Britain, France and
other countries think ours is the Christian
and human way; but we are not fighting a
Christian or humanitarian nation. We are
fighting dictators who have a lust for power
and who demand that their will shall be
supreme. Honourable senators, we have got
to prepare ourselves for this.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I want to join with the leader of the
opposition in congratulating the mover (Hon.
Mr. Dupuis) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Barbour) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. Like the leader
opposite, I was unable to follow the remarks
of the mover as closely as I should like to
have done, but I have just recently received
a translation of his remarks, and I can tell
my colleagues that when they have an opportunity of reading it they will find that the
honourable senator from Rigaud has lived up
to his reputation of being a keen student of
public affairs, and particularly those pertaining to present world hostilities. Those who
were unable to understand the mover in his
native tongue will find it well worth their
while to read and re-read the translation of
his speech. It is an excellent contribution to
the debates of this house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The same is true of
the address by the honourable senator from
Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour). As government
leader in the Senate it is my responsibility
to ask various senators to assume the task of
moving and seconding the Address, and with
a great wealth of material from which to draw
I always endeavour to choose men from different sections of the country. I am sure
honourable senators agree that it is both

interesting and illuminating for us, in the
opening days of each session, to hear someone
present the viewpoints of his own particular
part of the country and discuss the matters
referred to in the Speech from the Throne.
Honourable senators, in other sessions I
would usually adjourn the debate at this time
in order to give some thought to any specific
questions asked by the leader of the opposition. Now, however, as I intend to proceed
this afternoon, I hope the leader opposite
will not feel that I have ignored his remarks
if I neglect to commen't on all the points he
has raised. I also hope that some of my
colleagues on this side of the house will fill
in anything I overlook. I feel it almost impossible to go over all the ground covered by my
honourable friend, because he, in addition to
being well informed about domestic and
international affairs, has become a great
parliamentary strategist. The rapidity with
which he discussed all the international questions bef ore us really amazed me, and in the
brief time I have before me I would not try
to touch upon them all. In any event, I do
not know that I would be the proper person
to deal with matters of government policy on
certain questions which have been raised.
When the Appropriation Bill is before us we
can refer it to our Special Committee, where
the ministers of External Affairs and National
Defence can perhaps answer the questions
raised by the honourable leader opposite.
My friend has definitely and specifically
demanded to know why Canada should not
have sent ground troops to Korea immediately
they were asked for. That question implies one of two things. Whether we were
right or wrong in not sending land forces may
be questioned. It was certainly no secret that
we had no troops ready to send. We could, of
course, have sent some 3,000 highly-trained
parachute troops; but these men, as my honourable friend knows, were specifically
trained for the defence of Canada. The alternative was to send a number of untrained
troops to Korea in order to make a showing.
I do not think that would commend itself to
our people, and I am surprised to find my
honourable friend advocating it. It would be
a senseless thing to do, for it could only cause
a waste of life without adding anything to the
strength of the United Nations forces.
As to our general obligations under the
North Atlantic Pact, I have no particular
knowledge beyond what has been stated in
another place by the two ministers chiefly
Perhaps further information
concerned.
could be elicited. I take it that the obligations assumed by Canada under that pact are
for the common defence and benefit of ourselves and the other countries with whom

SENATE
we have bound ourselves together. How successful or effective this pact may be remains
to be seen. My honourable friend opposite
has referred to the proposal made by Canada
at the United Nations that member countries agree to make their combined armed
forces available for the repelling of aggression
in any part of the world. As he said, that
suggestion was opposed by Russia and fell by
the wayside. Specifically, what we have in
its place for purposes of collective security is
the undertaking of those countries bordering
the North Atlantic to build up their armed
forces in an endeavour to be ready to meet
just such a challenge as is now presented in
Korea.
In the face of Russia's right to veto, how the
United Nations will undertake to give effect to
the desire expressed by the other countries
for combined effort against aggression, I do
not know. I assume that the Assembly will
try to reach some formula for avoiding this
obvious difficulty and others. It will undoubtedly be the will of all the countries except
Russia to make their united strength available
for fighting aggression, and I hope means
will be found to prevent Russia from frustrating that will. The pact made by the North
Atlantic countries, in which Canada is included, continues in force, and I have no
doubt that as time goes on we shall be given
further information as to what plans are
being laid for defence.
I was much interested in the passionate
attack made by the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) upon the government because of rising
prices, and I presume he wished to imply
that controls should be reimposed. But I
have a distinct recollection of listening in
this house to eloquent appeals by himself
and his colleague from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) for discontinuance of government controls, "now that the war is over,"
in order that the law of supply and demand
might be able to operate again and cause
prices to come down. If they did not describe
the government as iniquitous for having
brought controls into being, they at least
attacked it for continuing them, and argued
that there should no longer be interference
with the ordinary effect of competition on
the prices of goods. But at this session
our honourable friends have made an almost
frantic appeal for resumption of government
controls. In so doing they have paid the
government a high compliment. I fancy that
the leader of the opposition was happy that
it was not the responsibility of the opposition
to bring down legislation, for the problem of
dealing with prices was not an easy one. He
certainly was not right in his forecast that
the problem would be settled if the laws
of supply and demand were allowed to

operate freely. And now there is, as I say,
this appeal, which perhaps in the circumstances is a natural one, to have controls
put on again.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a minute. I never
urged that controls be put on again. I asked
what the government policy was.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable
friend's memory of what he said is probably
right. However, he wanted the government
to do something. It is a very subtle point.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. I asked you what
the government's policy was.
Hon. Mr. Robertson. My honourable friend
used to argue that if the government stopped
doing certain things, everything would be all
right; but now be says that everything would
be all right if the government did something.
I believe he is as much in error now as he
was when insisting upon his demand that
controls be removed.
I do not think I need to remind this house
that the primary reason for calling this
special session of parliament was the worsening of the international situation. It is true
that the opening date was advanced somewhat because of the railway strike, but I
have no doubt that the difficulty of effecting
a settlement of that strike in the final hours
of negotiation was attributable in some
degree, at least indirectly, to the difficulties
brought about by the Korean war, the
workers perhaps fearing that a largely
increased demand for many goods by people
trying to safeguard themselves against shortages in the event of an extended conflict
might start an upward spiral in prices. So
from that point of view it can still be said
that the worsening international situation
was the primary reason for calling this
session.
The leader opposite has pointed out that
the government, through an appropriation bill
which is already before the other house, will
be asking for specific sums of money. Last
session the vote for defence was approximately $425 million, with authorization for
another $190 million for forward commitments. My honourable friend reminded us
that in committee a certain item, which
perhaps should have been properly charged
to defence, was found to be under another
head-I think it was housing. The Appropriation Bill introduced at this session calls
for a direct appropriation of $142 million
for defence, plus $300 million for the supplying of armaments to our allies overseas.
The government is seeking authorization for
future commitments of an additional $409
million, and a further amount of more than
$5 million is required for defènce research,
plus an extra $2 million, which may not be

SEPTEMB ER 5, 1950
directly connected with war expenditures, to
cover increased activities of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. The sum total,
honourable senators, of what we have spent,
the commitments we have made, and what
we are asking for in the future, is the
staggering sum of almost $1,500 million.
The New York Times of last Monday, in
an interesting article on the armament program of the United States, showed clearly
the tremendous cost of producing and maintraining modern weapons of war. According
to the article, the total appropriation bill
presented to Congress amounted to 36.2 billion
dollars, to which should be added an amount
passed by the house, and now awaiting Senate
action, of 16.8 billion dollars. These amounts,
plus an additional $10 billion for which the
President will likely ask, make a total of
$63 billion, of which more than $45 billion
is to be used directly for military expenses.
This expenditure reduced to a per capita
basis means that every man, woman and
child will have to pay $300 each towards the
cost of armaments. Though these sums appear
fantastic, they are probably far less, as my
honourable friend has pointed out, than may
have to be contemplated by the United
States and Canada should the international
situation grow worse.
The honourable leader opposite raised a
question which is asked by many seriousminded people today: Why was it that when
the Korean war broke out the United States,
which had an armament expenditure of $14
billion a year for some years, plus an additional amount for atomic research, had only
about eleven divisions under arms and these
were not up to full strength? With all Canada's
activities on land, on the sea and in the air,
we were prepared at that time to put into
combat only a brigade of three or four
thousand men. The reason for that situation,
of -course, is increased expenditures for armament purposes. Large as our appropriations
have been, we were able to provide only a
skeleton organization which could, when necessary, train a larger combat force. This basic
organization provided facilities for the rapid
expansion of needed armed strength for defence purposes.
A realization of the staggering expenditures
of the United States, and to a lesser extent
of Canada, for an inadequate defence force,
causes one to speculate on the program that
must have been in operation in Russia during
.the past few years. The honourable leader
of the opposition in the other house quoted
some figures on Russia's military strength
today as given by a member of the British
government. It was said that she had about
three million men under arms, or 175 divisions, which could be expanded within a few

37

months to a force of five and a half million to
six million strong. Further, it was said, that
Russia has 40,000 tanks,-seven times as many
as the United States-19,000 aircraft, many
of which are of the latest jet propulsion type,
and 360 submarines, 200 of which are of the
largest and most modern -construction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
leader whether it is true that one of those
submarines recently visited Halifax?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would not attempt to
express an opinion on that question, for my
honourable friend has as much knowledge
of that matter as I have. I might well ask
him if it is true that Canada has recently
been visited by a Russia submarine. While
I have no special information on the subject,
I presume that the,ru-mour was true.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Nonsense! A Russian submarine was never there.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: They have been seen in
the Bay of Fundy.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friends
know more about the subject than I do.
I make a comparison between the present
military strength of Russia and the United
States to show what a country of 200 million
people can do. I take the figures in this
respect to show that since the last war Russia
has maintained an army of three million men
and an air strength of 19,000 aircraft. Think
of the tremendous cost of keeping this equipment, which rapidly becomes obsolescent, up
to date. Bearing in mind the relatively low
production of Russia, it becomes obvious that
she has been taxing her productive facilities
heavily to produce arms and equipment on
the scale to which I have referred. We are
just now having a taste of what a much
smaller armament program costs. Though the
financial structure of Russia differs from our
own, nevertheless the arming and equipping
of 300 million men is an enormous feat.
Hon. Mr. Horner: How many millions of
slave labourers does Russia have to do the
work?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Generally speaking,
the men of an army are young and active,
and there is nothing to indicate that slave
labour is more intelligent than any other
type of labour. After all, the population of
Russia is only fifty million more than that
of the United States, a highly productive
nation.
I have always felt that even if Russia's
armed strength were a fraction of that
claimed for her, that in gaining that strength
she must have taxed her productive capacity
to such an extent as to reduce her standard
of living to a very low level.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: We must not forget
that as a result of the war the western portion of the Soviet Union was terribly
devastated, and this area had to be rebuilt.
Honourable senators, I give the leaders of
the Soviet Union credit for having sufficient
intelligence not to seriously believe that they
are likely to be attacked by the western
world, and I suggest to the house that
the tremendous land mass embraced in the
Soviet Union forms an almost impenetrable
barrier. I am certain that Russia's leaders
are sufficiently aware of our legislative processes to know that from an economic viewpoint Canada and the United States have not
at the moment the ability to make war; and
certainly Western Europe, which is still
recovering from the devastation of the last
war, cannot do so. It is true that developments in airplanes and the atomic bomb have
changed the picture, and that to a certain
extent distances have been shortened; but
even so I think we would be most unwise to
try to attack Russia. Among their 19,000
aircraft the Russians have long-distance
bombers, and we are told that they now have
the atomic bomb. But we are not throwing
in the sponge because they have these
weapons, and I am sure that the Russians
are not throwing in the sponge because we
have them. Just as we are preparing for
the possibility that these weapons may be
used against us, it is reasonable to assume
that the Soviet Union is taking the same precautions. History shows that Russia is safe
in her boundaries, and if the only armament
consisted of a shotgun to shoot ducks, distance would prevent any aggressor from going
far. History shows that you simply cannot
penetrate a land mass like that of Russia. So
why these three million men under arms, and
why all this armament? I can guess just
as well as the leader of the opposition or anybody else, but in using ordinary intelligence
I think it is fair to assume that the primary
reason for these things, and for Radio Moscow
daily telling the people of Russia and her
satellites that they are in danger of aggression
from capitalist America, is founded on the
fact that the Soviet leaders today are more
frightened of the people of Russia than they
are of the people of the United States.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I know nothing in
particular about Russia, because even ordinary sources of information have long been
closed to us. There is an iron curtain around
their country which is almost impenetrable.
But, as I say, I think the real danger to them
is more likely to arise from the constantly
increasing difficulty of a relatively small

group in endeavouring to continue to impose
their will on a much larger number. This is
true of the countries of Eastern Europe which
Russia has occupied. Relatively small, compadt, highly-organized groups, which are
frequently purged of those who fail to follow
blindly, are in complete control. Apparently
this is so in Soviet Russia itself. Out of 200
million people in Soviet Russia, the corps of
the communistic party is said to be only five
million, but they have had complete control
for a long time, and may still have it today.
How long they can hold control no one can
predict; but it is fair to assume that as time
goes on and Russian standards of living and
intellectual development rise, the problems
of the Soviet Union leaders will become
increasingly difficult. Therefore these wars
and rumours of wars, as far as Russia is
concerned, are more for her own people's consumption than they are for the rest of the
world. A friend of mine told me the other
day that he had listened to a man and a
woman broadcast from Russia in English. He
said that the hour-long broadcast was concentrated on one subject alone-the danger to
Russia and her satellites of the imperialistic
ambitions of the United States and the western world.
Honourable senators, I must repeat that I
give the leaders of the Soviet Union credit for
having more intelligence than to believe that
the western world is preparing to wage an
aggressive war. The Russians must know
something. They may despise our democratic
system, but surely they realize how remote
is the danger to them of aggression by the
western world. You may say: "Here is this
great country of Russia. Why do they not
want peace?" Well, I do not think the Russian
leaders can afford to have peace. The minute
they reduce their armies or their armaments
to a size that would ordinarily be required
for police purposes, the minds of the people
would concentrate on conditions at home.
There is nothing new at all to such tactics.
They have been the age-long method of dictators. They take different forms, but
basically they are always the same. Anyone
who believes for a moment that this situation is likely to end today or tomorrow or the
day after is building on a very shallow foundation. Russia, in her present position in
the centre of her land mass and surrounded
by her satellites, can provoke many incidents,
perhaps without a Russian soldier being
involved, and the rest of the world will have
to either accept this situation or oppose it.
To oppose it, even in the relatively small way
of the men now fighting under the United
Nations flag in Korea, will tax the abilities
and the faculties, of the western world for a

SEPTEMBER 5. 1950
long time to come. I do not believe the
Soviet leaders can afford to dispense with
wars or rumours of wars.
My honourable friend has said that he
does not agree with the Prime Minister and the
leader of the opposition in the other house
that there will not be an all-out war. But no
man can predict that will happen when a
tremendous number of men are under arms
and equipped with airplanes and tanks, and
everybody is on edge. No one can predict
that the leaders of the Soviet Union, having
large forces at their command and faced with
the alternatives of losing their heads or
declaring all-out war, might not choose war.
These are dangers, I admit, but I should
hope that they are not immediate. However,
there is no doubt that the United States,
Canada, and the countries of Western Europe
will have to face very serious difficulties in
making adequate defence preparations. I
suppose that these are the countries upon
whom rests the primary responsibility for
repelling aggression. The South American
nations, India and the rest of the free world,
though on our side, will probably have
enough to do for the time being in taking care
of their own peoples.
We in the countries upon whom falls the
primary responsibility for the preservation
of our way of life will have to be prepared
demands for
staggering financial
for
immediate defence, but at the same time it
behoves us to see that the standards of living
in our respective countries are not so reduced
as to make our people vulnerable to communist propaganda, which is one of Russia's
strongest weapons. Our allies in western
Europe are just beginning to recover from
the effects of the last war, and the production of their factories is gradually increasing.
In the United Kingdom rationing of some
goods has been discontinued and the quantities of others available for purchase have
been slightly increased; but now the people
there are asked to provide an undetermined
amount to meet war expenditures for the
present, and possibly for a long time to come.
Even if there should be no total war, the fact
is that the peculiar period in which we
are now living is gôing to bring about demands
that will severely tax the abilities of ourselves and our allies.
Looked at in the light of these circumstances it seems to me that the resolution of
my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), which the Senate passed last
session, calling for an inquiry into the possibility of some form of federal union of the
democracies, is of great importance. There
must be international co-operation, for to
provide the necessary defence and at the

same time maintain existing standards of living is a task that will challenge as never
before the constructive abilities of all nations
that are, so to speak, in the same boat
together. It is not enough to say that
tremendous obstacles are facing us. We must
not lose sight of what is at stake. We are up
against a ruthless and determined power
which by force of circumstances is at the
moment dominating 700 million people in
the other hemisphere. Perhaps the Senate
did not realize how well-timed that resolution was. What will be done to give effect
to it I do not know. Obviously the difficulties
encountered in any attempt to integrate the
armed forces and the economies of a considerable number of nations would be staggering. At present it is proposed that Canada
should provide certain forces to be used in
Korea or wherever else the United Nations
may deem it necessary to use them. Imagine
the practical problems that would arise if,
over a long period, soldiers from the United
States, Canada, France, Britain and perhaps
eight or ten other countries were being
trained together. The rates of pay for the
different nationals would vary greatly, possibly in the ratio of $5 to 50 cents, and it is
not difficult to picture serious complications
from this fact alone. Yet I believe that in
passing the resolution and suggesting that the
logic of events might make it necessary to
bring about some form of union of the
democracies in order to save civilization, we
builded better than we knew. For my part
I hope that the resolution will be effective.
What it proposed cannot be brought about
in a moment. In ordinary times it might
require generations, but things can happen
quickly when there is at the gates an enemy
such as now faces the western world.
Honourable senators, I do not think that I
can add much to what has been said. I see
the point of the leader opposite as to the
need for specific information about our
armed forces and international policy, but
adequate answers might best be elicited in
committee when the Appropriation Bill is
before us. If honourable members wish to
refer that bill to committee, I feel sure that
the two ministers most directly concerned
would be glad to attend and answer any
questions.
Hon. Thomas H. Wood: Honourable senators, may I join with those who have previously spoken in extending my sincere congratulations to the mover (Hon. Mr. Dupuis)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Barbour) of the
Address? Both made splendid speeches.
Every member of this house was, I am sure,
deeply shocked and regretful on hearing of
the passing of William Lyon Mackenzie King.

SENATE

So much has been said about him in the press
and elsewhere that I can add little, except to
say that we have lost a wise counsellor whose
good judgment and sound advice brought us
through difficult times and would be invaluable now.
The two speakers who preceded me today
have not had a great deal to say about the
matter that I propose to deal with at the
outset. This session was called for the purpose of discussing the Korean situation and
the railway problem. I should like to speak
first of the latter, because of its effect upon
the western and eastern provinces. I am
afraid that what I have to say may not be
popular in central Canada. I know that most
Canadians, even some of the railway workers,
were incensed that a small group of citizens,
through their leaders, should paralyse the
country's economy and disorganize the essential and vital business of Canada from coast to
coast, thereby causing untold anxiety and
distress, and all this when nerves were
strained almost to breaking point with the
problems of defence and aid to other nations.
For it is a known fact that to keep up a
nervous tension in all walks of life has been
one of the chief instruments of a dictatorship
policy.
When war is being waged, as it now is in
Korea, railway lines and communications are
bombed and disrupted, with great risk and
loss of life to those who must accomplish the
task. But this is not so of these leaders of a
small group. They can accomplish the same
result without physical harm to themselves,
knowing that the people of Canada have no
choice but to allow them protection. For my
part, I have always believed in collective
bargaining and compromise, but not one-sided
compromise. If, as representatives of the
people, we do not pass legislation to make
impossible in time of crisis the recurrence of
a situation siimlar to the one in which Canada
was placed by a small group, we shall deserve
the censure that we certainly shall receiveand in fact have received.
Most people I have talked to feel that the
railway employees have a minimum of
grievances.
An article appearing recently in a railway
unions newspaper mentioned the fact that
since 1939 increases in railway wages were
less by 25 points than in other industries; but
what I think was omitted from this article
was the fact that employees in other industries during the depression had their wages
cut all the way from 20 per cent to 50 per
cent, while the railways maintained much
the same wage scale as that prevailing in
1928 and 1929.

The members of 'this house know that during the thirties the government loaned $60
million to the Canadian Pacific Railway to
keep its workers on the payroll and guarantee
them a high rate of pay. During approximately -this same period young men on the
farms were guaranteed $5 a month. Even up
until five or six years ago the average farmer
was receiving an income of less than $1,000
a year and during the depression years it was
less than $400 a year. Now that be has a
chance to improve his financial position he
must meet increased freight rates and a
higher cost of machinery. Similar conditions
must be faced by the white-collar worker, by
those on pensions and annuities and by
widows with small incomes, all of whom are
in no position to strike when the whim seizes
them.
To return to the situation facing the wheat,
fruit and dairy farmers, no forty-hour week
is possible for them if their products are
to reach the Canadian table daily, fresh and
wholesome. These men produce by working
long hours, seven days a week, often with
the help of their families and with no guarantee of financial return. As may be seen,
there are many hazards of weather and of
the human element between the sowing of
the crops and their reaping. Further, the
men who grow the grain and raise the cattle
for market are greater in number than the
railway workers; and these producers are
the railways' best customers and they are
responsible for a large portion of the railways' income.
In Winnipeg recently I talked with a man
whose twenty-year-old son gets $275 per
month as an engine-wiper and will shortly
get a job as a fireman at $325. Even the
boy's father felt that was too high a salary
for a twenty-year-old lad. In this connection I ask for the permission of the house
to quote from a Regina paper a statement
given to the press by the union leaders of
that city. It is as follows:
The striking unions' central committee made a
statement Friday morning protesting against the
"myth" that railway workers are highly paid.
Members said that occasionally workers do get large
cheques, but this cornes after long hours of overtime. They said the hourly wage scale for railway
employees ranges from 86 cents to $1.22, while
monthly rates range from $123 to $348.

The article continues with the following
statement, which I wish to emphasize.
"No doubt our modest income will appear large
to some people who are receiving lower incomes.
There is a tendency to be envious of the position of
railroaders, but it must never be forgotten that the
incomes we have attained have been the result of
long years of organization and struggle," they
explained.

SEPTEMBER 5. 1950
By this statement the union leaders admit
that the railway workers are receiving much
higher salaries than other classes of workers;
and they show a lack of interest for those
with smaller incomes who, by the way, pay
a substantial part of 'the larger incomes received by the railway workers. There is
no mysterious war by which these high pay
cheques are produced; they come out of the
pockets of all Canadians, especially modest
wage earners and farm workers. There are
some workers on the railway, such as track
maintenance men and freight handlers, who
are not receiving the pay they should receive;
others are getting salaries out of proportion
to other workers.
Another important point which I must
mention is that some of the railway workers
did not want to strike. The use of the secret
ballot should, therefore, be made compulsory
instead of the ballot used before this strike,
which required a voter to sign his name,
specify his job and his place of residence.
Surely this is not a democratic way of
voting.
As to the demand for higher pay, I would
point out that the men in the ranks during
the last war, and those who are now on their
way to Korea, are working for as low as $3
a day, and for them there is no forty-hour
week.
The demands of the military services wil
deplete the ranks of the workers. How are
we to produce arms and equipment for the
use of our fighting men, for your sons and
mine? The urgent need is that all work
longer hours for greater, not less, production;
that during the next few years we all have
less ease and comfort, not more.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Wood: The recent strike took place
at a time when the fate of the railways was
already hanging in the balance. On a recent
motor trip to the coast we passed a moving
van taking furniture from Regina to Vancouver, and on every highway we saw trucks,
each of which was taking seven motor cars
from Detroit to Seattle. Oil will soon flow
by pipe-line and water transport from Alberta
to the Atlantic coast, with a resultant loss of
revenue to the railways of about $50 million.
This condition, I understand, is due to the
inability of the railways to compete in the
matter of rates. If the railway rates continue to go up the time may not be far off
when the people of Canada will find other
means of transportation. The trans-Canada
highway is making rapid strides towards completion in Western Canada. It is already
evident that the trains in the West are carrying fewer passengers than they did formerly,
though hotels and motor camps are as full as

they ever were. After the boost in pay which
the railway workers were granted some time
ago, many small stations were obliged to
close. The same thing will happen again if
the railways are forced to increase their cost
of operation.
When the timè comes that the Canadian
people find a cheaper means of transporting
their durable goods from east to west, make
no mistake about it, the burden of operating
the railways will then fall upon the producers
of cattle, wheat, fruit and other raw products,
who have no choice of transportation. I
talked to one man in Regina who before the
strike sent a carload of material into Winnipeg every day by railway freight and who
when the strike came was forced to call in a
trucking company. He found that by truck
he could ship 19 per cent cheaper with one
day faster delivery than by rail.
In central Canada at the present time the
railways have not been able to raise their
rates because of the likelihood that they
would lose their best paying traffic to motor,
water and other forms of transportation. How
can the railways operate profitably on the
only traffic left to them, that of the wheat
grower and the -cattle producer, except by
raising the rates on these commodities? The
urgent need today is for railway leaders who
are men with a sound knowledge of
economics.
As for the Korean situation, I was very
pleased to see in the press that the Honourable
Brooke Claxton does not propose sending
our specially-trained airborne brigade group
to Korea, because they have been trained for
the special purpose of defending this country.
In Exercise Sweetbriar they received special
I most
training in Arctic conditions.
heartily agree with Mr. Claxton and members of the government on their stand in
connection with this airborne brigade. While
on the West Coast we have anti-aircraft
defence and radar, and fighting planes and
similar equipment down the Alaskan Highway and at Churchill, I do not think anyone
would suggest in this house that we are
properly protected from an invasion by air
throughout northwestern Canada and the
West Coast. It would seem very unlikely
to me that the Russians, if they decided to
invade this continent, would try to make a
landing on the West Coast or the far northern shores. If all reports in the papers are
correct, Russia has some 5,000 aircraft, 3,000
of which are bombers and transport planes.
Let us not forget that Hitler did not make a
frontal attack in France against the Maginot
Line. Behind the defence line in Western
Canada would be the prairies. We should
keep in mind that the distance from the
Behring Straits to Edmonton and Calgary-

SENATE
and perhaps we might even include Saskatoon-is little if at all greater than the
distance between Newfoundland and Great
Britain.
For our security I would suggest that the
government consider using part of our air
force as a defence measure in all the cities
in Western Canada, and that in Regina it
build a large enough air strip to accommodate bombing and large transport planes. The
facilities in Regina at the present time do
not make provision for this accommodation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I intend to ask permission to adjourn
the debate, but before doing so I should like
to make a few random remarks. If someone
wishes to continue the debate now I shall
gladly give way.
Some Hon. Senators: Proceed.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I was greatly interested
in the speech just delivered by the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). I agree with
many things he said. I agree with him more
than I do with either Mr. St. Laurent or the
leader in this house about some of our immediate problems, but I want to make a few
observations about points on which I do not
agree with the leader opposite. He spoke of
the high cost of living, and when I asked
him what his remedy was he had an answer
all pat; he said, "I don't have to answer".
Then my honourable friend proceeded to
indicate that he made a mistake one time in
the Manitoba Legislature by telling the government what they should do. He knew, and
they did not. They took his advice and the
province was saved a million dollars. I
gather that if he had to do it over again he
would not make that mistake, because while
it saved the province a million dollars the
government got the credit for what was done.
In the greatest crisis which now confronts us
in regard to the cost of living, my honourable
friends either knows what the remedy is or
he does not know. If he does not know, there
is no reason he should not be frank about it
and say so; but if he does know, in light of
all the suffering in this country and all the
economic problems that are arising, I challenge my honourable friend's statement that
he does not have to answer. To do so is a
duty that transcends any obligation that he
owes to his party. It is a duty and primary
obligation to the people of all Canada.
A similar situation arises in connection with
our immediate international problems and
the grave conditions that he described. Again
he said, "I am under no responsibility. It
is up to the government." I point out to my
honourable friend that as leader of the opposi-

tion he is paid by the Parliament of Canadaperhaps not a very large sum-for the services
which he renders so well and so competently.
But apart from that my honourable friend is
under the same responsibility that every one
of us is under, and in view of all the threats
that hang over us at this time, if he has even
the slightest idea of the proper solution, he
should proclaim it without the least hesitation
at this time.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I am
not quite sure that I followed what the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) said about threats from Russia,
because I was called out to answer a long
distance telephone call. But I did hear what
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) said, and I am in complete agreement
with him. To me it is inconceivable that the
two greatest nations of this world at this time
should continue to spend more than they can
afford and exhaust their resources to such a
degree as to threaten the standard of life in
order to arm themselves to the teeth. That
they should continue in this policy and that
at the same time the leaders of each country
should openly call the leaders of the other
every name they can lay their tongues to in
fighting language, and continue to stir up personal enmity in their people is, as I say, incomprehensible to me. I am sure we are all
conscious of a growing personal hatred against
the Russian people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, Hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: We cannot help it. Do you
not think that with all that is going on behind
the iron curtain there is an equal personal
hatred being built up against us among the
200 million people in that country? It is
beyond my comprehension that two countries
should continue to arm themselves, to hate
each other and carry on to the point where
ruination and bankruptcy is threatened, with
an incident happening here today and there
tomorrow, without eventually going to war.
I am somewhat disturbed by the number of
honourable gentlemen who hold the same
view today. But they did not have that
view soon enough. I do not like to say "I told
you so", because I do not know of anything
worse to say; bùt I remember that in a speech
which I delivered at the Convention of
Weekly Newspapermen in Harrison Hot
Springs, at the Vancouver Board of Trade, at
a Bar Convention at Bellingham, Washington,
and later in the Senate, I said that the only
security we had against Russia was the knowledge and possession of the atomic bomb. I
also said it was very essential that we come
to a proper understanding with Russia when

SEPTEMBER 5. 1950
that country did not; have the atomic bomb
and we had the sole possession of it. After
I delivered my speech in Vancouver I met a
friend in front of the Vancouver Club, and he
said to me, "I enjoyed your speech yesterday".
I replied-if 1 may be pardoned the language,
Mr. Speaker-"'Hell! I didn't want you to
enjoy that speech. It was made to scare you."
But it evidently did flot scare anybody.
Nobody paid any attention to me, so I quit
making speeches of that kind. I believed then,
as I believe now, that every day terrible
events are being shaped in definite form.

Why, I read in the papers only this morning
that a Russian plane carrying a Russian officer
was shot down in Korea. It seems to me that
the inevitable becomes more obvious ail the
time, and that the sooner we realize how
awful are the conditions threatening our
civilization the better it wiil be for us.
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Dupuis for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable
senators, after I returned to the hotel yesterday I gave some further thought to what my
honourable friend the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) had said earlier in the afternoon
in reply to my question. The reply which
my honourable friend made reminded me
of a story that I had heard.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought so.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I told it to some of my
honourable colleagues last evening, and they
said that I should tell it to the house.
Some Hon. Senator: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The reply which the
leader opposite gave to my question left the
complete implication that he knew the
answer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no! On a point of
order, I protest that I never said that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The honourable gentleman
did not say it, but that was the implication.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, I rise on a
point of privilege. If the gentleman will
quote my remarks in Hansard I will accept
that, but not otherwise.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
dealt with this matter yesterday. I say that
the implication which I drew from my
friend's answerHon. Mr. Haig: But my friend cannot give
implications; he must go to Hansard and
quote what I said.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I said that that was the
implication I took from it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You cannot do that. You
cannot draw an implication unless you quote
what you are referring to and then prove that
it is a natural implication to draw.
The Hon.

the

Speaker: I would ask the

honourable senator from Vancouver South

(Hon. Mr. Farris) to read over the words to
which he is referring.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My friend did not challenge this last night when it was red hot.
The reference is to be found in Hansard, in
the second column of page 30. The honourable leader opposite said:
It is not as important, perhaps, as the Korean
situation, but it is an every-day topic of conversation and is the anxious concern of every householder in this country. Yet the government offers
no solution for this problem.

My friend was speaking about the high cost
living. I then ventured the very simple
question, "What do you suggest?" and my
friend replied:
I expected that some distinguished gentleman
would ask me that question. My reply is that that
is one question which I do not have to answer,
because I am not responsible for government policy.

Then I ventured the observation:
An answer might be very useful to the country.

My friend did not then say, "Well, I have
no answer. I do not know". He had this
to say:
I am not a supporter of government policy. The
government got itself elected a year ago on a
promise that it would do a good job, and so on.
Now what is the government doing?

He went on to say what the government was
doing, and then, as my honourable friend
will recall, he said that he had once made a
mistake in Manitoba when he told the government what to do, and the government as a
result of taking his advice saved a million
dollars for the province. I gathered the
inference that he was not going to make that
mistake again.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, but I think that is a
fair inference.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, you cannot draw that
inference.
Hon. Mr. Farris: So I think that is sufficient
grounds for me to tell a story.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I object. I happen to know
the story, and I object to my honourable
friend drawing any such inference from
what I said.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I leave it to each honourable senator to form his own opinion about
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. You cannot make a
speech on that.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Oh, yes he can.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You cannot impute to me
a statement that I never made, and then tell
a joke of which I would be the butt.

SEPTEMBER 6, 1950
Hon. Mr. Farris: Either my honourable
friend has a solution to the problem or he
has not. I said this last night. If he does
not have a solution, it would be very simple
for him to say so.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I never said that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, of course you did not
say that, so the only alternative is that you
have a solution and are not going to give it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Hold on. To prove that
this was the position of my honourable friend,
I would point out that he said something to
the effect that he had been in this position
once before in Manitoba and was foolish
enough to tell the government what it should
do, and that his advice saved the province a
million dollars. Now he says "I am not going
to do that again". All I wish to say is that
one of these two situations must be the true
one.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You cannot do that. You
tried to do it yesterday and failed. Now you
are going to try to tell a story of which I
am the butt. I do not think it is right.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Let us hear the story.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Yes, the story will not
hurt.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I must object to the dignity
of this house being albused in that way.
The Hon. the Speaker: Until I have heard
the first words of the story I cannot judge it
or stop the story from being told.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, one
morning a professor of astronomy looked
over the pupils in his classroom and, noticing
that one boy was not very attentive, he said
to him, "Mr. Jones, can you tell me what
causes the aufora borealis?" The young man
rose, scratched his head, and replied "Well,
Professor, I did know the answer to that
question, but I have forgotten it". Then the
professor made this comment: "What a
tragedy! The only man in the world who
knew what causes the aurora borealis has
forgotten it".
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Now, if my honourable
friend opposite does know the answer to this
other question-I put it hypothetically; I do
not say that he does know-if he does know
the answer, it is a great tragedy for this
country that he will not tell us what the
answer is.
I am sure that the story I told is a harmless one, and my honourable friend sees now

that he was needlessly alarmed. I do not
know what story he thought I was going to
tell.
An Hon. Senator: Let him tell it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
will say no more on the subject of the high
cost of living or on the Korean situation.
These matters are of very grave importance
to this country, but I feel that there are
others here who can speak on them with
more authority and better than I. Besides,
the questions are so comprehensive that there
really is not time in one speech to discuss
them thoroughly.
So I propose to ask honourable senators to
consider with me some of the problems having to do with that other matter which parliament was assembled to deal with, namely, the
recent railway strike. On my notes I have
indicated that a number of congratulations
should be extended. The first of these, of
course, should go to the mover (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Barbour)
of the Address in reply to the speech from
the Throne. I have not yet had a chance to
read the translation into English of the
mover's speech, but I agree with other English-speaking senators who have expressed
the utmost confidence that that speech will
be of the high standard which always characterizes the remarks of the honourable
senator from Rigaud in this house. The
seconder, my honourable friend from Prince
Edward Island, spoke in homely fashion. I
use that term in its best and proper sense.
His was the speech of a man from a province
whose inhabitants probably enjoy life more
than any other people in the world. And they
do that, not by trying to find reasons for working less, but by honest tillage of the soil
and other productive work. Their inspiration, satisfaction and other rewards come
from work well done.
The parliament of Canada is to be congratulated upon the prompt and effective
action that it took to stop the strike. The
government also is to be congratulated,
because of its display of good sense and the
firm moderation with which it gave a lead
to the members of parliament. And, finally,
the opposition leaders are to be congratulated
upon their co-operation in expediting proceedings dealing with the strike. So far as
I know, the speed with which the legislation
was passed and the strike brought to an end
established a parliamentary record. I am
sure that the action taken in the first two
days of this session has raised the respect of
the people for the Canadian parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SEPTEMBER
instance, has no relation to him. When I first
became a member of the Senate I wrote a
letter to my old friend the late Ian mackenzie,
criticizing some action he had taken regarding
labour matters. Taking the liberty of friendship, I wrote him with the consciousness I
suppose, that I was a new senator. In that
letter I laid down the things that I thought
ought to be done, and I received the following
reply: "Your letter most interesting. Please
remember you are in the Senate and I am
in the House of Commons". The point is
obvious. He was not disagreeing with ail, or
perhaps with anything, I said, but he was
conscious of the limitations upon a minister
in the House of Commons. We have often
been told that one of the principal reasons
why the Senate was set up was to protect
minorities. I would subrmit to .you, gentlemen, that the Senate also exists for the
protection of majorities against the power
of minorities.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think that is one of the
great duties we have. I have talked to many of
my friends about speaking on this question,
and they have said to me "Why not let sleeping dogs lie?" That may be the part of
wisdom, but I am not at all sure that it is
the part of duty at this time. I feel that a
sense of obligation rests upon us, to state
frankly, and without fear or hesitation, our
views on this question. I am not suggesting
that this session is the time to legislate. I
fully appreciate the fact that legislation
ahead of public opinion is harmful, not beneficial. We have all seen evidence of that in
the matter of prohibition. I do not think
there is any doubt in the world that prohibition effectively and completely enforced
would be a good thing; but I happened to be
an attorney-general at a time when the people
were all in favour of enforcing it against
somebody else, but equally in favour of trying
to get a drink for themselves. I know how
impossible it was to make it work. I once
said that if there was ever another plebiscite
on prohibition in British Columbia, the people
should be asked: "(1) Are you in favour of
prohibition? (2) Will you pledge yourself
individually to abide by the law if it is
passed?" If the plebiscite were based on those
questions there would be no danger of the
prohibition vote ever carrying.
So I am not now discussing this question
with the idea of having a law introduced
immediately for action at this session of
parliament; but I believe that now is the time
to start thoughtful consideration of what
must sooner or later be done in this country.
We must see to it that the public are properly
educated and, in due course, arrive at a
69266-5

proper conclusion. My honourable friend, the
leader opposite, (Hon. Mr. Haig) said yesterday that he thought it well at this time to
leave this question alone. There are reasons
why that may be so; but my judgment leads
me to overrule that objection and come to a
contrary conclusion: I have stated that the
warning for the future comes from what has
happened in the past-a group of respected
men in the community, led by responsible
leaders, going out on what I think was an
unjustifiable strike.
I am going to ask honourable senators to
give me their consideration while I enumerate the reasons why I think the strike was
not justified; not why the claims of the railway workers should not have been made,
but why the drastic action of a strike should
not have been taken when it was.
There were two points directly at issue.
The first was a demand for an increase in
wages of 7 cents an hour. There was one
group that wanted an increase of 10 cents an
hour, but I shall confine myself mostly to
discussing the 7 cents an hour increase. The
second essential point at issue was the demand
that after the 7 cents an hour increase had
been granted, the working hours of the men
should be reduced from 48 hours a week to
40 hours a week, with 48 hours pay.
In this connection there has been a lot
said about the high cost of living, which is
something everybody knows exists. I want to
stress, however, that there would have been
no controversy if the men had confined themselves to the need of increased wages in
order to meet the present high cost of living.
This is a very important point, because the
two questions are so interwoven in the arguments that you cannot tell when one is being
talked about and when the other. I read in
this morning's edition of the Toronto Globe
and Mail that the operative branch of the railways is now conferring with the railway
officials, demanding a very substantial increase
in wages without any reduction in hours of
work. I say that if those men who went on
strike had been concerned only with an
increase of 7 cents an hour, they would have
got it and there would have been no controversy and no Strike. The record is clear
as to that. It equally follows that if wage
increases alone had been considered there
would have been no controversy. The railroads would have granted them at once.
Confined to the wage issue, the question of
the high cost of living does not appear at
all. If the 40-hour week has any relation to
the high cost of living it would work the
other way around. We had a lesson in what
the honourable gentleman from Prince (Hon.

SENATE

Mr. Barbour) and the honourable gentleman
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood) said recently in
this chamber about the high cost of living.
They said that the number of working hours
have no relation to this question of the high
cost of living, unless it be that the more
hours you work the quicker you eliminate
the problem.
It is my understanding that a 48-hour week
has been in existence for a long time, and as
far as I know there has never been a shorter
working week. There is no doubt that relief
would have been granted at once had the men
proved that in addition to the wage increase
they must have a reduction in hours, because
under present working conditions they cannot preserve their health while putting in a
48-hour week. But I have never heard of a
suggestion of that kind. Naturally a 40-hour
week would be most desirable if you could
get it on the basis of being paid for 48 hours;
but I suggest that there is no condition of
desperation, oppression or threat to the health
of the men to make it mandatory at this
critical time for them to demand and receive
a 40-hour week. I say that that is not in the
picture, and in my submission such a claim
at the present time does not justify the imposition of the tremendous increase in cost that
would fall upon the railways. I understand
that the increase in wages would amount to
$80 million a year. I understand that the
Department of Labour has made a computation which shows the amount to be not much
less than that.
Now, we are not unaware of the facts. The
revenues and expenditures of the railways
have been given in evidence before the Transport Board, and we know that the companies
are not making money on their operations at
the present time. It is common knowledge
that every dollar of increased cost imposed
upon them as a result of concessions made in
this dispute must come out of the people in the
form of higher freight rates. In this connection it is well to bear in mind the thoughtful
and accurate remarks made yesterday by my
honourable friend from Regina (Hon. Mr.
Wood). It is really possible to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg. There is a very
serious danger now facing both railway companies and the people-for the people have
a heavy investment in one of the roads-it is
the possible inability of the companies to meet
the threat to their existence from other forms
of transportation. It may very well be that
farmers on the prairies as well as other producers will find it impossible to pay the
increased freight rates resulting from the concessions forced upon the railways, and that
consequential curtailment of railway operations might end in the concessions reacting

against the men themselves. I say, honoui
able senators, that the men would not have
needed to strike in support of their demand
for increased wages if that demand had not
been associated with one for a shorter working week. That concludes what I have to say
on the first reason why the strike was not
justified.
The second reason is that the decision to
strike was a repudiation of the conciliation
board's findings. Mr. Hall appeared before
the boards as representative of most of the
unions concerned. The chairman of both
boards was Mr. Justice Wilson of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia, and in
the report he made on one case he was supported by another member of that board, Mr.
Isaac Pitblado. A minority report was made
by the third member, a lawyer-no doubt a
man of distinction-whom I do not know.
I do know Mr. Justice Wilson and Mr. Isaac
Pitblado. Mr. Justice Wilson is regarded as
one of the most brilliant men who have ever
sat on our Supreme Court in British Columbia.
He is not a product of what is commonly
called the capitalist group. The son of a
lawyer who became a county court judge, he
grew up in the atmosphere of a small railway
town in the interior of the province. After
practising law for some years he himself was
also appointed to the County Court Bench,
and so outstanding was his work there that
the federal government took the unusual
course of promoting him to the Supreme
Court. From my knowledge of him I am
sure that as Chairman of the conciliation
board he dealt honestly, impartially and in a
spirit of fairness with all the matters brought
before him. This would be the opinion of
everyone who knows him. I have already
named one of the other members of the board,
that noble old gentleman Isaac Pitblado. It
is true that he is counsel for the Canadian
Pacific Railway, but I cannot conceive that
anyone of his wide experience, honesty and
fairness would ever put his name to a report
that he did not conscientiously believe to be
right and fair to the men as well as to the
companies.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Mr. Justice Wilson was
also Chairman of the other conciliation board,
in whose majority report he was supported
by Mr. Meighen. I have not met Mr. Meighen,
but many of us here had the great privilege
of knowing his father when he was leader
of the opposition in this house. The majority
report of both boards was in favour of an
increase in wages of about 6 per cent and a
44-hour week.
So little reference has been made to what
Mr. Justice Wilson said in both boards' report

SEPTEMBER 6. 1950
that I think it would be well to call attention
to a paragraph or two. I will read first from
page 17 of the printed report, where, after a
careful analysis of the wages question, he
says this:

said in their broadcasts and in the strike
ballot. Mr. Justice Wilson, at the bottom of
page 24 of the report, said this:

In making these comparisons it must be remembered that the incidental advantages enjoyed by
railworkers are generally greater than those granted
to other Canadian workers. Records show that the
continuity of employment in the railroad industry is
relatively high, which must have the effect of
increasing average annual earnings. The employees
have the benefit of pension plans. They and their
families are entitled to a considerable measure of
free transportation. Certain employees are given
free housing and other free uniforms. In the aggregate these factors add considerably to the advantage
of railway employment.

That point should be kept in mind, honourable senators, because the impression has
gone out that the railway men were striking
for the normal work week in the majority
of industries in Canada. Mr. Justice Wilson
and Mr. Isaac Pitblado may be wrong in
their conclusions, but I do not think they are
wrong in their findings of fact on the evidence before then.
The report continues:

He then refers to wages paid to other groups
of workers, and at the bottom of page 17
makes this comment:

On the contrary, the evidence before the board
indicates that the 40-hour week is very rare in
Canadian industry.
Man Hours and Hourly Earnings for December,
1949 (already referred to) shows that out of some
71 listings, which include both groups of industries
and separate industries, there are only three industries in which the work week is 40 hours or less.
These are automobile manufacturing (40 hours),
shoe manufacturing (39.3), and highway construction
(38-9). The number of workers in these three industries constitutes a very small proportion of the total
number of Canadian workers.
The board has not the facilities for working out,
from the figures quoted, the weighted average of
weekly work hours for all Canada, but a superficial
examination of the figures indicates that the average
work week is much nearer to 44 than to 40 hours,
and that a large number of Canadians work over
44 hours per week.

Consideration of the wages earned by these, the
largest groups of Canadian workers, convinces this
board that the proposals of the railworkers are unreasonable. To accept them must result in giving
an unmerited preference to rail workers over all
other Canadian workers. The continuance of such
an advantage would be unfair to other workers.
The inevitable result of such a great increase in rail
wage scales must be attempts by other groups to
achieve new standards.
The disparities to be
corrected would be so great that their rectification
would result in an entirely new wage scale for the
whole country.

I have not had the time or opportunity to
study all the evidence presented before the
boards, but I must say that I am greatly
impressed by these remarks by a man whom
I know to be as fair and competent as is Mr.
Justice Wilson.
He then takes up the question of hours of
work and compares conditions in Canada
with those in the United States. I will not
read his findings under this head, but will
simply indicate that they may be found at
page 23 of the report.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is the honourable gentleman able to give me, for my own information,
a comparison between the United States and
Canada as to hours of work? That became an
issue in my part of the country.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not wish to take up
time by reading the comparative figures.
They are given on page 23 of the report.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Mr. Justice Wilson discusses them at some length. Undoubtedly in
the United States the hours of work are more
favourable to the men than in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I wanted to
know.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I come then to Jie part
which I want to read, and which is important
in the light of what Mr. Hall and lM1r. Mosher
69266-5j

The 40-hour week is not in Canada, as it is in the.
United States, the normal work week.

Mr. Justice Wilson goes on to point out that,
The inherent nature of the railroad industry
makes the institution of a shortened work week
more difficult and expensive than it is in most other
industries.

As a conclusion, he says:
The board thinks that a fair solution of the problem before it is the institution of a forty-four hour
work week on Canadian railways for non-operating
employees, except those engaged in water transport
and those hotel employees who are included in the
terms of reference to this board, on the plan hereinafter set forth.

So, honourable senators, as far as the
issue regarding wages was concerned, the
companies were prepared to meet the demands in full. On the question of reduction
of hours of work, this board, after examining
all the circumstances and with a full appreciation of the problems the railways were
up against, gave a full report as I have
indicated. My honourable friend from Regina
(Hon. Mr. Wood) described yesterday not
only the problem of the railways and the
shippers, bot the danger threatening the
workers themselves-that they might kill the
goose that laid the golden egg. Those matters
were all set forth in the report of the board.

SEPTEMBER 6, 1950

House of Commnons will be founci the Hon. Mr.
Gregg's statement of what were the final
terins of the officers of the railway compa nies
an.d the final demands of the men, and the
latter were very far from the grounds which
were subm-itted as authorizing this strike vote.
At that timo it was nlot a 6 per cent offer
from the company but a 4 per cent wage
increase.
Ho-i. Mr. Bouffard: Four cents.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Did I say five?
Hon. Mr. Bouff ard: You said 4 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Farris: A wage increase of 4
cents per hour to become effective September
1, 1950, and a five-day forty-hour week, with
pay for 48 hours, to become effective October
1, 1951. This is a complete surrender of the
principle of a 40-hour week, as demandod by
the mon. Thesoe men for years have been workinýg a 48-hour week, and there bas beon no
suggestion that îheir health has been affected.
This offer of a 40-hour week was not to take
effect for another year, and there is the
requirement of a threo-year contract with an
escalator clause of tvWo-thirds a cent wage
increase for each one point in the rise of the
cost of living. Against this the men stili
dernanded a five cent increase and a five-day
forty-hour week wilh pay for 48 hours, to
bocome effective September 1, 1951, and a
two-year contra-cl'. And there was a controversy as to a delay of nine months before
the matter became too arbitrarily imposod
upon thern. The railwaymen of Canada nover
had an opportunity to vote on that. The only
thing tbis strike vote last May or June did
was to get the mon to sigan a blank choque
to the effect that unless thoy got everything
thoy wanted, or decided they ought to have,
tbey would be authorized to striko. I say that
is ail wrong. It neyer iustified a srnall group
of mon undor two leaders-and without the
members of the unions ever knowing anything about the torms-throwing this country
into chaos.
in the ilext place, I submit that this striko
was not iustified becauze the issue had been
narrowed down to such an extent that the
principles the mon had strivon for wero so
completely acknowledgod that I can -conceive
of nothing, oxcept an undue sense of power
and a consciousness of the might they had
within them, that would explain how in these
circumstances we were brought bore to deal
with an emergency createcl by the decision of
tbis group.
In the next place, this strike was nlot justified by making Donald Gordon the scapegoat.
Somne Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Ferris: 1 have read the nowspapors rnd looked everywhore to find out

just what the complaints are against him. It
bas been claimod that Mr. Gordon came right
out in the first place and made a "final" offor.
Nowhero have I been able to find that these
mon ever charged Donald Gordon with not
acting in good faitb. Nor can I find that ho
ever misstated the facts, or misled or doublecrossed the mon, or did anything oxcept talk
to them straight frorn the shouldor. 1 can
understand some honourable sonators saying
"Well, we think if Gordon had only pussyfooted or soothod them down a littie more.
tbey might have carried on".
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Who said that?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am saying that that
rnight be argued. Do not think I am saying it.
It bas been said that Mr. Gordon made a
"final" offer when, in fact, it was flot; really
a final off or. I have no doubt that Mr.
Gordon's first off or was made conscientiously
and honostly after ho bad received the full
advice of bis statisticians, and that hoe
believed ho was making the bost offer the
railroads could stand. When ho made furthor
concessions later ho was only acting with the
consciousness of the impending disas'er and
flot because ho foît that these concessions
woro justified. Ho was faced by two evils,
the lesser one being to sur:ender more than
the railroads could pay in order to avoid
disaster. It bas also been said that ho wvas
not conciliatory in his manner and told the
mon that if they went on strike thoy would
ho sorry. Well, I hope they are sorry.
Ho is also accused of having broken off
negotiations. I bave here a newspaper clipping of a statement by Mr. Mathor, the prosidont of the CPR. I do not suppose Mr. Mathor
has any inclination to hold a brief for the
prosident of the company that is making it
as tough as possible for the CPR; but I think
bis statement should ho fully recorded in our
Hanscrd. Horo is what Mr. Mather had to
say.
The statement attributed to, Mr. M. J. Coldwell
by press dispatchos to the effect that Mr. Gordon
had abruptly brought strike negotiations to an end
is untrue and can only bc attributable to a onesided account of the negotiations given to Mr. Coldwell by representatîves of the unions. Nothing was
said by Mr. Gordon on that occasion or any other
that was not the resuit of careful consideration by
the railway representatives jointly in what was their
common problem. The fact is that. at the conclusion
of the meeting on <last) Saturday afternoon, an
adjourniment was taken until 7.30 Saturday night
in order that both parties should have an opportunity of reconsiderlng their stand on a questioný
of auch great public importance.

Now, honourable sonators, listen to this:
When the conference was resumed Saturday
evening the represeiitatives of the men again said
that their position was unchanged and it was
because of this stand that negotiations were discontinued.

SENATE
Let us examine the matter a little more
closely. What did the representatives of the
men mean by saying afterwards that if the
negotiations had continued a little longer a
settlement might have been reached? Are
they implying that the government would
have "turned the heat" on Mr. Gordon and
forced him to make further concessions than
he thought should be made? They have no
right to suggest any such thing. Mr. Gordon's
action proves that once he had come to a final
decision he could not be argued out of it. On
the other hand, do they mean to imply that
if Mr. Gordon had waited a little longer they
might have changed their minds? The men
can only mean one or other of these things.
Do the union leaders want the public to
believe they might have backed down a little
from their demands if Mr. Gordon had played
with them for another hour or so? These men
are not children. There was nothing to prevent them from saying, "Mr. Gordon, although
we have already conceded as much as we
thought was possible, we feel that the negotiations had better not be broken off yet, for we
have something else to suggest." If that was
what they had in their minds, why did they
not say so? But if they had no intention of
conceding anything further, what was the use
of palavering two or three hours more?
This charge that the negotiations were
broken off too soon does not make sense, and
I think that one of the most unfortunate
occurrences in recent days was the complaint
made by the leader of the CCF against Mr.
Gordon. Through that complaint, which was
based on an inaccurate ex parte statement, an
attempt was made to destroy the usefulness
of Mr. Gordon as president of our great publically owned railway. Honourable senators,
you and I all know Donald Gordon. We saw
him at work here during the critical days of
the war. He brought into the fight for Canada
an intelligent grasp of economic conditions, a
vigour and a conscientiousness unexcelled
by those of any man in Canada or the
United States. I express my tribute to Arthur
Smith, an honourable member of another
place, a lawyer from Calgary, a Conservative,
and a gentleman with a strong sense of fair
play, who deplored attacks made on a man in
a forum where he was unable to answer.
Another honourable gentleman whom I wish
to mention is Mr. Gillis, from Cape Breton. I
have never had the honour of meeting him,
but time and again I have been impressed by
his speeches. Of course I disagree entirely
with his political views, but I regard him as
one of the brainy members of the House of
Commons, and I am glad to see that in this

issue he was not carried away by the prejudice exhibited by his leader. A newspaper
report before me states:
Clarie Gillis (CCF-Cape Breton South) saic he
was disappointed in Mr. Gordon if reports of his
conduct were true,-

He did not say they were true.
-but he suspected that the whole story might not
be known.

Of course the whole story was not known.
Mr. Gordon, a government appointee, could
not tell the story; but fortunately it has been
told by an impartial observer, a man of high
standing and great responsibility, the President of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Mr. W.
A. Mather. I believe that everyone here who
knows him and who knows Donald Gordon is
convinced beyond doubt that in the negotiations with the union leaders Donald Gordon
acted, as his conscience and intellect directed
him, solely in the interests of the Canadian
people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I was pleased by the Prime
Minister's statement that the government had
complete confidence in Mr. Gordon. ArQd notwithstanding the unfair attacks that have been
made, I am sure that Mr. Gordon will continue to serve the Canadian National Railways
system and its employees-for in the last
analysis the interest of the system and the
workers are identical.
I wish now to quote from a report that
appeared in the Ottawa Citizen a day or so
ago. It refers to a charge made by the
Allied Trades and Labour Association-in
Ottawa, I take it. The report says:
The association charged there might never have
been a nation-wide tie-up of the railways, had Mr.
Gordon's attitude during negotiations been marked
by the friendly spirit essential to dealings with such
an issue.

I submit to honourable senators that that
is not a reflection on Donald Gordon, but
that it is a strong reflection on the labour
leaders themselves. For surely it is a terrible
thing to suggest that they threw this country
into chaos, not because there was a real dispute but because they did not like the way
Donald Gordon handled negotiations! Are
we to believe that these men are as temperamental as prima donnas, who would so resent
any suspected slighting of themselves as to
have no regard for the consequences of any
retaliatory action they might take?
I am sorry to have spoken so long.
Some Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Farris: You will be glad to know
that I have come to the last of my collection
of reasons why the strike was not justified.

SEPTEMBER 6, 1950
I say, finally, that the union representatives
were wrong in not acceding to the Prime
Minister's request for a thirty-day postponement in order to permit negotiations to be
continued.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the best reason of
all.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No matter how you look
at it, you cannot get away from this point.
It is all very well to say that the government was lax in its handling of the situation.
Maybe it was, for no one is perfect. But the
Prime Minister of Canada, fully conscious of
his responsibilities and realizing what serious
consequences a strike might entail, asked the
leaders to allow negotiations to continue for
a further thirty days. And mark you, honourable senators, not since last May or June
had there been any mandate for a strike
from the men represented by these leaders.
In the meantime the situation had changed.
Many things might happen in a thirty-day
period. I say that under all the circumstances, and with the narrowing of the field
of dispute between the parties, the men who
refused to comply with the request of the
Prime Minister were not justified in doing
so. I point out that I am not making an
attack against the men for what has been
done; I am making this argument in relation
to what I have already laid down as the
premise to the discussion. I repeat: this
strike in the circumstances, and against the
Canadian people, was not justified, and the
fact that it was carried out by a group of
men as good as these men were, necessitates
consideration of protection against what may
happen in the future.
Honourable senators, I notice by a news
item in today's Globe and Mail that the running trades on the railways are now making
demands on the companies. This item reads
in part:
A demand for a blanket wage increase of 30 cents
an hour for 35,000 running trades employees of
Canada's railways will be served on the Canadian
Pacific Railway in union-management negotiations
opening here today.

There is no direct threat of strike accompanying the demand, but the power to strike
is there. The time has come when the people
of Canada must give thought to the morrow,
and the proper method by which fair treatment may be received by all parties-industry, employers, employees-and above all to
the public.
I come now, honourable senators, to my
suggested remedies, and I wish to take a
constructive look at the future. I say that
the government has got to do something positive, perhaps not in this session, but in the

next session. First, while we are, as it were,
hobbling along over the detour, consideration
should be given to the use of a secret strike
ballot, as emphasized yesterday by my honourable friend from Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood).
I can speak with some authority on the
matter of a secret strike ballot, because we
have it in the province of British Columbia.
Before the last election in that province many
labour leaders made violent attacks against
the government for its proposals in this
respect, but the results of the election justified-if anything can be justified by election
results-the wisdom of the government in
its labour legislation. It was returned with
a much greater majority than it previously
had.
Before amplifying my argument on this
point I would ask the question: Why should
labour leaders oppose the use of a secret strike
ballot? The only reason I have heard was
that it was a reflection on the good faith and
integrity of the unions. Well, honourable
senators, this is not an elective house, but
many of us went through elections before we
came here, and we know what happens. I
remember that when I was a boy in New
Brunswick we had the open ballot. Perhaps
I should not tel some of the things I know
about that happened there. But honourable
senators know well that we have provided
a secret ballot in elections for the protection
of the country, but primarily for the protection of the voters. Surely no one would
say that it was not a protection to an honest
working man to be just as free to declare his
opinion on strike action as on his choice for
a member of a legislature or for the Parliament of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Not only does British
Columbia use a secret ballot, as provided
for under section 75 of our Industrial Disputes
and Conciliation Act, but the vote is supervised by officials from the department. This
system works very well. Why should it not
work well? What right has any leader of
labour to object to securing a fair vote on the
attitude of labour.
The next thing that I think the government should do immediately, by way of putting a few more planks on the detour, is
to see that the final ballot on a strike shall be
on the issues at the time of the strike. In the
present case the strike vote should not have
been taken on the issues as of last May or
June, but upon those of the latter part of
August, when much better offers had been
made to the men.

SENATE
My third suggestion is that the strike ballot
should not have contained an ex parte argument by the labour leaders, based on inadequate information. I do not wish to charge
that the present ballot contains any misinformation, but il does not give the full information that ought to have been placed before
the men. My suggestion is that before a strike
ballot is sent out it should be submitted to the
Deoartment of Labour, and if in future we
have a labour court, it should be placed before
that body. Upon receipt of the ballot, the
department should at once call in the other
parties to the dispute to inquire whether the
ballot sets forth all the facts of the case. In
the end, the ballot should be passed upon by
the Department of Labour, instead of by one
party to the issue.
I would not venture to say, honourable
senators, what would have happened if at the
end of August labour had had a further
opportunity of voting on this question, with
all the facts before them.
I have before me a telegram from the
Saskatchewan Employers' Association, directed
to the Prime Minister. I presume all honourable senators received a copy of it.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The telegram
part as follows:

rcads in

The text of the ballot should be made public and
the rcsults published by districts. Such legislation
would take no privilege away from anyone, but
would give to workers the democrat'c right to
express their truc opinions without fear of intimidation frcm union oflicers and organizers.

This association further says:
We believe that the strike would not have taken
place had there been a secret ballot.

I do not know that that is so, but in looking
to the future it is a fair supposition that the
secret ballot would lessen the danger of
strikes based on inadequate information or
apprehension of what might take place.
I thsink, honourable senators, that these
stops should
be taken immediately to
strengthen
the
temporary
structure-the
detour, if you will; but let us look to the
future for a more permanent structure to
take ils place.
First, I do not think we should adopt any
such p:ocedure as that used in the United
States. Canada has no public officer comparable to the President. We have the Prime
Minister, but he is not commander of the
Canadian forces, and even if he were, I am
sure that no one would want to bring the
administration of our railways, under strike
conditions, into the hands of an officer corresponding to the President of the United
States, who is also Commander in Chief of
the armed forces.

Hon. Mr. Gouin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Furthermore, we would
not want to drag wage disputes into the political arena, if it could be avoided.
Secondly, I cannot see how the appointment
of an administrator would solve the problem.
One newspaper referred to such a person as
a "czar". Whether or not that is a proper
deflinition for him would depend on the
powers given to him. Let us try to visualize
the results of railway operations under an
administrator. What would he administer?
Would he run the railways? Such a person
would be under political pressure at all
times, and if he were acting with authority
it would be resented by the men. It seems to
me to be an utterly impracticable solution
for any permanent results in this country.
Just by way of illustration, let us look at
the attacks made on Donald Gordon. Is it
not significant that there was very little
attack on Mr. Mather? The answer is that
Mr. Mather is not a political appointee. A
political appointment is the place to strike
because politicians are more vulnerable than
private ci.izens who run private corporations.
My opinion, which is given with hesitation
and is subject to review' and revision by
nyself, is that this question, like all other
disputes in our country, should be settled by
the law, andministered on the principles of
justice as we pride ourselves in having them
in this country. I believe that a new court
shculd be established. I do not like arbitratLons which are set un for each occasion.
Someirns they are all right and sometimes
they are not. I believe thore ought to bo a
permanent labour court. Everybody knows
the effect of making men judges and giving
them appointients until they have reached a
certain fixed age. An esprit de corps is built
up among them. We have all known partisan
politicians who, when appointed to the
Bench, have risen above their antecedent
experiences and have become fine judges with
a full consciousness of their responsibility to
the state. I would make an outstanding lawyer
the chairman of such a court. I am not trying
to establish a position for any lawyer, because
any man possessing the outs t anding abilities
necessary to handle the job would probably
be making a sacrifice in accepting the
appointment.
Experienced
lawyers
are
trained in procedure, in the powers of
analysis, and in getting the viewpoints of
others. That is the whole basis of the legal
profession. I have never yet seen a lawyer
who was capable of giving good counsel who
was unable to obtain the viewpoint and to
understand both sides of a question. That is
a lawyer's training, and that is the kind of
man I would like to sec as chairman of such

SEPTEMBER S. 1950

a court. I would pay him an adequate
salary and not the paltry pittance now given
our Superior Court judges. There should be
no question of cost. The- cost of running
this court for several generations would be
trifling compared with the millions of dollars
lost in the nine day railway strike-millions
lost in earnings to the railway workers themselves, to men across Canada who became
temporarily unemployed, the cost to industry
and the black eye received by our tourist
trade. The other two men on the court would
not have to be lawyers, but men of high
standing and experience in social and labour
questions. I am thinking of a man like Mr.
MacNamara.
And what a magnificent
appointment the late Minister of Labour
would have made!
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: At oge time I was thinking of college professors, but I came to the
conclusion that they would not be acceptable
unless they had a wide experience outside of
their own profession. Three men might constitute a court, but you could have a fourth.
I am only suggesting, of course, what could
be done.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Would my honourable
friend suggest how he would enforce the
decisions of that court?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would enforce them in
the same way that any other court decisions
are enforced. I can understand my honourable friend thinking "Well, perhaps you
could not do it today". That is one reason
I say this subject must receive the backing
of public opinion. I was greatly impressed
with what Mr. St. Laurent said in the House
about enforcement of the temporary enactments. He said in effect that in the last
analysis you cannot enforce it by the power
of the State unless the power of the State is
supported by public opinion.
I am glad that my honourable friend from
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) brought this
point to my attention.
I have had the
honour of being asked to speak at the joint
meeting of the Canadian-American Bar Association in Washington this month, and I
propose to discuss the question of the
administration of justice, and to suggest that
when this immediate crisis of war is over
and we are back to normal conditions-which
I hope may happen soon-the permanent
solution ought to be along the lines of an
international court with full jurisdiction to
deal with the problems of all nations. It
would be just as impossible as anything in
the world to establish such a court today,
69266-6

but I have the faith and the hope to believe
that some day it will be established. If I
propose this to these lawyers, I am wondering if somebody will say "What a foolish
thing for you so suggest when you cannot
even enforce a labour regulation in Canada
by a court that has a mandate for that
purpose".
Honourable members, we must put our
own house in order before we can ever
hope to successfully achieve the same results
in a wider and international field. I say to my
honourable friend from La Salle that if
you set up the very best court you can in this
land and secure responsible, fair, impartial
and competent men as your judges, and their
decisions, having the sanction of the nation,
are not accepted by labour, then this country
is in a hopeless condition. But I for one
do not believe that. I think the average
working man is just as anxious as is industry
to have a fair adjudication of any problem
that comes. up. I believe that when this
question is properly put to the people of
Canada, and when they have thought about
it as respects the past and the future, they
will give their support to it.
This labour relations court should not be
hampered by any undue rules. Its judgment
should be final and binding on all parties, and
enforceable by the supreme power of the
State the same as is any other judgment. As
I say, I would not hamper the court by laying
down limits as to its authority, any more than
parliament has done in its handling of the
present strike. All it has done is to say that
if the dispute is not settled within a certain
time an arbitrator will be appointed. The
arbitrator will decide, through his own conception of justice and fair play, the right
treatment to all parties concerned. You cannot lay down a finer or higher test of the
administration of justice than that.
Honourable Senators, I have taken a lot
of your time, and perhaps I have made statements that may be criticized as being unfair
to labour. I did not intend them to be interpreted in that way. My only reason for
making this speech was that this question
is of such great importance that I wanted to
point out the dangers in the future as indicated by the realities of the past. I would
ask honourable senators to give this question
their most serious consideration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Dupuis for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate I want at
the outset to congratulate the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) upon the excellent speech he made
yesterday.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I believe his speech outlined the railway strike as no other speech
in parliament has done. My honourable friend
made certain proposals to the government as
to what he thinks should be done as soon as
possible to remedy such situations in the
future. I have one comment to make about
his proposal with regard to the secret ballot. I think it was a very timely suggestion,
and one that should be put into effect, if for
no other reason than to protect the ordinary
union worker. I make that statement as one
of the two senators here who have served
in the industrial field for many years and
who still hold union cards. I know what
meýhods of intimidation can be used, and
have been used, against certain union workers when they openly voiced objection to
what their union leaders wanted. It is all
very well to say that these ballots went to
headquarters and not to the locals, but the
locals have a way of finding out things.
Information leaks back, and those who vote
against handing over control or the say-so
to union leaders often find themselves intimidated by fellow-workmen who in many
instances may themselves be looking for some
kind of promotion. So I hold that if for no
other reason than in the best interests of the
ordinary worker belonging to a union there
should be the democratic right to cast a vote
secretly in any labour dispute, as there now is
in municipal, provincial and federal elections.
I repeat that the rights of the ordinary
worker should be fully protected by the
secret ballot.

May I say that while in my opinion the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) made an excellent presentation and offered some very valuable suggestions, he dealt with only one aspect of the
railway problem.
I feel that honourable
senators will agree with me that our great
railway problem is still unsolved. As I see it,
the recent strike will have the effect of
accentuating some of the difficulties now facing the railway. Anyone who has given
even cursory study to the situation will, I
think, agree that one of the principal causes
of trouble lies in the fact that although the
companies spend large sums for the improvement of passenger service the revenue they
receive from passenger traffic is relatively
sm.all and still dwindling. Further, competition from planes, trucks and buses-which
latter competition will be increased after the
Trans-Canada Highway is built-will bring
about even more restricted revenues for the
railways.
Anyone who has travelled across the continent knows that at times many coaches are
empty, and that by no means all the passengers in coaches are paying their fare.
In a coach in which I was travelling recently
there were eighteen of what in railway
parlance are termed dead-heads. That is,
there were two members of parliament with
their passes, and sixteen other passengers,
all of whom had passes. Under conditions
like that and faced with a decrease in farepaying passengers, how can the railways
carry on? As to freight, many business firms
found out during the strike that they could
ship more economically by truck than by
rail. And with the building of pipelines to
carry oil east and west from the Prairie
Provinces, the railways will suffer another
severe loss of revenue.
So, honourable senators, I contend that
the railway situation is one of the serious
problems confronting parliament. It is my
hope that a special standing committee of
this chamber will be set up to study the whole
matter, and that out of its deliberations some
means of helping the railways will emerge.
I am not going to deal with the criticism
that we have heard of Donald Gordon, nor
with the praise of Mr. Gordon that was
expressed yesterday by the senator from
Vancouver South. I will only say that anyone
who is looking for a "goat" had better pick
on the public, because that is the role the
public will have to play in this railway situation. In this I am thinking particularly of
grain growers whose product has to be hauled
across the country, and of the price that
consumers in British Columbia and other
provinces will have to pay for it. I foresee

SEPTEMBER 7, 1950
that increased freight rates will be necessary
to pay increased wages and keep our railways
functioning.
Passing on from that subject, I have one
comment on a statement made by the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I wish to assure him that there is no compact
among senators from British Columbia, nor
are we "picking on" him in any way. As a
newcomer to this chamber, I was somewhat
disappointed when the honourable leader
made the statement that it was not his duty
to advise the government. If that is so, I
cannot help wondering what is the duty of
a senator. Though I came to the Senate
recently, I have been in parliament since
1930, and know something of the workings of
both houses. If the supporters of the government are going to sit by on the one side and
acquiesce in all government legislation, and
on the other side the few who are in opposition are merely going to attack legislation
because it is brought down by a Liberal
administration, in my opinion' the eventual
result will be-though perhaps not immediately-that the people of Canada will take
a hand in the matter. I would remind honourable senators that even dictators can go only
so far in ignoring the voice of the people.
In accepting an appointment to this honourable chamber I did so with the view that I
should do my best on behalf of the people
of Canada, with no concern about getting
votes, to watch legislation and offer criticism
and also advice whenever possible or necessary. Above all else, I think that at every
opportunity, honourable senators should
supply some leadership to the people of this
country and give of information gained from
their past experience.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: During this special session of
parliament the criticism has been voiced in
the other place that the government has been
lagging in fihe playing of its part in the
Korean crisis. In my opinion, if there has
been any lagging on the part of Canada it has
been in her lack of boastfulness about the
contribution she is making.
I have before me an article which appeared
in the Huron Expositor, of Seaforth, Ontario,
dated August 31.
In this article there
appeared the replies of forty-one member
nations of the United Nations organization to
the appeal sent out for assistance in the
Korean crisis. I will not read the list, for I
do not think it appropriate that we should
point to the things which other nations have
said or done, or failed to do. However, a
glance at this list of replies by various countries shows clearly that this Canada of ours
is endeavouring to carry out fully its agreement with the Unied Nations. Without
69266-61

giving the names of the countries listed here,
I may say that some appear prepared to hold
a conference, others to send armaments, some
to supply a few officers; but not all offered
military assistance.
I was pleased, if no one else was, with the
statement made by the honourable the Minister of National Defence on Canada's ready
response to the call for active service in
Korea. In the light of conditions of full
employment and high wages in this country,
I am particularly pleased with Canada's
response in this affair. It is always easier to
get recruits when there is unemployment and
when men are travelling about seeking work.
It is obvious, therefore, that Canada's ready
offer to help in Korea is most commendable,
and the response to the call for men has been
most gratifying.
After we hear the taxation proposals tonight, I hope we will remember that there
can be no compensation for the sacrifice of
human life, and I trust that the people of
this country, with world conditions as they
are today, are not going to complain at this
time if they have to do without certain
material benefits. We can very well be proud
of the voluntary enlistments by Canadians. I
am one of those who believe that when the
inside story is told-and it cannot be revealed
at the moment for fear of jealousies and of
bringing about dissension-it will be realized
that Canada is far ahead of most nations in
playing a part in Korea.
I want to commend the United States for
its quick action in Korea on behalf of the
United Nations, but I am one of those who
believe that Canada should make it clear now
that she is not prepared to carry out every
obligation undertaken by the United States.
We should not be prepared to simply follow
the United States if she sets out on a policy of
policing the world. So long as she is acting
for and under the authorization of the United
Nations, I think Canada too should and will
do her full part.
I was very pleased when the Minister of
External Affairs stated in the House of Commons the other day that Canada or its government had no intention of interfering in
Formosa, and just in passing I may say that
in my opinion Canada is most fortunate in
having such an experienced man as Mr.
Pearson acting in the capacity of Minister of
External Affairs.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I doubt if any other nation
has in its cabinet such an experienced man in
foreign affairs. Mr. Pearson was brought up
in diplomatic circles and has given a good

From the British point of view, the acceptability

as an ally should be judged by how he looks to the
people of Asia and not by how he locks to Westeriners.

governments. This is not the first time that
a mistake has been made by the United States,
for Churchill said that America's master delusion was the conviction that China should be
regarded as a great power in the United
Nations. We in Canada supported the regime
of General Chiang Kai-shek, failing to realize
that the revolution in China was not started
on behalf of Soviet Russia but was directed
against the graft and corruptness of that
regime, corruptness which allowed millions
of Chinese to die for lack of food whilst a
few persons became rich. I have expressed
the belief that under such conditions millions
in China had the right to revolt. They were
worse off than even the Israelites of old were
when Pharaoh refused to give them straw, and
ordered them to look for their own straw and
still produce as many bricks per day as before.
True, they did not revolt-they were, however, led out to freedom from Pharaoh's
control.
Honourable senators, I sometimes wonder
where we in this Canada of ours are drifting.
The war had an effect on our people which
very few seem to have recognized. We were
regimented; we had to accept what we were
told by the central or federal government, and
do what official edicts ordered us to do. Our
democracy has not yet recovered from that
experience, and I find a regrettable complacency amongst our people. I find it even
amongst honourable members of another
place who, although elected to represent the
people, are willing to accept without protest
or question whatever the government sees
fit to do.
Reverting now to the present world situation, I wish to dwell for a few moments on
Korea, particularly in the light of that
country's past history. I wonder how many
parliamentarians have taken the trouble to
even look at the map to see for themselves
the location of Korea, Formosa and IndoChina. To those who have not, I would
suggest that to do so is a splendid educational
exercise which will prove helpful when reading about current events in these countries.
How many are aware that for the past
one hundred years and more Russia has
been endeavouring to control the East? Many
Canadians seem to think that the characteristics of the Russian people have changed
under the Stalin regime. The characteristics
of the British people have not changed
because a labour government is in office, nor
would the- characteristics of the Canadian
people change if a new kind of government
were to come into power in Canada. The
chief change in Russia is that the people
cast off their old masters, the tsars, and
replaced them by persons of lower rank who,
as the Good Book says of others in ancient

times have become much more tyrannical
and brutal than the old masters ever dreamed
of being.
Honourable senators who are curious about
the life of people in Russia may find a good
deal of interesting information in books written by David J. Dallin. Born in Russia in
1889, educated at Petrograd and Berlin, he
was elected to the Moscow Soviet as a deputy
in the then opposition. However, oppositions
did not last very long after Stalin got to be
in charge, and Dallin left the country in
1922. After living for a time on the European
continent he came to the United States, where
he has written five or six books, one of which,
The Rise of Russia in Asia, J recommend to
honourable members.
Knowledge of Russia's desire to control
the East enables us to understand more
clearly the moves that she is now making.
Tsar Alexander III built a railway from
Moscow to Vladivostock, for the purpose (>^
helping Russia to achieve her goal of controlling the entire East. Vladivostock is 500
miles from Korea. Latest reports are that
the railway, which is some 4,700 miles longthe longest line of railway in the world-Las
been double tracked under the Soviets, and
that the reason why goods are being shipped
south from Vladivostock rather than around
by rail is that the railway is jammed by the
transportation of military supplies.
In 1896 an agreement was signed between
Japan and Russia on the designating of the
38th parallel-the very parallel that we hear
.o much about today-as the line of demarca-tion between north and south Korea. Bot
Russia and Japan sent troops above and below
the 38th parallel, but it was not long before
Russia dispatched as well hundreds of officers
to train the North Koreans. In 1904 Japan,
protesting that Russia had violated the agreement, went to war with Russia, defeated her
and took over Korea. Many people today
are of opinion that the trouble over the 38th
line in Korea is something new, but we see
that this is far from being so. And it is very
interesting to read that just after the ending
of the last war in Europe Churchill and
Roosevelt offered Korea to Russia. Why she
did not accept it, no one can tell.
From Dallin's book to which I have already
referred, The Rise of Russia in Asia, I wish
to quote a secret message which was sent
by the Tsar to General Alexander in 1904,
when tension between Japan and Russia was
at its height:
"It is desirable," wrote the Tsar to General
Alexander in 1904, "that the Japanese, and not we,
be the ones to start military operations . . . But
if they should cross the 38th parallel on the western
coast of Korea, with or without a landing, you are

SENATE
hereby given instructions to attack them without
waiting for the first shot from their side. I rely
on you. God help you."

on military weapons, forgetting that propaganda, as used to the fullest extent by Soviet
Russia, is a most powerful weapon.
One frequently picks up broadcasts over the
air from Soviet Russia, telling of how good
life is in that country. If I wished to be
critical of the press and radio in this country,
I would point to the fact that the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation and the press
always seem to set out prominently the lying
statements emanating from the Russian delegates at the United Nations organization, or
from Moscow; on the other hand, it is forgotten that we have 14 million people in this
country, and that some communistic propaganda may fall on receptive ears. I would
suggest to the government that more serious
consideration be given to the spread of ideas
by means of propaganda.
We are not going to defeat communism by
the negative attitude of instilling fear into
our people and asking them if they are not
afraid that the Russians may overrun this
country. That method may be of some use,
but I would prefer a more positive plan of
action. In that way we would prevent many
of our people from being misguided and led
astray, not only by radio addresses from
Moscow, but from propaganda spread by
communist leaders in Canada, acting under

The words "God help you" would of course
not be uttered by the rulers in Russia today;
but at that time her churches were all open.
What Soviet Russia is doing today has long
been the characteristic ambition of the people
of that country.
I corne now to an incident that took place
on this continent, when the Russians defied
a British man-of-war entering the Stikine
River on the northern Pacific coast. I
wonder how many honourable senators know
that at one time Russia claimed the entire
Pacific Ocean and had military forts as far
south as San Francisco. The correspondence
which passed between the officials of the
Hudson's Bay Company and the Secretary
of State for Great Britain makes most
interesting reading. I wish to quote a short
passage to support the statement I made a
moment ago, that the Russians have not
relinquished their ambition to control the
entire world, particularly the East; and that
Stalin and his group operate under the
assumed1 name of Communists, because they
believe it provides a means by which they
can fulfil a desire which the Russian people
held for more than a hundred years. I
quote from a letter dated October 24, 1835, orders from Moscow. For example, at the

part of the present war. We have lost the country. I believe it is the right of every
battle of propaganda. The attention of the person to criticize the government in office
authorities in this country has many times in an endeavour to bring about better conbeen brought to the fact that propaganda is ditions, but I have no sympathy with anyone
a real weapon; but still they choose to give it in Canada, who either openly or clandesthe brush-off. We focus our efforts entirely tinely, is acting on behalf of Moscow in order

SEPTEMBER 7, 1950
to impose upon Canada the Russian form
of government. I warn such persons that if
the time ever comes when Russia controls
Canada-and God forbid that it ever should
-those who think they will be little leaders
and hold key positions in the new order will
find that they have been badly mistaken. No
doubt that is the lure which bas carried
many of them into subversive activities. I
would point out to them that Russia, in her
occupation of any country so far, has not
depended on any of the native population to
run her affairs. Indeed, she has ready a
trained army, tried and true, to send into
those countries; and those Russian sympathizers found that the new regime gave
them no power by which they might get even
with someone against whom they held grudge.
I would not mind these people being fools if
they did not lead so many good citizens
astray. Look at the number of our loyal
citizens who were duped into signing that
peace notice. It is high time that we woke up
to realities, and put on a campaign of information to enlighten our people.
I wonder how many honourable senators,
or members of the other house, if suddenly
asked what the fighting was all about in
Korea, could give an answer that would be
understood by the common citizen? Well, this
question has been asked and is still being
asked. We have the best country in the world
and we enjoy the best life any people could
have; the common man bas more than his
counterpart in any other country. But do we
extol these facts? No, we sit back and let
lying propaganda come to us from the Soviet
Russia and allow enemies within our gates
to sow seeds of discontent among our people.
Many of our citizens quite innocently fall
into these movements, as was evidenced today
by the march on parliament bill by members
of a Canadian Peace Congress. Did honourable senators ever see a more asinine thing
than this march, especially in one of the most
peaceful countries of the world? We should
send the leaders of such propaganda demonstrations back to Moscow, for propaganda
it is.
A lot of people waste time wondering
whether the Korean war will result in a
third world war. I think the answer to this
question does not lie here, but entirely in
Soviet Russia. And what she will do no one
can tell. We got a lesson in the thirties, but
in my opinion we went to sleep after the
last war. Honourable senators will remember
how Mr. Churchill kept telling the British
nation what Hitler was doing, but nobody
heeded his warning. A few days ago a party
leader in the other place was reciting the
events of the thirties. As I listened to him I

could not help thinking how different his
viewpoint was from what it had been before
the last war. Right up to 1939 members of
his party were rising in their seats and
demanding that the government answer the
questions: "What are we arming for? Why
are we spending all this money on armament"? Yes we had our lesson in 1939-1945,
but we pretty nearly got caught again. Perhaps with the help of God and all free
democratie nations, particularly the United
States, we can and will pull through.
Do not let anyone tell you that the Soviet
leaders do not make any mistakes. Just look
at what happened when Stalin and Hitler
signed their treaty. Stalin trusted that blackguard Hitler rather than the British; but
you know how quickly Hitler turned on
Russia when the opportunity came. Is there
any man who would say that Russia could
have withstood Hitler's terrible onslaught
had Britain not held the gate for all democratic countries after the fall of France?
Would any man in his proper senses argue
seriously that Russia could have survived
if Britain had not stood by and saved democracy for half the world? When Hitler was
attacking Russia he had still to watch Great
Britain and the western allies.
Honourable senators, I did not intend to
speak longer than forty minutes, but I have
one or two more points that I should like
to 'cover before concluding. I have dealt with
the power of propaganda, but let me say
again that I would honestly like to see Canada put on a positive campaign extolling the
good things of this country of ours: our
free life, without concentration camps or
brutal secret police, as opposed to the lying
propaganda the Soviets put out by radio,
literature and by word of mouth through
agents in this country. The nations of the
Western World would do well at the United
Nations to tell the Asiatics what are our
aims in Korea and Formosa. For the most
part at the present time only United States
troops are fighting in Korea; so you can
understand the propaganda which Russia is
spreading among the North and South Koreans
that the move made by the United States
is an imperialistic one. Under the United
Nations we should try as early as possible
to make it plain what our plan is for Korea.
I think it is safe to say that the Russians
are more realistic than we are. They understand us better than we understand them.
We are not realistic at all. I hear members
of the House of Commons, senators and
others, talking about the effect of the atomic
bomb if we had a war with Russia. But
have we taken any steps in the matter?
Have we done anything towards defending our

THE SENATE

Friday, September 8, 1950.
The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Acting
Speaker (Hon. J. H. King) in the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am advised that the House of Commons
have temporarily suspended the debate on the
Appropriation. Bill so that they may give
immediate consideration to item No. 5 on
their Order Paper, the Canadian Forces Bill,
which stands in the name of the Minister of
National Defence. Of course at the moment
I am unable to say how long that house will
take to deal with this measure, but there is
some indication that debate on it will not be
extended. In the circumstances I have been
asked to request that the Senate sit tomorrow,
with a view to having the bill passed through
this chamber and given Royal Assent this
week. It occurs to me, judging from some
optimistic views I have heard expressed, that
the bill may be passed by the Commons this
afternoon. If this should happen, and the
bill come to us tonight, honourable senators
might prefer to sit this evening and dispose
of the legislation then rather than meet
tomorrow morning. Therefore, in anticipation
of the bill reaching us tonight, when the
debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech
from the Throne is adjourned this afternoon
I am going to suggest that we adjourn during
pleasure to meet at approximately 5:30, when
I hope to have some information as to the
progress made by the other house.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Dupuis for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
in my remarks this afternoon I shall perhaps
repeat some of the things that already have
been said in this debate. But very often, when
asked by people in British Columbia why the
government does not take certain action or
why someone does not make a certain statement, I have found upon looking into the
matter that such action has been taken or

such a statement made. Therefore in my opinion some things cannot be said too often, for
many people miss important matters which
are referred to only once.
I want first to congratulate the mover
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis) and seconder (Hon. Mr.
Barbour) of the Address. They both performed
their functions nobly. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) on
his most able presentation of the facts surrounding the strike and the Korean affair,
and the senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid), who yesterday covered similar
ground from a different viewpoint.
Today I intend to put before the house some
thoughts and ideas which are perhaps not
entirely my own, but which I have heard
expressed, and which should, in my opinion,
receive immediate consideration by this body.
I believe that in matters affecting labour the
Senate provides a more appropriate forum
for discussion than does the House of Commons. Honourable senators are free to express
their own opinions without regard to the
effect they may have on re-election to office.
In that respect I think the position of a
senator differs from that of a member of
the House of Commons in the same way as
the office of a judge in Canada differs from
that of a judge in the United States, where
one cannot but think that the decisions of
judges must at times be influenced by an
impending election. Further, members of the
House of Commons may have certain personal
views but be fearful to express them because
of their possible effect on public opinion. A
government may hesitate to take a certain
step because public opinion is not yet receptive to it; and to stay in power a government
must have the support of the majority of the
public in any action that it takes. The work
of the Commons, therefore, instead of following a straight and positive course cornes down
to a series of compromises in the right direction. The Senate, on the other hand, is blessed
with freedom from the anxiety of election
results, and can help to provide good government by making proposals which, though not
popular at the time, may prove wise in the
future.
As to the question of strikes and work
stoppages, I believe that parliament should
give serious consideration, not to the "detour"
which was taken for expediency, but to
the building of a permanent road towards
the solution of labour problems. In the beginning labour was badly treated, and we in this
country for years have been fighting for
freedom, not only of workers but of the citizens generally. We have been trying to get

HOUSE OF COMMONS
away from dictatorship and tyranny, and we
have come a long way in labour matters and
in political affairs.
I think we are at times a bit too complacent
about our political freedoms. Being a peaceloving people we cannot imagine other nations
taking agressive action against us. The situation in Korea has shown us very clearly that
there are nations in this world who have
no compunction about taking aggressive action
against other nations. The attack on Pearl
Harbour woke us up, and the Korean affair
has had the same effect. It is true that we
are having to spend considerable money in
Korea, but I think that most of the funds
we are raising today will help us to prepare
against possible aggression in other parts of
the world. If the Korean affair has shaken
us out of our complacency, then I think the
money we are spending on it is well spent.
We tried for many years to win political
freedom, and today North Americans enjoy
more freedom, I think, than the people of
any other part of the world. Some countries
are slipping back into the regimentation of
dictatorship that prevailed throughout the
world centuries ago.
After political freedom had been won, the
labour unions of the country fought for the
workers in their battle against employers.
Many employers at one time exploited labour
to the full, leaving the working people with
barely enough on which to subsist, but the
labour unions, through organization and by
pressing their demands, were able to greatly
raise the wage standards and living conditions
of the workers.
Then another change came about, and political action was taken with respect to labour
conditions. It was no longer just the labour
unions that were responsible for improved
working conditions. The government commenced to introduce all manner of labour
legislation covering maximum working hours,
minimum wage scales, safety devices, workmen's compensation, and many other matters.
Some labour leaders looked upon the government's action in this regard as infringing
upon their field of activity. They saw how
this might cause them to lose their hold on
their members, who of course were paying
dues. Some of the unions countered this
move by getting into the political field themselves. They formed groups, put up candidates to run for public office, and tried to
control political parties. Thus a struggle arose
between labour organizations and government
in controlling the conditions of workers. On
the one hand are men selected by a particular
labour group or union and, on the other,
men elected by the people at large to form
the parliament of the country. When it comes
to a struggle between these two classes, I

do not think there is any doubt about the
final result, but the labour unions still have
the power in their hands to disrupt the whole
business of the country as was vividly
illustrated within recent days.
If the government, in order to fully protect
the public, feels that it should set up boards
to control the services, prices and profits of
public utilities, then why should we not go
a step further and place public utilities completely under government control so as to
ensure that proper service will be given and
that the public will not be inconvenienced?
A stoppage caused by labour in the functioning of a public utility is just as serious as a
stoppage caused by the company itself.
When labour used to be exploited, as I said
earlier, many companies were owned by
individuals. But there has been a change,
and today it is rare to find a company owned
,by one person. Most concerns now have large
numbers of shareholders, in some cases
running into the thousands. Indeed, it often
happens that the number of shareholders in
an industry exceeds the number of workers.
And of course a good many concerns are
publicly owned-by the state, or a province
or municipality.
Only by close co-operation between management and labour can we have real
progress in our country. When a compa.ny
has a dispute with its employees over rates
of pay or working conditions it does not arise
because the manager is trying to keep labour
down. He has to look at the picture from the
broad view of what is in the best interests
of his company's shareholders and employees
together, for he knows that the company
can only remain successful by giving satisfaction to both classes. If he sees that a
requested increse in wages would make it
necessary to boost the price of the company's
goods or services so high that the volume of
business would be greatly diminished, he
realizes that in the long run the workers
would be better off by continuing on their
present scale. The management of a railroad, for instance, know that if in order to
meet higher demands from labour freight
rates have to be increased beyond a certain
level, many firms which have been accustomed to shipping their goods by rail will
patronize trucks, airplanes or water transport instead, and beffore long it may be necessary for the railway to lay off men. A company which is able to maintain all its existing
staff on a 44-hour week might, if the week
were reduced to 40 hours, suffer such a loss
of traffic as to be forced to dismiss half of
its employees.
Another thing to be considered is the point
of view of people in business for themselves,

SEPTEMBER 8, 1950
who cannot reduce the length of their own
working week. Take the farmer on the
prairies, for instance. He works hard for
perhaps 70 hours a week, and the price of
his product may be controlled by an export
market. Even if he has a good crop, how will
hc feel when he comes to think that the men
hauling his crop to seaboard or to a local
market are being. paid two or three times as
much per hour as the net amount he will
receive? He will not feel very happy about
that, and his discontent will not be good for
this country.
Then, again, who is to say what industry
pays the best wages? In the old days when
wages were governed by the law of supply
and demand, the more remunerative or
pleasant a type of labour was, the more
workers it attracted. In time, of course,
competition among workers for employment
in any such field would become keen and
rates of wages would fall much below those
paid in fields where conditions were relatively poor. Out on the West Coast thirtyfive years ago some industries were paying
very high wages, higher even than those of
today, because working conditions of that
time were far from good and it was difficult
to get men for the jobs. The law of supply
and demand controlled the rates of pay. But
now demands for wage scales are based not
so much on the type of work as on the
strength of the union to which the workers
belong. Of course, everybody knows that
when wages go up it is the final consumer
who pays the shot; so when a union is strong
enough to get higher rates of pay for its
members than are received by members of
weaker unions, one result is that the members of the weaker unions have to pay a
larger share of their earnings for goods or
services produced by the workers belonging
to the stronger union. I hope, therefore,
that in time unions as well as companies
will in some way be restrained from making
exorbitant demands.
Here is another point. Many unions operating in Canada are international unions. I
have not gone into the subject far enough
to be able to state whether or not it would
be better for Canada if we had nothing but
Canadian unions, but anyone can see that
although the Canadian members of an international union may be doing the same kind
of work as its American members, business
conditions in Canada are not the same as in
the United States. A plant operating in that
country is producing for a market of 150
million people, whereas the same kind of
plant in Canada has a total market of only
14 million, and it is not possible for the
two plants to pay the same wages and produce

on a competitive basis. Take the automobile
industry, for instance. It has to make heavy
expenditures for dies and other tools before
a new design of car can be turned out, but
for every 3,000 cars that can be sold in Canada
there will be more than 300,000 sold in the
United States. It is clear that if the rate of
wages is the same in both countries, the
Canadian workers who buy automobiles must
pay much more for them than American
workers pay. If the Canadian prices of goods
in general are higher than American prices,
the cost of living here will be higher than
that in the United States.
Canadian railroads also are seriously handicapped by this country's small population, as
they are obliged to haul trains through
hundreds of miles of territory in which there
is no possibility of obtaining traffic, a condition with which American lines as a rule
do not have to contend. Representatives of
international unions seem inclined to overlook these facts when demanding comparable
wage scales in both countries. Labour unions
in Britain do not insist upon their members
being paid at rates current in the United
States or Switzerland or Italy or any other
outside country; they base their demands on
conditions in Britain alone.
A great deal has been said against compulsory arbitration. I think it is absolutely
necessary in the fields of public utilities and
essential public services that, if collective
bargaining and" voluntary arbitration do not
produce agreement, there should be some
method of compulsory arbitration, if you
wish to call it that, or arbitration of some
kind that must be accepted by both sides. It
may interest honourable senators to know
that for many years some unions have insisted
upon having a compulsory arbitration clause
written into their contracts with employers.
Two such unions are the International Ladies'
Garment Workers and the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers. Their arbitrator is, I
think, a professor of international law at
McGill University, and when their negotiations with employers fail, he makes a decision
which is bindng upon all concerned. He has
a permanent appointment, and the unions and
employers together pay his salary. That
arrangement has produced very satisfactory
labour relations, so there is no doubt that it
will work. Of course, the garment industry
is not a public utility. In certain quarters it
might not be classed as even an essential
industry, for in British Columbia some citizens
have occasionally discarded their clothes and
probably would not worry if they had none
at all. However, most of us in this chamber
undoubtedly consider garments to be essential.

SEPTEMBER 8, 1950
I do not want to see compulsion; neither do
I want to see the government of this country
try to make any man work at any particular
job. Nevertheless, I do not think that any
one group of men should be allowed to tie up
industry in this country by selfishly trying
to get more out of their fellow citizens than
they are entitled to, for that is all it amounts
to if their demands are out of line. I do not
wish anything I have said today to be construed as a charge on my part that the striking railway workers were asking for more
pay than they were entitled to receive. I
have not compared their rates of pay with
those of employees of other companies, and
I am not well enough informed on the matter
to make a positive statement. But regardless
of whether the workers were underpaid or
overpaid, in my opinion they had no right
to disrupt industry all across Canada, and
attempt to 'bludgeon the employers into a
settlement.
I should like to hear the strike question
discussed further, and have other members
express their views, so that the general public
may have the real facts and protect themselves against any future stoppage of the
wheels of industry in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable senators who moved
and seconded the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne.
Parliament was called into this emergency
session to deal with matters of great importance. The bill to end the railway strike
which had paralyzed this country was presented by the government and dealt with by
parliament in a prompt and efficient manner.
I believe the Canadian people appreciate the
prompt action of this honourable body and
the other branch of parliament.
I should like to express my appreciation
of what was said in this house on Wednesday last by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) with
reference to Donald Gordon. I have known
Mr. Gordon for a long time, and during the
war years I had the honour to be associated
with him when, as Chairman of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board, he was in charge of
price controls. I never worked with a man
who surpassed him in ability, fairness of
mind, rugged honesty and sincerity of purpose. Mr. Gordon won the deep admiration
and respect of all who were associated with
him for the fine and beneficial work he carried out for the people of this country during
the war years. He did a more effective job
of holding down prices for the consumers of

Canada than was done in any other country
of the world. His record is a matter of history, and it should never be forgotten.
I should perhaps add that when Mr. Gordon
was doing a big job as Chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, a forty-hour,
or fifty-hour week was out of the question
for him. I know that he worked sixty or
seventy hours a week during the war years;
and he is still working very long hours. He
came up the hard way, and has always been
used to work. Further, he has proved himself
to be the friend of the ordinary people and to
have their interests at heart, and any criticism of him in this respect has no foundation
in fact. He has never spared himself in
working in the interests of all the people,
and thousands can testify to the kindness and
sympathetic consideration shown by him
when they had reason to discuss their problems with him.
As we know, Mr. Gordon recently evolved a
sound and constructive plan for the reorganization of the finances of the Canadian
National Railways. Anyone who has studied
this plan cannot but realize what a help it
will be to this great institution when it is put
into effect. The plan should receive unanimous parliamentary support, because I believe
that it will be a great step forward in the
long history of the Canadian National
Railways.
Turning to other matters, the government
has been criticized in this chamber in relation
to the increased cost of living. I know that
one commodity which is of great importance
as a food, and which is produced in my part
of the country, has not gone up in price.
Fish prices along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the Bay of Fundy area, have been
stable for a longtime. I refer to fish around
the Bay of Fundy area. Many kinds of good
fish can be purchased by consumers in different parts of Canada at very moderate prices,
so I can assure this house that the fishing
industry of New Brunswick and, I believe,
that of the other Maritime Provinces is not
raising the cost of living by any general increase of prices. What we need in the Maritimes, of course, is a larger export market.
We purchase the great majority of our manufactured products from central Canada, and
in order to pay for these products we must
export.
Last year I called the attention of the house
to the disruption of Commonwealth trade by
all the restrictions imposed on it by the
sterling bloc, led by the United Kingdom
government. I gave the loss of our West
Indies trade as an outstanding example of
this disruption.

SENATE
More than a year ago I spoke out strongly
against Empire countries getting mixed up
in barter deals with Iron Curtain countries.
From my long experience. in trading around
the globe and in viewing world conditions, I
felt that no real good could come of such
deals, and that such schemes would be very
disruptive to Empire trade; in other words,
that those who sowed the wind would reap
the whirlwind. And that is just what has
happened, for the piper must be paid. No
wonder the Right Honourable Mr. Churchill
has raised his great voice against such trading,
and that his voice has echoed throughout the
Empire and the United States. The situation
must certainly be embarrassing to the socialists of Great Britain, because press despatches
inform us that the Soviets are calling for
payment of their end of the deal. They are
asking for and receiving such essential commodities as tin, rubber, wool, special
machinery, and machine tools used in the
construction of tanks and other war machines.
I may say that machine tools are a scarce
article throughout the world today. In this
connection it has just been brought to my
notice that Craven Brothers, the second
largest engineering firm in Great Britain, has
stated that it has a $2,800,000 order from Russia for machine tools, and for three years it
cannot contribute a single split pin towards
Britain's defence production.
No doubt a lot of the goods I have mentioned which are shipped out in this way are
being stockpiled for future use, and for no
good purpose. Through these deals the dictator states can also easily supply themselves
indirectly with pounds and dollars to pay
their Fifth Column, which thrives among us.
The rouble would not be any good for such
payments, and dollars and pounds must be
had.
It is self-evident that communists
spend millions to spread their propaganda
throughout the world, especially in the demozracies; and they need a big payroll to meet
the demands of their spies and sympathizers
in general and to pay for value received. So
the democracies obligingly open the tap which
enables the communists to conveniently get
the right kind of money for their nefarious
work, including the encouragement of aggression in certain places, which is costing us
dearly.
The Soviets and their satellites have
nothing whatever to off er in trade that cannot
be procured within our commonwealth. I am
thinking of lumber, fish, and coarse grains
which are surplus commodities within the
Empire. These are the kinds of goods that
are being supplied by Russia and her friends
in the barter deals to which I have referred.
I know from experience that trade between

communistic countries and democratic countries will not work. The two forms of trade
will not mix. The communists will only trade
one way, and that is their own way by barter
deals.
They have no idea whatever of
mutually beneficial trading, and it is beyond
comprehension why any democracy should
play the communistic game in trading, for it
always ends in disruption as far as the other
party is concerned. The freedom-loving nations
of the world have a great advantage, because
they have everything they need for good
living among themselves, be they at peace
or at war. The dictator states trade with the
democracies for one reason only-to get something essential that they cannot produce at
home. As I have already stated, mutual
benefits do not come into the picture, so why
should any democracy accommodate the
dictator states when it is self-evident they
are out to do everything they can to spread
disruption and ruin among the Christian
democracies?
The British Empire has the potential for
being the greatest territorial trading unit the
world has ever seen. It has command over
more commodities used in world trade than
has any other group. But Empire trade,
especially as far as this country is concerned,
has been gradually disintegrating, and barter
deals with rank outsiders have contributed
mightly to this.
There are three worlds today as far as
international trade is concerned: the dollar
world, the rouble world and the sterling
world. The democratic peoples are divided
and are not standing together, as they should,
in a way that would provide a great and
prosperous trade that would raise the standards of living for freedom loving nations. As
the great Sir John Boyd Orr has stated, it is
hard indeed to build peace where there are
empty stomachs.
With conditions in the world as they are
today, I cannot emphasize too greatly the
need for the freedom loving nations to work
in the closest possible unison both in defence
and in trade. Great objectives will be reached
if they do this because when democracies
trade they strive to confer benefits which are
mutual and which mean prosperity for both,
whereas the communist nations want every
advantage for themselves and are delighted
when they can spread embarrassment and
disruption among those who believe in the
democratic way of life.
I should like to discuss one more phase
of our Empire trade situation. The question
might be asked: Was there any real need
for those barter deals which so upset and
disrupted commonwealth trade and which
are now proving so embarrassing? My

SEPTEMBER 8. 1950
answer is that there certainly was not. Our
commonwealth is no Sahara Desert: we have
the raw materials, so why not produce and
distribute the goods?
Let us enumerate the commodities which
form the real basis of international trade:
wheat, rice, other coarse grain, cotton, wool,
steel, base metals, precious metals, minerals,
fish, lumber, oil, rubber, sugar, livestockincluding leather-beverages, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, fats and coal. If we
look around and take stock we will find that
the British Empire, with a possible shortage
in oil and cotton, can produce about all of
these commodities, so essential to good living.
Since the loss of Egypt the cotton supply
within the Empire has not been great; but if
Alberta comes through with oil, as we believe
it will, our supply of that commodity will be
solved for this generation anyway.
We can safely say that the English-speaking world has everything it needs now for
a prosperous trade, so why should we go out
of our way to play the communistic game?
The barriers that have been set up against
Empire trade are man-made, artificial, and
are mighty shortsighted, and we are going to
pay dearly for them. The excuse that the
friendly markets of the Empire had to be
forsaken and that deals with hostile countries were necessary because in those countries dollars were unavailable to purchase
certain needed commodities, does not hold
water at all. In fact, such reasoning is far
from common sense. In the first place it was
self-evident to anyone with experience in
world trade just what the communists would
want in return, and how embarrassing it
might be to fulfil Soviet requirements. This
is the way it has turned out.
In the second place, how could any democratic nation hold up the dignity of labour
and accept goods from a nation who was
producing them with the help of slave labour
to the extent of thirteen or fourteen millions
of people? According to the press these
people went without a clothing or bedding
allowance, and received only a pound and a
half of black bread per day plus two bowls of
barley soup, without fats. Possibly the nigger
in the woodpile is the fact that Russian goods
produced by slave labour were cheaper. That
would certainly be an ignoble reason, and
one that could not be defended.
As to the stock answer that dollars were
not available for trade with Canada, let me
tell honourable senators that there were
plenty of dollar reserves from which to draw.
England holds nearly a billion and threequarters' worth of Canadian securities that
could be turned into dollars over night. The
dollar problem is one of financial bookkeeping: it is entirely artificial. Both the Old

Country and Canada are paying financial
experts large salaries, so does anyone mean
to say that there would be any difficulty in
working out a plan whereby a billion or more
dollars could have been placed in this country
as a commercial trade credit for England and
the Empire for the purchase of lumber, fish,
coarse grains and many other commodities
that we produce, and which are now supplied
by Russia? It would be a simple transaction,
and it could have been put through at a very
low rate of interest, if any, because the
ordinary profit of trade would furnish due
compensation. The economic problem of any
country is a matter for its own citizens first,
and the initial sacrifice, if any, should be
made by them. Enough Canadian securities
held in England could have been pooled in
the Bank of England to cover a loan that
would have entirely supplied all the dollars
needed, and our Commonwealth could have
kept out of these obnoxious barter schemes
that have so disrupted and embarrassed it.
I think Canada could show greater leadership in the promotion of empire trade. After
all, this country is First Mate on the Empire
ship. Take a look at Australia-a country
rich in natural resources and with an assured
future. It has a great people. The result of
the present war in the Pacific means everything to them, and their airplane pilots have
been in the front line since the start of the
fighting in Korea. Australia is going through
an emergency period, but the country's credit
is gilt edged. For years United States loans
have been made to Australia, and they have
always been paid. Australian bonds are listed
on Wall Street and have a fine rating.
Recently when Prime Minister Menzies was
in the United States he arranged a further
loan of $300 million, which of course will be
spent in that country. I do not know whether
or not he intimated to Canada that a credit
would be appreciated. There is an old saying
that a person seeking a loan will usually
apply to an outsider rather than to a relative,
for he thinks his relatives know of his situation, and, that if they can help they should
volunteer to do so. We should give credit
to Australia if it is needed. Also, if a credit
in Canadian dollars will help South Africa
or our own West Indies, we should not wait
for any one of these great countries to come
to us hat in hand. We should offer them
immediate aid, if it is required, for we know
that the future of every one of them is beyond
imagination. They have real wealth, which
is what counts; and their people have a way of
life like ours, and desire to defend the same
institutions that we love. Any loans made
to these parts of the empire would be one
of the best and most far-sighted investments
that this country could make. They would
contribute greatly to the building up of empire

handle this bill.
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, I would ask that this bill be given
second reading at the next sitting of the
house.
Honourable senators will recall that a few
days ago I suggested to the house that the bill
be referred to the Special Committee on
Legislation.
For the information of the house I may say
that within a few minutes a second bill, an
Act respecting the Canadian Forces, will be
presented for our consideration, whereupon,
I should like, with the consent of the house,
to have it proceeded with at once. The special
committee is scheduled to meet if and when
the house has seen fit to give this bill second
reading, and the Minister of National Defence
will be present to answer any questions or
supply any information with regard to it.
I have a further suggestion to make. The
Minister of National Defence wishes to attend
a meeting of veterans in Winnipeg tomorrow,
and he intimated to me that it would be out
of the question for him to be here early next
week in order to attend a meeting of the
Senate committee dealing with the Appropriation Bill. On the other hand, he said he would
be very happy to attend today in order to
answer questions about the Appropriation Bill
as well as the Armed Forces Bill. In this way
the business of the Senate would be
facilitated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am
in entire agreement with the proposal of the
honourable leader' of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson). When a meeting of veterans
is being held in such an important city as
Winnipeg, it is only proper that the Minister
of National Defcnce should be there.

Hon. J. Gordon Fogo moved the second

reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, it must be a
matter of deep concern and regret that you
meet here at this time to consider a situation
which makes Canada a party in what is now
a localized war, but which may possibly
result in a further major conflict.
It is not so long ago, some thirty or thirtyfive years, that Canada took part in a war
against German militarism, the destruction of
which we all hoped would lead to a period
of peace. Following that struggle the League
of Nations was set up for the purpose of preventing, if possible, any future war. That it
failed to do so was perhaps caused by the
fact that it did not command the full support
of all the great powers, including the United
States.
In 1939 Canada was again plunged into a
world struggle. This time it was against dictators and the dangers of Fascist domination
of the world. When the dictators and their
armies were destroyed and broken, again the
war-weary world met to try to devise a means
of avoiding a repetition of such a struggle.
Everyone believed that the time had arrived
when international disputes could be settled
by some other means than war. Consequently the United Nations Organization was
set up, and among its objectives, the provision
of security against aggression was one of the
most important. The rise of communism and
the obstructionist tactics followed by the
representatives of the Soviet Russia in the
Security Council have served largely to prevent the United Nations Organization from
carrying out its objectives respecting the control of aggression, the veto power from time

SENATE
to time exercised by the Soviets rendering
the Security Council impotent. So strong was
the feeling about this that during the past year
many people had almost come to the conclusion that the United Nations Organization
was, as the League of Nations had been,
doomed to failure. Some persons even went
so far as to suggest the creation of some other
organization from which Russia and its satellites would be excluded. The failure to provide means to meet or repel aggression caused
Canada and other friendly nations to join
together in what subsequently became the
North Atlantic Treaty, which we all know is
designed for the protection of ourselves
against the threat of communism.
The sudden invasion of Southern Korea
by the communist forces of the north, armed
with Russian weapons, happened fortuitously
at a time when the Security Council was sitting and the representatives of Soviet
Russia were absent, they having previously
walked out in protest. It was also fortunate
that at the particular time of this aggression
a United Nations commission was actually
sitting in Seoul in Korea and was able to
give promptly a first-hand report of what
had happened. Consequently the Security
Council had reliable information on which to
act, and it took prompt action to repel this
armed attack and to restore international
peace and security. Fortunately again, one
of the great friendly powers, the United
States, was so situated in the Pacific as to
be able to place forces on the Korean front
immediately, and, with aid from Australia,
they undertook to meet the invader.
This example of leadership on the part
of a great nation such as the United States
gives us heart, I think, and removes the
temptation to fear that the United Nations
Organization is going "out the window"; and
the views of the world with regard to United
Nations may now change. This action of the
United States, supported as it will be by
other members of the United Nations, may
as it were be a milestone in the organization's history and convince aggressors that
if they invade neighbouring territory they
will bring down upon themselves the combined forces of nations who are interested in
the preservation of peace.
As a member of the United Nations and a
signer of the North Atlantic Treaty, Canada
had already undertaken defence expenditures
far greater than she had ever incurred for
defence purposes in so-called peace time. We
all remember the vast amounts which were
voted at the last session of parliament. The
policy of Canada-it was discussed at length
at the time and everyone seemed to be

familiar with it and to agree with it-was,
first, to safeguard the defences of our own
country; and, second, to provide machinery
for raising and equipping a civilian force in
the event of all-out war, instead of maintaining a standing army.
The Korean situation therefore presented an
immediate and serious problem to Canada,
for we were not organized to participate in
such a campaign. We were able, however, to
send to the East certain units of the navy
which were then in the Pacific Ocean; we also
directed the transport section of our air force
to take part in the important task of maintaining the supply lines of the forces in
Korea, which was no small undertaking.
With no ground troops available, the government decided to raise a special force for
service in Korea, or elsewhere as required.
The response to the appeal for volunteers for
this force was remarkable, and within two
weeks the original establishment was raised,
and as recently announced by the minister
in the other place, 3,000 replacements-the
number may be greater now-have been
enlisted and are under training. At the
outbreak of the Korean affair the total
authorized strength of all three Canadian
forces was 50,912. This has been increased
by 40 per cent, which would bring the total
to 69,160. The minister said, when he spoke a
few days ago, that the strength of the armed
forces had then reached 56,962.
While there are some who would stand
on the sidelines and criticize the government
for not taking stronger action, I feel free to
say that we have no reason to be ashamed
of what Canada is doing. In the past she has
always done her part, and today is living up
to that record. I am convinced that what
has been undertaken by the government has
the support of the vast majority of the
Canadian people.
Furthermore, Canada is indeed fortunate
in having as ber Minister of National Defence
the Honourable Brooke Claxton.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It may well be that the
portfolio of Minister of Militia and Defence
in the years gone by was a sinecure; but no
one would suggest that the Minister of
National Defence today bas an easy task.
Mr. Claxton brings to this onerous position
sound judgment, tremendous energy and perseverence. Further, he has the advantage of
having served in the armed forces as a noncommissioned officer. This experience gives
him firsthand knowledge of the problems of
the men in the ranks. On many occasions

SEPTEMBER 9. 1950
'within recent months Mr. Claxton has demonstrated his remarkable grasp of departmental affairs. Again I say, Canada is fortunate in her choice of Minister of National
Defence.
The bill now before the house is intended
to enable the government to place Canadian
forces on active service, in accordance with
the circumstances therein described. Honourable senators will recall that considerable
attention was given not long ago to the
National Defence Bill. During the careful
consideration of that bill no one anticipated
the early change in the international scene,
which has since taken place. It is the experience of every lawyer that no matter how
much wisdom is brought to bear on the consideration of a particular document, there are
still contingencies that one cannot be prepared to meet. This sudden aggression is a
contingency of that nature.
Honourable senators will recall that the
National Defence Act provides that Canadian
forces can only be placed on active service
in an "emergency", which is defined as "war,
invasion, riot or insurrection, real or apprehended". Though no such emergency exists
at the present time, it obviously has become
desirable and necessary that certain parts of
the Canadian forces be placed on active
service.
The bill before us provides that any part
of the Canadian armed forces may in the
future be placed on active service, 'not only
in an emergency as defined by the National
Defence Act, but also by reason of Canada's
commitments under the United Nations Charter, The North Atlantic Treaty, or any other
instrument for collective defence by which
Canada is bound. That is the first important
operative part of the bill.
Secondly, the bill provides that the services of short-term personnel, who -are entitled to release at the expiration of their
terms, may be retained wihile they are on
active service or while an emergency exists,
and for one year thereafter.
The third important provision has to do
with pensions. The regular career soldier,
who comes under the provisions of the
Defence Services Pension Act, contributes
about 5 per cent of his pay for pension purposes. The bill contains an amendment by
which persons enrolled for special services
shall be excluded from the provisions of
that Act.
The last important provision in the bill
is designed to enaible the government to
extend certain benefits of the veterans legislation now applicable to veterans of World

War II, to those who participate in any
action under an international agreement. By
this method parliament avoids the complicated procedure of amending all the statutes
affected to make them apply to the special
service force.
Section 8 of the bill provides that this Act
shall be deemed to have come into force as
of July 5, 1950, which is the date upon
which the three Canadian destroyers now
serving in the Pacific sailed from Canada.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I shall be as brief as possible. It is agreed
by all, I am sure, that the passage of the bill
now before us is necessary to authorize the
sending of a Canadian force outside the dominion. Therefore, I can see very little objection to it.
The introductory remarks of my honourable friend from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo)
brought clearly to my mind the feeling that
has existed in Canada since June 25. Everyone was shocked at that time to hear that
North Korea had attacked South Korea in a
deliberate attempt to crush that part of the
country. We knew that by agreement Russia
was supposed to look after North Korea.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) recently gave us
a splendid account of the Korean situation
prior to the Great War. He explained how
the 38th parallel had been the dividing line
between North and South Korea for over
one hundred years.
Fortunately, when North Koreans attacked
South Korea on June 25 of this year there
were two bodies in existence. The first was
the United Nations Commission which was
examining the situation in Korea, and therefore was able at once to give an unprejudiced
account of what had happened; the second
was the United Nations organization itself.
My honourable friend from Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Fogo) gave a brief history of world
events from World War I to this day. We
know how the United Nations organization
was formed at San Francisco in 1945. Even
at that time a great many of us thought
that it was a great mistake to give the veto
right to the five great world powers; but
we were told that otherwise it would have
been impossible to get either Russia or the
United States to join the United Nations.
When I attended the second session of the
United Nations in New York in 1946, I
think I learned why both the United States
and Russia might have felt the need for the
veto power. I do not think it was anticipated
that the veto would be used as it has been, but
the great powers, especially the United States,
were afraid that a number of small nations, by
combining their votes, could compel one of

SEPTEMBER 9, 1950
are told that we had 10,000 men trained as
paratroopers and soldiers, but that it was
necessary to keep them here for the protection of our own country. I seriously challenge
that statement. If we allow our side to lose
the war in Korea, the next move by the
communists will be made in some other
country-maybe Iran or Yugoslavia or Germany. They will keep on applying the Hitler
tactics and attack in soft places.
It is not a sufficient answer for the government to say that we have 10,000 trained soldiers in this country. Trained men were
what MacArthur asked for. He wanted ground
forces that could be thrown into action, if
necessary. Many people are opposed to the
sending of Canadians abroad for that purpose,
but I believe that the majority wonder why,
after all this splurge of spending on military
effort, we were not able to put any men into
the field; and if we had, we would not have
been able to equip them. I do not say the
money has been improperly spent, but I think
it has been spent foolishly.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What is the difference?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no difference.
I am not so favourably impressed as is my
honourable friend opposite by the Minister of
National Defence. I am afraid that when the
minister took over his present department he
had the idea that never again would it become
necessary for us to go to war, or, if events
proved differently, that there would be a
space of six or eight months or more in which
forces could be trained for dispatch to whereever they might be needed, and that in these
circumstances we should in the meantime
simply maintain a small force. But the
Russians were bound that things would not
happen in that way. Apparently United States
policy was largely similar to ours. I am not
criticizing that country, for I have no right
to do so, but I recall that about the middle of
June the United States Secretary of War
declared that his country was ready to fight
any nation on earth. Ready! It was not ready
at all.
I come back to our own situation. Although
the Secretary General of the United Nations
called for help in Korea on the 14th of July,
we did not do anything at all till the 7th of
August. Why? We knew that our action would
be closely watched all over the world. Canada
is one of the great free nations, the country
that would be regarded by Russia as the best
prize for conquest, and the country that it
would be easiest for Russia to seize in an
overland attack. Yet when the call came for
help we were not ready at all, and we did
not do anything for more than three weeks-

for twenty-four days-and then we called for
volunteers. Of course we got some right away.
The people of this country are disturbed
about this situation. They realize that we
are not going to be allowed six or eight
months to prepare for defence. If Russia
decides to attack Canada or the United
States, she will be too clever to give us a
chance like that. And in the United States
there is a veritable revolution over the
national unpreparedness for a world war.
Think of it! Just the other day General
MacArthur, the leader of the United Nations
forces in Korea, had to call for more ground
forces in order to help him hold the line.
I hope he can hold it, but I am not sure. In
these circurnstances I do not'think that any
member of this house or of the other house
has a right to be complacent and to say
that the Minister of National Defence has
done a fine job. My feeling is that that attitude is not justified.
I am glad that we sent at least some
destroyers to Korea and furnished some airplanes to transport supplies. It. is not a
very big effort for a country that for the
last ten years has been describing itself as
one of the great middle nations. We wanted
to be leader of the middle nations. Leader!
Even Siam is sending men to Korea; and
Australia, with only a third of our population, has got forces there. These facts make
Canadians fear that the United States will
form a very bad opinion of this country.
We talk bravely of how we have stood by
the United States, how we are part of the
freedom-loving people of the world; yet when
a cold-blooded and totally unjustified attack
was made on freedom, the best we could do
was to send three destroyers for naval duty
and twelve airplanes for the carriage of
supplies. The government has stated that
we could not send any men for at least six
months. Well, the struggle will be decided
before then.
I say again that that situation is worrying
Canadians. It is no wonder that the other
house has had some hot debates about our
lack of action. The representatives of the
people, like the people themselves, are really
disturbed by the fact that after all the
money we have spent the only response we
could make to the United Nations call for
help was three destroyers and a dozen
airplanes.
I am willing to vote for the bill, and I
presurne that every member of this house will
do so, because I am sure that all of them are
as keen as I am to see that Canada does
everything it can to put down this aggression. It is the first time in my experience
that an aggressor nation has not attempted

SENATE
to justify or explain its action. In World
War I Germany attempted to justify her
action by saying that it was bound to assist
her partner, Austria. I do not think that
Germany's conduct was justifiable, but at
least she recognized the necessity of trying
to appease public opinion. And even Hitler
sought to justify his war policy to the world
by contending that he had no option but to
attack Poland and other countries because
they were getting ready to move in on
Germany.
We and the other democracies were caught
unprepared in World War II, and we made up
our minds that we would be ready in the
event of another outbreak of aggression.
When parliament at the last session was asked
to vote $425 million for defence purposes the
honourable leader of this house said that
Canada must be ready to meet aggression
wherever it arose. The ink was hardly dry
on his remarks in Hansard when there was a
cold and unprovoked aggression in Korea. The
attack was in no way justified; there were no
foreign troops in Southern Korea. The Americans had been there two years previously,
but they had all left. The forces of North
Korea hoped to overrun South Korea within
a month; and I have no doubt that Russia
expected that the United States, because of
distance, would not interfere with the
campaign.
As the honourable sen.ator from Carleton
(Hon. Mr. Fogo) has just said, had the United
States been without military strength, and
had Australia not been ready to lend valuable
assistance, South Korea would have shortly
been conquered. Then if any other country
attempted to move, it would be regarded as an
act of aggression.
I enjoyed the historical sketch given a
few days ago by the honourable gentleman
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). It
becomes obvious that if we of the West do not
win in Korea we shall surely lose face
and forgo the sympathy and help of the
people of that part of the world in our struggle
against communism.
We must not forget that military defence
against Russian aggression is no tea party. We
are not now dealing with the Germans who,
though fierce in their offensive knew something about world conditions. The Russians
do not.
Honourable members, perhaps I do not need
to say more than that I intend to vote for the
bill, but I may add that I am pleased that
the government saw fit to call parliament into
session quickly. My only complaint is that
parliament could have been reassembled even
earlier than it was. True, the immediate
reason for our return was the railway strike,

which was a very important matter as far as
the people of Canada were concerned. In my
opinion parliament should have been recalled
on July 15, the day after Trygve Lie asked for
reinforcements for ground troops, and failed
to get them. The government could then
have given us the facts, and asked for our
advice in the matter. Of course everyone
knew at that time that Canada would have
to prepare a force for the Korean campaign,
but had it not been for the railway strike
parliament would not have been recalled
before October 1.
We are a quiet, peace-loving nation, and we
think that our freedom, our prosperity and
our standard of living are an answer to all the
communist propaganda in this country and
elsewhere. But we saw a demonstration on
the steps of the parliament buildings the other
day which rather shocked our complacency.
There we saw a young Canadian, a graduQte
of one of our universities, a man whose father
and uncle were distinguished missionaries and
church leaders, at the head of a crowd of
people who would overthrow the government
by force. We sometimes see that sort of thing
in Canada today, and yet people just shrug
their shoulders and pass it by without concern. I entirely agree with the statement
made by the Minister of External Affairs
some time ago about the leaders of these
communist sympathizers. The sooner Canada
takes some positive action against this type
of person, the sooner Russia will appreciate
our stand.
I give the bill my full support, I trust that
it will shortly go to committee, and that
before the sun sets tonight it will become law.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
without delaying the house unduly I should
like to discuss for a moment or two some
remarks made by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). He reminds me of a
vociferous critic of the government in another
place who suggests that Canada should be
ready at all times to meet world situations
everywhere, forgetting that she has a population of only 14 million people.
I have every confidence that Canada will
do her part within the United Nations organization, but we should take note of the practical way in which Russia has moved along.
For instance in North Korea, as far as I
know, there are no Russian troops taking part
in the campaign. Russia has merely helped
and trained the Koreans.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: What about the Red Star
plane that was shot down the other day?
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is only one plane.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: But there are more where
it came fron.

SEPTEMBER 9, 19850
Hon. Mr. Reid: That may well be true. I
just wish to call the attention of the house
to the fact that Russia has used other people
to fight her battles, and that if we are going
to be practical we should give consideration
to the re-arming of Germany and perhaps of
Japan. Korea bas a population of 30 million,
and I do not think our small nation of 14
million should be asked to send manpower
in numbers comparable to those which Korea
is capable of supplying. We should assist in
training and equipping Southern Korea's millions to fight for their own land.
I should like to have heard the honourable
opposition leader give some credit to the
Royal Canadian Air Force for its service to
Korea thus far. The American people are
now paying tribute to the personnel of the
R.C.A.F., who are performing the astounding
feat of providing an airlift over the Aleutian
Islands to Japan and thence into Korea. This
operation is, as I say, now receiving full credit
from people of the United- States. The
efficiency of our airmen over this perilous
route astounds them, hence their admiration.
My main purpose in rising at this time is
to express an opinion as to the likely outcome
of the Korean affair. One of the best ways
of gaining perspective is by reading history.
Men who follow a military career are or
should be, required to read the history of battles from the early days up to the present time.
The basic strategy of fighting or of battles
has not changed much because mankindi has
not changed.
Therefore, a military commander familiar with the history of the past
has some idea of what he may expect in battle today. My opinion is that Russia knows
what she is doing, and that her delegate was
deliberately absent from the meeting of the
United Nations when the question of Korean
aggression came up. I say that Russia knew
full well that her veto could stop any official
resistance by the United Nations in Korea.
In the light of all the circumstances I am
not sure that Russia will allow the United
Nations to win in South Korea. As I have
said before, Russia wants Korea, and always
has; it is part of her imperialistic plan. She
is not going to be accused of starting the war,
but in my opinion she has set a trap into
which the western nations have fallen.
I appeal to honourable senators and the
country as a whole to stop talking, before
it is too late, about such things as an extra
cent on the cost of a bottle of pop or a
chocolate bar. In my opinion the Western
World is faced with its greatest crisis-that
of the tremendous might of the most ruthless
nation on .earth. Russia knows where she is
going, and intends, if possible, to get there.
I am afraid that this beginning in Korea is
just what Russia wants, and that she is not

going to sit idly by and watch Korea taken
from under her. In her vast imperialistic
march, which she carries on under the name
of Stalinism or communism, she needs Korea.
Honourable senators, as I said the other day,
when the inside story is told it will be realized
that Canada's part in Korea compares
favourably with that played by any other
nation. It is true that Great Britain has despatched troops to Korea, but those troops
were available in Hong Kong. Canada is not
far behind. I disagree with the opinion which
exists in some quarters of the other place
that Canada, with only 14 million people,
should drain her manpower by sending
troops to every trouble spot in the world.
I think we should assist these other countries
to arm, so that they can help fight their own
battles. We can and should, of course, help
them with our manpower too. We should also
use our great industrial might to this end.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
senator what responsibility Canada has
assumed under the Atlantic Pact?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Canada bas assumed her
duties just the same as other members of the
Atlantic Pact. Where has she fallen down?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Right here.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is your opinion, not
mine.
Hon. Mr. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I hesitate to say anything at this time,
but it is the duty, and indeed the privilege, of
those of us in this chamber to express our
opinions on these important matters. At the
outset let me say that I am expressing my
own opinions.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has pointed out the
seriousness of the Korean situation. Honourable members will recall that when we were
discussing the raising of armed forces to fight
under the United Nations flag, I asked how
those forces were to be raised. It is my
humble opinion that if we are to be associated with the United States in the North
Atlantic Pact, we should adopt a draft system
similar to theirs. In fact, I think all nations
who are members of the Atlantic Pact should
adopt a draft system to raise their part of a
United Nations force. It has always been my
opinion that conscription is the only fair
method by which to raise an army.
Those who are now volunteering for the
Canadian forces are not signing up just for
the duration of the Korean emergency. They
are liable for service until the expiration of
one year after the emergency has ceased to
exist. The parents of our eighteen, nineteen
and twenty-year old youths must surely

SENATE

are placing on thoso volunteers. I rocaîl that

Hon. Mr. Quinn: I will withdraw it, but

that the United Nations should help West
Germany to arm, and I think they should

go further and say that they should lend
every possible assistance in the re-arming
of Spain.
I am amazed sometimes when I hear the
criticisms of Spain and Franco. People seem
to forget that if it were not for Franco the

Russia years ago. I ask honourable members

believe that today he should be rendered
every possible assistance. If Spain and every
other anti-communist country bordering on
the Atlantic were to come in with the rest
of us who have signed the North Atlantic
Treaty, the pact would have far more prestige and strength than at present. In the
fight against communism we need the assistance of every anti-communist country, large
and small. So let us do away with bigotry
and national and religious hatred, and bring
the whole anti-communist world into a united
front.
I am heartily in accord with everything
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has said today. I submit that he was justified in the criticisms he made. The people
of this country cannot understand how it is
that although, since the end of the last war,
parliament has appropriated $1,500 million
for defence, there is nothing to show for all
that money. When the Secretary General of
the United Nations called upon member
countries to support the United States forces
in Korea, we were unable to respond with
even a battalion. The government says
that we have in this country 10,000 men, all
trained for a certain purpose. Well, the need
to serve that particular purpose may never
arise and the training of these men may be
of no avail. I subrmit that if we have trained
men, at least a battalion or a regiment of
them should have been sent to Korea. The
dispatch of troops from this country to Korea
would have strengthened the morale of the
United States forces. Look at what .happened when the British troops arrived in
69266-7

Korea! The morale of the Americans rose
at once, and as a result -they fought better.
That is all I wish to say at this time. I
intend to vote for the bill, because I believe
we should do everything in our power to
help in putting down aggression. Canada,
as a member of the United Nations, is under
an obligation, and when we were asked for
assistance we should have given some.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
sénators, I have no objection at all to the
demand for an accounting, at a time like
this, of the expenditure of money on the
provision of military defence in a period of
peace. I think it is most salutary that every
now and again the question should be raised,
as it has been raised today, as to whether we
have got value for the money spent. And it
is wise for those who support the government
to listen carefully to criticisms of what has
been done. On the other hand, I like to be
fair. I am unable to say whether or not
every dollar has been spent wisely, for I do
not know. In a big matter of this kind, one
in my position must necessarily confess lack
of knowledge.
What does strike me strongly just now is
the reference back to speeches made by the
leader of the government here (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) and the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) at previous sessions when we
were passing estimates for military expenditures. I believe I have a reasonably good
memory, yet I cannot recall any occasion when
the leader of the opposition stated that Canada
should at all times maintain an expeditionary
force prepared to embark, on 24 hours' notice,
for a battlefield anywhere in the world. That
is the proposition that is before us now by
way of criticism. As I remember our discussion, we talked about the defence of
Canada, the training of men in the north, the
provision of flying forces capable of defending
Canadian cities against attack from abroad,
and so on. I have no recollection of hearing
anyone in this house advocate-nor of reading
that anyone in the other house advocatedthat Canada should maintain an expeditionary
force prepared to embark on 24 hours' notice
to any part of the globe where trouble
happened to occur. If in this country we
have a defence force of a strength and
standard commensurate with the money spent,
I see no criticism to offer.
I of ten wonder why it takes so much time to
train soldiers and to equip them, and of course
I join with the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) in wishing that the time could be
shortened. But I think my lack of knowledge
of military matters is an element there.
Though I do not understand why it is so,
the fact is that the training and equipment of
armed forces does take a long time, not only

SENATE

here but in the United Kingdom, the United
States, and other countries. The government
cannot be criticized for that.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me to interrupt? The
criticism is not as to the length of time it
takes to train men, but as to the governinent's
slowness in starting the training.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But we have been training forces for a long time.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I mean, for this special
purpose.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There has been some
talk of losing three weeks time in calling parliament together. True, we might have been
called a little earlier, but I do not see where
any time was lost as far as our military
preparations were concerned. The cabinet
was carrying on, and it did everything that
parliament would have done had it been in
session. Therefore, I do not see where the
criticism lies.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would point out that it
was three weeks after a request was made for
troops that any move was made to recruit a
force in Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Affairs-I am more interested in his information-will be available to answer our questions. If the leader of the government will
assure us that these men will appear before
the committee later, I see no objection to the
house giving third reading to the bill now.
Some Hon. Senators: Carried!
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am quite happy to
give that undertaking, but I must point out
that it may not be possible for the Minister
of National Defence to attend the committee
meeting. Under those circumstances he would
be represented by some one from his department. The Minister of External Affairs will
be available, as the measure has to do with
external affairs.
Honourable senators, I move that the bill
be now read a third time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read a third time, and passed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Honourable Robert Taschereau, acting as Deputy of
the Governor General, would proceed to the
Senate Chamber this day at 12.45 p.m., for
the purpose of giving Royal Assent to a bill.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I had expected that the debate on second
reading would not have lasted as long as it
has, and that the bill would have gone to
committee earlier. I am advised that when
the bill has been passed that Royal Assent may
take place at either 12.45 or at 6 o'clock this
evening. As I gave an undertaking that the
bill would be referred to committee, I am
entirely in the hands of the house as to the
course we should follow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I make a suggestion
to the honourable leader of the government?
We have been told that the Minister of
National Defence and the Minister of External

The Honourable Robert Taschereau, the
Deputy of the Governor General, having come

RED RIVER FLOODS
MANITOBA RELIEF FUND
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John T. Haig: As the senior senator
from Manitoba, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Canadian parliament and
the people of Canada and elsewhere for the
very fine way in which they responded to the
Manitoba Flood Relief Fund. The response
by the people of North America, the United
Kingdom, France and other countries was
magnificent, and the amount raised was a
little over eight and a quarter million dollars.
This money is to rehabilitate the people of the
Red River Valley who lost furniture and
equipment in the flood disaster of last June.
Incidentally, it is rather interesting to note
that all honourable gentlemen in this chamber
from Manitoba come from the Red River
Valley, so it must be a pretty important part
of the province.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Perhaps that is the
reason for the flood.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, honourable senators
know the cause of the Great Flood; perhaps
the cause of the Red River flood was the
same.
I want to say that this relief fund is being
ably administered. Perhaps there are one or
two cases in which somebody is receiving a
dollar too much or a dollar too little, but I
have not heard a single word of complaint
about the administration of the fund.
On behalf of the people of the Red River
Valley, I also want to thank the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec, and particularly the
Province of Saskatchewan, for the magnificent way in which they opened their arnis
and took our people into their homes and hospitals. I can say without hesitation that not
one cent of the money contributed to the
Manitoba Flood Relief Fund is being wasted.
I may also say that I have not heard one
single word of criticism about the action
taken by the federal government with regard
to the flood disaster. It appointed a very able
man to administer its relief fund, and, as in
the case of the Fraser River flood, it has
undertaken to meet 75 per cent of the cost
of rehabilitating the flood victims. As one
69266-7j

who comes from Manitoba I am not going to
say anything about what our provincial government is doing. In fact, the less said about
this the better.
Let me also thank the farmers of Prince
Edward Island for the fine hogs they sent to
the farmers of the Red River Valley who lost
their stock in the flood. And to the farmers
of Scotland, who sent out a number of purebred cattle to help replenish the dairy herds
of the Red River Valley, we also say thank
you.
DEFENCE APPROPRIATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 2, an Act for granting
His Majesty aid for national defence and
security.
He said: Honourable senators, this Appropriation Bill follows the form adopted during
the last war, when over-all amounts were set
out without any detail of the estimates which
ordinarily accompany bills asking for the
appropriation of public moneys. I propose
to explain the large items, and if and when
the house sees. fit to give the bill second
reading, I would suggest that it be referred to
our Special Committee on Legislation, where
detailed information will be available, if
requireçi.
I have asked the Minister of
External Affairs if he will be present, and
he has agreed to come on very short notice. As
the Minister of National Defence is away
today, if the bill is sent to committee this
afternoon an associate deputy minister will
be on hand to answer any questions relating
to facts. Of course, he will not be able to say
anything as to policy.
The bill would provide the amounts of
money that the government needs to finance
its greatly increased defence prograrn in the
face of the present emergency. The total
amount that would be voted is $858,768,021.
There are three main appropriations. The
first, which is for $142,200,200, would provide
the additional sums that are needed by the
services for the remainder of the current
fiscal year. The second, amounting to $409,257,821, may be used now by the services
to make contractual commitments for future
years. The Appropriation Act passed last
session limited the contractual commitments
that the services could make for future years
to $141,123,670. This bill would increase that
figure by the amount I have mentioned.
The third appropriation amounts to $300
million and is for the purpose of producing
defence equipment and supplies for our own
forces or for the forces of our allies under
the North Atlantic Treaty. It will get under

SEPTEMBER 11, 1950
I have no further explanation to make at
this time, but honourable senators may
receive detailed information in the Special
Committee on Legislation.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have no criticism to make of the contemplated
$5 million expenditure on research. I also
have no criticism to make of the $2 million
which is to be spent to defray the charges
and expenses for the land services of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. I am glad to see
that British Columbia and Newfoundland are
to use these services, because for many years
now the R.C.M.P. have served the province of
Manitoba in a highly satisfactory manner. I
was a member of the Manitoba legislature
when this system was first adopted, and I
know that some people thought it would not
work out. Some argued that there would be
a -clash between the Attorney-General of the
province and the Attorney-General of the
dominion in the administration of the police
force in the province, but I have never heard
of such a clash. I would recommend that
every province in Canada should use the
services of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police.
I have no criticism to make of the appropriation of $142 million which is to organize
and equip the Canadian armed forces, but I
should like to be certain that the $409 million
referred to in subsection 2 of section 2 is
expended only if absolutely necessary. I
appreciate that it is difficult for us to judge
whether this money is necessary or not. Perhaps the people of South Korea felt that they
were spending enough on big guns and equipment to withstand any aggression that might
come; perhaps they even thought that no
foreign army would ever attack their land.
Nevertheless it, happened; and I think there
is even more reason to expect that Iran or
West Germany or Yugoslavia will be attacked.
I agree with what one American recently
wrote: that the issue between the East and
West will finally and ultimately be settled
on the plains of Europe, where throughout
the centuries ai great wars have been fought.
I entirely agree with what our government
is doing about the Korean situation. I agree
entirely with what we are doing to see that
Iran, Malay and Indo-China will be protected
in the event of attack; but we all know that
the real struggle, if it comes, will be fought
out in Western Europe.
I live in a prairie province, and I believe
it is quite within the bounds of possibility that
if Russia were to send out bombing planes
on a mission of destruction in Canada and the
United States, their course would be down
through the prairies. I disagree with honourable members from British Columbia who feel

that the first attack would be made on Vancouver. It seems to me much more likely that
bombs would be dropped first on the central
provinces. And what would be a more probable point of attack than, for instance, the
city of Winnipeg? Owing to its geographical
position with the lake region to the north and
American territory not so very far to the
south, Winnipeg would be regarded by the
enemy as a hub where bombing could accomplish a lot of damage. I feel that everything
possible should be done to enable us to meet
the aggression when it comes. There is no
need to repeat the stern warning that I expressed the other day, that I believe Russia
intends to try to conquer the world-either by
treachery, as she is doing now with the aid of
nitwits in different countries, or openly and
by force, or perhaps by both methods. Whatever she chooses to do, we have got to be
ready.
Then there is the appropriation of $300
million which may be used for the purposes
of the North Atlantic Treaty. Because of lack
of information, there is not much that I can
say about this vote. I tried unsuccessfully to
get the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) to disclose what our liabilities are
under the treaty. I hoped the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) would, tell
me, but again I was disappointed. Then I felt
sure the senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) would give some facts on the subject, but he also breathed not a word about
it. We must have some obligations under the
treaty. We are asked to vote $300 million in
the dark, without knowing what it is to be
used for, other than that some of it may be
spent on arms or other materials to assist
friendly nations in Europe. In my own mind
I question whether this vote should not have
been postponed until after the United Nations
meeting has been held and we know what we
shall be required to furnish in arms, ammunition and men.
Let no one have any doubt that under the
North Atlantic Treaty we shall be expected
to furnish men for fighting in Europe. If
the treaty means anything at all, we are
going to have to send to Europe not only
arms and ammunition, but fighting men. In
a news(paper this morning I read that
scientific weapons and methods would make
it possible to conduct war with relatively
few men. Well, if proof were needed to
demonstrate the unsoundness of that idea,
it has been furnished in Korea. Despite all
the airplanes, battleships and scientific
weapons at their command, the United
Nations forces have been backing up steadily

today is whether the beach-head at Pusan

pleasure ta the explanations which will be
given in committee.
Borne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, this
appropriation bull has to do with war expenditures, and it is one w*hich the house has
no alternative -but to pass. Nevertheless,
we should be conscious of the fact that we
are takin-g the flrst step of a j ourney dowrn
a long road, the e.nd of which we cannot
now see.
Persons who have observed international
affairs over the past few years are conscîous
of the f act that there has been a gradual
deterioration in conditions during that time.
There have been hopes that the world might
escape another cataclysm such as the recent
world war, that the United Nations organization might in some way prepare the road to
permanent peace. Those hopes are now vanishing, and we are faced with the grim fact
that war in the future can only be avoided
through the building up as rapidly as possible
of the defences of the freedom-loving countries. It is scarcely necessary for me to
emphasize that situation to honourable members of this house.
Facing a grim, future, as we do, it seems to
me that this is a good time to take stock o!
our own position. I am not very much con~cerned about the problemn raised by the
honaurable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
respecting the use to which our manpower
may be put. I arn more concerned about the
fact that the waging of war today is a tremendously costly business. The cost per man
of prosecuting the Second World War was
easily double that of carrying on the First
World War; and it is a safe prediction that if,
unhappily, another war should come about,
the cost o! it will be much greater than that o!
the war of 1939-45. That means, honourable

senators, that a tremendous burden will be
thrown upon the economies of ail the countries engaged in such a war.
I hold firmly to the view that it is the part
of wisdom for this parliament and for the
Canadian people to pay as they go as much
of the costs as possible. 1 have a horror of
increasing debt, because as debt and inflation
grow it is the innocent people of this country
who, suifer most. I refer to those who
through their savîngs and the purchase of
annuities have endeavoured to provide against
the needs of the day when they can no longer
work. They have the least voice in the aifairs
of the country today; yet they will suifer
heavily.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The middle-class people,
or, if you like, the lower middle-class people,
have done much of the work of this country.
They have looked after our municipal business in ail its phases; they are the ones who
for the most part have-kept our churches and
educationai institutions going and today, because of increased taxation and the inflationary processes which a great war or vast

baose, they are the ones who wiil suifer most.
It is a saf e calculation that within the next
twelve rnonths the commonwealth countriesthat includes Great Britain-the United States
and the western European countries will
probably spend as much as $35 billion for
defence. Let us flot deiude ourselves that
the amount we are votîng today wiil cover
ail our expenditures. It is just the commencement of expenditures. We will be asked at
the next session of parliament to vote substantially larger amounts than we voted at
the last session plus the present appropriation.
One of the great tasks which governiments
today face is that of relieving as f ar as
possible the eifects of inflation. This can
ta a large extent be done by taxation; but if
we are going to meet increasing obligations
for the cost of defence and at the saine Urne
maintain our current high stanidard of living,
we will plaçe upon this country an unbearable
burden of taxation.
My first suggestion is that the federal gavernment, ail the provincial governments and
every municipal body in this country should
pare to the bone their running expenses. I
do not wish to say anything against the
policy of social security, for we have gone
a long way in that direction. But if we
examine the costs of ail our governments,
under the general heading of social security
benefits, including soldiers' ailowances and
veterans' pensions, we will flnd that this
country of only 14 million people is probably

SENATE

spending well over $1 billion a year. How
far can we go in maintaining these services,
and at the same time meet the huge expenditures needed to cope with the most vital
question that concerns us? The old-age pension or the family allowance is not of much
value to a man if in the end, he loses his
freedom, liberty and right of self-government. That is the great issue at stake today
in the gigantic struggle which is taking place
throughout the world. It is not so much a
test between East and West as a test between
two vital concepts of life. On the one hand is
the opportunity for man to achieve selfdevelopment in all possible directions, so long
as he does not injure his neighbours; and on
the other hand is the possibility that he will
become a slave and a mere cog in the vast
mechanism of government in a police state.
That is the issue at stake, and it is with the
hope of preserving peace in the end that
the freedom-loving nations are girding on
their armour against the powers of darkness.
This is going to cost us dearly, and so I
should like the Canadian people to become
more aware of these important issues. Let us
not deceive ourselves. The highest possible
sacrifice may be asked of every Canadian, but
I am sure that if our people become clearly
aware of the real issues they will, as ever
in the past, rise to the needs of the hour. I
am convinced that every thinking Canadian
will make this sacrifice because more than
anything else he values the right to live his
own life, free from the interference of any
aristocratie government which may try to
impose itself upon him.
Honourable senators, I support this bill
unreservedly. I feel confident that the government will use its utmost wisdom to see
that value is secured for whatever money it
spends. I hope that every Canadian legislative body, seeing the trouble which rises
before us, will reduce to a minimum the
ordinary costs of administration so that more
of our national income may be directed to
meeting the costs outlined in this bill and
which-make no mistake about it-will
increase in the future.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Arthur

W.

Roebuck:

Honourable

senators, may I highly commend the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) for the eloquent words he has just
spoken about the preservation of liberty and
freedom of our Canadian people. I was
particularly struck by his reference to the
possibility of our citizens becoming, as he put
it, cogs in the mechanism of government. That
is something of which we must be eternally
aware. We do not want our citizens to

become mere flies on some great governmental wheel, and for this reason I think it is
worth while for me to take just a moment
of your time to sound a note of warning
about this matter of police.
The bill before us provides for an appropriation of $2 million for the maintenance of a
police force for the provinces of British
Columbia and Newfoundland. The amount
involved is not large; I am more concerned
about the tendency than about the event. I
suppose that if these two provinces wish to
enter into an agreement with the federal
government about police financing I should
have no objection, but I wish to call the attention of all thoughtful people to the tendency
involved. When I was Attorney-General of
Ontario, I introduced a bill to establish a
central police office or clearing house for the
various police forces of the province. This
bill was attacked by the Conservatives on
the grounds that it would centralize all police
power in the hands of one man, the AttorneyGeneral of the province. Following a debate
of two or three days I withdrew my bill
because of the opposition's attack. It is true
that I was able to argue that in this instance
the centralization of the police forces had no
ulterior or sinister purpose, and that it might
well bring about greater efficiency in the
policing of the province; nevertheless, I withdrew my bill following the strong arguments
put forth by the opposition.
The leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) has pointed out that the provinces
will not be able to fully meet the cost of the
services to be rendered to them by the
R.C.M.P. Thus, I take it, the good citizens
of these provinces, in order to save a few
dollars and perhaps improve their police
system, are transferreing a certain power
which was ,placed in their hands by the
Fathers of Confederation. I have mentioned
two good arguments in favour of centralizing
the control of police forces, but I have an
abiding faith in the local' police forcesHon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck:-just as I have in local
school trustees who are close to their people.
Efficiency is not necessarily the last word
in police administration.
Sometimes the
fanatical and over-efficient policeman is most
dangerous, and not infrequently the easygoing policeman is the better of the two. I
favour the man who knows his people, who
feels that his control is close to him, and
who acts in accordance with the sentiment of
the small community in which he operates.
Local control which is in tune with those
who suffer under the authorities, is a consideration far superior to efficiency or the
saving of a little money. I do hope that my
province of Ontario will never enter into

SEPTEMBER 11, 1950
an agreement of this kind, but will spend the
necessary funds to maintain a local police
force. I hope that the democratic control
of the police forces of our country will
remain with our municipal councils, and
not be centred in the parliament buildings at
Ottawa. One of the strongest means of protection against the insidious drift towards
centralization and tyranny is local control of
the police forces. The whole of Russia was
subjugated through a successful attack upon
the police of Leningrad: when the police there
revolted and transferred to the revolutionists
the arms they required, the present dictatorship of Russia was set up. I am not anticipating anything of that kind in Canada, but I
do say that a centralized police force located
in the city of Ottawa is much more amenable
to such a coup than are, say, a thousand
police forces in the municipalities throughout
our country.
Provinces which have decided to dispense
with their own police forces must be presumed to know what they want, so I have no
intention at all of voting against this appropriation of $2 million. But I think it has
been worthwhile to sound at least this note
of warning and to express the hope that my
own province of Ontario will refrain from
placing itself under thé jurisdiction of a
centralized police force.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable members,
it was not my intention to say anything in
this debate, but the remarks of the senator
who has just spoken prompt me to point out
that the people of British Columbia are not
entirely in agreement with what is being done.
Many of them feel that the arrangement was
"put over" by the powers that be at Victoria.
I took occasion to publicly warn every municipality in British Columbia to hang on to its
police force, pointing out that there would be
some danger in, having control centralized at
Ottawa, three thousand miles away.
What I am wondering is, who made the
approach to have the change brought about?
In the light of info'mation gained during
many sessions spent in Ottawa, I believe the
approach came from the authorities here, who
are trying their best to take over the police
in every province. It is not the province that
has appealed to the.Royal Canadian Mounted
Police to have itself included within their
jurisdiction. Oh, no! But certain authorities
here who are desirous of exercising greater
control have for the past ten years at least
been proposing to the various Attorneys
General that provincial police be transferred
to the R.C.M.P.
In my province although there has been an
occasional statement as to what the cost of
the new service will be, the agreement
between the provinces and the R.C.M.P. has
69266-8

never been made widely public. So I say to
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
that I hope it will be possible to have some
questions answered in committee. I agree
with and commend the remarks made by the
senator from Toronto Trinity (Hon, Mr.
Roebuck).
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I disagree with the last two speakers. The
Royal Canadian Mounted Police is recognized
as the greatest police force in the world. No
province that has its police work done by the
R.C.M.P. has cause to regret the arrangement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I congratulate the people
of Newfoundland and of British Columbia
upon inviting the R.C.M.P. to take charge of
the policing of those provinces. For some
years now our province of Nova Scotia has
been policed by the R.C.M.P., and we never
before had such efficiency. Members of the
force are educated, equipped and organized to
deal with all classes of criminals, and they
can do this work better than any provincial
police force. With all due respect to the
provincial police of Ontario, of British
Columbia or any other province, I consider
the R.C.M.P. to be the best police force that
we could possibly get, and I should like to see
it functioning in every province of Canada.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Roebuck: If I may have the
indulgenceThe Hon. the Acting Speaker: The honourable gentleman from Halifax-Dartmouth (Mr.
Isnor) has the floor.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I have
no objection if the senator from Toronto
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) desires to make
any observation bearing on his former
remarks.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I only wish to point out
that I have voiced no criticism of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. As a matter of
fact, I hold the force in the highest regard.
Hon. Mr. Reid: So do I.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I
hesitate to take part in this debate, particularly in view of the eloquent remarks made
by the senators from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I say that with all due respect to
others who have spoken. I wish to deal
briefly with the principle of the bill and the
effect of one or two clauses upon the section
of the coun'try from which I come.

SENATE
But first I should like to support what has
been said by the senator from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn) as to the efficiency of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the
province of Nova Scotia. I recall very well
that in 1928 or 1929 the province was con-

sidering whether it would continue its own
police force or enter into a contract for the
services of the R.C.M.P. It was brought out
then that not only would the R.C.M.P. bring
about greater efficiency-and I am satisfied on
that score-but that the province would save
considerable money under the proposed agreement. The cost of the provincial force was
a question very much to the front at the time.
If I remember the figures correctly, for a
provincial force of one hundred men the
annual outlay was $263,000, whereas the services of the same number of men in the
R.C.M.P. could be obtained for $150,000.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The saving was a mess
of pottage.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: My honourable friend is
wrong. The provincial government no doubt
took the saving into account, but it also had
regard to the question of efficiency and the
general over-all picture of policing the province. An arrangement was entered into, and
ever since then we have had exceptionally
good service from the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. Therefore I am happy to
associate myself with the remarks of my honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax. In the
past we have disagreed on some matters,
which I need not mention at the moment, but
there were never any hard feelings because
of that. Victory would sometimes go to one
side and sometimes to the other, and he and
I always maintained a fine spirit of friendship.
In our own part of the country we are regarded as political opponents, but, as I say,
I am happy to associate myself with what he
has said on this occasion.
Honourable senators, the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has referred to
the heavy expenditures that are being made,
and he wonders whether the government is
going to practise economy. I hope that it will.
for $850 million is a very large amount of
money. As a member of the Public Accounts
Committee of the other house during various
sessions I had an opportunity to scrutinize
expenditures very closely, and I always felt
that in governments, as in business organizations, there were bound to be some expenditures open to question, but that on the whole
the public funds of Canada were being
properly expended.
In a reference to war expenditures, the honourable leader opposite criticized the government for its disposition of surplus supplies

and equipment. I feel that if my honourable
friend had been as closely associated with
the War Expenditures Committee as I was,
and had listened to the arguments advanced
by experts and members of the armed forces,
he would have concluded, as I did, that the
government can no more afford to keep on
hand obsolete equipment than can a merchant
who is left with poor stock. Not only did the
government dispose of its surplus equipment
and supplies, but in many instances it
received exceptionally good prices for what
we would call bargain merchandise. Further,
the plants which were sold were converted
for peacetime purposes, thus providing employment for a large body of Canadian labour.
In my opinion, the policy of the government in
that regard contributed greatly to the maintaining of the highest employment level in
the history of our country.
In some isolated instances certain plants
and equipment should perhaps have been
retained; but I for one was not an expert
in this field, and I took the advice of those
who were supposed to know what might be
expected to be of use in future wars. On
the strength of the advice given, the committee approved of the action taken by the
stores branch of the armed forces. In my
opinion the government followed a wise policy
in disposing of its war surpluses as it did,
through the War Assets Corporation.
Although I am aware that my remarks at
this time should be directed to the principle
of the bill, I want to deal with one particular
clause of the measure before us. The leader
of the government, in introducing the bill,
touched on various sections; I propose to deal
only with clause 3. Subsection 1 of that clause
provides that the Governor in Council may
. . . authorize the production, acquisition, repair
and provision of equipment, services, supplies and
facilities, for the use of the naval, army and air
services of the Canadian forces and the armed forces
of any party to the North Atlantic Treaty . . .

In dealing with the particular subsection,
I think it would be proper for me to refer
to bill 3, which was passed last Saturday;
and I should like, if I am permitted, to touch
on the bill now being considered by the
other house. All these measures are closely
allied, having to do with the purchase, distribution and allocation of supplies and.monies
for war purposes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On a point of order. I do
not object to the honourable gentleman referring to the bill now in the other place, but,
to offset any criticism in the future for failure
on my part to complain, I want it understood
that in doing so he is completely out of order.

SEPTEMBER 11, 1950
As far as I am concerned, I consent to the
honourable gentleman discussing the allied
measure at this time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I think the
honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Isnor) should confine himself to the bill before
the house.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Mr. Speaker, in reply to
the honourable leader opposite, I shall
endeavour to deal only with two bills, namely
bill 3 which has been passed, and the bill
now before the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend is
still out of order in referring to a bill which
this house has already passed. He had a
right to speak to the measure when it was
before the house on Saturday last, he did
not do so. I am quite willing to consent to
his proceeding under the circumstances, but I
say that he is out of order in doing so.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Mr. Speaker, as I said a
moment ago, I am quite willing to admit that
I am out of order in discussing a bill now
before the other house, but I think that I have
the right to refer to a measure which we have
already passed.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Go ahead.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: The honourable gentleman may refer to the fact that the
bill contained certain provisions and that it
was passed by the house; but beyond that be
should not discuss the measure.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
in fairness to the honourable gentleman from
Halifax, I should point out that these three
measures are closely integrated, and that
during the rather rapid disposition of the
legislation on Saturday last I suggested that,
so far as I was concerned, I w$ould not object
to related matters being brought up for discussion later.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And the leader of the
opposition did not object to that.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Did not that suggestion
apply only to the consideration of the bill
in -committee when the minister was present?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think I appreciate the
feeling of the chamber, Mr. Speaker, and I
will endeavour to confine my remarks to
the bill before the house, notwithstanding my
view regarding the proper procedure.
I have stated that I want to deal with
section 3 of the bill, and in doing so I should
like to point out to honourable senators
that this measure and the two other bills
referred to authorize huge expenditures
which will, for the most part, be spent in
the industrial centre of Canada. The large
amounts involved prompt me to call the
69266-8à

attention of the leader of the government in
this house to the desirability of an equitable
distribution of the expanding industrial activities, so as to benefit the extreme east and
west, and the Prairie Provinces.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The fact is that of Canada's
population of 14 million odd 34 per cent is
in Ontario and about 32 per cent in Quebec.
I shall refer to this area containing approximately 66 per cent of our total population as
the industrial centre of Canada. British
Columbia has about 10 per cent of the total
population, and the remaining 24 per cent
is scattered throughout the rest of the
country. In the light of these facts, honourable senators will realize why it is that I
am concerned as to where this $850 million
will be spent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It must also be remembered that in the industrial centre, containing about 65 per cent of the population,
there is a corresponding percentage of production and wages, for where you have
production you are bound Ito have spending
power. Thus it is that industrial production
is centered in Ontario and Quebec, particularly within a radius of one hundred miles
of Toronto and Montreal. The honourable
leader of the government should bear these
facts in mind, and impress upon the Minister of Trade and Commerce and the Minister
of National Defence that when spending this
vast amount of money through the Canadian
Commercial Corporation-which is the purchasing branch of the Department of National
Defence-they should give greater consideration to industries situated in the extreme
East and West of Canada.
I should like to discuss for a moment the
Dartmouth-Bedford Naval Magazine. I do
not wish to relate to honourable senators
what they already know about the Halifax
explosion of 1917, which took 1,600 lives.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: And blinded 700 persons.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes. And everyone knows
about the explosion which took place there
in 1945. The people who were injured or
killed in these explosions could properly be
classified as war casualties. Despite these
explosions Halifax played a most important
part in both world wars, but things are not
so good for Haligonians today. I do not
like to advertise this fact, but apart from
housing construction Halifax does not have
the industries it should have in proportion
to the over-all industrial production and
wealth of this country. I am anxious that
at this time the Maritime Provinces should

SENATE
share in Canada's spending power, and I
think it is an opportune time to bring to the
attention of the leader of the government
the facilities of the Eastern Passage Airport.
I have been told that one day last week as
many as 720 airplanes landed at this airport. Honourable members will recall that
only a short time ago it was claimed that
certain types of aircrafit could not land there,
and I raise this question now so that this
important airfield may be put in proper shape
to enable any type of aircraft to land on it.
I recall that in 1942 or 1943 it was drawn
to the attention of the Minister of National
Defence, the late Colonel Ralston, that a
bottleneck condition existed at Fairview.
The dangers of this condition were pointed
out, and it was said that in case of an
emergency, such as the Halifax explosion, the
authorities would not know what had happened. I am drawing this situation to the
attention of the government in the hope that
the Department of National Defence will see
fit to co-operate with the Canadian National
Railways in widening this bottleneck and in
making an adequate road which would serve
the city in the event of emergency.
I should like to draw attention to the
Debert and Aldershot army training centres
in Nova Scotia, which after World War II were
left in a rather dilapidated condition. If the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
had referred particularly to camps of the type
of the two just mentioned, and to the action
that should have been taken by the government to maintain them, I would have supported his argument. I think the Department
of Defence should consider taking action to
bring these camps up to a proper standard.

In the past the question has been raised as
to whether Nova Scotia had any industries
which could benefit from war expenditures.
I would point out to honourable members
that during the last war there was spent in
Nova Scotia, only about one per cent of the
total war expenditure in Canada by the federal government. Today we have the Fairey
Aviation Company, a firm, long-established
in England, but new to Canada. It operates
at Dartmouth and is able to manufacture as
well as service aircraft. Therefore, I hope
part of the money to be expended on airplanes will find its way to their very important industry at Dartmouth. Then there is the
Cussor Radar Company, and many other
companies, which could be of real service in
the present emergency period. I need not
mention the value of our shipbuilding, steel
industries, and so on, but I want to re-emphasize the fact that Canada's industries are for
the most part centred in Ontario and Quebec.
I should like the leader here to inform the
Minister of Trade and Commerce that our
section of the Maritime Provinces is hopeful
that it will enjoy a fair portion of the expenditures contemplated in this bill.

is known as inflation, is of course most controversial and most interesting, because of
its very wide application throughout the community; and if honourable senators will bear
with me, I shall discuss for a few minutes
this matter of rising prices, the cause of the
trend, and possible means of offsetting it.
What we call "inflation", though it is really
price inflation, is the rising value measured
in money of goods of all kinds. Unfortunately
its effect on the cost of living is rather too
well known to us all. To the low-income
classes it has proved and is proving somewhat
of a national disaster; and I think it is generally conceded to be undesirable in its effects
upon all classes of the community. I believe
responsible statesmen in all parties will agree
that, in the interests of business, for thq sake
of those whose incomes are fixed, and of
housewives and those who maintain homes in
our communities, it is undesirable that the
prices of commodities shall reach exorbitant
figures.
There are two factors in this matter of
price: one, the value of the goods sold; and
two, the value of the money used in purchases. Many people do not realize this,
although they see that the value of goods
and the price of goods are associated. If the
value of goods goes up because of an increase
in demand or of a lessening supply, prices
rise; and if the purchasing power of money
decreases because of an increase in the
amount tendered for purchases, again the
price rises. Conversely, if the supply of goods
exceeds the demand, or if the supply of money
is less than the supply of goods offered, prices
f all.
Honourable senators will observe, as I
have remarked, that there are two factors in
price: the goods offered for sale and the
money offered for purchase-not necessarily
the money used for purchase but the money
tendered or ready to be tendered, which, of
course, by rule of competition, affects the
price.
One of the most valuable documents to
come into the hands of honourable members
is the report of the Royal Commission on
Prices, otherwise known as the Curtis Report,
dated at Ottawa on March 18, 1949. I may
say to my honourable colleagues that this
document is well worthy of their study. I
should like to quote from the Summary of
Volume II, the Economics of Rising Prices:
We are concerned in this report with a general
rise in prices which is commonly called "price
How does inflation
inflation" or just "inflation."
come about? Briefly, it is a symptom of too much
spending in relation to the available supply of goods
and services, or, to use an overworked but expressive phrase, it is a case of "too much money
chasing too few goods."

That is an excellent phrase-"too much money
chasing too few goods".
The report continues:
Once full employment has been attained, the
attempt to increase spending by more than the increase in average output per worker is bound to
raise the general level of prices . . . spending by
businessmen for capital investment puts money into
the pockets of wage and salary earners and businessmen who work on the projects or supply the
materials. So unless adequate counter measures are
taken, or there are some other offsetting influences,
the chase of money after goods begins. The resulting competitive bidding-up of wages and prices
adds to the incomes and to the general willingness
to spend. Thus the spiral of rising prices moves
upward.
Rising prices can be cured only by removing the
excess of demand over supply. Any other proposed
remedy, no matter how different it looks, can
succeed only if it somehow or other increases the
supply of goods or decreases the rate of spending.

The report goes on to outline some of the
things that governments may do by way of
offsetting such a trend.
Government policy can operate in several ways to
reduce the volume of spending, namely, by:
1. Levying higher taxes which have the effect of
leaving less money in the hands of the public for
spending.

We all

from

prospective

purchasers of goods the wherewithal, or at
least a portion of it, with which they could
buy goods.
2. Discouraging borrowing and the raising of capital, e.g., by higher interest rates and by putting
indirect pressure on the banking system to curtail
lending.
3. Encouraging saving and the deferring of expenditures, e.g., by government bond selling campaigns
and by postponement of its own capital expendi-

tures.

4. Controlling prices and supplies and thus making
it illegal for people to spend as much as they would
otherwise have done.

I turn to page 17 of the report in which

the authors say:
In theory, fiscal and monetary action alone can
prevent a general rise in prices. All that is required
is a policy which reduces purchasing power and
otherwise restricts expansion in the money supply
and the rate of spending to the point where money

demand is equal to the available supply ...

The report then goes on to mention the
practical difficulties in carrying out such a
policy, but there lies the principle-on the
one hand, a reduction in the amount of
money in the hands of would,-be purchasers
or the temporary laying aside or saving of
money by them; or, on the other handý, an
increase in the production of goods.

I have already said and, in view of the
excellent authority just quoted I think it

SEPTEMBER 12. 1950
worth saying again, that the average person
when faced with the undesirable factors of
rising prices naturally wishes to regulate
prices in some 4 way. He sees the price tags
on the commodities that he wants, and if he
could invoke the powers of government to
change the figures on the tags his end would
be achieved. But in my submission that is
not the most desirable method of procedure.
It will be recalled that after the war ended
a number of senators, of whom I was one,
spoke in this chamber against price controls
and demanded that they be discontinued to
as great a degree as possible and as soon as
possible. Our friends across the aisle agreed
with us at the time; I well remember that
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
took the same stand I did. I notice now,
however, evidence from the opposition
benches of, perhaps, a slight change in thinking. The C.C.F. was always strong for controls. Personally, I am not; I should like
to see them disappear. In my hand I have
a statement by a very eminent authority on
this point of the arbitrary control of prices
and the undesirable effects that follow from
it. I should like to read a brief passage:
Direct controls, of themselves, do not cure any-

thing; indeed, they may often do more harm than
good. At best, direct controls can do little more
than contain for a time the pressure of demand.
Price control in any form, however, is no substitute
for action designed to bring over-all demand into
line with over-all supply. It disguises inflation. It
does not remove the cause of the trouble. A policy
of direct controls of necessity develops an appetite
that grows by what it feeds on. Finally, a widespread system of direct controls, no imatter how
skilfully and honestly adinnistered, requires a huge
and burdensome bureaucracy. Under less severe
conditions direct controls of prices, wages, production and distribution-and they are inseparable-are
incompatible with a free society and a free economy.
The authority for that statement is the pres-

ent Minister of Finance, and the words were
spoken recently. Surely he should know
that what he said was right.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Have you given the reference?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I quote the minister as
authority for the statement, but I do not think
it would be proper to give the reference. I
believe I am witihin the rules in taking that
course.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I understand.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The minister should
have a good knowledge of the subject with
which he was dealing. He was one of those
who took part in the administration of controls during the last war, when we had- a
very extensive experience with them-and I
suppose in similar circumstances the experience would be repeated. I am not criticizing

his position; I am simply mentioning the
undesirableness of controls and pointing out
that it is better to adopt some other method,
if one is available.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Are you suggesting any?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Of course I am. That
is my thesis. I think that controls have been
tolerated often in the past, and I suppose will
be in the future, only because of the serious

consequences of excessively rising prices to
the national economy.
I have tried to lay a foundation for what
I have yet to say. I have already mentioned
that there are two factors in the problemcommodities, on the one hand; and money
on the other. And as the quotations I have
given would indicate, it is possible to control
money as well as price.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable senator allow me? Is there not also an alternative
in the production of more goods which are in

demand?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Vien: To what degree does this
bill encourage additional production of goods
which may be in short supply?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It does not encourage that
at all; that is not the purpose of this bill. No
doubt other legislation will provide for what
my friend suggests. I understand that there
is a measure to come before us on the subject
of materials and services. I do not wish to
discuss that. What I am discussing is the
money approach to this problem of rising
prices, not the commodity approach.
I should like to point out here that, for the
purposes at all events of this discussion,
money is not confined to coins and what some
people call folding money. Those things are
promises by a government to pay at some
future time; they are negotiable, and they
constitute money because they have purchasing power. But there are other forms of
purchasing power besides coins 'and folding
money. When a banker enters a credit to
some individual in his book he places that
individual in a position to buy, gives him
purchasing power, and that purchasing power
in some of its aspects is quite similar to, if
not exactly the same as, coins or paper
currency. For instance, when a finance corporation gives its paper to a purchaser for
use in the purchase of an autombile, it is
creating money, because the credit of the
corporation is regarded as of value, and the
note in its application to the relationship
between commodities and money, has the same
effect as if the government printed dollar
bills.

Section 2 of the bill contains the definitions, the first of which is "charge account".

No doubt most of our wives have one.
Briefly, "charge account", means an agreement or an arrangement whereby the buyer
gets possession of goods on the condition
that any unpaid balance shall be due and
payable in a lump sum. By paragraph (b)
"consumer goods" mean,
-any

goods or class of goods declared by the

Governor in Council to be consumer goods for the
purposes of this Act.

The government by that definition is taking

a very liberal right, in that it may control
any class of goods if the competition appears

to be too strong, or for any other reason.

(b) the repayment of loans wholly or partially
secured on consumer goods purchased by the borrower at retail;
(c) the repayment of loans, the proceeds of which
are used to pay for consumer goods purchased by
the borrower at retail.
That is to say, if after the passage of this

bill one of my honourable colleagues were
to request a loan from a bank for the purpose of buying some of the goods referred
to in one of the orders in council, he might
be committing an offence, namely, borrowing
for the purpose of buying on credit or of
buying for cash and paying later, which is
the same as buying on credit.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The question is a good
one, and I propose to refer to the constitutional aspect, but I do not think it would be
wise to do so at the moment. By the way, an
amendment was made to the bill as introduced, and some words were added. Section

to be published in the Canada Gazette.

Hon. Mr. Vien:

Is it proposed that an

offence shall be created by regulation? In this
bill it is stated that the Governor in Council
may by regulation determine that this or that
violation of regulations is an offence under
the Act, and prescribe penalties. Is it usual
in federal legislation to create offences by
regulation, not by statute?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think the answerwhich I tender with respect-is yes. I have
in mind, for instance, the Post Office Act,
under which the Postmaster General is permitted to make regulations and provide
penalties. It is not even necessary to proceed by Order in Council. I think it will be
found that in every Act which gives power
for the creation of a prohibition, so that it is
an offence to do something, penalties are provided; and frequently it will be found that the
regulations shall specify what is to be the
penalty. It is a fairly general practice to let
the Governor in Council not only specify the
prohibited act but provide the penalty.

Hon. Mr. Vien: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, there is no doubt
that there is plenty of precedent for so doing.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It often happens that the
Governor in Council is empowered to pass

regulations to make an Act workable, and a
breach of such regulations may .constitute an
offence; but

this bill.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, I suppose that is

a question on which each of us will decide
according to his own experience and reading.
I do not think this procedure is very unusual.

Hon. Mr. Vien: I think this bill goes further
in that direction than any which has preceded it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A little way, perhaps.
It is true that pretty wide powers to create
offences are given, but certainly not without
precedent.
The phraseology respecting the expiry of
the Act is a little unusual. As a rule, measures of this kind have no termination date;
they remain in force until they are repealed.
Some of the statutes in which a terminal date
appears are laconic in that regard: they
specify that termination shall be at a certain
date, which may be amended by parliament
if it so desires. In this bill, however, a new
procedure is provided: the Act shall terminate
at a certain time unless, upon addresses of
the Senate and the House of Commons, the
Governor in Council orders that it be continued in force for a further period. The
purpose of this provision, as explained to
me, is that the government wishes it to be
clearly understood that at a certain date the
legislation shall be reviewed if it is proposed
that it shall be continued.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Otherwise it will come to
an end.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or it will corne to an
end. By this section they tell the people of
Canada and us in this legislature that one
year from next July either they will not act
or they will act. Either the measure will then
expire, or, if it is to continue, we shall have
an opportunity to voice our opinions and to
consent to its continuance. I do not see how
anybody can object to that course. Perhaps
some question could be raised as to the
length of time before the Act can be reconsidered; but after all, it is less than two
years.
In my opinion no harm will result from
this measure. Some people hold the opinion
that borrowing has been resorted to rather too
freely of recent years. I cannot imagine that
anybody will be denied an essential commodity by reason of the administration of
this Act. It may make it a little harder to
buy diamonds or radios or washing machines.
It may in some cases compel people to save
their money until they have the funds to buy
something they require, instead of buying
first and then starting to pay off their
indebtedness, including interest and other
charges. A person is rarely injured by having
to make a larger deposit or to repay his debt
at a faster rate. On the other hand, many
people will be benefited by restraints upon
too ready borrowing and running into debt.
Most of us have learned to our sorrow in the
course of our long careers that debt is not a
desirable thing; yet of recent months we as
a people have gone far in that direction.
Let me give some figures from a statement compiled by the Bureau of Statistics.

As to cash sales, the figures are as follows:
per cent
Increase 1st quarter 1948 to 1st quarter 1949 .. 2-3
Increase lst quarter 1949 to lst quarter 1950 .. 4-0
Although there has been a very desirable
and satisfactory increase in cash sales, it has
been moderate in the past two years.
Now, let us take instalment sales. As to
these the statement shows:
per cent
Increase lst quarter 1948 to lst quarter 1949 12-3
Increase lst quarter 1949 to lst quarter 1950 26.9
Honourable senators will notice that there
is here an increase in instalment sales >of 26 -9
per cent. That is very important, and it is
too big a percentage to laugh at.
On the other hand, as to charge accounts,
where payments are either made immediately
or perhaps at the end of the month, the figures
show the following increases:
per cent
Increase lst quarter 1948 to lst quarter 1949 ..
Increase lst quarter 1949 to lst quarter 1950 ..

3-5
3-0

Here the increase is very slight as compared
with the total amount of increased volume.
Let us then compare the days' credits that
were outstanding at the end of this year with
those outstanding at the end of last year. On
March 31, 1948, there were 141 days' credit
outstanding on instalment purchase accounts.
In other words, at that time on all instalment
contracts in Canada there was an average of
141 days remaining in which payment was to
be made.

Hon. Mr. Nicol: How much of that was for
consumer goods?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That was all for consumer goods.

Hon. Mr. Nicol: How do you know?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They are instalment purchases, and I understand, because the Bureau
of Statistics was dealing with consumer goods
when gathering these facts and figures.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Might not houses or
farms be included in that?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Or farm implements?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am always ready to
be corrected, but I do not think so. I have no
authority for saying so too dogmatically, but
I am pretty sure that that is not so. I have

stated that the number of days outstanding on
March 31, 1948, was 141. On March 31, 1949,
the number of days outstanding was 170, and
by March 31, 1950, the number of days outstanding had increased to 200. That is to

SEPTEMBER 12, 1950
say, the credit not only increased by the percentages I have mentioned, but the time of
re-payment also increased very materially.
Let us take the figures of the retail financing
of consumer goods-and there is no doubt
that these are consumer goods. The retail
filnancing of consumer goods by finance and
acceptance companies in 1948 amounted to
$122,522,000. 'By 1949 this had grown to
$190,574,000, an increase of 55-5 per cent,
which is no small increase.
The balances outstanding with finance and
acceptance companies on consumer goods
paper had reached $70,45-1,000 by the end of
1948, and $115,977,000 by the end of 1949, an
increase of 64-6 per cent.
I submit, therefore, that this legislation, if
it has the effect of reducing these instalment
purchases to some degree, will do little harm
to anyone and will accomplish a useful
purpose.
We had some experience with this kind
of legislation during the last war, and it
may be that the experience gained then will
be of very little guidance to us in what is
proposed here. Honourable senators will
observe that the Act only gives authority to
the Governor in Council to specify the commodities and to limit the loans. The Act does
not do this in itself, so one naturally turns back
and asks what was done during the Second
Great War. But it would be a mistake to
assume that what was done then will necessarily be done now. If a person bought an
automobile at that time he had to make a
down-payment of one-third of the price of
the vehicle, and there was a minimum down
payment of $25. On other goods a down payment of one-fifth of the total purchase price
was required, with a minimum of $5. The
maximum period of credit given in those
years was six months for wearing apparel,
except furs, ten months for all goods where
the amount financed was less than $500, and
fifteen months when the amount financed was
over $500.
Some information as to the effectiveness of
the legislation during the war years may
also be of interest. Over the period from
1941 to 1945 the total sales of consumer goods
in Canada increased by 36 per cent, whereas
instalment sales decreased by 41 per cent.
There was more than one reason for that
decrease. The restrictive elements of the legislation were in existence at that time. There
was also a decrease in the amount of consumer goods affected by the legislation
because, as honourable senators will recall,
manufacturing plants turned from the production of consumer goods to the production of
war goods.
I have observed by the press that the
United States is introducing legislation similar

to the bill before us. An honourable senator
has asked me about the .constitutional aspects
of this bill. I submit that quite aside from any
war powers given to the Dominion Government under the peace, order and good government provision of the British North America
Act, there are plenty of powers given under
section 91 of that Act. I refer to such classes
of subjects as currency and coinage, banking,
incorporation of banks, the issue of paper
money, savings banks, bills of exchange and
promissory notes, interest, and legal tender.
Anticipating that some honourable senator
would ask me that question, I took the trouble
to find some legal authority on the subject.
I refer to the Canada Supreme Court Reports,
1938, page 100, under the heading "In the
Matter of Three Bills passed by the Legislative
Assembly of the Province of Alberta." The
headnotes to the decisions read in part as
f ollows:
Per Duff, C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and
Hudson, JJ.-Such machinery, as established by The
Alberta Social Credit Act, in its essential cornponents and features, comes under head No. 15,
"Banks and Banking."
Per Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ.-Even if

such legislation is not strictly within the ambit of
No. 14 or No. 15That is, of section 91.
-or partly in one or partly in the other. then this
legislation is ultra vires, as its subject-matter is

embraced within category No. 2 of s. 91, "Regulation of Trade and Commerce."
I doubt that head No. 2 of section 91, "Regulation of Trade and Commerce," is one of the
factors giving us the right to enact this
legislation. However, in the light of the decision I have referred to, I have no doubt at
all as to the constitutionality of this bill, quite
aside from war legislation.
I may have spoken a little rapidly. My
honourable friend asked me whether this was
war legislation and I said it was not. I think
it is legislation brought about by conditions
and anticipated conditions resulting from
trouble in Korea and the possibility of trouble
elsewhere. The word "temporary" is used in
the title of the bill-"An Act to make temporary provision for the regulation of consumer credit." I do not think it is a temporary
provision. In my opinion it will last two years,
irrespective of whether the Korean situation
is cleaned up within the next two weeks or
continues and becomes intensified. The legislation will last for two years anyway, and I
am under the impression that it will remain
in effect after that time. It is social legislation
designed for the purpose of holding down the
excessive increase in prices which has been
so disturbing to our economic life in the last
few years, and which gives signs of being
more disturbing in the future. The bill is
also designed in anticipation of the very

SENATE
considerable expenditures planned by the
government on military equipment, all of
which will tend to provide purchasing power
without at the same time increasing the
supply of consumer goods that take up the
loose cash in the jeans of our fellow citizens.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does the honourable senator
not consider that the constitutionality of the
measure is more strongly supported by the
preamble, which deals not so much with the
social interest of the nation as with defence
preparations?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Vien: After referring to certain
possible developments the preamble says:
... and it may therefore be necessary, as a further
measure to counteract possible adverse effects of
these developments upon such defence preparations ...
I should think that this aspect, rather than
the social welfare aspect, is likely to make
the bill constitutional.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think the honourable
senator is right. I mentioned both aspects.
It may be that one is stronger than the other,
but undoubtedly the purpose of the measure
is, firstly, social-to restrain rising prices;
and, secondly, to influence the flow of commodities into the war effort rather than into
the hands of consumers. Obviously, if you
decrease the number of buyers or the amount
of credit or money or purchasing power in
the hands of buyers, less production will
flow into consumer goods and therefore more
will be available for the war effort.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
after listening to the honourable gentleman
from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) I
have come to the conclusion that this is very
unusual legislation and entirely different
from any previous measure having a similar
objective. I do not intend to go into the
constitutional aspect of the bill. I take it for
granted that the law officers of the Crown
have looked into that matter carefully and
have decided that it is within the powers of
the federal parliament to pass legislation of
this kind.

I have not had much opportunity to
examine the bill, for it came into my hands
only at Il o'clock this morning.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That was when I got it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Then I must congratulate my honourable friend upon the research
he has been able to do in a very short time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is very kind.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No doubt some legislation such as this is necessary at present.
Just how necessary it is perhaps cannot yet

be decided. In my opinion the bill has been
hurriedly drawn and is far from complete.
Senators who have read it will have noticed
that it gives the government and the Minister
of Finance complete blanket authority to do
whatever they think is necessary or whatever
they want to do in controlling the buying of
consumer goods. In that respect it goes, I
think, much farther than any legislation of
this

kind

has

ever

gone

before,

and

if

carried to the extreme it might oblige everyone to pay cash for all purchases. That of
course would interfere greatly with the conduct of business in this country.
My remarks will have to do principally with

the effect of the bill upon Western Canada.
Everyone here knows that up to the 16th of
August we had growing in the prairie prov-

inces perhaps the greatest

crop of wheat

that they have ever produced. It was a
magnificent crop, in many cases standing as
high as a man's arm pits. The grain was
developing into what is known as six-rowed

wheat-that is, three rows on each side of
the head all the way up-and there was a
prospect of harvesting a 40-bushel crop. But
on the 16th of August a great calamity hit
the Western provinces. That night we had
from five to ten degrees of frost, which not
only seriously damaged the crop by lowering
the grade but reduced the yield to about
half of what had been expected. As a result,

the Western provinces will have only about
a 40 per cent crop, and the farmers will not
have much cash. They are going to be obliged
to buy machinery, equipment, refrigerators
and other necessary articles upon the instalment plan. What effect this measure will
have upon these primary producers depends
upon how far it goes. Take the young farmer
just starting up in business. He must acquire
a great variety of machinery, an automobile,

a truck, and perhaps a combine. If he is to
carry on at all, he must buy those goods on
the instalment plan. I do not know whether
this bill permits him to borrow money at
the bank or not, in order to pay cash for the
goods. My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) indicated that the
provisions of this bill might bar him from
doing that.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is power to do so.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Subsection 1 of section
3 of the bill gives the Governor in Council
absolute power to make regulations. I am
pleased, however, that it does not interfere
with the usual practice of instalment buying
of land. As honourable senators know, land is
often bought with a small down payment, the
balance being paid either by instalments of
cash over a term of years or by crop payments. Though farm lands may still be

SEPTEMBER 12, 1950
bought on time, this measure would place
restrictions upon the farmer who wants to
buy equipment on an instalment basis. Very
few farmers can afford to pay for the machinery which they require in less than a year
or even sixteen months. The usual practice
is to make -a down payment and to pay off the
balance over the next two or three years.
We must consider also the position of a
young man who is preparing to get married
and who wants a home of his own. Most of
us in this chamber have been married at
least once, and when we started out we bought
our household goods and furniture on the
instalment plan. Of course in those days
we were young and reckless, and the fact
that it might take two or three years to
liquidate our debts did not bother us. Even
today many of us, especially those who come
from Western Canada, have no more money
than they need.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There are exceptions.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If we try to buy things
on the instalment plan in the face of the
provisions of this bill we may find ourselves
in difficulties.
I offer another illustration as a basis for a
further objection. In my home town in the
province of Saskatchewan there is now being
constructed a very expensive waterworks and
sewage system. Hundreds of the townfolk
will not be able to install the water system,
buy the sinks, bathtubs and other equipment,
unless they are permitted to do so. on a fairly
liberal instalment plan. I should like to know
if the government intends to apply the provisions of this bill in such a way as to prevent these people from modernizing their
homes and enjoying benefits which larger
towns and cities now have.
For the reasons I have given, I am
reluctant to vote for the bill until the extensive powers which it confers have been
clearly defined, so that I will know exactly
what I am voting for. As a western senator,
I should like to know to what extent this
measure will interfere with the development
of the Prairie Provinces. It may be that the
object behind the bill is to prevent a highpressure salesman from persuading the
housewife to buy some gadget on an instalment plan under which she pays a dollar a
month for the rest of her life. If that is the
object contemplated, I am in favour of that
feature of the bill.
I want to voice my objection to the penalties for which the bill makes provision. The
measure sets forth only the maximum penalties, and leaves to the Governor in Council the
power to make regulations as is seen fit. I

think that is bad legislation and bad law, and
we should not agree to it.
If the house is prepared to pass this
measure, I suggest that its life be limited to
a period of one year. By the end of that
time we would know the effect of the
measure, and whether the country favours
the continuation of such legislation. True,
parliament bas the right to review any legislation, but my experience has been that
measures of this kind run on until they
expire. For my part, I hope the government
will see fit to amend section 5 so as to make
the legislation operative for one year only.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators may I add a few words to the debate on
this bill?
Unusual times bring about unusual legislation, and this bill is no exception. If in
normal times the Governor in Council had
asked for power to make regulations restricting consumer goods without spelling out the
scope of the regulations, and sought the
further power to determine what goods are
essential, we would immediately want to
know in detail the purpose of the measure
and to what extent its provisions would, be
used.
In discussing the bill, I do not intend to be
severely critical of it because of the absence
of things which should normally appear in
legislation. My view is that this bill is
intended to meet a temporary situation; by
that I mean until the next session of parliament. If we continue to expand our
defence preparations, and encroach further
upon our economy by channeling civilian
materials to meet the demands of defence,
we must expect within a very shdrt time to
face further restrictions and controls.
This bill cannot be regarded as a cure-all.
It is intended to keep down certain tendencies
which have appeared recently. With that in
mind, I repeat that I do not propose to be
critical of the bill.
There is no doubt that the government has
the authority to enact this legislation. So
far as currency is concerned, section 91 of
the British North America Act puts it within
the federal jurisd-iction. The same section
makes the subject of defence a federal
matter. I would go so far as to say that
even omitting the questions of currency and
defence, which are specifically federal matters, the subject matter of this legislation is
one that concerns not only the national
safety of Canada, but the welfare of all
Canadians. Once that is admitted, there can
no longer be any question of encroachment
upon the provincial field of jurisdiction as
regards property and civil rights. In those

SENATE

circumstances, even in the field of credit
one can envisage both the federal authority
and a provincial authority enacting legislation which could remain operative so long as
it entailed no conflict between the provinces
and the dominion. If a clash should occur,
of course the federal authority would override the other.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) referred to an
Alberta case decided in 1938. In a more
recent judgment that of the Privy Council
in 1947, the right approach to the consideration of this question is clearly spelled out.
I refer to the case of Attorney General of
Ontario vs. Canada Temperance Federation,
Dominion

Law

Reports

(1946),

volume

2.

What the court stated in dealing with the
Canada Temperance Act applies equally here:
In their lordships' opinion, the true test must be
found in the real subject-matter of the legislation:
if it is such that it goes beyond local or provincial
concern or interests and must from its inherent
nature be the concern of the dominion as a whole
(as for example in the Aeronautics Case . . . and
the Radio Case) then it will fall within the competence of the dominion parliament as a matter
affecting the peace, good order and good government of Canada. though it may in another aspect
touch upon matters specially reserved to the provincial legislatures ...
True it is that an emergency may be the occasion
which calls for the legislation, but it is the nature
of the legislation itself, and not the existence of
emergency, that must determine whether it is valid
or not.

So far as I am concerned I do not think that
there is any constitutional question. There
is no doubt as to the right of the federal
parliament to enact this legislation. Rather,
to my mind, the question is, first, as to the
necessity of it; second, whether it should go
as far as it does; and, third, whether the
federal government is doing something which
is an abuse of its authority and, under the
guise of that authority, is encroaching upon
the provincial field? I think that if you apply
those three tests you will have to come to the
conclusion that the Parliament of Canada is
dealing with a problem which is national in
scope.
We members of the Canadian Parliament
have obligations as respects Canada's membership of the United Nations; we have
obligations to our own people; we are influenced by our concern for their safety and
welfare. The problem is plainly a national
one; and while we are not talking in terms
of war, or apprehended war, the protection
of the state and the prevention of war demand
that we put our defences in order. Often
one has to fight harder for peace than for
war. The so-called police action which is
going on in one part of the globe cannot,
from the point of view of any member of the
United Nations, be called war: nevertheless,

people are fighting. One has to keep in mind
the underlying purpose, which is to guarantee
for the free peoples of the world the right
to live and conduct their affairs and practise
their religion in a manner acceptable to them
as socially-minded and cultured human
beings.
As far as this legislation is concerned, there
is no use fooling ourselves; it means control.
To restrict consumer credit is a measure of
control; but, as the government see the matter, under the circumstances it is essential
for the protection of our economy at this time.
They propose to control and regulate the production and use of essential materials and
supplies, because in their opinion it is necessary to do so.
Frankly, I am not sure that this measure
will accomplish all that is expected of it. If
the present situation continues, it will inevitably lead to price, wage and rent controls.

We shall revert to all the controls which
attained their full bloom and vigour in the
last war. This legislation marks the beginning of a trend. We cannot for long go on
doing the things which the government proposes in the pattern of legislation before us
without inevitably reaching a point where
more stringent measures of control will have

to be applied.
Hon. John T. Haig: First, I would congratulate the honourable member for TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) on his very able

presentation, and the honourable member
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who
certainly expressed the reactions to this
legislation of the small man throughout the
country. When the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity began his speech the gallery
was full; half way through, it was empty. I
do not know whether this was because it was
such a good speech or such a bad speech. At
any rate, the audience disappeared.
An Hon. Senator: Perhaps they heard that
you would follow him.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think this legislation will
effect some reduction of purchasing power.
It is not my intention to criticize it, except to
the extent of saying that I do not like the sort
of legislation which confers power on the
government to make regulations and to prescribe punishments for breaches of those regulations. I think that is a wrong principle
altogether. The honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) did not follow
up his objections with a speech, as he might
have done; but he has indicated a method of
procedure which none of us likes.
I agree with the honourable member for
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that
legislation of this kind may be necessary, but
also I agree with the honourable member from

SEPTEMBER 12, 1950
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that the date
of termination might well have been one year
hence. No new legislation would have been
necessary; only a resolution before July 31
next year by the two houses to continue the
statute in force for a further period. Over
long years in this house we have found this
restriction a pretty good one. Remember the
moment this bill becomes law a bureaucracy
will be built up to put it into effect. I do not
say that this is not necessary; but the tendency
to continue such an organization indefinitely
is one which exists, and will have to be
carefully watched. I agree with what the
Minister of Finance said the other evening
when he was dealing with the question of
controls. He struck a high note, a key-note
of sanity, the best I have heard in all the
speeches he has delivered since he came into
office.
For the past three or four years the Government of Canada has released to the people
of Canada credit on a scale never approached
at any previous time. Let me illustrate. It
may be said, "Well, there was necessity for it".
That may be so, but let us discuss for a
moment what the government has done.
Under the National Housing Scheme the government loaned such large sums of money
that during the past six or eight months persons building under the N.H.A. could acquire
houses for extremely small down payments.
This had the effect of releasing credit in a
tremendous way. I am not arguing that our
people were not in need of these houses, but
I am concerned about the credit aspect of the
question.
Another thing the government did was to
tell the banks they could lend money to
farmers to enable them to buy trucks, tractors,
swathers and other farm machinery. The
government guaranteed 15 per cent of the
total loans made by the banks, but did not
guarantee the individual contracts. In other
words, if notes were not paid on $15 million
of a total loan of $100 million, the government
would pay the $15 million. This scheme also
had the effect of letting loose millions of
dollars in Canada. Again I am not arguing
that our farmers were not entitled to receive
any credit, but I am concerned about the
extent of that credit.
Then the government reduced the interest
on Dominion Government bonds to 2î per
cent. The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), in answer to a
question by me, said that if the government
increased the return on bonds to 4 per cent
a lot more of them would be sold. Later the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), argued that this would increase the
cost of living. But it does not do that. It
would affect those who pay income tax, but
the cost of living of a young man who is

supporting a wife and two children on an
income of $2,400 a year would not be
increased, because he does not pay any income
tax.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: What about sales taxes?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They do not come under
this bill, but I warn my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. McKeen) that if this sort of thing
continues he will find out when the next
budget is brought down just how important
income tax is in the tax structure of our
country.
An Hon. Senalor: We already know it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, the
three factors I have mentioned have increased
the spending of money in this country no
end. It might be political dynamite to cut
off credit to the farmers, so that they could
not buy expensive farm machinery, or to curtail loans on housing projects, or to pay 4
per cent on government bonds; but I maintain
that if these things were done they would
result in the saving of more millions of dollars
than will be saved under this legislation.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) recently said that if
I had any solution to the present high cost of
living problem I should off er it to the government. Again I say that this is not my duty,
but I will say that the crux of the problem is
the expenditure of vast amounts of money.
For instance, I was told in one of our standing committees last year that the profits made
under the National Housing Act were turned
over to the government. Perhaps that is
true. But how were those profits made? When
the National Housing scheme was set up the
government transferred to the distributors
under the Act $140 million worth of housing
which it had built in this country during the
war.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: How much did they pay
for that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Not a nickel. They promised that the net profit made every year
would go to the government as payment on
the housing they took over, but there is no
way for the National Housing people to show
a profit until the $140 million worth is used
up. Houses were built in the vicinity of
military camps and war plants between 1942
and 1944, when building costs were about
one-half what they are today; therefore considerable profit was made in the sale of these
houses. I am not criticizing what was done,
but I am saying that it let loose on this country millions of dollars of credit which was
used to purchase goods, and. that consequently
the price of goods went up.

SENATE
What I am trying to get at is this: the bill
only covers the little fellow, the man who is
receiving an income of $2,000 or $2,500 a
year and who wants to get married or buy
a half section of farm land. I do not think
this legislation hits the honourable senators
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen), Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) or Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien). It does not worry people who own
their own homes; it only affects the little
fellow. I think we should give attention to
bigger accumulation of capital.
i recall that from 1942 to 1944 good houses
were selling for only $8,000. In fact, I once
sold the house in which I am now living for
$8,000, but the man who bought it could not
meet the payments and I had to take it back.
Well, the other day I refused $14,000 for it,
and the prospective purchaser was willing to
pay me a little over $14,000 if he could get
immediate possession. Credit has forced up
the purchase price of houses. The minute
the government adopts a credit system it
should cover the whole field.
I notice that in connection with the National
Housing scheme the government claims it
is only going to lend money on the basis of
the prices which prevailed before the latest
increase in the cost of lumber. A young man
wrote to me the other day and told rne he
had to pay $4,000 for a second-hand combine.
That is a lot of money.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What did he buy for $4,000?
Hon. Mr. Haig: A combine.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: A combination thresherHon. Mr. Euler: I know what it is.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I appreciate the arguments
advanced by my honourable friend from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), but like the
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) I
believe that this struggle is far more serious
than most people seem to think it is. This
is the third time in the present short session
that I have expressed that opinion. I fear
that the people of Canada are not awake to
the threat that we face right now. We are
going to have to cut down our standard of
living and our scale of expenditures, and
there will have to be some restrictions on our
free and easy way of life. Canada is a great
country and the standard of living here is
high. Our people are noted for their hospitality, and living accommodation is good for a
young country of only 14 millions. But as
somebody said the other day-I think it was
the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
-there is something more precious than all
that.

Like the member from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), if I thought the passage of this
bill would in the slightest degree help to
protect the liberty that we Canadians enjoy,
I would vote for it, even though I appreciate
the arguments of my honourable friend from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and others.
The senators from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) and Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
apparently have a good deal of influence with
the administration-they speak on all important government measures-and I would
suggest that they urge the appropriate minister to make a study of all prices that have
been increased and see whether some reduction cannot be made in them. I think it is
safe to say that rarely does anyone of us now
ever receive a letter which does not complain
about the high cost of living. Regardless of
the part of the country in which the writer
lives, if he is a thinking person at all he will
mention how high butter has gone, or sugar
or tea, or tires, or some other commodity.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Or beef.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Beef is a luxury which only
few can now enjoy, and then only in very
small quantities.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Except in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: How about Blaine
Lake?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not too critical of
Toronto. It is probably a pretty nice place,
but of course not half as good as Winnipeg.
I urge the government to make a study of
the prices of goods in general and try to
find some way of curbing the rise in the cost
of living, so that the wage earner, farmer,
fisherman, bushworker-in short, the ordinary
small man-may be able to live decently
under present conditions in Canada.
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I would not take strong issue with
some of the points made by the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). I of course agree
with him that this bill attempts to deal with
only one phase of the problem of the steadily
rising cost of living. I agree also that under
this particular bill it would be desirable to
take whatever measures should be taken so
as to regulate consumer credit. He criticized,
among other things, the amount of credit
extended for the building and purchase of
homes. I feel that when action is being
taken under this bill the government should
make regulations governing the terms on
which credit may be obtained for these purposes, and I believe the minister has already
intimated that this will be donc.

SEPTEMBER 12, 1950
I find it more difficult to follow my honourable friend's reasoning as to the interest
on government bonds. He suggested that
the government had forced the rate down to
2t per cent. As I understand it, with my
limited knowledge of these matters, that rate
was fixed because so many people were eager
to buy the government's 3 per cent bonds.
that those securities commanded a premium
on the market and the net yield to purchasers
approximated 2a per cent. In other words,
it became evident that there were plenty of
willing purchasers of governrment bonds
yielding 2î per cent. Of course, if this government had not practised reasonable economy in the administration of the country's
affairs, -and had had to borrow sums far in
excess of what it has been borrowing, it
undoubtedly would have had to raise the
interest rate in order to attract purchasers.
The principle is very elementary. If the
interest rate at the moment is low, it is
because the government has so conducted its
affairs as to avoid the necessity of borrowing
excessively. In any event, I can see no connection whatever between this matter and
my honourable friend's general thesis.
Honourable senators, I should like to take
a few minutes to make one or two general
references to the subject of price control.
My honourable friend says that the government is not exercising sufficient control. The
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) pointed out various aspects of this
problem, and there is no need for me to add
that it is a very difficult one. Let me make
a brief review of what has been done with
respect to controls in recent years. War
broke out in September 1939, but there
was no control of prices for about two years.
In calculating the cost of living index the
average price from 1935 to 1939 is taken as
100, the base index. At the outbreak of war
the figure was 100-8, and by the time controls were first put inta effect, in October
1941, it had risen to 115.5.
In the fall of 1945 the National Emergency
War Measures Act, providing for the continuation of controls in the period of transition from war to peace, was passed. It
continued in force orders in council that
were in effect under the War Measures Act
and emipowered the Governor in Council
to repeal or amend any orders or to make
new ones as deemed necessary to effect an
orderly transition. At that time the cost
of living index stood at 119-9.
On July 5, 1946, the Canadian dollar was
brought back to 'par with the United States
dollar. Honourable senators will recall that
it was at a discount of 10 per cent throughout
the whole period of the war. This action by

the government was presented to parliament
at that time as being part of a program of
control, ta lessen as much as possible the
likelihood of rising prices. Speaking at that
time, the minister said:
(a) Higher prices for Canadian imports tend to
push up production costs and the costs of living in
Canada.
(b) An increase In foreign prices for our own
export products also stimulates pressure for increases in the domestic price of such commodities.
(c) The adjustment in the exchange rate will help
offset the effect of high and rising prices in other
countries. It will mean that the cost of imports
will be 10 per cent less in Canadian dollar terms
than would otherwise have been the case.
(d) Another benefit from this change will be that
prices of goods which we normally buy from England, France and a number of other countries will
now be more in line with our prices, with the
resuIt that we will receive more goods from them.

In general, honourable senators, the government sought to counteract the trend of rising
prices by bringing the Canadian dollar back
to par, thereby reducing the cost of imports
from the United States and relieving the
upward pressure of increased costs on the
domestic market entailed by the difference
between the value of the Canadian and the
American dollar. In July, 1946 the cost-ofliving index stood at 125-1.
In May, 1947 parliament passed the Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, which
provided for the continuance in force for
another year of fifty-seven regulations. The
Act did not permit the Governor in Council
to pass new regulations or to amend old ones,
but it permitted the rescinding of any which
were thought unnecessary. The cost-of-living
index was then 133-1. In passing, I cannot
refrain from saying that I thought the government a little unwise at that time in deciding
to continue in force precisely 57 regulations.
I recall quite clearly the attack the honourable leader opposite made on this proposal,
in respect to which he said:
I strongly advise the government-though I do
not suppose it will listen to my advice-to get out
of this control business just as fast as it can. I
suggest too that it never go back to these controls,
because there are 57 reasons why the people of this
country will be angry at them if they do.

Of course I expected him to pounce on the
57 regulations.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is just what the Minister of Public Works said the other night, is
it not?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am merely pointing
out another instance of an expression of my
friend's strong objection to controls, with
which I find fault.
As a result of the exchange crisis, brought
about largely by the spectacular increase in
imports from the United States, measures were

SENATE
taken in November, 1947 to drastically control
and in some cases prohibit, the importation
of certain goods from that country in order to
conserve our supply of foreign exchange. The
cost-of-living index at that date was 143 -6.
When legislation for the further continuation of the Transitional Measures Act was
presented to parliament in March, 1948 the
government asked for the continuation of only
27 regulations regarding controls. At that time
the power of the Governor in Council was
limited in the same way as it had been in
1947. The cost-of-living index as of that date
stood at 150-8.
By March, 1949, the number of regulations
had been reduced to 12, and the government
asked for the continuation of these for one
year. The cost-of-living index had then risen
On September 18, 1949, as
to 159-2.
a result of conditions brought about by the
drastic devaluation of the pound sterling,
Canada devalued her dollar by 10 per cent.
The cost-of-living index at that time had
reached 162-3.
By March, 1950, the only remaining controls
were those with respect to rentals. The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act was
amended to continue these controls for a
further thirteen months, at which time the
government said that it intended to abolish
them altogether. By March of this year the
cost-of-living index had gone up to 163-7
points, and on August 1, last, it stood at 168 -5.
I draw the attention of honourable senators
to the fact that during the five-year period
from the end of the war up until the present
time, the index rose from 119-9 to 168-5.
During the same period there was a gradual
reduction in the number of control regulations.
The honourable leader opposite and the
members of his party were not the only ones
whose voices were heard in favour of decontrol; there was no disagreement on this
side of the house as to that general policy;
and I think that it met with the overwhelming
approval of the country at large. Indeed, such
criticism as one heard was caused more by the
delay in removing controls than the fact
that they were being removed. The suggestion was frequently made that controls
were all right in wartime, but that in times of
peace they should be discontinued. But the
bald fact remains, honourable senators, that
during the period from 1945 to 1950, when
there was a gradual relinquishing of controls,
there was also a gradual increase in the
cost-of-living index of approximately 10 points
a year.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Will the honourable leader
permit me to suggest that it was because

of the controls that living costs rose so
rapidly? I intend to touch on that question
in the remarks I shall make later.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am just pointing out
that there was no general disagreement with
the policy of decontrol. Though competition
in the price field is the basis of our economy,
it is interesting to note that as the controls
were removed living costs rose.
The cause of our difficulty today, as the
honourable leader opposite has explained, is
that the demand for goods far exceeds the
supply. It is as simple as that. The desire
for goods and services has driven prices
upwards, while incomes and employment
have remained at a high level. In our desire
for the removal of controls we overlooked
the fact that during the war years there was
an almost complete cessation of buying. My
advice to people during the Victory Bond
campaign, was like that of everyone else,
"Save your money now and spend it after
the war." At the time that was a perfectly
reasonable and natural thing to say.
A second factor in stimulating the demand
for goods was the remarkable transition from
war to peace with far less unemployment than
was originally anticipated. Sitting at one of
the meetings of the Cabinet which I attended
after the cessation of hostilities, I wondered
how upwards of a million and a half people
in the armed services and in war industries
could be absorbed into the ordinary economy
of the country without widespread unemployment and a violent social upheaval. Had
great numbers of people been unable to find
work, there would have been a great reduction of purchasing power.
However, through one cause or another,
the transition from war to peace was made
with hardly any increase of unemployment.
One favourable factor which perhaps had not
been foreseen was the extraordinary optimism
of Canadian business generally regarding the
future of our country. I myself marvelled
that hard-headed businessmen would contemplate vast programs of capital expenditure at the price levels at which those
expenditures had to be made. As honourable
senators know, of recent years our capital
expenditures, largely though not entirely for
business development, have exceeded three
and a half billion dollars a year. Consequently
we have been favoured with continuous
capital expenditures, to which were added
the outlays on various undertakings by
federal, provincial and municipal governments. The remarkable optimism which prevailed after the war was reflected in an

to the good s0 f ar as the future o! Canada is
concerned. On the one side was an extraordinary demand; on the other side, in one
form or another, were curtailinents of various
sources of supply. Ordinarily goods and services come from two sources: what we
ourselves produce, and what we import. As
regards the first our productive facilities
went ahead at full speed, and with some
minor exceptions, practicaily every productive
business in this country has been fuily
engaged.
Conditions were not quite s0 easy in the
field o! imports. For a year and a half after
1945, the exceptional demands of our people
for goods from the United States resulted
in imports out of relation to the amounts we
were shipping out. This precipitated a crisis
which necessitated the imposition of controls
and restrictions in respect of exchange. It
is true that the volume of imports from the
United States in 1946 and 1947 was not much
greater than the amount we are absorbing
at this time. The difference lay in the much
smaller volume of exports which we 'were
then sending to the United States.
In November of 1947 our supply of manu!actured products was seriously reduced following the control, the curtailment and in
some cases the total prohibition of imports
from the United States. On the one hand
we were faced with a constantly increasing
demand for goods; on the other, with a
definite curtailment of imports, because, for
one reason or another, European countries
were not in a position to supply us with much
that we needed. In that period competition
neyer had a real opportunity to function. The
demand in relation to the available supply
was probably just as great as it had been in
any period during the war, but the supply
remained limited.
The question, honourable senators, is,
where do we go from. here? During five
years the price level has risen fifty points, an
average of ten points a year. At present
-practically
nothing except rents is controlled.
At least as f ar as government controls are
concerned, competition is free. Wihere shal
we be five years from today? The answer,
if it is to be satisfactory, must depend on an
increase of our domestic productive facilities
and the ability to import. At the moment
there are two difficulties in the way of importing as an element in reducing the cost of
Living. One is the effect of tariffs or other
artificial restrictions on imports from. the
zountry where we are most likely to get
them, namely the Unitd States; the other is
the problem o! the depreciated dollar, which

acts as a sort of tariff and enhances production costs. It is flot so easy to say what other
factors enter into the matter. I remember
about a year ago when I announced to the
house the depreciated exehange value of the
Canadian dollar, I remarked that I agreed
with the government's action, as under ail the
circumstances it was probably inevitable. I
regretted, however, that it had to be taken,
because I believed it would be a factor ini
increasing our costs.
Today we in this country are faced with
very difficuit and constantly changing conditions which will have a very marked
influence on our economy. Not so long ago,
when comparisons were made of the wage
levels of this country and in the United States,
it was invariably argued that, if wages in
Canada were less, so was the cost of living,
at least as regards farm products. Even
when it was conceded that such manufactured
articles as automobiles and electrical equipment could be had more cheaply in the
United States, the reverse was said to be true
as regards our basic agricultural products.
Probably this was largely true: the domestic
prices o! these commodities were largely
governed by those prevailing ini the European
markets to which most of our farm products
were exported. Whether or not it was logical,
there was always -the argument that in this
country labour must accept a lower rate of
pay because of the cost of living.
What do we find now? Our economy is
moving more and more towards integration
with that of the United States. I think it
has been said that this year our imports from
the United States wiil be in the vicinity of
$1,900 million, and that with the exception
of gold our exports to that country will be
approximately only $200 million less than
our imports from, it. This means that our
exports ta the United States will be al-most
double what they were lin 1946. It is inevitable that as more and more of our primary
products are exported to the United States,
the price of these goods on the home market
wîll become the American price rather than
the prevailing price on the British or
European markets. For instance, in Canada
today the price of meat and lumber is the
American price; in fact, it is the American
price plus 10 per cent. As the economies of
the United States and Canada become more
closely integrated, as they may, the consumers of this country will pay more for the
whole range o! secondary goods.
Last session my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) mentioned automobiles and certain electrical goods as
instances o! articles for which the Canadian
consumer pays more than the American price

SENATE

I noted his figures, and the percentage of
increase that he gave was about 25 per cent
in one case and 30 per cent in the other.
These increases may be typical. Figures disconsumers
spent
close that Canadian
$1,200 million for automobiles and electrical
goods in 1948, and the honourable member
from Churchill pointed out that in that year
Canadian consumers paid $3 million more for
these two classes of goods than did the
American consumers. The reason is obvious.
It is because of our general economic structure. If it develops that prices in the whole
field of primary goods should become the
American prices plus 10 per cent, the result
wili be an almost intolerable condition which
will have terrific social consequences. I want
to emphasize the seriousness and the ramifications of this condition-and I am sure there
is only one answer to it and that is to have
increased competition.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would point out that a
duty is paid on Canadian cattle entering the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, that is true, but
I am hoping that under the arrangements
which are to be made this duty will be
lessened if not withdrawn entirely. I am
sure that my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) is also hopeful of
this. It is a perfectly natural way to feel,
and I know that I would like to see the duty
removed from every product that is exported
to the United States from Nova Scotia. Again
I say that in my opinion there is only one
solution to this problem, and that is the
greater production of economically made
goods or, in other words, greater competition.
As the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon Mr. Roebuck) and the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) pointed out, the
measure before us is only temporary and
palliative, and is being introduced for the
purpose of trying to curtail too much purchasing at a particular time. I think the
answer is to have sufficient goods to go
around. So far as the members of the Atlantic
Pact are concerned, the solution is to remove
as quickly as possible the obstructions to the
free flow of trade between themselves.
Hon. Mr. Horner: In your opinion the
answer is not a 40-hour week?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The 40-hour week
really has no significance here. The object
of those who want a 40-hour week is not to
be restricted to working 40 hours a week, but
to get a higher rate of pay for any time
worked over the 40 hours.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But surely fewer goods
are produced in a 40-hour week?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: It does not necessarily

follow that because a 40-hour week is adopted
a man cannot work more than that length of
time. For instance, it is immaterial whether
a farmer work 365 full days a year or only
lives on his farm two weeks in the spring and
fall and spends the rest of his time-as I have
been told is the case with one farmer from
southern Saskatchewan-in a comfortable
hotel suite. Some farmers are wealthy; some
are not. Some run their business one way
and some in another. The important factor
is to have the greatest possible competition,
and I suggest that for one reason or another
competition has not had a chance in the last
five years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, the advantage in closing a debate is that
the speakers who proceed you cover most of
the ground, but there are one or two points
that are worthy of mention at this time.
My honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) was concerned about the farmer
who might want to purchase agricultural
implements on time, and he expressed the
hope that such buying would not be prohibited
under this Act.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: How do we know it will

not be?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We do not know. Para-

graph (b) of section 2 of the bill reads as
follows:
"Consumer goods," means any goods or class of
goods declared by the Governor in Council to be
consumer goods for the purposes of this Act.
In other words, as long as they are goods
to be consumed, they are considered to be
consumer goods and may be so classified
under this Act.
Hon Mr. Aseltine: What does consumption
mean?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suppose it means to
use up. The goods of the pariticular type to
which my honourable friend referred are
usually described in financial circles as producer goods. It would be unheard of for
producer goods to be included as consumer
goods under a bill of this kind. Producer
goods were not included in the last Act, and
I am sure they will not be included in this
one. The honourable member from Rosetown
wants to know what steps are to be taken
under this bill. I should like to know that
too, if it were possible.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think we should be
given some information about it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, I can assure my
honourable friend that none is available.

SEPTEMBER 12, 1950
What I wish to say, in closing the debate,
is that the mists are hanging very heavily
over the future, and none of us can see very far
ahead. Nobody knows what conditions may
develop, what necessities may arise. No one
is able to tell us what the government is likely
to do under this bill within the next two
years.
The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
fears that the legislation may be the first step
towards the setting up of a great bureaucracy.
We of course have had a little~experience in
measures of this kind, and I am able to give
him some information as to that. The consumer division of the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board handled legislation which, in
principle at least, was almost exactly the same
as this, and at the peak of its activities the
division employed only about forty persons.
From 1941 to 1945, during which years price
control was in force, there were only 303
prosecutions for infractions of the law, and
290 convictions. The total fines paid in all
that time amounted to only $38,000. There
was not very much bureaucracy in that.
The leader of the opposition argued forcefully that this measure applied to the small
man, and urged that its provisions be extended
to the big fellow. I should like to point out
that the control provided for here will apply
to the finance corporations as much as to the
consumers who deal with them. It may be
interesting to note that in 1949 the retail
financing of consumer goods by finance
acceptance corporations amounted to $190
million. That is not chicken feed; it is big
business; and the people who run it are not
the little fellows.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As I understand it,
consumer credit is not going to be wiped out
completely.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By no means. Probably
a limit will be set to the amount of credit
that may be given for the purchase of articles
which can well be done without, and purchasers of those articles may be required to
pay back the balance more promptly than at
present. During the last war the largest
deposit required of purchasers on the instalment plan was one-third of the value of the
goods, and a higher percentage is not likely
to be demanded now. The time within which
credit balances must be paid may be curtailed a bit. However, I do not think that
any action taken under this bill will hurt
anybody, even the chap who is getting
married and plans to buy his wife a sink in
which to wash the dishes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

definition of "essential materials", which are
designated in the bill as follows:
ESSENTIAL MATERIALS (DEFENCE) BILL

THE SENATE

SECOND READING
Hon. S. S. McKeen moved the second reading of Bill 5, an Act respecting materials
and services essential for the purposes of
defence and national security.
He said:
The object of this bill is to control materials
and services essential for the purposes of
defence and national security. It makes provision for the control of the production, supply, distribution, use, and prices of essential
material and services if and when required.
At the start of every war there is need of
some legislation to give the government power
to make quick decisions and take control over
production, industry, and, in some cases,
labour. The weakness of our democratic
system in a time of war is that our processes
of making decisions are rather slow. We
found in the past that when a democracy is
up against a dictatorship, the government or
somebody in that democracy must have the
authority to make quick decisions, because
those decisions affect not only ourselves but
all our allies.
At the start of the first world war the
government of the day, to meet this need,
passed the War Measures Act. That statute,

(b) "essential materials" means such materials
and substances as are designated from time to time
by the Governor in Council under section three as
being-

And this is the important part.
-essential for defence purposes.
A material which is not essential for defence

purposes doeq not rank under this bill as
"essential".

The main purpose of this measure is, of
course, to enable the government to carry
out its commitments under the Atlantic pact,
not only for our own supplies but for supplies
to our allies. It also enables the government
to make preparation for dealing with the
Korean situation and for our national defence.
The field in which the powers conferred by
this Act may be exercised, or exercised first,
is that of iron and steel, in which shortages
are even now evident. The first step to be
taken when a shortage is apparent is that the
industries themselves, will allocate to the
more essential services such steel as is available. Already that is being done: some steel
has been diverted from the construction of
automobiles to purposes of military and naval
defence. If a point is reached when this
system is inadequate to our needs, the government under this bill will have power to step

SEPTEMBER 13, 1950
in and set a priority for certain orders. If
defence buying and the creation of these
priorities causes such shortages in the supply
available to consumers, and industry begins
to take a little more out of buyers in the
way of prices, the government is vested with
authority to make a "price-freeze" which will
hold down prices when the proposed increase
is the result of purchasing for defence
purposes.
In 1939, at the beginning of the last war,
shortages did not immediately appear, because
business was poor and there was idle productive capacity subject to immediate expansion.
Today the picture is a little different. We
have full employment, and production is
running practically to capacity.
It is true that with our present greater
production capacity we can better take care
of a program such as we had in 1939, but at
the same time it is going to cause some shortages at some places at some times. Thus they
are endeavouring, as far as possible, to
increase production in order to take care
of the extra needs of defence purposes without disrupting civilian consumer goods. If
this purpose can be achieved then there will
be no need of putting in a priority system, but
for certain periods it may be necessary to
take some action.
Our present greater production capacity as
compared to 1939 is explained by our increase
of export business. At the beginning of the
present fiscal year, March 31, our Minister of
Trade and Commerce forecast a banner year
for 1950, predicted it to be as good or a little
better than it was in 1949. We are now only
half way through the present fiscal year and
we may now anticipate an even greater
increase in our exports over what they were
in 1949. This rise in business, being greater
than was anticipated, has caused a certain rise
in prices because there is more employment
and more buying power. Apparently our
purchasing power bas increased more than
our production of consumer goods, and thus
we have experienced a rise in prices.
This increased business bas been aided, I
think, by our keeping up with our export
trade. Since the war we have been practically
on a balanced trade so far as our external
trade is concerned. But we have had one very
serious problem. Whereas in 1947 we had a
$1 billion deficit on our trade with the United
States, we enjoyed an even larger surplus with
other countries. Our earnings from the sterling
bloc were not wholly convertible, however,
so we were in a position where we had credit
in the sterling bloc but could not pay for
our purchases in the dollar bloc without
drawing on our reserves. The answer would
seem very simple. You should buy less and

sell more in the U.S. But it is not a simple
thing to do this. It is a rea1 task to increase
your sales and at the same time cut down
your purchases. The same problem that we
had with the United States, the sterling bloc
had with Canada. So we find that in 1947 we
had an export business to the United States
of $1 billion 61 million and an import business
from that country of $1 billion 975 million.
This gave us a deficit of just $914 million. At
the same time we had a $750 million export
business with the United Kingdom and a $190
million import business from that country.
This gave the United Kingdom a deficit of
$560 million with us. In the whole sterling
bloc that deficit built . up to almost $800
million, and their problem with us was the
same as our problem was with the United
States. The United Kingdom had to sell more
to us and buy less from us. Our government,
principally through the Minister of Trade and
Commerce, endeavoured to assist the United
Kingdom in their problem.
In 1949 we had an export business with
the United States of $1 billion 500 million,
which was an increase of about $500 million
over 1947. This represented half our 1947
deficit with the United States. On the other
hand, our purchases from the United States
remained practically the same. They were
$1 billion 974 million in 1947 as compared to
$1 billion 952 million in 1949, a difference of
approximately $22 million. Thus in two years
our deficit with the United States was
reduced from $940 million to $449 million or,
in other words, it was cut practically in half.
At the same time we cut the deficit of the
sterling bloc from just under $800 million to
a little over $500 million. This meant that
we were reaching a point of closer balance
of trade with both our main trading areas.
Perhaps I am gazing into a crystal ball, but
with half the fiscal year already completed
it would appear that our exports to the
United States in 1950 will reach approximately $1 billion 750 million, and our imports
$1 billion 825 million, thus bringing our
imbalance down to about $75 million. Estimates from experts are that the deficit will
run anywhere from $200 million to $50
million, but I may say that for the month of
July our imbalance was only $1,300,000. So
we are running practically on balance right
now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does that include gold?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: No. The current difference in trade between the two countries is
about $2 million per month, but there are
ex-ports of about $15 million per month in
gold, which are not taken into consideration
in these figures. Last years net export of
non-monetary gold was $138 million.

reserves build up the government removes
import controls, and then there is more buying, which in turn brings down the reserve
again.
As to our trade with the sterling area, it
appears that our total exports in 1950 will
amount to $750 million and total imports to
$600 million, leaving us with a surplus of
$150 million. Of course that means a deficit
of $150 million to the sterling area in its
trade with us, and the stage is now being
reached where countries of the sterling area
are relaxing restrictions on the purchase of
supplies from Canada, a policy which will
increase our total trade still further.
So from Canada's standpoint the trade
picture looks very healthy. I think a great
deal of credit is due to the government, and
particularly to the Right Honourable C. D.
Howe, Minister of Trade and Commerce, for
achieving in about three years a balance in
Canada's export and import trade with both
the dollar area and the sterling area.
Because of the tremendous trade we have
built up we can take on a defence program
of even $1 billion without too badly disrupting the business of the country. In March
of this year it was estimated that our gross
national product would amount to $16 billion 300 million, but by mid-year the estimate had increased to about $17 billion.
So a defence budget of $1 billion would not
have a very serious effect upon the country.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is my honourable friend
speaking of gross national product or of
national income?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Gross national product,

Hon. Mr. Euler:
May I ask a question,
which perhaps is not appropriate at this
time? Of the hundreds of millions of dollars
which Canada loaned to Great Britain and
certain European countries, how much is
still available for the purchase of goods in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I do not have the current figures, but when I checked a year ago

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would my friend permit

a question? Does the $750 million for export
trade apply to the United Kingdom or to the
sterling area?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: To the sterling area.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Have you the total
figures of exports to the entire sterling area?

SEPYËMËER 13, 1950
Hon. Mr. MclCeen: As I say, the $750
million is export to the sterling area. The
United Kingdom's portion is $550 inillion.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Are you in a position
to say how much of the export to the sterling
area is made up of E.C.A.?
Hon. Mr. MclCeen: I have not a break-down
of the figures in that way, but if my honourable friend is correct in this figure of $300
million, only approximately one-third would
go to the sterling area:. Our exports for
this year for all sterling areas will be $750
million, of which the United Kingdom will
get $550 million.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Do you flot think it is
a little difficuit to say, when we are extending our trade to sterling areas with exports
made, up for the most part of E.C.A:*purposes?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Our exports to the
United Kingdom have come down a little.
In 1947 our exports amounted to $751 million.
That is when they were buying a good deal
by E.C.A. On the other hand, during that
same period our purchases from the United
Kingdom amounted to only $189 million. Our
increase of purchases from $189 million to
$250 million is providing the United Kingdom
with extra dollars with which to purchase
the goods they need. The position of that
country has been the same as our own with
respect to the United States. If the U.K.
did not have dollars she could flot buy from
us, and as our purchases only amounted to
$189 million from her, she could buy from us
only to that extent. To go beyond that
amount she would have to use some other
form of credit, such as gold, or give some other
services. We have now given them an extra
$150 million of purchasing power in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: May I asic the honourable
gentleman where he gets his figures on the
national production?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: They are from the
Department of Trade and Commerce, and I
secured them from the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics. In this conection I would strongly
recommend that every honourable senator
secure from the bureau a copy of the pamphlet entitled Canada at the Halfway Mark,
which sets forth all the recent statistics, and
is well worth reading.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But the Bureau of Statistics is a branch of the Department of Trade
and Commerce.

one suggests that the figures are coloured by
the department.

gold, and it is one of Canada's products. I see
no reason why it should not be included in
the total exports, the same as any other
commodity.
HMon. Mr. McKeen: The authorities may
have an explanation for flot including it, but
I do flot know what the answer is.
I gave some figures of expenditures for new
investment in Canada this year, totalling $3 -7
billion. It should be pointed out that of that
amount only $2-5 billion is for new construction, about $750 million being spent for repairaand maintenance. The interesting part of this
program is that 70 per cent of it is finaniced
by Private citizens out of their own savings.
The government is not increasing the volume
of construction; in fact, there is a great backlog of government work to be done.
In the discussion of controls yesterday it
was pointed out that when they were removed
prices rose very substantially, and that one of
the reasons for this was the pent-up buyingpower at the end of the war. The government
has benefited by its experience during the
period of rising prices, and is now trying to
allow a free flow of goods and services, so as
to prevent any reaction following the removal
of such restrictions as may be in force.
By this bill the government is asking only
for power to restriet essential materials and
services, including, partîcularly, electrical
energy. This will permit the steady production of war materials without interfering with
civilian production, except in so far as certain
materials will be used for defence purposes.
It is f elt that the bill will allow civilian production to be carried on in a relatively normal
fashion.
Hon. Mr. Euler: When do the powers
terminate?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I arn not sure.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: On July 31, 1950.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The same as in the bill
passed yesterday.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McKeen: This bill, as I have said,
seeks much less power than the government
asked at the outbreak of the last war, and is
considerably less than the powers asked for
by our neighbour to the south in its defence
program. I would point out that the defence
program in the United States has considerable
effect on industrial life in Canada, because
that country purchases from us, as we purchase from it.
The government is confident that in so far as
essential materials for construction purposes
are concerned, there should be no stoppage
of the flow of these supplies. I should perhaps point out that if a plant in Canada
requires machinery or equipment from the
United States within a period of fifteen
months to two years, it may well find itself
faced with priority controls in that country.
Our government cannot interfere with the
policy of the United States. If, on the other
hand, if an order for the machinery and
equipment were placed in Canada, I think it
most unlikely that deliveries would be interfered with.
The honourable leader of the house pointed
out yesterday that we in Canada were paying
a price for goods equivalent to the United
States dollar for exports out of Canada. I
think that is generally so. For instance, on
the Pacific coast we pay no higher price for
lumber than do our American friends. The
situation in eastern Canada may be different,
but the price level in the United States is
bound to affect that in Canada.
In the administration of this Act the government will have to see to it that Canada's
production is maintained. When a similar
Act was passed in 1939, no one knew who
was going to administer it or how it was
going to be administered. Today the powers
are being asked for by a department, headed
by a minister who had a broad experience
during the Second World War. We know
what action was taken. We know that his
powers were not abused, but were used for
the benefit of Canada, and that production was
tremendously increased. Except in times of
stress, we in the democracies do not like to
pass measures to delegate our authority to the
government. But if the government wanted
to declare that war is apprehended they could
use the War Measures Act right now. They
prefer to have the country's business carried
on in the usual way, and to superimpose with
as little disturbance as possible the war production program. That is their reason for
asking that this bill be passed. I hope the
house will see fit to pass it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has the honourable
gentleman given any consideration to the
constitutionality of the measure?

Hon. Mr. McKeen: Not being a lawyer I
am a little at a disadvantage on that question.
I am afraid I shall have to leave it to the
Department of Justice or to any lawyers in
the Senate who would like to argue it. I am
not the proper person to do so.
Hon. John T. Haig: I shall not talk very
long about this bill. We have previously discussed much the same issue. This bill does
not go as far as the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The War Measures Act
is not in effect, though not repealed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that, but it can
be brought into effect; and the object of this
bill is to avoid making the declaration which
would be necessary to bring the War
Measures Act into operation.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The effect of the War
Measures Act would be to put us on a war
basis at once. I am not persuaded that the
government want to do that. I believe they
do not want to do it.
Other problems are looming large on the
horizon of the world. To realize their gravity
one need only read the morning papers. A
man of the standing of Louis Johnson, Secretary of Defence, is thrown out of the United
States Cabinet and another man is put in,
really as War Minister. One only has to read
the speeches in another parliament across the
water to know what is on the minds of the
ministers and members there.
The house permitted the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen), the
mover of the bill, to discuss matters of trade,
so I may be allowed to say a few words on
the same subject. For the last three or four
years our trade with nations of the sterling
area has been supported almost entirely with
the money which we lent to them or with
advances made by the United States under
what the public at large, including myself,
knows as the Marshall plan; I do not use
letters to designate it, because I am never
sure of the combination. At present Canada
faces a new difficulty in connection with overseas trade. Two weeks ago my honourable
friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
informed me of what had happened to the
Western Canadian crop. Yesterday the Minister of Trade and Commerce confirmed the
accuracy of what the senator from Rosetown
had told me a fortnight ago, that the damage
to our western crops through frost amounted
to 50 per cent. Anybody who understands the
grain trade knows that the present spreads
between grades indicate a realization by the
government that grades four, five, six and

SEPTEMM le.- 1950
below will be unsaleable on world markets
for making into flour. It has been the practice of European and other countries ta buy
a certain amount af our hard wheat to mix
with their soi t wheats in order ta produce a
grade of flour acceptable ta their people. If
much of our wheat grades below No. 3, and
theref are is too 10w ta use for mixing purposes, there will be great dîfficulty in selling it.
However, I do not think trade has anything ta do with this prablem. The honourable
senator from Toronto <Han. Mr. Hayden) put
a question which I would have asked bad I
thought af it quickiy enough. Regarding the
trade af approximately $750 million which
Canada bas with the sterling area, he pointed
out that about hall of it was financed with
United States dollars, part of it resulted from
business which we Canadians are desperately
trying ta build up with the sterling area, and
some af it from purchases, not sa much in
Great Britain as in Australasia, East Asia and
Malaya, for the purpase af stockpiling in the
United States and to some extent in Canada.
As I say, it is not going ta do us much
good ta combine a consideration af this bill
with a discussion of the general trade situation, yet I shail take this oppartunity ta point
out that one grave mistake we have committed is that we have so tied ourselves up
with the Bank of International Settlements
that we are unable ta, seil aur gold on the
world mnarket. Why should we not be permitted to dispose of it at the best price we
can get for it? It bas been suggested ta me
that in that event the price per ounce would
rise to nearer $50 per ounce than the $38.50
which is the present ruling price. I cannot
understand why we should be bound up witb
some international organization which prohibits us from selllng gold. Af ter South Airica
-and perhaps Russia, although neither I nor
anybody else knows with any certainty what
is the Russian output-we are the world's
leading gold-producing country. But these
considerations have nothing to do with the
bill, and if the hanourable gentleman from,
Toronto had abjected I wauld have had to
admit that I was as much out ai order as was
the bonourable senator from Vancauver (Hon.
Mr. McKeen) when, in introducing the bill,
he talked about trade canditions.
The purpose ai this measure is simply to
give the gaverniment power ta contrai certain
essentials which, might enter into war production. In that respect It bas my approval. I
repeat that we are today ini exactly the same
position as we were in from 1939 ta 1945.
By no stretch ai the imagination can it be
supposed that any man or woman in this
bouse would vote or act to limit in any
69266-9 j

prepossible way Canada's maximum
paredness against the eventuality ai war.
In a very able speech the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar> pointed
out that neither in 1914 nor in 1939 were
we challenged to tbe same extent as we are
today. I agree with hlm, because I do nat;
believe that, had Germany been successful
in the 1914-1918 war, she would bave gane
as f ar as Stalin will go if Russia proves
successful in the caming war. Nor do I believe
that the Germany af 1949, had Hitler succeeded, would have demanded as much as
Stalin will demand if he wins the next struggle. I say that this is the greatest crisis we
have ever faced; and I am sure I speak for
every member on this side of the bouse when
I say that we would vote for the bull even
though it did no mare than help in a slight
degree the people af Canada ta prepare for
the coming struggle.
A point which bas troubled me, and one
which I thank the honourable senator from
Vancouver for baving mentioned, is that we
as Canadians do not like ta give any government or any individual unlimited powers.
We thlnk it is aur province ta, meet and decide
the nature and extent af the authority which
should be vested in them. Aiter seeing what
the parliament af Canada bas accomplished
this session, I arn not afraid of its ability ta,
act swiftly. I do flot; think that when we
came here on August 29 any ai us believed
that by the next day parliament would bave
taken the necessary action ta end the most
drastic strike Canada bas ever experienced.
I do not tbink any parliamrent could act niuch
faster than that.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In my opinion the creditable performance of Canada's parliament in
dealing with the railway strike was the best
illustration of democracy in action this
country has ever given. I doubt that even
the Mother ai Parliaments or the administration in the United States bas ever moved
more swiftly. But while the railway strilce
was of extreme importance ta the economic
life of this country, it could not be placed in
the same category as a state of war emergency. In 1939, when the world faced the
greatest struggle in its history, I think parliament took only nine days to declare war
against tbe enemy.
I do not like legisiation wbich places
tremendous powers in the hands ai any
individual or gavernment. It is proper ta
give the necessary power ta, a government ta
administer the aiffairs ai the country, but
this bill would confer upon one man or one
group af men certain dictatorial powers over

, SËNAtE
a large part of the economie life of the country. I am not sure that this should be done
unless 'an actual state of war has been
declared. In fact, I do not think it should be
done at all.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It would seem that my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has already adopted the attitude that war
is an absolute certainty. I think it is very
wrong for him to say so, even if he believes
it to be true.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would put the War
Measures Act inta effect so that we would
know exactly where we stand.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are quite sure of war
then.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would put the War
Measures Act into effect. I know my honourable colleague from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) and other honourable gentlemen do
not agree with me when I say I am sure
there will be war, but I want to say to the
honourable member from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) that I do not believe we can get
Canadians going hard enough unless they realize the struggle we are facing. And we are
facing it just as sure as the sun will rise
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not think that statement does any good.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We did not think Korea
would be attacked but it was, and just as soon
as Russia is ready to move against Yugoslavia it will do so. The only thing that is
holding the Reds back is the gigantic industrial power of the United States and that
country's determination to carry on the
struggle. The Russians also believe that the
Americans would und'oubtedly use the atomic
bomb against her.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable friend
believe that there is such a thing as talking
oneself into a war?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No,.there is not the slightest d'anger of that. Nobody in Canada wants
a war.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should think not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend cannot accuse me of wanting war. In 1939 I was
one of those who voted for war, but I will
tell my honourable friend quite candidly that
by so doing I sent seven relatives, including
my own son, to war.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Others did the same.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I knew what I was doing
then, and I thank God that my son came
home safely. His record was at least a fair
one. Men do not get the D.F.C. for just

walking around a block. I am not going to
bé charged with saying that I want war, but
I do not want to see our people caught like
they were in 1939 when the Nazis went
marching across Europe. The Russians could
do the same thing now. Would you call
Churchill a warmonger for saying that it will
take at least 70 divisions to hold back the
reds in Europe? Churchill was the one man
who before 1939 warned his nation to get
ready. The people did not listen to him, but
within a year and a half he was made Prime
Minister of his country. It took Pearl Harbour
to wake up the Americans in 1941. And to
think that they were actually negotiating with
the Japanese when that country attacked
them at pearl Harbour! That is the sort of
thing that upsets me. We Anglo-Saxons have
no liking for war. We just hate it. Those
who have been soldiers-I have not beenor whose sons served in battle know that you
cannot forget the war for even one single
night. I detest war just as much as any person, but I do believe that the last two wars
have taught me that the only way to meet
aggression is to be absolutely ready for it.
Until South Korea was attacked, I do not
think the people of Canada or the United
States believed another war could possibly
come. We have to alert our people to what
they face.
Had it not been for the remarks of the
honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) I would not have spoken so long.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I apologize for that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not like this legislation, and while I intend to vote for it with
my eyes wide open I still believe it would
be better not to have it at all or to have the
whole situation covered, because I do not
believe Canadians have really been awakened to the terrible threat to their freedom.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
do not propose to speak at any length. I
merely rise because the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas inferentially
accused, me of ascribing to him a liking for
war. That was far beyond what I said or
intimated in any way. I believe he dislikes
war as much as I or anybody else. My
criticism is that he chooses to tell the people
of Canada in so many words that war is
absolutely certain to come. I think that is
a most injudicious observation to be made
by any member of parliament.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
seerns to me that the discussion which has
taken place bas wandered far beyond the
boundaries of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that.

SEPTEMBER
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This legislation does npt
deal with trade statistics or what we should
do about our gold exports. It is a measure
to give extraordinary powers to the Governor
in Council, and in particular to the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, because of the situation in which we find ourselves 'in this
troubled world. Let me make myself clear
at once. I am in full support of this. bill.
I think it is necessary that the government
should have powers to do rather extraordinary things at this time; but we should not
Ire blind to the fact that they are extraordinary powers.
I have the impression that the junior senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen) regarded
the bill as simply one which would confer
certain limited powers upon the givernment
and the minister and would work no great
harm.
I do not believe that at this stage the
government could have invoked the War
Measures Act. The purposes for which that
Act can be used are, if my memory serves
me aright, set out clearly in the statute.
We are not yet at war-at least, there has
been no declaration of war by the Parliament
of Canada. The action being taken in IÇorea
by the United Nations is police action, and I
understand that the desire is to keep it upon
that basis. We are not threatened ,with invasiôn and we have no insurrection in this
country, so 'in my opinion it is doubtful
whether the War Measures Act could be
invoked.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Can it not be said that
war is apprehended?
Hon. Mr, Crerar: No, I should say we are
not in a period of apprehended war.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If you said war was
apprehended you would have to say with
whom, I should think.
Hori. Mr. Crerar: Let us look at this bill
for a moment and see what we are doing;
and let me repeat that we have to do it.
It may be, though, that the iheasure goes too
far, that it could have been framed in a
more desirable way. Let us not be blind to
the fact that this bill gives extraordinary
powers to the government and to the minister.
The preamble, 'which sets out the basis
for the legislatiqn, is essentially part of the
bill. Then section 2, the interpretation section,
la very important. Paragraphs (b) and (c)
of that section define "essential materials"
and "essential service". When you read paragraph (b) in conjunction with section 3 you
get an idea of how broad the definition of
"essential materials" is, and I ask myself
what cominodities could be excluded from
it. Clearly, iron and steel are essential for

13,

1950

defence, as are copper, zinc, lead and alumý
inum. Are înot wool, leather and cotton
also essential for defencç, in that they are
requirei for the making of uniforms for the
forces? And what about lumber? My point
is-perhaps some of. my legal friends here
will correct me. if I. am wrong-that there
is scarcely' a material entering into the needs
and services of our civilian population which
could not be brought under the definition of
"essential materials" for defence.
Hon. Mr. King: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I am right in that
opinion, then section 4 of the bill gives the
Governor in Council and the minister very
wide powers of control over the production,
allocations and prices of all commodities declared by the Governor in Council to be
"essential materials", and over the keeping of
records with respect to them. That, it seems
to me, is not an overstatement of the case.
If it is, I should like some of my legal colleagues to set me right.
A question has arisen as to how this legislation will be administered. My honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen)
seemed to argue that the Minister of Trade
and Commerce, who will be responsible for
administering the law, did a wonderful job
in handling similar legislation before and
can be trusted to do so again. In esteem
and admiration for the Minister of Trade
and Commerce I take no back seat to anyone.
During the strenuous days of the last war
we were cabinet colleagues, and no one knows
better than I the services he rendered to the
Canadian people in the great adventure in
which Canada was then engaged. But that is
not the point. Parliament does not pass legislation-or at least it should not-because
a certain individual will administer it. If
anything should happen to the Minister of
Trade and CommerceHon. Mr. McKeen: The government has lots
of other good men,
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think we must keep it
clearly in our minds that so long as the law
is in force the powers mentioned in this bill
will be exercised by whatever person happens
ta be Minister of Trade and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Do we believe fhat
any governmnent would capriciously declare
to be essential a com;odity which in fact
wgs, not essential?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, but I would Temind

Hon. Mr. Euler: Are you not always looking for trouble?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I arn merely trying to
make clear what the effect of the bill will

for.
No one i Canada has greater faith i the
supremacy of parliament than I have, but
if the events of today are contrasted with
those of flty years ago, I do flot think any
student of affairs would deny that the executive power has been greatly increased. That
is true in many countries, including Great
Britain, where there has recently been criticism of it. Any increase in the power of
the executive as against the power of parlia-ment is not a healthy development. Whlle
parliament has the right to vote a government out o! power, and ta make any changes
it May desire, there is sometimes a reluetance on the part of the mai ority to do so.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resurned from Friday, Septomber 8, consideration o! His Excellency
the Governor Generalrs speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon.
Mr. Dupuis for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
there is nothing unusual in my rising to take
part in the debate on the Address in reply
to the Speech frorn the Throne. It la the
one opportunity I have o! apeaking without
fear o! 'being called ta order by the honourable senator froni Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy),
for I can talk about anythlng from the froat
in Saskatchewan to the heat i Tknbuk-tu.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I have just corne i.
Hon. Mr. McK..n: To get a leason?
Mon. Mr. Horner: I first wlah ta compliment the inover (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Barbour) of the Address

in reply on the excellent job they did. I
was am-used at the gentie chiding which the
honourable senator from Prince gave me for
raising my voice. He referred ta the inspiration which he got fromn the quiet manner in
which the House of Commons discussed the
railway strike and came to a settlement.
Well, I deplore the quiet manner that pleased
him. The honourable senator made reference
lin his speech to the charity o! which the
Bible speaka. I would rernind hlm that the
Good Book also refers to an occasion when
loud voices were heard and when the Master,
upon being asked to rebuke his disciples,
replied that if these should hohd their peace
the very atones would cry out. I have no
doubt that when the money changera were
driven frorn the temple loud voices were
heard also.
Honourable senators, I think there has
been altogether too much criticism o! my
leader. It ia not often that I feel that I
shouhd corne ta his defence.
Somo Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I can think of no other
house of parliarnent with a two-,party system,
which has a more helpful leader o! the
opposition than we have. If I were ta
criticize hlm at ail it would be because he
ia too generous with his help and advice.
My leader in speaking o! the cost o! living
said that I had opposed controls. Weil, 1 do
not like to say to my honourable frienda, "I
tohd you so"; but I opposed controls away
back in 1940, when I predicted that what has
happened would happen. At that trne creamery butter was controlled at a price of 32
cents a pound to the conaumer while crearn
was being subsidized to bring the producer's
price up to 42 cents per pound o! butter! at.
What happened?
The butter producer
became discouraged by reason of the higb
cost of labour and other things, and got rid
of his herd.
For two years now I have opposed certain
controls and prohibitions, notwithstanding the
fact that we desperately needed Arnerican
dollars. To prevent; a rise in the coat of living, and malnly for the benefit of the eastern
provinces, for two solid years the western
rancher was prohibited frorn selling his cattle
abroad. I have cornplained before of this
prohibition. There followed a packers' strike
in Western Canada. It continued for a rnontb
during the normal season for the marketing
of cattie. At thia tirne cattle of a quality
which was bringing 30 ta 35 cents per pound
just across the border were selling at 10
or il cents a pound in Western Canada. Some
of the ranchers decided to withold their
cattie and attempt ta winter them, becaus<

SENATE
they believed there would be a considerable
shortage the following season. But an exceptionally hard winter intervened, and some
ranchers lost two or three hundred head.
I know of a woman, who lived not far from
a ranch in which I am interested, who committed suicide because she could not bear to
stand by and see the cattle die. As you go
through that country, you see truckloads of
the bones of these animals piled up on the
prairie and in the barnyards. Today we are
deprived of these cattle as the result of a
policy which was adopted for purely political
reasons. The West has not the voting strength
of the East. Eastern Canada is allowed to
ship cattle, which are not even good dairy
cattle, to the extent of hundreds of thousands
a year.
I want to point to another injustice in
the control of the cost of living. I invite anyone who is interested to go to the market
and see what happens to a carload of cattle.
The top price is paid for perhaps three or
four animals, and for the rest the price is
away down. A lot of splendid beef has been
sold on the market at 20 cents a pound. Any
average beef animal will dress 50 per cent;
the better stock will run as high as 58 per
cent; sometimes realy good animals go up
to 60 per cent. These figures refer to an
animal that is trimmed; its legs are off at
the knee; the head also is off, although the
choicest meat is on the cheeks; and the
tongue, heart and liver sell for a high price.
My contention is that the cost to the consumer is out of proportion to the price paid
to the producer; some parties "in between"
are making more than they ever did.
Much the same thing happened when the
government set itself to reduce the price of
eggs. As a result, thousands of people went
out of the chicken business. Now we are
facing a shortage of chickens and eggs. Yet
consider what the average labouring man
bas to pay when he goes to a restaurant for
a meal. One of the honourable senators from
Nova Scotia was with me recently at the
Toronto Exhibition, and we had a meal at a
restaurant run by Canada Catering Company.
Roast beef was two dollars and a half a
plate; yet if that grade of beef was sold at
$5 a pound the caterers could make a profit
from the size of serving they gave. The
same statement applies to bacon.
I have another job for the Minister of
Agriculture. Recently he persuaded a large
line of restaurants to stock apple juice. I
suggest that it would be a good idea to have
a law to provide that any restaurant which
serves pullet eggs, should be required to put
Up an announcement "Pullet eggs are served

here". They are only half the weight of
Grade A eggs, and are 15 cents a dozen
cheaper.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why not sell them by
weight?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. That would be a
fair way of doing it. I asked that my eggs be
served in their shells, so that they would not
get lost in the egg-cup. I was charged 50
cents for two eggs and some toast. At the
present price of eggs there is no justification
for that sort of thing.
Any further interference, or even talk of
interference, on these lines will only result in
a further lowering of production. A farmer
must have a certain level of prices. And
while talking of the position of the farmers,
I propose to speak briefdy on the subject of
wheat. I know something about it. I am
not at all astonished that farmers throughout
western Canada are shocked at the present
condition of affairs.
I have farmed long
enough in the west to know that when a small
quantity of wheat is damaged by frost it can
be graded higher because it can be mixed
with better grades. Elevators, in their anxiety
to get rid of the lower grade wheat, are deliberately grading it down to perhaps No. 4
or No. 5, although I have seen samples graded
No. 3 that are no better than other wheat
which is graded No. 5. This is a serious matter for the farmer.
In this connection let me say that I am, and
have been for years, awfully tired of the
smart alecks who go around the country
estimating the crop and talking about the
probable carry-over. Why they should busy
themselves with other people's affairs is more
than I can understand. In other lines of
business people are permitted to keep secret
the supplies they have on hand: then why
should the farmers' production be publicized
all over the world? Today we find ourselves
with a crop whose value is reduced by about
$200 million. In the national interest it
would be a good thing to aim at a carry-over
of 200 million bushels. Who will get the
benefit this year of the extra dollar a bushel
which our wheat is worth when the better
quantities are mixed with grades 4 and 5 and
the whole is raised to a milling grade? Will
the companies reap the benefit or will it go
to the producer of the grain! If our carryover equalled 200 million bushels, most of our
wheat could be brought up to milling standards. I notice an item in a Saskatoon paper
stating that some farmers are dumping their
wheat on the ground in preference to selling
it at present prices. My advice to the farmers
is, by all means to keep their wheat.

SEPTEMBE R 13, 1950
Here is another thing which honourable
senators unaccustomed to the growing and
handling of wheat may not know. If wheat is
stored properly its colour and grain is improved, and it should not be milled for at
least one year anyway. We used to think
the only method of improving grain was to
stack it, but we have since found that it is
cheaper to improve it by properly storing it
in a granary. The farmers of western Canada would certainly be well advised to store
their wheat in granaries whenever possible.
I would just like to ask what would be the
result if we had no carry-over of wheat and
the entire crop in western Canada were
frozen. I think we should have a carry-over
of at least two million bushels of wheat in
case of any emergency.
I want to· discuss wheat prices. In all my
experience there has been a spread of about
6 cents between grades 1 and 3. Sometimes
the spread between grades has only been 2j
cents, but this year it is 10 cents. So it is
evident that somebody intends to make use
of grades 2 and 3.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is a difference of
10 cents between grade 3 and grade 4.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. In other words,
there is a jump of 18 cents between grade 1
and grade 4, and that is what the farmers are
protesting against.
I have heard the same complaint right along
about the production of hogs. Less than onethird of our bacon comes from grade A hogs.
Despite the fact we are short of food these
days, there is a $5 difference in the selling
price of a hog if it weighs one pound over a
certain weight. I do not know of anything
more ridiculous than this system, which was
introduced years ago to encourage the farmers
of Canada to raise hogs which produce the
type of bacon required in England.
That
necessity has long since passed, and we have
since discovered that the f ault was not so much
with the hogs, but that our packers did not
know how to cure the bacon to suit the British
people. I think this grading system should
be abolished entirely.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do you mean to tell me
that if a hog weighs, say, 181 pounds instead
of 180 pounds you get $5 less per hog?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The limit is 185 pounds
and if the hog weighs 186 pounds it is considëred to be too heavy.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is what you are
protesting against?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, and it is the same
thing when the hog is too light. A farmer is
69266-10

119

docked again if his hog weighs less than 135
pounds.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Is not the maximum
weight 175 pounds?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Perhaps. I know it has
been varied to some extent. I have heard
fellows say that they have run their pigs
around for a couple of hours to take a few
pounds off them.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Does that work?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, it works. So much
for the high cost of living in Canada.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that the
railway strike was unjustified, but I think
that if anyone has the right to speak about
it in this house it is an honourable senator
from Saskatchewan. I agree entirely with
what the honourable senator from Regina
(Hon. Mr. Wood) had to say about the strike.
The sorry part of it is that the railroad men
themselves are the ones who are going to lose.
Perhaps I will be pardoned if I say something about railway labour and management,
because every summer from 1910 to 1918 I
used to ship horses west by rail. In those
days all the money I had or could borrow I
invested in horses, so I stayed very close to
them when they were being shipped. I could
tell some rather interesting stories about life
on the railroads in the early days. For
instance, I remember on one occasion travelling along north of Lake Superior on a CPR
freight train. This was at a time when the
railways were starting to use bigger engines
in an attempt to haul longer freight trains.
On this particular run the train crew decided
to show railway management that they were
not going to haul so much freight, and they
deliberately broke a coupling while the train
was on a grade. They notified the railway
officials that they were leaving half the train
on a siding, and then they high-tailed it to the
next division point with the remaining cars.
Fortunately for me my 'horses had been
placed in a car close to the éngine. I certainly hollered plenty about what happened
then, and there were other occasions when I
raised my voice in protest. I recall buying
twenty-two horses in Moose Jaw. A horse
dealer there told me that it would be all right
to put the horses in one freight car because
they were only going to travel a short
distance. The train travelled from Moose Jaw
to Regina during the night. Early the next
morning I went to the freight office to tell
them I wanted to unload the horses because
they would die rightthere if the train did not
soon pull out of Regina. The yard master

SENATE
told me I would be the smartest man on
earth if I could unload the horses because
there was so little time. I got the horses out
and fed them some hay, but the yard master
told me to load them in the car immediately
because the train was pulling out any minute.
Not long after we left Regina the temperature
reached 90 degrees, and the horses stood and
fought in the heat of that car until 9 o'clock
at night. When we got to Saskatoon on Friday night I went to see about getting the
horses up to Blaine Lake the next day, but I
was told the freight train had just left and
no trains were running on Saturday. The railway people there told me that I should have
wired them, and I replied "I am not running the railroad. I thought you received
notice of what freight you were supposed to
carry."
I could have sued the railway
plenty on that occasion because those horses,
which incidentally were all dapple greys,
were scalded black on their sides.
I notice that the Premier of Saskatchewan
recently wrote an article condemning the
callous treatment received by the employees
of the CPR. I hold no brief for the CPR,
but I think this criticism is entirely uncalled
for. For political reasons the premier had
to align his province with six others in
protesting against increased freight rates,
but I am complaining because of what he has
done in other ways to hurt the railroads. He
has spent huge sums of money on the construction of great highways paralleling Canadian National lines, on the purchase and operation of buses which run on those highways,
on the erection of bus depots, and so on. I agree
with the senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) that the Senate ought to make a
study of the whole railway question. I know
that we tried to do that once before, but
surely we ought to make another attempt, for
the situation is bad and will have to be dealt
with in some way before long. There is
some freight that should be shipped by rail,
and we ought to give serious consideration
to the problem of how to make sure that this
is done-of how "to render unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's."
I say that during the recent strike labour
lost a great deal of public good will, and the
carriers are suffering. When I was up in
Quebec over the week-end I was told that the
railways will never get back some of their
former business. One man who before the
strike had been making heavy shipments by
rail found that he could get satisfactory service
from a trucker, and he signed a year's contract with him.
Now, I am going to suggest a way of solving
the railway problem. The senator from
Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour) was mistaken in

saying that during the strike every railway
wheel in Canada was stopped. The Algoma
Central was runing right along.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: And the Pacific Great
Eastern.
Hon. Mr. Horner: So at least two lines kept
on operating. Honourable senators who have
never taken a trip on the Algoma Central
have missed a great treat. I speak from
experience. Before the train has gone fifty
or sixty miles all the passengers are as one
family. In the dining car there is no tomfoolery about a lot of linen, but the food
is excellent and well served.
All the
employees seem to take great pleasure in
pointing out special scenic features in the
mountains and lakes, and spots where trout
and other fish may be found. My trip over
the line was one of the most delightful I
have ever had. The main freight traffic
point is Hawker Junction. A branch runs
from there to Michipicoten, on Lake Superior,
to which point iron, pulp and so on are hauled
for transhipment via lake boats. I was surprised to find that from the Soo to within
twenty miles of the Canadian Pacific Railway
at Franz the Algoma Central runs through
hardwood bush, maple and birch, and I was
told that in the fall of the year when the
trees are changing colour the spectacle in
this area is gorgeous. When going through
there you can imagine yourself in a miniature
British Columbia. At one time you are right
on top of a mountain, and before you know it
you have run down a canyon to a lovely
stream. I inquired who owned the Algoma
Central and was informed that the men themselves had bought it, or the greater part of
it. So of course they did not go on strike.
I want to mention something that was told
to me by one of our colleagues in this chamber.
I do not think it would be right to mention
his name. The operation of his business
requires a great deal of capital, and as he
was experiencing much difficulty because of
demands for higher wages and shorter workdays, he made a proposal to the workers.
He said to them: "If you will pay me enough
to cover the depreciation on my machinery
and 4 per cent on my investment you can
run the plant to suit yourselves and have
whatever profits it will make. And I think
the profits will be good, for you will do
twice as much work then as you are doing
now." They admitted that if they owned
the plant they would do twice as much work
as they did for him, but I do not know
whether they accepted his proposal.
Now I come to my suggestion for solving
the railway problem. For years we have been
struggling with the Canadian National, which
has become a kind of third leg of government,

SEPTEMBER 13, 1950
a third party, as it were. So long as this
status is maintained the men will make more
and more demands and we shall be continually having to pay deficits. These smart
men, these agitators and some strikers, argue
that the companies can pay higher wages for
a shorter work-week and make money without
increasing freight rates. My suggestion lias
to do principally with the Canadian National,
but 1 believe it would be acceptable to the
Canadian Pacifie if the shareholders could
be assured of some small return on their
investmnent. The suggestion is simply that the
railways be turned over to, the men. If
that were done the men would work twice
as hard and would not ask for any "feather
bedding"' on diesel locomotives. The Canadian
National has bouglit seven new diesels, and
the unions insist that each of these must
have included in its crew a fireman, who
would have nothing to do except draw his
salary. I imagine that this is one kind of
demand which the men would not. make if
the railway earnings were to be divided
among themselves.
I want to mention here the lack of courtesy
which seems now to have become typical
of employees on Canadiar, National trains.
The experience of a number of senators and
of many other people throughout the country
in this respect has been the same as mine.
The attitude of the employees towards passengers seems to be: "Well, this is your
road, and you ought to travel on it regardless
of the service you get. You should not patronize any other road at ahl." This condition does
not exist on Canadian Pacifie trains. When
travelling on one recently I was greatly
pleased to observe the friendly spirit between
passengers and employees. Trainmen assisted
passengers with parcels and luggage to get
on and off at stations, and in various other
ways did their best to be of service.
In a newspaper the other day I noticed
a dispatch fromn Birmingham, England, which
was headed "No genteel substitute for rolled
shirt sleeves." Before I read it I may say
to the senator fromn Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour)
that a Prince Edward Islander who helped
me on my farmn for four years had certainly
been taught by someone how to work. The
dispatch says:
Two British educationists suggested yesterday
British industry could do a better job if it picked
its manager off the factory floor instead of for the
blueness of their blood.
"Men learn by doing. not by looking. There Is
no genteel substitute for the dirty face and rolled-up
shirt sleeves," the pair said in a joint paper presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science.
The educationists are D. H. Bramley. head of the
Industrial administration department of the Birmingham Central Technical College. and[ A. M. B.
Rule, of the Birmingham Coflege of Commerce.
69266-liO

Many British Industrial fIrms choose their managers from the white collar ranks, and manual
workers are doomned to rise no higher thon foremen.
"These methods, that have fairly availed us ini
the past. wifl be iadequate i the future," Bramley
and Rule said, "ijf Britain is to maintain her statua
as a major power and to keep up her customsry
standard of living."

That rnay be so.
Honourable senators, as I arn unable to
finish before 1 o'clock, I move adjournment
of the debate.
The-motion was agreed to.
At 1 o'clock the Senate took recess.
At 3 pm. the sitting was resumed.
BREN GUNS AND AMMUNITION

Hon. Mr. Reid inquired of the government:
1. Have any Bren guns and animunition been
reported missing or stolen fram. armouries throughout Canada during the past six months? If so2. Slow many such guns and how many rounds of
ammunition have been so reported as missing or
stoleit?
3. What recoveries have so far been made of any

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

Hon. Mr. Horner (Continuing): Honourable
senators, I did not quite finish my remarks
before lunch about the railway question. My
honourable leader said that the strike was

SENATE

settled. I have no apologies to offer for saying that I fear this whole labour question is
not settled. I only wish it were. The railway strike gave several honourable senators,
including myself, the opportunity to make
their first trip to Ottawa by plane. In this
connection I should like to refer to the
courteousness of the stewardess and others,
who made the trip by air a delightful one.
The ticket agent was right at the plane when
I boarded it in Saskatoon, and he remarked,
"Senator, we hope to see you again". He was
reminding me that I had been helped out on
this occasion, and that I should not forget
about air travel in the future.
By way of contrast I recall an incident on
the dining car of a Canadian National Railway train, when the steward refused to
serve four boys who were clean and well
behaved but who were in shirt sleeves. After
the boys were ordered out of the car by the
steward I remonstrated with him, and pointed
out that they were perhaps travelling without coats and that I, for one, would certainly
not object to their being served in the dining
car. But the steward was very short and
nasty with me, and refused to allow them to
return. It was not long before young lads
from the United States were travelling in
considerable numbers over that line to
Edmonton and to Dawson Creek. When
they came along the steward was lucky if
they had a shirt to wear in the dining car;
yet nothing was said.
As I may want to travel home by rail, my
feeling about railway employees is somewhat
the same as Stephen Leacock's attitude toward
co-education. When asked which of the two
sexes were the smarter, he said, "The Lord
help me, I think I know the answer to that".
I could tell of many instances of discourteousness at the hands of railway employees, but
I do believe that they are the exception
rather than the rule. There are many railway
people who are doing a faithful job and are
most solicitous about the comfort of the
travelling public.
Just about the time the bus companies in
Saskatoon were building terminals which
allowed passengers to step from the curb
into the bus, the railways decided, in the
interests of safety, to build underground
waiting-rooms. The honourable senator from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood) said that he knew
of one death which might be regarded as
attributable to the dangerous stairs in a
railway station. The death of the late honourable senator from Central Saskatchewan,
the late Senator Johnston, which occurred
while he was hurrying to catch a train, was
no doubt precipitated by reason of his having
to use dangerous stairs.

In the stations which have dugouts, as I call
them, the train crew go aboard from the
ground level; yet one often sees an old lady
trudging unassisted up the stairs with a bag
in each hand, unable to make use of the handrail. At Calgary and Edmonton, for instance,
the passengers go in at ground level, but in
many railway stations the stairs are very
hazardous. The bus terminals take passengers
aboard from the curb; further, there is a
man ready to take the baggage and place it
in the bus, and no tip is expected.
I am anxious to see our railways prosper,
for their prosperity is most important to the
economy of Canada, and particularly to the
province of Saskatchewan. I would emphasize
that we in this chamber should have no fear
of the political effect of anything we may say.
In an attempt to get satisfactory railway
service in Canada, I would suggest that we
turn the railways over to the men, and let
them see if they can make a living out of
operating them.
I turn now to the question of surplus horses
from the West. Notwithstanding the prospect
that horsehide may become very valuable, as
suggested by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), our horses are
still going to the United States.
I have had a good deal of experience in
hiring men, and in this respect I have been
particularly fortunate. On many occasions I
have had difficulty in getting hired help to
stop work at a decent hour. Some of those
who worked too hard were unreasonable in
their association with their fellow workers. In
one instance I had to keep a man by himself because he was too hard on the other
men. I recently met that chap in British
Columbia, and he complained that in the shipyard where he was then employed the unions
would not let him do a good day's work.
I should like for a few minutes to direct
the attention of the house to the Korean affair
and to world conditions generally. The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) was quite right when he said that no
one should say that we are headed for another
war. Certainly I hope we are not. When I
consider the staggering amounts expended
for military purposes, I always wonder what
would be the result if we spent only a
small part of those amounts on peace. I do
not want to offend the government in any
way, but I think it has fallen down in the
battle of propaganda for peace. The United
States is today spending large sums on broadcasting its aims in several languages. I believe
Canada could adopt a similar policy to
advantage.
As to the activities of communist sympathizers, my suggestion is that rather instead of

SEPTEMBER 13, 1950
criticizing Dr. Endicott and the Red Dean,
we should invite them in and ask them to
name the persons in this country that they
think are interested in making war. Then
if they were unable to point to anyone, they
should be asked if they would accept a sum
of money and go to Russia, where we would
pay their expenses in the promotion of. the
cause of peace.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But not their return
fare.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I agree with the statement of the leader of the government that
Russia is spending huge sums on armaments
to keep her own people satisfied. I have
met many Russian people in the community
in which I live. I have particularly in mind
a doctor who escaped from Russia at the time
of the revolution. While in China, I think, he
received an offer of a position in a Russian
hospital. By some means he got a message
through to a doctor friend and asked him if
it was safe for him to return. The friend
warned him that if he valued his life he
should keep moving. That doctor came to
Blaine Lake, where he has been for seventeen years. The friend to whom he wrote
in Russia went to Latvia, where he prospered
for a time, but later lost everything. He too
is now in Blaine Lake, and he is preparing
to try some examinations so that he may
practise medicine in this country. His son
came with him. In speaking to a friend of
mine who understands Russian, he said that
Russia will not be able for ten years to
carry on a major war, because the living conditions of the masses of the people are so
poor. As the leader of the government has
said, the rulers of Russia are carrying on
propaganda to make their people believe that
every other nation wants to attack them. Up
to the present they have never been able to
give their own people anything like a decent
living. So, while we here are concerned for
fear that a few Russians in Canada may not
be loyal, I believe that Russia herself is
afraid that the great majority of her people
would not support the Soviet government if
it began a war.
In surveying the world situation generally,
my impression is that we are in a deplorable
position. There seems to be a lack of world
leadership. Recently the world lost one of
its finest citizens. I have always admired
Field Marshal Jan Christian Smuts, who
recently passed away; and it is a matter for
regret that his age and ill health prevented
him from playing a greater part in the present
crisis.
What about our record as Canadians? It
has been suggested that wa should know our

enemy: yes, but we should know ourselves.
"Man, know thyself" was the advice of a
great thinker. We should study wherein we
have failed or fallen short of what we might
have done. What a ridiculous position we
are in today. After destroying the finest
plants in the world, created and operatc
by Germans, we are now going to rebuild
them. For four years I have pleaded that
German prisoners in Canada should be
allowed to remain here. Wherever they
worked, whether in the beet factories or the
lumber camps, they begged the government
to allow them to stay. Many of them were
among the finest men Canada ever had. I
spoke to this effect both in this chamber
and in committee, but with no result. Yet
the late General Smuts, after bravely fighting
the British armies in the field, became one of
the leaders of the British Commonwealth of
Nations. I say there was no justification for
our action regarding the German prisoners.
It was dictated by fear-and fear of what?
Fear of the labour unions. I believe that this
country is likely to be short of millions of
workers. Our production and resources make
us the wealthiest country per capita in the
world, yet, as was pointed out recently in the
Toronto Globe, we are so afraid of admitting
workers from outside that only four hundred
men are to be brought in for harvest work.
Probably there are millions available in
Germany. There is hardly a Canadian home
in which a maid is not needed; our people are
only too anxious to provide good homes and
treat their help fairly, but help is not to be
had. Even the shortage of meat to which I
have referred is the result of the shortage
of labour. Men accustomed to working conditions in the cities will not go on the farms;
yet I believe there are a million Germans
willing to come here and do what most of
our people are unwilling to do.
Let me quote from my own experience,
which is no different from that of 90 per
cent of Western Canadians. As the honourable senator from Prince Albert (Hon. Mr.
Stevenson) knows, it was not the custom of
Western Canadian farmers to pay high
wages. A man went to a farm to serve an
apprenticeship, and if he was fortunate
enough to serve with a good farmer he himself becarrie a competent farmer and the
man for whom he worked provided him
with credit when he started on his own
account. After men worked for me for a
number of years I told them they could
look to me if they needed some assistance;
and when they started on their own farms
I gave them some credit. Even today I get
letters from some who advise me that they
need so much money for such a purpose;

SENATE

and I irnrediately wire it to them, because
they have worked f aithfully for me. But
the high wage system enforced by the unions
has put a stop to that kind of thing, and
today we are short of f arm help. What a
desirable position we would have been in
now if four years ago, when I advocatecl the
idea, displaced Germans had been permitted
to corne here.
Last session I made the staternent that
we were spending large sums of money on
military exercises in the north country when
our troops could have been more usefully
iocated in Germany. What sort of protection have we at present?
One thing I arn deeply concerned about
is Canada's lack of trained diplomats. Since
we have adopted, at great expense, the policy
of having representatives, both ambassadors
and trade commissioners, in almost every
country, I think we should begin at once to
select young men with the proper background, train them thoroughiy, give them a
full knowledge of the language of the country
to which it is proposed to send them, and
appoint those S0 qualified, instead of political
has-beens, as our representatives abroad. To
my mind that is an urgent necessity.
It appears now that one of the bulwarks of
our democracy is to be Japan. 1 feel that
were I able to speak the language I would
be a fitter representative to send there than
sorne of the men who demanded during the
recent war that Canadians of Japanese origin
be rernoved frorn their homes, and that their
ships and other belongings to be taken from

themn. As a Canadian I arn ready to plead
guilty to the charge that these people were
ill-treated. There is no doubt in my mind
that if we hope to escape being overwhelmed
by Asiatic peoples we must treat them with
absolute fairness. I recommend honourable
senators to read the officiai report of what
happened to Japanese property. I was in
the West myseif, and actually saw some o
the belongings which had been taken from
their owners and sold at perhaps one-tenth
of their value. In addition, Japanese property
valued at $200,000 was "lost, stolen or
strayed". One of our colleagues has referred
to the loss of a few Bren guns, but let me
remind him that here is evidence of the
disappearance of a great deal of private
property which cannot be traced. Surely, if
these people are to be our willing allies, such
wrongs should be righted.
Ail I would
emphasize is that these Japanese Canadians
must be so deait with as to remove ail
suspicion of unfairness.
I have not much more to say. We should
open our doors to immigration. Let us get rid
of the fear of the labour unions that these
people are going to, deprîve anybody of a job.
That is one of the fears which has been holding back the developrnent of this country. In
my opinion tlhere is no country in the world
which could use immigrants to better advantage than Canada.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
sernators, there is no legisiation before us,
and I have ascertained that there is flot likely
to be, even under the rnost favourable circurnstances, for a few hours. But as
usually happens on the occasion of the terniination of a session of parliament,' "hope
springs eternal", so I move that the house
adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at
the cail of the bell at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 3 p.m. the sittîng was resumecl.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
as no legisiation has corne to us yet from the
other place, I can only suggest that the house
adjourn agaiin during pleasure. I do not wish
to inconvenience anyone, but I would ask
honourable senators to remain within the
precincts of the building so that they' may
be readily available should any legisiation
corne to us during the afternoon. I would
move, therefore, that the house again adjourn
during pleasure, to reassemble at the cali of
the bell at 5 o'clock or sooner.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was in the gallery of
the other chamber this morning, and I can
report that all the taxation measures had
received first readîng there before 1 o'clock.
The opinion was expressed then that these
bis would receive second reading early this
afternoon, so it may be that we shall be in a
position to deal with them before 5 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is why I suggested to honourable senators that they make
thernselves available during the afternoon.
H-onourable members will be called to the
chamber at 5 o'clock unless sorne legisiation
is forthcoming before that tirne, in which
event the bell wîhl be rung sooner.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
INCOME TAX BILL
FERST READING
A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bil 6, an Act to amend
the Income Tax Act.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move the second
reading now.
Honourable senators, this 'bill is the first of
four revenue blls arising out of the supplementary budget introduced in the present
session by the Minister of Finance. The
need for raising additional revenue is caused
by the increased defence expenditures that
the government has recenthy decided to proceed with. After -the estimates for the current fiscal year had been revised and the
nemr, sums for defence were added to the
already authorized expendîture, the net result
was a budget deficit of about $44 million.
The Minister of Finance has announced, the
governrnent's definite determination to .pay
as we go in this new effort, and accordingly
additional new revenue measures have been
*passed by the other place. The expected total
revenue in the remainder of the current
fiscal year from this and the other three
measures which in due course will be introdu*ced in the Senate is estirnated to be $58.9
million.
This would result in an estimated
over-all surplus of $15 million, instead of
$20 million as forecast by the Minister in
his 'budget speech hast spring.
The 'bull now before us, an amendment to
,the Income Tax Act, provides for an increase
of 5 per cent in 'the rate o! tax on corporations, applicable to profits earned on and afýter
the lst of September this year. That is to
Say, the present rate of 10 per cent on the
first $10,000 o! profits will be increased to
15 per cent, and the present rate of 33 per
cent on profits in excess of $10,000 will be
increased to 38 per cent. It is expected that
these incréased rates wilh yield an additional
$ 13.5 million in the current fiscal year and
$85 million in a full year. As honourable
senators are aware, there 'are no increases
in personal income tax rates.
Han. W. M~. Aseltine: Can the honourable
.Leader of the govern-ment state how much
revenue will be obtained under this measure
between now and 'the Slst of Ma'rch 1951?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is estimated that
the yield for the remainder of -this fiscal year
wxl be $13.5 million, and for a full year
$85 million.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think that no honourable mernbers on this side have any objection
to the bull. It may be that some o! our
'colleagues who are interested in big manuf-acturing corporations will wish to say something, but I have no rem'arks to make. I

A message was received from the House
The bill reads as follows:

of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada,
enacts as follows:
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move second reading
now.
Honourable senators, this is the second of
the four bills to which I referred, and has to
do with amendments to the Excise Tax Act.
The increases in present taxes and the new
taxes contained in this bill cover items which
generally speaking do not enter into the costof-living budget. The excise tax of 10 per
cent on automobiles, radios, etc. is increased
to 15 per cent, and certain items of sporting
goods and motorcycles, which at the present
time bear no special tax, are to be placed
in the 15 per cent category. A tax of 30 per
cent is to be levied, at the manufacturers'
level, on soft drinks, candy and chewing gum.
It is expected that the revenue from this
source for the balance of the current year
will be about $35-3 million, and for a full
year $82-4 million. It will be noted that
the general sales tax of 8 per cent remains
unchanged, and that no new items are
included in the base to which this -tax applies.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if the honourable
leader has copies of the bill for distribution?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am very sorry, but
I have no extra copies. My honourable
friend's complaint is quite legitimate.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Of course it is, and we
should have the bill before us.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The simple fact is that
extra copies do not exist. I secured a copy
for the honourable acting leader opposite;
there may possibly be one other available,
but that is ail.

1. Paragraph (a) of subsection five of section
eighty of the Excise Tax Act, chapter one hundred
and seventy-nine of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
"(a) in the case of ail articles enumerated in
section two of Schedule I, be deemed to apply to
any such articles, which are, in Canada, wrapped,
packaged, put up in boxes, bottles or jars, or
otherwise prepared for sale;"
2. Subsection one of section eighty A of the said
Act is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:
"80A. (1) There shall be imposed, levied and
collected, an excise tax equal to fifteen per cent.
of the current market value of all dressed furs, dyed
furs and dressed and dyed furs,(i) imported into Canada, payable by the importer
or transferee of such goods before they are removed
from the custody of the proper customs officer;
or
(ii) dressed, dyed, or dressed and dyed in Canada,
payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of
delivery by him."

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask a question

at this point? As I understand that provision, an additional 5 per cent is added
to the present 10 per cent, making a tothM
tax of 15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is correct.
3. Section eighty B of the said Act is repealed and
the following substituted therefor:
"80B. There shall be imposed, levied and collected
an excise tax equal to fifteen per cent of the current market value of the fur contained in any
garment, robe, or other article imported into Canada,
payable by the importer or transferee of such goods
before they are removed from the custody of the
proper customs officer."

Again the change is, I think, frorn 10 per
cent to 15 per cent.
Schedule 1 to the said Act is repealed and the first
schedule to this Act is substituted therefor.

The first schedule is:
Automobiles adapted or adaptable for passenger
use with a seating capacity for not more than ten
persons each, 15 per cent.

SEPTEMBER 14, 1950
This is an increase of 5 per cent.
Provided that the tax on automobiles shall apply
on the total price charged for such automobiles,
which price shall include all charges for accessories,
optional equipment, advertising, financing, servicing,
warranty, or any other charges contracted for at
the time of sale, whether charged for separately or
not.
Provided further that the tax shall not apply to
automobiles imported under customs tarif! items
702, 704, 705A, 706, 707 and 708.

I take it that, with the exception of the
change in the rate the schedule is the same
as the one it supersedes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: When does this tax
become effective? Take the case of a person
who, prior to the coming into force of this
measure, bought an automobile but has not
yet received it. Does the tax apply in a case
of that kind? Does it depend on whether the
purchaser has or has not paid his money?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not quite sure,
and I would not wish to give the house
incorrect information. My impression, from
my recollection of matters of this kind, is that
these taxes are levied at the manufacturer's
level. Once a car has left the manufacturer
and has come into the hands of the dealer,
the question of liability would be one as
between the dealer and the purchaser.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understand that. But
would the tax apply if an automobile dealer,
say in Ottawa, has a number of cars in his
possession?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think not.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Now take the case of
a person in Saskatchewan who, having
ordered a car through his local dealer, and
paid for it, comes east, let us say to Windsor,
Ontario, to take delivery of the automobile.
What position is he in? The car is still in
the hands of the manufacturer, but it has
been ordered and paid for. Does the purchaser have to pay the tax?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not think the
fact that the purchaser has come to Windsor
to pick up the car changes the relationship
In effect, I
between buyer and dealer.
assume, the situation is that the manufacturer
is delivering the car to the dealer or to someone whom he designates. The governing factor
would -be whether the car has been received
before or atter the date of the minister's
announcement. I may speak from personal
experience. Some time ago I ordered a car
of which possession was taken yesterday in
Windsor. I see no great hope of relief from
the extra tax.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is still time to
amend!

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Retroactive

The second group includes:
2. Articles, materials or preparations of whatever

composition or in whatever form, commonly or com-

mercially known as toilet articles, preparations or
cosmetics, which are intended for use or applica-

tion for toilet purposes, or for use in connection
with the care of the human body, including the hair,
nails, eyes, teeth, or any other part or parts thereof,

whether for cleansing, deodorizing, beautifying,
preserving or restoring, and to include shaving soaps

and shaving creams, antiseptics, bleaches, depilatories, perfumes, scents and similar preparations,
flfteen per cent.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is that a new tax?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The next paragraph
includes firearms, which are subject to 15
per cent tax.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is true.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They were not taxed

Hon. Mr. Robertson: The paragraph reads:
(b) Firearms and complete parts thereof and
ammunition except for military or police purposes,
fifteen per cent;

Then follows:
(c) Motor cycles and all other two- or threewheeled motor-driven vehicles including motors for
attachment to bicycles but not including vehicles
specially designed for carrying goods or for use
by invalids, fifteen per cent;
As my honourable friend says, these are addi-

tions to the schedule.
Then there are the items:
(d) Golf clubs and golf balls, fifteen per cent;
(e) Fishing rods and fishing reels, fifteen per
cent.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I don't like that!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask whether that
item will increase the price of the Campbell
golf ball?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There are a good many
honourable senators on this side of the house,
and perhaps on the other side, who are more
conversant with that subject than I am, and I
would be glad to have their experience and
knowledge in order to answer the question of

assembling the information I will proceed:
4. Devices, commonly or commercially known
as lighters, which produce sparks, flame or heat
whether or not in combination with other articles
on the separate or combined value, as the case
may be, fifteen per cent.
5. Cameras and unexposed photographie films
and plates, except those sold for industrial or
professional photographers' use; projectors for
pictures except those sold for commercial, religious,
or educational purposes, fifteen per cent.

These, as honourable senators know, are
additions to the list.
I continue:
6. Phonographs, record playing devices, radio
broadcast or telecast receiving sets and tubes
therefor, fifteen per cent.
7. Coin, disc or token operated slot machines
and vending machines; coin, dise or token operated
games or amusement devices of all kinds, fifteen
per cent; Provided that the tax hereby imposed
shall not apply to coin collectors used on pay
telephones, turnstiles for collecting tolls or charges,
coin operated locking devices, nor gas, electric or
parking meters.
8. Trunks; suiteases; bags and luggage of all
kinds; purses; wallets; billfolds; key and card
cases; handbags; jewel cases; dressing and toilet
cases; shopping bags, except paper bags; golf and
other sports bags; all the foregoing whether fitted
or not, fifteen per cent;
Provided that the tax hereby imposed shall not
apply to the goods mentioned herein when manufactured expressly for a customer for his use in
the operation of his business or profession.
9. Ash trays; tobacco pipes; cigars and cigarette
holders; cigarette rolling devices and other smokers'
accessories, not to inelude lighters, matches or
tobacco, fifteen per cent.
10. Fountain pens; ball-point pens; ink pencils;

11. Cigars, twenty-five per cent.
Provided that the sale price of cigars manufactured in Canada shall include the amount of
excise duty payable thereon under the Excise Act.
12. Matches, fifteen per cent.
13. Tires and Tubes.
(a) Tires in whole or in part of rubber for automotive vehicles of all kinds, including trailers or
other wheeled attachments used in connection with
any of the said vehicles, fifteen per cent;
(b) Inner tubes for use in any such tires, fifteen
per cent;
Provided that the tax hereby imposed shall not
apply to the goods mentioned herein when used
exclusively for the original equipment of such
automotive vehicles.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there any increase in the
tax on bicycle tires?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not think so. My
understanding, from a reading of the bill,
is that the increased tax only applies to automotive vehicles.
Paragraph 14 reads as follows:
14. (a) Clocks and watches adapted to household
or personal use, except railway men's watches, and
those specially designed for the use of the blind,
and alarm clocks where the sale price bu the

Canadian manufacturer or the duty paid value of
those imported does not exceed ten dollars, fifteen
per cent;
(b) Articles of all kinds made in whole or in
part of ivory, jet, amber, coral, mother of pearl,
natural shells, tortoise shell, jade, onyx, lapis
lazuli, or other semi-precious stones, fifteen per
cent;
Provided that the tax on the articles enumerated
in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall
not apply to the goods mentioned where the sale
price by the Canadian manufacturer, or the duty
paid value of the goods imported, does not exceed
one dollar;
(c) Articles commonly or commercially known as
jewellery, whether real or imitation, including
diamonds and other precious or semi-precious
stones for personal use or for adornment of the
person;
goldsmiths'
and silversmiths' products
except plated table knives, forks and spoons;
pewter ware;
Articles of cut glassware, crystal glassware, cut
or not, etched glassware, or metal decorated glassware;
Articles of china, porcelain, earthenware, marble,
stoneware or other pottery ware, except articles
for use in the preparation or serving of food or
drink, filteen per cent;
Provided that the tax on the articles enumerated in subsection (c) of this section shall not apply
to the goods mentioned where the sale price by the
Canadian manufacturer, or the duty paid value of
the goods inported, does not exceed fifty cents.
The excise tax on these articles was 10 per
cent.
Paragraph 15 reads:
15. Carbonated beverages, aerated waters, unfermented
fruit juice beverages
(not including
beverages at least ninety-five per cent of which
consists of pure juice of the fruit) and imitations
thereof and all other compounded or mixed soft
drinks where the beverages, waters or drinks are
put up in bottles or other containers for sale, thirty
per cent.
16. Candy, chocolate, chewing gum and confectionery that may be classed as candy or a substitute for candy, thirty per cent."

This is not an increase, but is the new tax
to which I referred. That concludes the reading of Schedule I.

Schedule II to the said Act is repealed,
and a second schedule is substituted therefor.
It reads as follows:
1. Carbonic acid gas and similar preparations
to be used for aerating non-alcoholic beverages,
fifty cents per pound.

That is a new tax.
2. Cigarettes, manufactured tobacco and Canadian
raw leaf tobacco:
(a) For each five cigarettes or fraction of five
cigarettes contained in any package, two cents;
(b) For each ounce or fraction of an ounce of
manufactured tobacco, including snuff but not
including cigars and cigarettes, contained in any
package, two cents;
(c) For each ounce or fraction of an ounce of
Canadian raw leaf tobacco when sold for consumption in Canada, one-half cent."

That, honourable senators, is the substance
of the bill.

Department of National Health would find
records showing that some soft drinks are
very deleterious to the health of children.
Just before I left to come here a dentist in
my home town-I will not mention his name
-warned a mother that her boy had better
stop drinking a certain brand of soft drink
because of the effect it was having upon his
teeth. He added that it was easy to tell from
the teeth of every boy who came to him for
treatment whether the boy was accustomed
to drink that brand. It is unfortunate that
more publicity is not given to the harmful
effects of certain soft drinks, but anyone who
endeavours to make the facts known is
opposed by vested interests, which have large
sums invested in the pop business all over
the country. I think that the fewer the candy
bars and soft drinks that children consume,
the better it will be for their health.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have not sufficient information to enable me
to comment on the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). It seems to me that if the tax on
soft drink manufacturers is likely to have the
serious effect that he fears, the government
will take some action to prevent it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I hope so.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: His fears for the manufacturers are probably not well grounded.
Just a word on the suggestion by the acting
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
that the tax on candy and chewing gum
should be removed because they are largely
consumed by children. The huge sums which
ar.e being spent today on amusements and
liquor-I am not making any criticism of these
things at all-indicate that the purchasing
power of the mass of the people in this
country is very great, yet despite the tremendous additional outlays that we are undertaking for defence it has been decided,
rightly or wrongly, not to raise the existing
rates of income tax. The federal treasury
is providing more than $300 million a year
for children's allowances, and probably the
bulk of this is being used for the benefit of
the children. While some of the money which
children spend for their pleasure may be
earned by themselves, I suppose that by far
the larger proportion of the money that comes
into their hands is furnished by their parents.
Therefore a tax on anything consumed by
children is indirectly a tax on their parents.
However, because of the wide distribution
of income in this country, it is inevitable
that if the public revenue is to be substantially increased, taxes must be applied generally to all people. In countries where life is less
happy than in Canada, and the income is
in the hands of a few people, substantial

increases in revenue could perhaps be obtained
by taxing only the few. But in this country,
as I have said, taxes must apply generally to
all the people.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Commons with Bill 9, an Act to amend the
Excise Act, 1934.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall the bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move second reading
now.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is this another bill of
which no copies are available?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: This is the third measure that I referred to. It contains amendments to the Excise Act, and as no copies
are available, I shall read it. Briefly, it proposes to increase the tax on spirits from $11
to $12 a gallon, and to raise from 16 cents
to 21 cents a pound the tax on malt used in
beer.
The bill reads as follows:
His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada
enacts as follows:
1. The first paragraph of section one of the
Schedule to The Excise Act, 1934, chapter fifty-two
of the statutes of 1934, is repealed and the following
substituted therefor:
"1. Spirits
On every gallon of the strength of proof distilled
in Canada, except as hereinafter otherwise provided,
twelve dollars, and so in proportion for any greater
or less strength than the strength of proof and for
any less quantity than a gallon:"
2. The first paragraph of section two of the
Schedule to the said Act is repealed and the
following substituted therefor:
"2. Canadian Brandy
On every gallon of the strength of proof, ten
dollars, and so in proportion for any greater or
less strength than the strength of proof and for
any less quantity than a gallon:"
3. Section four of the Schedule to the said Act
is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
"4. Malt

SEPTEMBER 14, 1950
Upon all malt brought into a brewery subject to
such allowance or rebate in respect of waste as
may be authorized by the Governor in Council,
per pound. twenty-one cents."
4. This Act shall be deemed to have come into
force on the eighth day of September, nineteen
hundred and fifty.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: What amount of revenue
will be realized from these tax increases?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not appear to
have that information before me, but the
total revenue to be gained under this and the
measure to follow, namely the Customs Tariff,
is $10,100,000 for the balance of the current
year and $22,100,000 for the full year. I
would point out that the amendments to the
Excise Tax Act apply to domestic production
only.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Did the honourable
leader give the amount of additional revenue
expected by reason of the tax on candy only?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I gave the estimate
of expected revenue from the additional tax
on soft drinks, candy and chewing gum as
$35-3 million for the current year and
$82.4 million for a full year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am curlous to know
by how much the tax on spirits, as provided
by this bill, would have to be increased to
enable the government to eliminate the tax
on candy. It would seerri to me that an
additional 50 cents would about cover it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My attention has been
drawn to the fact that the Minister of Finance
in the other house gave the breakdown of
figures which the honourable acting leader
has asked about. This is the information he
gave: the increased revenue from excise taxes
on commodities is $17,300,000 for the remainder of the fiscal year, and $34,400,000 for a
full year; on soft drinks the increase is esti-

mated at $8,500.000 for the balance of the
current year and $24 million for a full year;
on candy and chewing gum there will be an
increase of $9,500,000 for the current year and
$24 million for a full year.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I should like to ask the
honourable leader why a tax was imposed
on soft drinks, and apparently no consideration was given to the imposition of a tax
on beer?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is a tax on malt.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: True, there is an increase
frbm 16 cents to 21 cents per pouhd on malt,
l5ut the effect of that will be that the brewer
will weaken the strength of his beer and
thé price will remain the saie. It seems
to me that a tax on beér would have produced
môé revenue.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Might he not still
weaken his beer?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I do not know, but I think
a greater revenue would result.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In any event, this
is the legislation as it comes to us.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the scond time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mi. Robertson: Now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 10, an Act to amend the
Customs Tariff.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move that the bill be
read the second time now.
This, honourable senators, is the fourth of
the bills to which I have referred. Increases
in the duty on imported spirits and imported
malt corresponding to the increases in the

domestic tax on spirits and malt are contained in this bill. It is estimated that the
additional revenue from these increases and
the tax on alcoholic beverages will produce
$10,100,000 during the current fiscal year and

$22,100,000 in a full year.
The bill is as follows:
1. Schedule A to the Customs Tariff, chapter fortyfour of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is
amended by deleting therefrom the following
enumerations of goods and rates of additional duties
of Customs as enacted by section two of chapter
twenty-three of the statutes of 1942-43 and section
two of chapter seven of the statutes of 1943-44:
"Whisky, brandy, rum, gin and all other goods
specified in Customs Tariff Item 156 and 156b, $7 per
gallon.of the strength of proof.
Ale, beer, porter and stout, 30 cents per gallon"
and by substituting therefor the following enumerations of goode and rates of additional duties of

Customs:

"Whisky, brandy, rum, gin and al other goods
specified in the various subitems of Tariff Item 156.
$8 per gallôn of the strength of proof.
Ale, beer, porter and stout, 40 cents per gallon."
2. Section orie shall be deemed to have come into
force on the eighth daj' of September, 1950, and to
have applied to all goods mentioned therein ihnported or taken out of warehouse for donsumption

PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Assistant Secretary of the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right
Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, acting as
Deputy for His Excellency the Governor
General, would proceed to the Senate Chamber this day at 3.45 o'clock for the purpose
of proroguing the Special Session of the
Twenty-first Parliament.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
When the present session adjourned in September
it was considered that the world situation might
make it necessary to resume the session before the
close of the year. As that did not happen, my ministers recommended just before the beginning of
the New Year, that the special session be concluded
and a regular session be commenced as early as
circumstances would permit.
The measure to provide for the resumption of the
operation of the railways which was enacted at the
opening of the special session resulted in the immediate termination of the strike. Failure to reach
an accommodation between the parties to the dispute led to the appointment of an arbitrator, whose
decision has settled the points remaining at issue,
as provided for in the statute.
In response to the original reason for summoning
the special session you approved a measure making
provision for the placing of Canadian forces on
active service in consequence of action undertaken
by Canada under the United Nations Charter or the
North Atlantic Treaty; and to provide for the
application of veterans' legislation to veterans of
the special force.
You also passed bills respecting materials and
services essential for the purposes of defence
and internal security and respecting the temporary
regulation of consumer credit.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you made for additional defence expenditures and also for meeting
our obligations under the United Nations Charter
and the North Atlantic Treaty.
Honourable Mémbers of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Providence continue to bless and protect this
nation.
